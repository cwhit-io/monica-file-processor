[time=396] (singing in foreign language)
[time=426] (audience applauding) - Hi, my name's Kevin, I'm 51 years old.
[time=436] I've been attending Black Hawk for a couple years, and I've been a believer for about half my life.
[time=441] My childhood was harder.
[time=443] I grew up in a house where both my parents drank to access.
[time=447] My mom actually died when she was 55 as a result of her lifelong drinking.
[time=452] Most of my brothers and sisters, they drink regularly or drug abusers still to this day.
[time=458] And there was a lot of sexual abuse in my family as well.
[time=462] It was pretty rampant throughout not only my family, but my extended family as well.
[time=467] I myself, I was abused when I was young, about 10 to 12 years old, my brother.
[time=473] And I also witnessed abuse of other family members.
[time=476] In spite of all that, I knew there was a lot of love in our home, but there was also a lot of chaos.
[time=482] As I got into my teens, it's no surprise then, that I turned to drugs and alcohol myself.
[time=486] By the time I was in my twenties, I was a full-blown alcoholic drug user as well.
[time=492] Somehow, I was successful at college.
[time=495] I got a good job out of college, and I thought for the most part, because things turned out well, I was okay.
[time=501] But something was missing.
[time=502] I had a spiritual loneliness in my heart, and at the age of 25, God got ahold of me.
[time=508] He really changed my heart.
[time=509] I became a born-again believer, and he performed a miracle in my life.
[time=513] I remember going through to this day the house and dumping out the alcohol and getting rid of the drugs, and things changed.
[time=520] My life did a 180.
[time=521] I was involved in my church.
[time=524] I had a thriving marriage.
[time=526] We started having a family, and things were going really well.
[time=529] I still battled lust.
[time=531] I thought everybody did, and with my childhood, I really learned to put on a heart exterior and not trust anyone.
[time=539] And I wasn't about to trust an eighth one with my lustful thoughts.
[time=542] I pretended everything was okay, and really confided in no one.
[time=546] Eventually, those thoughts turned into pornography use, and turned into sexual addiction as the years went on.
[time=554] I would have periods of sobriety, where I would go a long time, but then I would also have periods where I was just in bondage to the sin until eventually I'd get caught.
[time=563] When I got caught, I would do all the right things, repent, but I never really had a hope that I was ever gonna really get rid of this burden on my back.
[time=574] In 2010, I was in bondage again.
[time=579] I lost my job as a result of my secret sins, and I separated from my wife.
[time=585] We took a couple months, and we eventually reconciled.
[time=589] I got new business, started my own business, and things were going well.
[time=592] Moved back into the home, everything was great.
[time=595] My wife gave me an ultimatum.
[time=596] She said she had done this enough, and if I turned back to that again, she was gonna divorce me this time.
[time=603] Sure enough, within a year or two, I was back in my own vomit and turning to the sexual sins again, and I got caught the latter part of 2011, and my wife held true to her promise, and the day after Christmas, I moved out of my home and never returned again.
[time=622] So here I am at rock bottom.
[time=624] I'd gone through life feeling I could manage anything, and for the most part, things turned out well.
[time=628] Now, I'm facing broken family, broken marriage, broken kids, broken cabin.
[time=634] Nothing is going well, and I don't know where to turn.
[time=637] I knew I was at a critical juncture in my life, and I was either going to pursue real recovery, or I would probably end up down a path of bondage that I didn't think I would ever escape from.
[time=649] I started attending CR, Selbert Recovery, in the beginning of 2012, and within a few months, I knew that I needed to do something different.
[time=657] The old ways didn't work, and I was there to pursue something different, and I made a decision to really engage in my recovery.
[time=665] That meant being transparent with people, that meant finding true accountability partners, and Selbert Recovery was a place where I could come in, and I felt safe there.
[time=675] There were other people that were struggling.
[time=678] Some were the same issues I had, some with completely different issues that I had, but all of us masked a pain that we turned to something else to hide that pain, and it was church.
[time=690] I've had a number of people say that Wednesday night is church, a lot more than Sunday, is because of the relationships that we have.
[time=698] My relationships were all broken, and my relationship with God was very similar to my relationship with my earthly father, distant, superficial.
[time=708] I believed in God's power.
[time=710] I had the belief that he could change anybody.
[time=712] I just didn't have the belief that he could or wanted to change me.
[time=716] I felt he couldn't love me enough, and I needed to clean myself up before I came before God, and it took a little while, but I eventually came to recognize that as pride.
[time=727] I know now that I can't clean myself up, come before God.
[time=732] No one can, that's why we have a savior, because we can't come before him ourselves.
[time=739] Selbert Recovery and the 12-step program were critical in my own personal recovery.
[time=744] For me, the 12-step program really appealed to me.
[time=748] I wanted to do his in don'ts manual, something that I could do these 12 steps, and six months later, you turn out, here you go, you're fixed.
[time=758] God had a different plan.
[time=759] He certainly used the 12-step program in my life, but God really wanted my heart.
[time=765] Christ wanted me to lay my burdens upon him.
[time=768] Come to me, all you who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
[time=772] You see, I'd spent my whole life trying to overcome my own burdens, and once I started laying those upon Christ, I started really to understand what grace is.
[time=782] I never understood grace other than from a head-knowledge standpoint, and now it was slowly starting to seek into my heart.
[time=789] Overcoming addiction is not easy.
[time=792] It's a long, painful process, but there is hope, and I realized eventually that I don't have to be in bondage to the sin anymore.
[time=803] Do I have to watch myself? Certainly, every day.
[time=805] I need to wake up every day and realize that I need God's power to make it through that day, but I'm no longer a slave to sin.
[time=813] God has saved me, pulled me up out of the pit, and I can look at life now with hope.
[time=818] Today, I'm a different person.
[time=820] My relationship with my children are being restored.
[time=824] God has even brought another person into my life, and I have an open, honest relationship where I can talk about my hurts, where I can talk about my feelings.
[time=831] I'd encourage anyone who feels they are too far gone for God's reach, or feels they, God couldn't love them the way they are.
[time=838] Don't give up, continue to seek out relationships where you can be real and honest.
[time=844] Come to celebrate recovery.
[time=845] We may not know you, but we already love you.
[time=847] We serve a God who is willing to pursue us, no matter what.
[time=851] - Well, good morning.
[time=859] If you have the word of God in some form or fashion, find Proverbs 5 with me this morning.
[time=866] It was Father's Day in 2003,
[time=873] when one of my favorite pastors, Mike Bulmore, preached Proverbs chapter five, and I still remember that service.
[time=881] And ever since that time, Proverbs five has had just a special place in my heart, and I'm anxious and excited to share it with you this morning as part of just God's incredible grace to us as his people.
[time=896] And so let's read Proverbs five together this morning.
[time=903] My son, be attentive to my wisdom,
[time=911] and climb your ear to my understanding that you may keep discretion and your lips may guard knowledge for the lips of a forbidden woman drip honey and her speech is smoother than oil.
[time=926] But in the end, she is bitter as warm wood, sharp as a two-edged sword.
[time=934] Her feet go down to death.
[time=936] Her steps follow the path to shield.
[time=939] She does not ponder the path of life for her ways wander, and she does not know it.
[time=947] And now, O sons, listen to me.
[time=950] Do not depart from the words of my mouth.
[time=955] Keep your way far from her, and do not go near the door of her house lest you give your honor to others and your years to the merciless, less strangers.
[time=967] Take their fill of your strength, and your labors go to the house of a foreigner, and at the end of your life, you groan.
[time=976] When your flesh and body are consumed, and you say, "How I hated discipline." And my heart despised reproof.
[time=988] I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or inclined my ear to my instructors.
[time=993] I am at the brink of utter ruin in the assembled congregation.
[time=996] Drink water from your own cistern, flowing water from your own well.
[time=1003] Should your springs be scattered abroad, streams of water in the streets?
[time=1008] Let them be for yourself alone, and not for strangers with you.
[time=1013] Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth.
[time=1022] A lovely deer, a graceful dough.
[time=1026] Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight.
[time=1032] Be intoxicated always in her love.
[time=1037] Why should you be intoxicated, my son, with a forbidden woman, and embrace the bosom of an adulterous?
[time=1043] For a man's ways are before the eyes of the Lord, and he ponders all his paths.
[time=1050] The iniquities of the wicked will ensnare him, and he is held fast in the cords of his sin.
[time=1060] He dies for lack of discipline, and because of his great folly, he has led astray.
[time=1067] God's word this morning to us, God's grace to us.
[time=1073] And as we pray, what I want to do this morning is I want to pray over us the prayer that Mike Bulmore prayed as he began the message to Proverb 5 this morning.
[time=1084] So let's pray this morning as I read his prayer over us.
[time=1091] Father, I stand here this morning with an appropriate sobriety.
[time=1095] Not just because of the topic that's addressed here in this passage in your holy word, but I stand here recognizing that you intend to use your word today for the good of your people.
[time=1110] And Father, I tremble to think that there might be anything in me, or anything in this church that would keep this from happening.
[time=1120] And so Father, we submit to you right now.
[time=1124] Father, we know that you love your word, not just for itself, though you love it because it is your word, but you love it also because it's for our good, and you delight in your children.
[time=1139] And so you love the effect of your word in the lives of your children.
[time=1144] And so today, Lord, we want to delight in your delight in your word.
[time=1151] We want to rejoice in the fact that you've given your word, you've spoken this word, and that all of your words are true, and they are good.
[time=1159] So Father, we pray this morning, would you form your mind in us today by your word?
[time=1166] And Lord, I pray specifically, would you make your word effective for all of us listening this morning, for all people, but God, I pray especially for men this morning.
[time=1179] That you would, in their hearts, bring your word with particular effectiveness.
[time=1185] O come thou incarnate word, gird on your mighty sword.
[time=1194] Come and your people bless.
[time=1198] Come give your word success.
[time=1201] O spirit of holiness on us descend.
[time=1207] Pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1210] What I love about this chapter is that it's not difficult to understand.
[time=1217] In fact, I don't know if there's gonna be much more that I can explain to you than you could not get from a regular reading of Proverbs chapter five, but I also love that it's so matter of fact, and straightforward.
[time=1232] God doesn't sentimentalize anything.
[time=1234] It's just what his reality is for us.
[time=1238] And what I love is at the heart of this Proverbs chapter five is God's grace.
[time=1244] It's his grace to us that he would communicate his truth to us, his way to us, his mind to us, so that we could then be informed by that and live in the good of what he's prescribed for us.
[time=1261] At the heart of this is the seventh commandment.
[time=1264] Do not commit adultery.
[time=1266] And this morning I wanna understand that we need to pack into this concept all forms of sexual purity.
[time=1274] All forms of sexual sin.
[time=1277] Jesus does this in Matthew five if you remember.
[time=1281] When he says, you have heard it said, do not commit adultery, but I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery in his heart.
[time=1293] And so Jesus in this idea or this concept of sexual purity packs all of this into this concept of sexual purity for our good and for his glory.
[time=1305] And so gentlemen, young men, older men, while this passage specifically addresses God's grace to us by informing us regarding the adulterous, I believe the practical implications include God's grace to us by informing us regarding all manner of sexual sin.
[time=1327] Two thoughts real quick before we get in.
[time=1330] Notice verse one and two, the audience.
[time=1332] Notice who this is addressed to, my son be attentive to my wisdom, incline your ear to my understanding.
[time=1339] It's a father addressing his son for something he will experience or have to deal with for the rest of his young life or the entirety of his life.
[time=1351] Notice the words that you would keep discretion.
[time=1354] It's an ongoing skill or strategy that needs to be employed by this young son that he would guard knowledge.
[time=1366] I want this built into you son is what the father is saying because you are going to need it for the rest of your life.
[time=1374] So this morning we can say Proverbs five is for younger men.
[time=1381] We could also say that it's for younger men who are getting older, maybe younger men from 12 to 42.
[time=1388] I don't know why do I say 42?
[time=1393] Well, it goes well with 12, right?
[time=1397] But also I'm 42 and so from practical experience I can tell you that at age 42 I still need this help.
[time=1407] And I would argue from talking to others who are older than me that they need this help as well.
[time=1415] That you may keep on going for the rest of your life.
[time=1421] Today if you are in your teens, listen if you're in your 20s this morning, listen if you're in your 30s, pay attention this morning.
[time=1433] If you're in your 40s, listen your 50s, your 60s, your 70s, your 80s, I don't know how far I need to go.
[time=1441] But you get the point.
[time=1444] Secondly, God's word gives us two types of instruction.
[time=1452] The vast majority of the Bible is
[time=1458] his formative instruction for us.
[time=1461] It's the fun stuff.
[time=1462] It's when we gather together and we encourage one another in the ways that God has prescribed for us that we would be formed into those types of activities and those types of daily living.
[time=1475] It's him forming his mind in us and teaching us and training us.
[time=1482] It's his formative instruction.
[time=1484] It's God training us in his ways but there's also corrective instruction.
[time=1493] It's not always fun but necessary.
[time=1498] And so both this idea of formative and corrective is something we need to eagerly receive and with humility receive this from God as his good for us as a part of his grace to us.
[time=1514] By God's grace this morning, each of us
[time=1520] will hopefully experience some of both of that today.
[time=1524] Formative instruction and corrective instruction.
[time=1529] So Proverbs 5 this morning, Proverbs 5, five strategies for pursuing sexual purity.
[time=1538] Try to make that easy for you, right?
[time=1541] Here they are and we'll detail them together.
[time=1544] Number one, understand sexual temptation for what it really is.
[time=1550] Two, establish protective patterns of behavior.
[time=1554] Three, seek out regular biblical teaching on this topic.
[time=1559] Four, enjoy what God has given you to enjoy.
[time=1566] Five, know that your sexual practice is in full view of God.
[time=1571] Just so you know we'll probably spend more time on the first three.
[time=1576] But let's look at that first one together.
[time=1580] Understand sexual temptation for what it really is.
[time=1585] Look at what it says in verse three.
[time=1587] For the lips of a forbidden woman and adulterous, drip honey and her speech, it's smoother than oil.
[time=1596] But in the end, she's bitter as warm wood,
[time=1602] sharp as a two-edged sword.
[time=1607] Understand this, that sexual temptation at the heart of it, it's a lie.
[time=1612] We need to unmask the deception.
[time=1615] It's not what it looks like.
[time=1618] Sexual temptation cannot deliver on the promise that it's trying to make.
[time=1624] There is no lasting satisfaction, but there is lasting remorse and consequences that flow out of it.
[time=1632] As it says there in the end, understand this, there is always an after, there is always an end and it is never described as something which is good inside of scripture.
[time=1646] It is always full of despair and destruction, maybe not immediately.
[time=1652] You might not see it right away,
[time=1658] but oh, it will show up and oh, it is happening.
[time=1663] Whether you realize it or not, we need to get a clear picture of the realities of the consequences of sexual sin and understand exactly what it is.
[time=1674] It's the idea of a mousetrap.
[time=1676] It's a great illustration, right?
[time=1679] I mean, one of the things about a mousetrap that gets me every time is it's out there in plain view.
[time=1684] I've never seen a camouflage mousetrap, have you?
[time=1692] And I understand this morning that a small rodent doesn't have the mental capacity to understand kind of a spring-loaded device, right?
[time=1702] But the point is still there.
[time=1706] I mean, I can just imagine a mouse coming up to a mousetrap and stopping for a minute and just thinking, ah, oh, I see that.
[time=1715] Oh, but that, if I do that, then that's, and he just stops from that, and then another buddy comes up, right?
[time=1723] And he says to the buddy, hey, Frankie, hold on a minute.
[time=1727] You see that bar?
[time=1729] And if you go and kind of grab that cheese and that lever gets pulled, it's, you're a goner.
[time=1735] I know that a rodent doesn't have the mental capacity to understand that type of thing, but the point is valid, right?
[time=1746] Sexual temptation is coming at us and it's right out in the open.
[time=1751] And without the word of God informing us, we are just like mice.
[time=1758] We can get so fixated on that little slice of cheese, we ignore the damage and the destruction that is bound to follow.
[time=1768] Proverbs 5, 6, and 7, it's a great little mini-series on this same topic, but it is very good at detailing the consequences of sexual sin.
[time=1780] But understand this, at its heart, it's a lie, and it comes from a result of foolishness.
[time=1786] We need a dose of reality here.
[time=1789] Proverbs 6, 32 says this, he who commits adultery, lacks sense.
[time=1795] He who does it destroys himself.
[time=1798] It's like taking a shiny new penny that you're so excited about in exchange for a million dollar note.
[time=1807] It just doesn't make sense.
[time=1810] The heart, it's just foolishness.
[time=1816] We need to be reminded of God's goodness to us in giving us his commands, right?
[time=1822] And that's really what's going on here.
[time=1826] Back to Genesis chapter three, when Satan came to Eve and he said, did God really say?
[time=1835] Can we really trust God, right?
[time=1839] Or in that moment when we see something shiny that we want to take a hold of because we think it's gonna bring us such fulfillment or pleasure or satisfaction, do we believe ourselves in that moment?
[time=1852] Or do we listen to God's instruction to say,
[time=1859] oh no, that's not what it looks like.
[time=1862] You know, there's a sense in which you sometimes think that your situation is different, that no one will find out, that there won't be consequences this time.
[time=1872] As long as I stop this time, then I can probably avoid the consequences.
[time=1878] That's just simply not true.
[time=1880] Your sin, my sin, any sin will find you out.
[time=1890] And by God's grace, that happens so that we can get help.
[time=1894] You know, I almost wanted to make this first point.
[time=1897] Don't be a fool.
[time=1900] I mean, that's really what it comes down to.
[time=1903] Don't be an idiot, although that's, again, a word that we're not trying to use in our home.
[time=1910] The first strategy is to understand sexual temptation
[time=1920] for what it really is.
[time=1922] It's a lie.
[time=1923] It's foolishness.
[time=1926] It's a disregard for God's grace to us.
[time=1929] Listen, men, this truth this morning is God's grace to you for us to grab a hold of.
[time=1937] Sexual temptation is not what it looks like.
[time=1942] In fact, that's something you could tell yourself.
[time=1944] In the midst of that temptation, this is not what it looks like.
[time=1950] See, Satan is not just a liar, but he's also a murderer.
[time=1955] Sexual temptation is not just a liar.
[time=1959] It's a murderer as well.
[time=1961] Strategy number two comes from verse seven and eight.
[time=1966] Establish protective patterns of behavior.
[time=1970] And now, oh, sons, listen to me.
[time=1973] Do not depart from the words of my mouth.
[time=1975] Keep your way far from her and do not go near the door of her house.
[time=1982] Establish protective patterns of behavior in your life.
[time=1987] Now, when I say that, most of you, if not all of you or some of you will think, man, this sounds restrictive.
[time=1995] Man, it sounds like confinement.
[time=1999] I mean, many, many times one of the first things people say when they have some sort of prescription on what they can't do or guidelines in their life, they immediately begin to think negatively about that, to think that it's some sort of restriction on them or some sort of confinement.
[time=2018] But look at verse 22 and 23.
[time=2020] The iniquities of the wicked.
[time=2024] In snare him, he's held fast in the cords of his sin.
[time=2028] He dies for lack of discipline.
[time=2031] And because of his great folly, he has led astray.
[time=2035] That is confinement.
[time=2037] That is prison.
[time=2040] It's being trapped.
[time=2042] It's like a dog returning to its vomit, as it says in Proverbs 26, 11.
[time=2047] Like a dog that returns to his vomit.
[time=2049] So is a fool who repeats his folly.
[time=2052] Listen, as you get trapped in that type of sexual sin, it just, you just keep having to go back to it.
[time=2062] It's entrapment, confinement.
[time=2066] You know, talk to somebody.
[time=2070] Listen to the video, to somebody who's been ensnared and they will tell you, that's true confinement.
[time=2079] How we need to think is this, that we all need help.
[time=2085] Every single one of us, listen, the world in all of its ways, it's coming at us faster than ever before.
[time=2095] Now, I know nothing has changed for centuries.
[time=2098] The abandonment of God's ways in search of something better is as old as history.
[time=2103] And this idea of sexual temptation is as old as history as well.
[time=2108] But understand this, the accessibility that you and I have has completely changed.
[time=2113] There is no way that I would enter into some sort of store to find some sort of magazine or publication because I would fear somebody seeing me.
[time=2127] But that changed when you can have that privately
[time=2133] on some sort of handheld device or computer in your room where no one else is.
[time=2140] The accessibility is completely different than it's ever been before.
[time=2147] And while we needed to build fences before the accessibility, I believe we need to build even more fences now with the accessibility.
[time=2156] The guidance in verse eight is just straight, practical wisdom.
[time=2162] Do not go near the door.
[time=2166] Take the far path is what it's talking about.
[time=2169] It's God's grace to us this morning.
[time=2173] Don't go near her house.
[time=2174] There are places that you shouldn't go.
[time=2178] It says there, keep your way far from her.
[time=2186] I believe that way has kind of two different ideas.
[time=2188] One is certainly a road that would go by her house, but also just a manner of living, a lifestyle, a choice of how you're going to live your life, your habits, and so it's the idea of this that again, no one commits adultery without taking several steps of departure first.
[time=2210] There's a road that leads to adultery.
[time=2214] Psalm one would say this, how blessed is the man
[time=2220] who does not walk in the council of the wicked or does not stand in the way of sinners and does not sit in the seat of scoffers.
[time=2228] There's a progression there that happens from simply just kind of listening to what ungodly advice is out there to then actually participating in that ungodly device and then actually being one of them that lives in that way.
[time=2245] Listen, we live in a culture where it's impossible
[time=2252] to avoid all of it, but let's be real for a minute.
[time=2255] Let's not play games this morning.
[time=2257] We exercise considerable choice.
[time=2260] There is much that can be avoided if we choose to avoid it.
[time=2264] I have a friend that's a pharmacist and he works at one of those convenience stores and he tells me every day he said, you know what?
[time=2272] Every day that I go in, I have a choice of which aisle to go back when I go back to the pharmacy every day.
[time=2278] I purposefully choose not to go down the aisle with all the magazines and the greeting cards.
[time=2286] He's got that choice, he can go down any aisle and you know what, he could probably go down that aisle without sinning and yet he's choosing to take the far path.
[time=2297] He's choosing not to go near.
[time=2301] I think it's a really helpful phrase, this idea of take the far path.
[time=2310] I think it's something we can use with one another and encouraging one another to take the far path.
[time=2316] You know on a personal note, I am not in a relationship outside of my marriage nor am I contemplating pursuing one.
[time=2324] I'm not visiting websites with pornographic material and still I am not so bold as to say, I'm not vulnerable to do so.
[time=2332] I've built fences in my life.
[time=2339] I can tell you, I do not have unaccountable access to the internet.
[time=2344] I have something on all of my devices called covenant eyes.
[time=2349] They're actually in the lobby if you want to find out more information about them.
[time=2354] But what that does, it's an internet filter, but also every page that I would visit gets sent in a report to my accountability partner.
[time=2365] And you can choose who that accountability partner is.
[time=2367] Mine is my wife, Paula.
[time=2369] She's the greatest help to me.
[time=2371] And so she has a report.
[time=2374] She doesn't look at all of them, but they give certain labels to them.
[time=2378] And so there are certain websites that might have a higher label so she could see if I'm looking at things that I shouldn't.
[time=2385] I don't have unaccountable access to the internet.
[time=2392] In my profession at work, I have procedures and guidelines about how and when I would meet with a member of the opposite sex.
[time=2401] I don't meet with a member of the opposite sex privately in my office or their office.
[time=2407] The door is always open.
[time=2408] And if they don't want to meet with me, they don't have to.
[time=2413] But I'm not gonna go there.
[time=2416] I'm gonna choose to take the far path.
[time=2418] Now, would it be wrong?
[time=2419] No, but I've built some fences in my life.
[time=2425] I won't drive by myself with another member of the opposite sex.
[time=2431] I just won't do it.
[time=2432] Would it be wrong? No.
[time=2433] Does it say that in the Bible?
[time=2434] No, I just am choosing to build some fences in my life.
[time=2438] I don't wanna go near.
[time=2441] I wanna take the far path.
[time=2446] Practically for you, it may be different, but it may be saying no to some things.
[time=2452] It may be canceling your cable.
[time=2455] And it may be somebody coming up, "Hey, hey, John, you canceled your cable, what's up?" You say, "You know what, I'm in my own heart "and in my own life, I've decided "I'm just trying to take the far path." It may not be for you, but for me, that's what I need to do.
[time=2473] It may be adding some fences of your own, maybe getting covenant eyes for you and also the protection of your whole family.
[time=2484] It may be setting up some new guidelines in your life on work practices and who you meet with and when you meet with them and how.
[time=2491] It may be confessing and getting help.
[time=2494] Celebrate recovery is a wonderful ministry.
[time=2497] What I love about celebrate recovery is Christ is at the center.
[time=2500] And you can get help there.
[time=2504] I don't know what it means this morning, but men, if you haven't already established protective patterns of behavior, build some fences in your life, you, I am not strong enough on our own to battle this.
[time=2518] Third, seek out regular biblical teaching on this topic.
[time=2522] You can see it sprinkled all throughout this chapter.
[time=2526] Verse one, be attentive, incline your ear.
[time=2529] Verse seven, listen to me.
[time=2532] Do not depart from the words of my mouth.
[time=2535] Verse 12, how I hated discipline, he says.
[time=2540] And my heart despised reproof, 13.
[time=2545] I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my instructors.
[time=2552] Listen, this morning, please.
[time=2553] Avoid the mistake of saying, "Josh, thank you for teaching on this." I really appreciate you doing that, but I'm just not in a position where I struggle with this right now.
[time=2566] I'm not struggling with this.
[time=2568] You know what, if that is true, praise God for that, but now is the time to set the foundation of God's biblical truth for you.
[time=2577] So when temptation does come, you'll be ready.
[time=2581] If you, if you are in the midst of it,
[time=2587] you won't wanna hear what God has to say at that point, right?
[time=2591] So we need to build this truth into us early and often so that when temptation does come, we're ready with it.
[time=2599] Psalm 199, how can a young man keep his way pure by guarding it according to your word?
[time=2607] We need to build this truth deep into our hearts and minds right now.
[time=2613] There's no time to say, you know what?
[time=2618] I'll do this, I'll do this later.
[time=2622] Because the enemy is bringing temptation in faster than we know what to do with.
[time=2627] We need God's mind to inform us.
[time=2633] We need to build it deep into our lives.
[time=2637] The world has no problem talking about sex, does it?
[time=2641] There's no problem in the world.
[time=2644] And yet somehow it becomes awkward when we talk about it as believers.
[time=2650] And I understand in some instances there needs to be an awkwardness.
[time=2653] But in other instances, there's no reason for it to be awkward.
[time=2658] It's God's design.
[time=2661] It's his grace to us so that we could talk about it in openness and clarity and receive help as we go along.
[time=2670] You know, humility is the key, right?
[time=2672] To be able to fight off pride that says,
[time=2678] "I don't need help or I don't want anybody to know "about what I'm dealing with." Versus humility says, "You know what?
[time=2685] "I'll take as much help as I can get.
[time=2687] "And I'm gonna let people know "when I do need help in certain ways." 1 Peter 5.5, God opposes the proud, but he gives grace to the humble.
[time=2700] We need to seek out regular biblical teaching on this topic
[time=2706] and allow the word of God to inform our minds.
[time=2710] Number four, maybe the best part of the passage.
[time=2715] Enjoy what God has given you to enjoy.
[time=2720] Specifically here it addresses the gift a husband receives from God in a wife.
[time=2727] Verse 15, "Drink water from your own cistern, "flowing water from your own well.
[time=2734] "Should your springs be scattered abroad, "streams of water in the streets, "let them be for yourself alone "and not for strangers with you.
[time=2743] "Let your fountain be blessed "and rejoice in the wife of your youth.
[time=2748] "A lovely deer, a graceful doe.
[time=2751] "Let her breast fill you at all times with delight.
[time=2755] "Be intoxicated always in her love." The language here is unashamedly sexual.
[time=2765] It is unashamedly erotic.
[time=2770] It is God's design and it's a part of his goodness to us.
[time=2776] We could go back to Genesis 1.26.
[time=2781] This says that he made man and he made woman male and female.
[time=2786] That they could come together and be one flesh.
[time=2790] Now that certainly talks about a coming together of emotional and spiritual and financial components, but there is also that physical component of the sexual union of a man and a woman in the confines of a marriage relationship and it is a beautiful thing.
[time=2806] And it is a gift from God, husbands, for you to enjoy your wife,
[time=2816] to be intoxicated with who she is and how she looks and how she feels.
[time=2824] It's God's gift to you.
[time=2828] For married couples also, there's more of this in the Bible.
[time=2832] This isn't the only place, right?
[time=2835] Song of Solomon details a lot of this idea of just enjoyment of one another.
[time=2842] It's God's goodness.
[time=2845] God is a giver of good gifts and husbands today.
[time=2850] I'd love to look at each of you individually and tell you your wife is a gift from your heavenly father for you to enjoy.
[time=2864] And notice it says the wife of your youth, not in your youth.
[time=2871] It's not just something that's relegated to when you were young.
[time=2876] But as you continue to get older, by God's grace Paul and I have been married for 20 years, August 4th was our 20 year anniversary.
[time=2885] And I'm growing more and more in my delight of her as we continue to grow together.
[time=2891] So I just encourage you gentlemen, let your minds wander in thinking of her.
[time=2898] There's nothing but green lights from God.
[time=2904] To think of her and to be with her.
[time=2909] You know, don't be fooled by the false claims of familiarity, right?
[time=2913] I mean, it happens in so many different ways.
[time=2917] You get a new car and three months later, you're ready for a new one, right?
[time=2921] It's just become familiar.
[time=2923] You get a new toy as a young person.
[time=2926] I mean, we all understand that, right?
[time=2928] And it's the hottest thing at first, right?
[time=2931] I mean, I want to play with that toy all the time, but yet two weeks later, one week later, it's at the bottom of the toy box because there's something new, right?
[time=2940] It just, it's become familiar.
[time=2942] Guys, can I just encourage you?
[time=2946] That familiarity, all that is is just selfishness at the core.
[time=2949] Don't let familiarity ruin the enjoyment of your wife.
[time=2957] Young men who aren't married yet, this is not the only reason to get married, but it's a wonderful reason to get married.
[time=2968] And this culture might tell you, oh, wait, wait, wait, you don't want to be stuck in a relationship with only one person for the rest of your life, do you?
[time=2979] And yet God is informing us that's exactly what you want.
[time=2988] Get married, it's a wonderful thing.
[time=2992] Strategy number four, enjoy what God has given you to enjoy, he's a giver of good gifts.
[time=2999] And the sexual union of a man and a woman inside a marriage is a part of his goodness.
[time=3004] Five, know that your sexual practices is in full view of God, verse 21.
[time=3008] A man's ways are before the eyes of the Lord and he ponders all his paths.
[time=3016] I want to share two components real quick with this.
[time=3018] The first is fear, the second is grace.
[time=3021] There's a reality that we will all have to give an account for our actions, right?
[time=3025] Your actions and your thoughts are not private.
[time=3030] It says there, in verse 21, that he sees it all.
[time=3035] He sees your finger on the mouse of your computer.
[time=3043] But also it says there in that second part that he ponders your way.
[time=3050] The grace of God that comes is this, that he knows your path, he knows what path you're on.
[time=3057] And this is grace from God in that he gives us help along the way, he knows when temptation is coming and he gives you help.
[time=3067] Today is one of those helps for you maybe.
[time=3069] It may be that you're contemplating something or you've been contemplating something, whether it's going to do something with someone you shouldn't or visiting some sort of website.
[time=3082] And this today is God's grace to you.
[time=3086] He ponders your path, he knows what you're thinking.
[time=3090] He knows that you're contemplating that and he is sending you a lifeline this morning to grab a hold of.
[time=3098] It's his grace to us as he ponders your path.
[time=3104] He brings discipline, he brings forgiveness and restoration.
[time=3109] You know the irony of this idea of fear and grace comes in Hebrews chapter four.
[time=3116] We don't have a lot of time but I want to read it to you this morning.
[time=3118] It's so great.
[time=3119] Listen to the irony here.
[time=3120] It says this, for the word of God is living and active, sharper than any double edged sword.
[time=3125] It penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow discerning the thoughts and attention to the heart.
[time=3131] And verse 13, "And no creature is hidden from his sight, "but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him "to whom we must give account." That's pretty scary, right?
[time=3144] The next verse, listen to this, here's the irony.
[time=3148] Since then, we have a great high priest who's passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession, for we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weakness, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin, let us then with confidence, even though he's seen everything, we're naked and exposed before him, let us with confidence draw near to the throne of grace,
[time=3180] that we might receive mercy and find grace
[time=3186] to help in the time of need.
[time=3190] Whether you're contemplating or whether you're already down the road and participating, understand this, you cannot go too far for God's grace to reach you.
[time=3201] He's throwing you a lifeline this morning.
[time=3209] And if you would reach out and claim Christ,
[time=3215] our confidence is in him because he went through it all without sin and because of our love for him and our commitment to him, because of what he's done for us, we can receive his grace.
[time=3231] We can receive the grace of repentance,
[time=3237] the grace of forgiveness, the grace of restoration, but also the grace to keep us from even going that direction, the grace of his help for obedience to him.
[time=3250] Well, in conclusion, you know, there's truth to know
[time=3257] and there's truth to incorporate, truth to hold on to and practices to incorporate, right?
[time=3263] I don't know exactly what it is for you this morning, but this, first of all, truth to hold on to, to know in your mind, sexual temptation is not just a liar, it's a murderer, see it for what it is, let the word of God inform your mind regarding sexual temptation.
[time=3283] Secondly, God's grace is present.
[time=3288] From this, God's grace is present to form this truth and to correct you.
[time=3294] You may this morning need to confess something this morning.
[time=3297] I'd encourage you to do that as fast as you can.
[time=3304] It may be that God is just forming correction and that would encourage you then this morning to build some fences.
[time=3312] It's this final thing.
[time=3314] Maybe it's memorizing Proverbs 5 or a section of Proverbs 5.
[time=3320] Maybe it's reading Proverbs 5 through 7 on a weekly basis.
[time=3326] I don't know, again, I don't know the application for you specifically, but I do know that some of these things are very practical.
[time=3336] Enjoy your wife, go home today and just communicate to her
[time=3342] how thankful you are for her and that maybe you need to confess to her that you haven't been viewing her in the way that God views her as one of the best gifts that you've received from him.
[time=3357] Maybe you need to have that discussion this morning.
[time=3363] I don't know, I don't know what it is, but I can tell you this, that sexual purity honors God.
[time=3371] That sexual purity is a fortress for your marriage.
[time=3377] It's a fortress for your family.
[time=3384] And as we all pursue that together, it's a fortress for our church.
[time=3390] So by God's grace, let's take the help this morning that he's given us through his word and humbly receive it for our good together and for his glory
[time=3408] as our great God and King.
[time=3410] Let's pray this morning.
[time=3411] God, thank you so much.
[time=3413] Thank you that this is your idea.
[time=3418] The world's just taking it and messed it up.
[time=3421] And we sometimes fall in line with that.
[time=3425] And yet in your sovereign goodness, you've planned.
[time=3428] You've planned for help for us through the person of your son Jesus and the work of your spirit and our hearts and our minds.
[time=3437] God, I pray this morning that you would allow us
[time=3443] to take these truths this morning, these five strategies for sexual purity and that we would employ them for your honor, God, for your glory and for our good.
[time=3458] Thank you so much that you do delight in your children and you've given us your word that we might experience the very fullness
[time=3470] of all that you have for us.
[time=3474] Thank you so much this morning, God, if there's anybody here this morning who's caught, I pray that you by your spirit would help them to seek help, to confess and repent, maybe go to celebrate recovery or find a friend or be in a community that loves your gospel and incorporates your gospel into their lives.
[time=3501] I pray also for all of us this morning that you would give us the grace of obedience,
[time=3510] that when we're tempted, we would say no because we know that your way is what's best for us.
[time=3522] God, thanks for this morning, thanks for these people.
[time=3525] We love you because you first loved us.
[time=3529] You're an amazing God and a wonderful King.
[time=3532] We love you this morning.
[time=3534] It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[time=3559] (upbeat music)
