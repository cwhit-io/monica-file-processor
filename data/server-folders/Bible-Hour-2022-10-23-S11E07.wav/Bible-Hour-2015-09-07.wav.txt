[time=655] my soul. Amen. You may be seated. Let's pray. Father, I praise you today for who you are,
[time=678] and I praise you for what's going to happen today in your church. We're going to hear
[time=684] stories. We're going to see the fruition of changed lives today and confessions of where
[time=692] people are and what's happened in their lives. And I give you all the glory and all the credit
[time=698] for that today and all the celebration. I thank you so much for what you're doing. I pray, Father,
[time=705] as we give right now, that we do it with joyful hearts and joyful spirits. I pray we realize we're
[time=715] continuing in worship when we give. I pray that you're pleased with everything that happens today.
[time=723] [AMEN] In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form and void and
[time=735] darkness was over the face of the deep and the spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. And God saw that the light was
[time=748] good and God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light day and the darkness he
[time=757] called night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day. And God said, "Let
[time=765] there be an expanse in the midst of the waters and let it separate the waters from the waters." And God made the expanse and separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters
[time=776] that were above the expanse. And it was soul. And God called the expanse heaven and there was
[time=784] evening and there was morning, the second day. And God said, "Let the waters under the heavens be
[time=792] gathered together into one place and let the dry land appear." And it was soul. God called the dry
[time=800] land earth and the waters that were gathered together he called seas. And God saw that it was good.
[time=806] And God said, "Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed and fruit trees bearing fruit
[time=813] in which is their seed, each according to its kind on the earth." And it was soul. The earth
[time=821] brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds and trees bearing fruit
[time=828] in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. And there was
[time=836] evening and there was morning, the third day. And God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse
[time=844] of the heavens to separate the day from the night and let them be for signs and seasons and for
[time=850] days and years and let them be lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth."
[time=858] And it was soul. And God made the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day and the lesser
[time=865] light to rule the night and the stars. And God set them in the expanse of the heavens
[time=873] to give light on the earth, to rule over the day and over the night and to separate the light
[time=880] from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning,
[time=889] the fourth day. And God said, "Let the water swarm with living creatures and let birds fly above the
[time=897] earth across the expanse of the heavens." So God created the great sea creatures in every living
[time=903] creature that moves with which the water swarm according to their kinds. And every winged bird
[time=909] according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. And God blessed them saying, "Be fruitful
[time=918] and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let the birds multiply on the earth."
[time=924] And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day. And God said, "Let the earth bring forth
[time=931] living creatures according to their kinds, livestock and creeping things and the beasts of the earth according to their kinds." And it was soul. And God made the beasts of the earth according to their
[time=944] kinds and the livestock according to their kinds. And everything that creeps on the ground according
[time=950] to its kind. And God saw that it was good. From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea,
[time=966] creations revealing your majesty. From the colors of fall to the fragrance of spring,
[time=979] every creature unique in the song that it sings. I'll explain it. Indescribable,
[time=992] unkontainable, he'll place the stars in the sky and you know that my name. You are amazing
[time=1002] down. Oh powerful, untameable, hostile, we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim. You are amazing
[time=1019] up.
[time=1022] Who has told every lightning, oh there it should go.
[time=1031] Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow.
[time=1043] Imagine the sun and its source to its light. Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of light.
[time=1056] Indescribable, unkontainable, he'll place the stars in the sky and you know that my name.
[time=1069] Are amazing down. Oh powerful, untameable, hostile, we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim.
[time=1086] Are amazing down.
[time=1100] Indescribable, unkontainable, he'll place the stars in the sky and you know that
[time=1116] my name. You are amazing down. Yeah. Oh powerful, untameable, hostile, we fall to our knees as we
[time=1131] humbly proclaim. You are amazing down. Yeah. Indescribable, unkontainable, he'll place the stars.
[time=1146] Indescribable, unkontainable, he'll place the stars in the sky and you know that my name.
[time=1150] You are amazing down.
[time=1158] Indescribable, unkontainable, you see the depths of my heart and you love me the same.
[time=1173] You are amazing down.
[time=1187] Kids you are dismissed.
[time=1217] This morning we are starting a new series called The Gospel Project which is defined
[time=1238] as a Christ-centered Bible study for all ages. So whatever we study here your children will study
[time=1246] in their classrooms which will give us a great chance to talk to them around the dinner table
[time=1252] and it's going to give us a great chance to talk to them when they come from school and they will learn something different than what we teach them in church. My family and I are
[time=1262] grateful that we can be with you for such a time as this but I'm also glad that we start with this
[time=1268] Gospel Project and it's interesting that we don't start in Matthew chapter one but we start in
[time=1274] Genesis chapter one which teaches us that the Gospel does not start with for God's soul of the
[time=1281] world but the Gospel starts with in the beginning God created. It is no accident that the Bible
[time=1289] starts with Genesis one one. It doesn't start with John 3 16 it starts with John 1 1 because if
[time=1298] John 1 1 is not true what makes you believe John 3 16 is true but I'm here to tell you that both
[time=1305] of them are true and we are starting at the right place. In the beginning God created. Today I want
[time=1316] us to see from the biblical message that was read to us that we learn from Genesis one who created
[time=1326] the world what he created and how he did it. All these questions are answered in the Bible. First
[time=1335] of all we learn who created everything. In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
[time=1342] We are introduced in Genesis chapters one and two to God and in Hebrew there are two words that
[time=1349] describe God. You have Elohim which is here in Genesis one one and then you have Yahweh. I'm going
[time=1357] to use Yahweh Elohim because both those words appear together in Genesis chapter two verse four.
[time=1365] These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created in the day that the
[time=1371] Lord God Yahweh Elohim made the earth and the heavens. This is a very very important
[time=1378] verse because it tells us from the beginning that the Bible is a book about God.
[time=1385] It's not about you and I it's first and primarily about God. The Bible is a book about God and God
[time=1394] is introduced to us in the first couple of chapters in Genesis as Yahweh and as Elohim we're going to talk more about that as we go through the book of Genesis. But we are told that he
[time=1405] created the heavens and the earth. What does that mean? That means that he created everything.
[time=1412] You see that's actually a figure of speech. I grew up in Romania so I had to learn English
[time=1418] later in life and I had to learn that you guys use these things called figures of speech.
[time=1426] This is a figure of speech. The heavens and the earth is a figure of speech called emerism.
[time=1431] You have two opposites to denote the whole. So when the Bible says that God created the heavens
[time=1437] and the earth that means that he created everything. It's like you're having Psalm 139
[time=1444] when the Psalmist says Lord you know when I sit down when when I rise up. What does God know about me?
[time=1452] Everything. Not just when I sit down when I get up. That's emerism. Two halves to denote
[time=1458] opposites to denote the whole. The same thing we have here in Genesis 1-1. In the beginning God
[time=1464] created everything because the Hubble telescope discovers new galaxies every day. Did God create
[time=1473] those? Yes and we find that in Genesis 1-1. This is not taking God by surprise and you shouldn't
[time=1480] take us by surprise either. The first thing we learn that in the beginning Yahweh is an all-powerful
[time=1487] God who creates everything. You see this verse is an answer to the atheist who says there is no God.
[time=1495] This verse is an answer to the false religions who say that other gods created the world.
[time=1506] See when Moses was writing this inspired by the Holy Spirit. This story of creation was not
[time=1512] the only one floating around. When Moses is writing about the creation story the other nations living
[time=1520] around Israel also had creation stories. The Babylonians were teaching them our Duke. Their
[time=1526] chief God decided to manufacture humans because the gods were too busy. So they were making humanity
[time=1534] to help them do their work. The Egyptians were teaching that the Egyptian god Num was sitting at
[time=1541] his potter's will and formed man and then he had to call his wife to breathe life into them.
[time=1547] The Sumerians were teaching that humans came to be as a result of many gods being involved in a
[time=1555] drunken party. Think about that. Moses is leading the people of God towards the promised land.
[time=1565] They're going towards the promised land and they have all these false stories about creation.
[time=1570] God comes and says no no this is how I created the world. There's nothing chaotic about this.
[time=1579] It's very orderly account because God is a powerful God who creates everything.
[time=1584] That's the first thing we learned. Second of all we learned that God is powerful and because
[time=1591] he's powerful he forms the formless and he fills the void. Verse 2 says that the earth was without
[time=1597] form and void. What happens looks like this is the first day of creation and God brought the
[time=1604] world from its primitive condition of desolation and waste as one scholar puts it to its fullness
[time=1611] and order. We call this the framework hypothesis. Look what happens in the first three days. In the
[time=1619] first three days God takes care of the formlessness problem and in days 4, 5, and 6 he takes care
[time=1626] of the emptiness problem. Remember because verse 2 said the earth was formless and void.
[time=1633] So God takes care of what's happening here. In the first three days he forms the formless
[time=1639] so he puts light to darkness, see in the sky fertile earth and then he fills the void.
[time=1645] The sky is empty so he puts the sun, the moon, and the stars.
[time=1650] The air is empty and the water is empty so he puts birds in the sky and fish and marine animals.
[time=1663] In the sea and the earth is empty so puts animals on the sixth day.
[time=1671] Don't you love it when skeptis asks you well when when it got great dinosaurs Tiberius?
[time=1677] According to this verse dinosaurs were created on day 6. You can say that with confidence
[time=1688] because that's what the Bible teaches. The Bible teaches that God is an all-powerful God
[time=1696] who creates everything and because he's all-powerful he's a God of order there's nothing chaotic about him. He creates in days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. He forms the formless and he fills the void.
[time=1710] And we learn that unlike the false gods of the nations God is a powerful God who creates
[time=1717] everything to the power of with the power of his word. That's why we have this idea of creatio ex nihilo creation out of nothing. If the other gods of the nations needed
[time=1727] raw materials to create God doesn't need any raw material does he? He creates out of nothing
[time=1734] with the power of his word. God said let there be light and there was light. The Psalmist picks
[time=1743] that up and says in Psalm 33 6 to 9 by the word of the Lord the heavens were made
[time=1749] and by the breath of his mouth all their host. He gathers the waters of the sea as a heap. He puts the deep in storehouses that all the earth feared the Lord. That all the inhabitants of the world
[time=1760] standing all of him for he spoke and it came to be. He commanded and it stood firm. That's all we
[time=1770] have. Look in verse 6 and God said let there be in verse 9 let there be let the waters under the
[time=1777] heavens be gathered together in one place. Verse 11 and God said let the earth spout vegetation plant
[time=1783] yielding seed and fruit trees bearing fruit according to its kind. See all this is truth
[time=1791] and because it's truth because there were lies out there that spoke how the world came to be and
[time=1797] how all these things came to be. I went to school at a I didn't have the benefit to go to a Christian
[time=1805] school like like Blackhawk. I went to a public school in California and then I went to Cal Poly
[time=1813] Pomona. I walked into the biology class and I was told there is no God. For a minute there I
[time=1822] thought I was in communist Romania. That's where I grew up and I was told there is no God and I come here and I thought this was the promised land that I'm going to learn about God and I go to school and they tell me there is no God and you're nothing but an evolved cell. Moses had to deal
[time=1841] with false teaching as well. See when when he was around the false gods of the Canaanites believed
[time=1848] that the false gods like Asharad the goddess of fertility was around she's the one who made the
[time=1855] grass grow and she was the one who made women give birth and the Bible comes and says no that's
[time=1862] not how it happened. God said let the earth's provigitation according to it kind. Verse 14 let
[time=1873] there be lights let there be lights and he was so. The Bible says that God made the sun the moon
[time=1884] and the stars. That's not what the world tells us. The world tells us that the stars appeared first
[time=1891] about 10 billion years ago 10 15 billion years ago depending on who you ask. That's what they tell
[time=1897] you. First they were the stars and then the sun appeared about five billion years later
[time=1903] and yet the Bible teaches us in Psalm 19 one that the heavens declared the glory of God and the sky
[time=1912] above proclaims his handy work. My dear brothers and sisters the Bible teaches that Yahweh Elohim
[time=1922] the God of the Bible the God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ created everything by the power
[time=1930] of his word. There's nothing chaotic everything is very very orderly he creates everything by the
[time=1938] power of his world and we see that all creation all creation obeys him because he's a powerful
[time=1946] God. Verse 7 tells us and it was so. God said let there be and he was so. Verse 9 let there be
[time=1955] and he was so. Let there be and it was so and it was so and it was so everything obeys because
[time=1962] God is a powerful God amen. I know you know that this morning I want us just to reflect upon that
[time=1969] and to review that not only is God a God a powerful God Yahweh Elohim is a powerful God he creates
[time=1976] everything in in six days. There are some people who say Tiberius Genesis one is great he teaches us
[time=1984] who created but it never tells us how he created if that's the case I want to ask you why then do
[time=1991] we have this temporal framework in scripture why do we have this there was evening there was morning
[time=1998] day one day two day three therefore day five day six why do we have all these if God did not intend
[time=2006] for us to know how he created God could have just said in the beginning I created everything
[time=2012] and then move on to chapter three right the fall but he didn't do that actually he goes to great
[time=2019] length to give us this temporal element because the Bible teaches us not just who created not just
[time=2027] what he created but how he did it and there's a very important reason why day one day two day three
[time=2038] until about the 19th century very few people very few church-going people very few believers
[time=2045] rejected this notion that God created in six days but after Darwin came with his hypothesis his theory
[time=2052] some Christians wanted to marry what Darwin said with what the Bible says and says how can we
[time=2058] marry those two and believe what the Bible says and also believe what Darwin says and they came
[time=2065] up with different theories and you know about theistic evolution and other such like things like that but there's one called the day age theory and they say well Tiberias this day here
[time=2076] it's not a 24-hour period it's a day age it's a it's a long period of time and they say that because
[time=2083] see you need thousands of years for the grass to grow and the trees to grow and for plants to come
[time=2089] and for trees to give fruit and not only that you need a lot of time for the the distance from that
[time=2096] star and the sun to make it here see what what they what they implies that God did not create
[time=2104] a fully functional universe they think they created this baby universe and we needed to grow
[time=2113] so that's why we need day ages like a thousand years the problem with that view is this
[time=2119] if God has needs a thousand years for the day age let me ask you what happens with the night age
[time=2127] because it says here there was an evening and there was a morning this is not just one day
[time=2134] if you have a day age you also need a night age that is not consistent with what the Bible teaches
[time=2140] not only that but we do have actually biblical evidence to suggest that this is a 24-hour
[time=2147] period and you know that the Reformers help us and they taught us that Scripture interprets
[time=2153] itself with what scripture and in Exodus chapter 20 this is the passage that is
[time=2160] very key for all of us is this Exodus chapter 21 God gives the Ten Commandments
[time=2166] again remember Moses is leading the children of Israel towards the promised land and he's giving
[time=2174] them the Ten Commandments and now listen to the fourth commandment in Exodus chapter 20 verses
[time=2180] 8 to 11 I want you to imagine that you're hearing that group that is coming out of Egypt you're
[time=2186] going towards the promised land. God is giving you this word and I want you to imagine and imagine that you're in that group and you're asking yourself how would you have understood this passage to be and the word day to be was it a day like a 24-hour period was a long period of
[time=2201] time just ask yourself and this is how the word puts it remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy
[time=2210] six days you shall labor and do all your work but the seventh day is the Sabbath to the Lord your God on it you shall not do any work you or your son or your daughter you male servant or your female servant or your livestock or the souljourner who is within your gates for in six days the
[time=2228] Lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that is in them and rested the seventh day therefore the
[time=2235] Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy so I want you to imagine that you're in that group and God is telling you in six days God made the heavens and the earth would you have understood
[time=2246] that any differently than a 24-hour period no there's no way what about if you live during the
[time=2253] time of David maybe you're thinking has changed and now day doesn't mean day anymore no I refuse to
[time=2260] believe the ones Darwin comes we have finally seen the light we have not seen the light that is
[time=2269] darkness the Bible says very clearly that God created everything in six days and it says very
[time=2276] clearly why to give us a framework for how to live our lives as well for in six days the Lord
[time=2282] made heaven and earth the sea and all that is in them and rested the seventh day did you know that
[time=2288] people around the world tried to change the weekday I heard the French tried to go to a five day
[time=2298] week I think the Russians tried to go to a ten day week I don't know why they will do that don't
[time=2304] don't ask me but he never worked did it he never catches on because it's not how God intended it
[time=2311] to be he created in six days so he can give us a framework for how we should live our lives
[time=2318] the bottom line is this my dear brothers and sisters either we believe what the Bible says
[time=2324] which is the what you have at the bottom or we believe what the world says the world says that there was a big bang and then first you have the stars then the sun then the earth then the oceans
[time=2338] let me ask you how can you marry those two things can you marry those two things and make them fit
[time=2344] together and I'm here to tell you that you cannot either we believe what the Bible says or we believe
[time=2350] what the world says there is no middle ground and when the world tells us to compromise they
[time=2356] basically tell us to ignore Genesis one it is very very clear but again I ask you if Genesis one is
[time=2365] not true one makes you believe that John 3 16 is true but I'm here to tell you that both of them
[time=2372] both of them are true when I came to the US in 1986 Ronald Reagan was president
[time=2379] and he said this he said sometimes when I'm faced with an unbeliever an atheist
[time=2386] I'm tempted to invite him to the greatest gourmet dinner the one could ever serve
[time=2392] and when we finished eating that magnificent dinner to ask him if he believes there is a cook
[time=2398] that's a good question isn't it can you can you can you go to a nice restaurant and get this gourmet meal and then someone will come
[time=2411] and say there was an explosion in the kitchen I'm I'm not I'm not trying to be funny it just
[time=2424] comes naturally but Tiberius I went to school I didn't go to black how I went to a secular school
[time=2434] and I thought I was taught that we're nothing but we evolved from something I'm here in the last
[time=2442] few minutes that I have left I want to show you briefly how evolution is not scientific
[time=2449] you are taught and you read this in the papers and you're going to read national geographic
[time=2455] and they're going to tell you that evolution is a scientific proven fact I want to show you just
[time=2461] briefly how evolution gets a pass from from three laws that have been established and accepted by
[time=2467] all scientists believers or unbelievers evolution is a lie from the pit of hell it is not scientific
[time=2476] and here's first of all the idea evolution gets a pass from the first law of thermodynamics the law
[time=2485] of energy conservation all scientists agree that energy cannot be created or destroyed
[time=2494] energy is only transformed but according to the the theory of evolution you have energy created
[time=2505] from nothing at all when Ken Ham debated Bill Nye the science guy Bill Nye the science guy was
[time=2516] asked that question where did that first cell come from and Bill Nye had to say I don't know
[time=2523] because evolution is not scientific second of all evolution gets a pass from the second law of
[time=2533] thermodynamics the law of entropy that says everything goes from order to disorder just
[time=2540] walk into your teenager's room leave that room without any force acting upon it that room will not
[time=2548] get better it will go from order to disorder just like you have here in this from this cube of ice
[time=2557] it's gonna make a puddle of water that water will not become a castle it's gonna become a puddle of
[time=2565] formless puddle but evolution says that everything went from disorder to order there was the big bang
[time=2574] and out of that all of a sudden everything went orderly until we had a cell and then the cell
[time=2580] replicated and you got two cells and so forth and so on and my favorite one is this evolution
[time=2587] gets a pass from the law of biogenesis the law of biogenesis says that everything living comes
[time=2593] out of something living a baby comes out of a living mommy a cute puppy comes out of a living
[time=2607] dog you'll never see anything living come out of something dead did you
[time=2613] and yet in evolution they say that the first living organism the first living cell came from
[time=2619] dead matter when you go to school and this is the challenge for those of you are still in school
[time=2627] you have to speak the truth in love and you have to tell your teacher kindly and gently
[time=2634] evolution is not scientific evolution gets a pass from these laws evolution is a lie
[time=2642] and a lie needs to be combated with truth and the truth is the Yahweh Elohim the powerful God
[time=2649] created everything in six days everything was very very orderly so how can we apply the truth
[time=2658] two things that I want us to see first of all we need to praise the Creator God it's in Revelation
[time=2664] four eleven the twenty four creatures elders say where they are you our Lord and God to receive
[time=2671] glory and honor and power for you creator all things and by your will they existed and were created
[time=2677] now think about that why they could have said where they are you Lord because you sent your son Jesus Christ to die for our sins right and that would have been true but they they're not going back to Matthew one or John one they go back all the way to Genesis one because the Creator
[time=2695] became the Savior their one and the same you cannot separate those two you cannot say I'm gonna
[time=2703] praise God for being the Creator or I'm just gonna praise him for being the Savior and I don't agree that he's the Creator you cannot do that if he is the Creator he's also the Savior because
[time=2714] the Creator became the Savior some eight one oh Lord our Lord how majestic is your name in all the
[time=2721] earth some ninety four ninety six four and five four greatest the Lord and greatly to be praised
[time=2727] he's to be feared above all gods for all the gods of the peoples are worthless idols but the Lord
[time=2733] made the heavens we have to praise this Creator God and we did this this morning and we have to
[time=2740] continue doing that but also we have to put our trust in the Creator some 146 starting in verse
[time=2748] three put not your trust in princes in a son of men in whom there's no salvation when his breath
[time=2754] departs he returns to the earth on the very day his plans perish blessed is he whose help is in the God of Jacob whose hope is in the Lord his God who made heaven and earth the sea and all that is
[time=2766] in them who keeps faith forever my dear brothers and sisters the gospel does not begin
[time=2773] with for God so love the world it starts within the beginning God created the Creator later becomes
[time=2784] the Savior and John knows that so when he opens his gospel he writes in the beginning was the
[time=2791] word and the word was with God and the word was God he was in the beginning with God all things were made through him and without him was not anything made that was made he came to his own and his own people did not receive him but to all who did receive him who
[time=2808] believed in his name he gave the right to become the children of God I'm going to close with this
[time=2816] we cannot understand who God is if we don't believe I can bring you here scientists after
[time=2825] scientists they will tell you how evolution is not true but ultimately it's a matter of faith
[time=2832] Hebrews 11-3 says very very clearly by faith we understand that the universe was created by the
[time=2843] word of God so that what is seen was now made out of things that are visible my prayer is that
[time=2850] you will put your faith in the Creator God who's also the Savior God let's pray the father we thank
[time=2859] you for sending your son Jesus Christ into the world to redeem us from a sinful life
[time=2868] and a godless eternity but we thank you that the gospel message starts with in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth I pray they will teach us what it means that we put our trust in this Creator God that we put our trust in the Savior God that we put our trust in you not in
[time=2886] worthless godless philosophies and teachings but we will praise you the Creator God Yahweh Elohim
[time=2895] May our life be a testament to you Lord who is the great Creator God who not just loves us
[time=2905] and saved us but loves us and created us in your image in Christ name I pray amen
[time=2925] I am awesome wonder consider all the worlds thy hands have made I see the stars I hear the
[time=2946] rolling thunder I power throughout the universe display and sings my soul my Savior God to thee
[time=2964] how great thou art how great thou art then sings my soul my Savior God to thee
[time=2978] how great thou art how great thou art and when I think that God is
[time=2993] the sun not sparing said him to die I scarce can take it in that on the cross my burden gladly
[time=3009] bearing he bled and died to take away my sin then sings my soul my Savior God to thee
[time=3026] how great thou art how great thou art then sings my soul my Savior God to thee
[time=3042] how great thou art how great thou art when Christ shall come
[time=3054] wish out of acclamation and take me home what joy shall fill my heart then I shall bow
[time=3068] in humble adoration and their proclaim my God how great thou art then sings my
[time=3084] soul my Savior God to thee how great thou art how great thou art then sings my soul my Savior God
[time=3104] to thee how great thou art how great thou art
