[time=860] Then God said, "Let us make man in our image after our likeness, and let them have dominion over all the fish of the sea, over all the birds of the heavens, and over all the livestock, over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."
[time=878] So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him, male and female he created them.
[time=886] And God blessed them, and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moves on the earth."
[time=901] And God saw that everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good, and there was morning, and there was evening, the sixth day.
[time=913] Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the hosts of them.
[time=919] And on the seventh day, God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done.
[time=927] So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.
[time=936] Then the Lord God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature.
[time=946] And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed.
[time=954] And out of the ground, the Lord God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food.
[time=961] The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[time=968] The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.
[time=974] And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, "You may surely eat of every tree of the garden,
[time=981] but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat.
[time=986] For in the day that you eat of it, you shall surely die." Then the Lord God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone.
[time=995] I will make him a helper fit for him." Now out of the ground, the Lord God had formed every beast of the field and every bird of the heaven
[time=1004] and brought them to the man to see what he would call them.
[time=1007] And whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.
[time=1012] The man gave names to all the livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field.
[time=1019] But for Adam, there was not found a helper fit for him.
[time=1023] So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs
[time=1030] and closed up its place with flesh.
[time=1033] And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man, he made into a woman and brought her to the man.
[time=1040] Then the man said, "This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh,
[time=1046] and she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man.
[time=1052] Therefore man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.
[time=1065] Good morning. Please open your Bibles to Genesis chapter 1.
[time=1074] Thank you Darren and the fire for that beautiful music.
[time=1080] I too like to sing, but when I want to tell them that I want to sing, they tell me to sing in the garden alone.
[time=1088] My name is Tiberius Ratsu.
[time=1092] I teach Hebrew and Old Testament at Grace College in Theological Seminary, and I'm the interim teaching pastor here.
[time=1100] I am not a candidate for the lead pastor, senior pastor position.
[time=1105] I'm just an interim pastor. I've done this before in other churches, and I think my gift in one way is to step in and just be a go between until God brings to you the man he has for you.
[time=1118] And you have to believe that, amen?
[time=1120] God, I was talking to some of you that have been here a long time, and they've been through all the transitions of pastors that you had, and God was faithful in the past, and he's going to be faithful in the future, amen?
[time=1132] You really have to believe that because God is in control.
[time=1136] Last week we saw how God and his infinite wisdom and power created everything in six days,
[time=1143] and we saw that it's a matter of faith.
[time=1145] By faith the author of Hebrew says we believe that everything was made, was made out of something that was not seen.
[time=1153] And now we are focusing on day six of the creation.
[time=1158] Now God inspires Moses to write about something that he has not experienced.
[time=1163] Moses was not there when God created everything.
[time=1167] And Moses was not there when God created Adam and Eve, so by inspiration of the Holy Spirit God tells Moses what to write.
[time=1177] Then God said, "Let us make men in our image after our likeness."
[time=1183] So God created many his own image.
[time=1185] In the image of God he created him male and female.
[time=1189] He created them. The expression, "Let us make men"
[time=1196] is a starting point to the doctrine of the Trinity.
[time=1200] We know when looking at the entire scripture that there's a Trinity, but the beginning of that doctrine starts in Genesis 1.
[time=1208] Genesis 1 says, "In the beginning God created heavens and the earth." So God the Father was present at creation.
[time=1217] Genesis 1-2 says, "The Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters." So we know that the Spirit of God was present, the Holy Spirit was present at creation.
[time=1226] But was Jesus present at creation?
[time=1229] We read last time from John 1-1, when John begins his gospel, he doesn't start with Bethlehem.
[time=1236] He starts within the beginning was the Word.
[time=1240] And the Word was with God and the Word was God.
[time=1243] So we see from the beginning of Genesis, we have a trajectory here that's going to teach us that there is such thing as the Trinity at 3-1.
[time=1252] But that's just the beginning of that doctrine.
[time=1254] We have to look at the New Testament and what we call the Trinitarian formula in the name of the Father, in the name of the Son, in the name of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1262] We have to look at all those things to develop the entire doctrine of the Trinity, but it's beginning, it's in Genesis 1.
[time=1271] But what does it mean when God says, "Let us make men in our image"?
[time=1275] What does it mean to be created in the image of God?
[time=1277] First of all, I want to show you, I want to tell you what it doesn't mean.
[time=1283] It does not mean that there is a physical dimension to God.
[time=1288] God doesn't have a body.
[time=1291] God is Spirit, infinite and perfect.
[time=1294] It doesn't mean that God has a body.
[time=1298] Those who misunderstand that actually change the Bible when it says God the Father, they actually change it to God the Mother.
[time=1306] I know some of you are shocked, but it's happening because people don't understand what's going on here, that this has nothing to do with a physical dimension.
[time=1315] God is Spirit, infinite and perfect.
[time=1318] However, if God chooses to reveal himself as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=1324] I don't have the authority to change that into God the Mother.
[time=1329] For whatever reason, I cannot do that.
[time=1334] God revealed himself as God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1339] And even though there's no physical dimension to him, that's how he chose to reveal himself.
[time=1345] And I have to accept that I cannot change that.
[time=1350] Also, we have to reject what false religions teach about this that God has a body.
[time=1355] For example, Mormonism, one of the false religions of today has an axiom.
[time=1363] This is what Mormonism says because they misunderstand what this verse says.
[time=1369] They say, "As man is, God once was."
[time=1376] Think about that. "As man is, God once was, and as God now is, man may become."
[time=1388] That, my dear brothers and sisters, is a heresy and has been established as such for many, many years.
[time=1394] But again, it's because people misunderstand what creating the image of God means.
[time=1399] It has nothing to do with a physical dimension.
[time=1404] To be creating the image of God first of all means that God created us to reflect and represent our Creator.
[time=1417] God created many his own image in the image of God he created, he male and female, he created them.
[time=1424] So when God inspires Moses to write these words, back then the kings of the earth who ruled over large lands
[time=1433] they didn't have any supersonic jets to go from this place to this place.
[time=1439] So in order for their people to know that that king is the king, they would erect statues with the likeness and the image of that king over all the kingdom.
[time=1453] And that statue made in the image of that king was supposed to represent that king and the people in that land in those lands would know, "Hey, this is our king.
[time=1464] And this is the image and likeness of my king." When God says, "Let us make many in our image," he basically says to humanity, "You, Adam and Eve, you humanity are supposed to represent and reflect me on the earth."
[time=1480] Because remember there is no physical dimension to God but God doesn't want to erect statues of stone.
[time=1486] He wants to erect people that have flesh and blood and a conscience to represent God our Creator.
[time=1497] So let me ask you my dear brothers and sisters, how are we doing in reflecting and representing our Creator God?
[time=1504] How are we doing? We were created to reflect and represent our Creator.
[time=1511] And you might say, "Tiberius, I really don't understand exactly what that means." Well, in the New Testament Paul writes to the Colossians about Jesus and he says, "Jesus is the image of the invisible God."
[time=1528] And the author of Hebrews writes in Hebrews 1-3 that Jesus is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his nature.
[time=1537] So if you want to know how you want to live your life every day, you need to be like Jesus.
[time=1542] That's why it's very important to start talking about Jesus not when we get to John 1 but when we get to Genesis 1.
[time=1550] After Jesus raises from the dead he rebukes the disciples on the road to Emmaus that they didn't understand that the Old Testament spoke about Jesus
[time=1560] and caused them foolish and hard of heart but we know how to act every day if we understand that we need to be like Jesus.
[time=1573] To be creating the image of God means to reflect and represent our Creator and to be creating the image of God means
[time=1582] that we are created as rational, moral and spiritual beings. Go to chapter 2 please if you have your Bibles.
[time=1595] The Lord God commanded me saying you may surely eat of every tree of the garden but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat for in the day you eat of it you shall surely die.
[time=1606] I want us to see that we are different than the animals. It is very important to understand this in chapter 2 here because remember when the Bible spoke in chapter 1 that God created the animals
[time=1617] he created the animals according to their what? Kind according to their kind. Here it doesn't say that we are created to anybody's kind we are creating the image of God we are different than the animals.
[time=1632] The animals are not created in the image of God. Animals have instinct. Hopefully we don't operate by the same rule.
[time=1646] When we operate by instinct alone we act like the animals. Animals are given instinct. We are given a spiritual, rational and moral dimension.
[time=1657] We know the difference between right and wrong. That's why hopefully you never see a cat that's been imprisoned and gone to jail.
[time=1667] Have you ever seen any cat go to jail? Has any police officer arrested a dog for doing something immoral? No, that's why we don't put dogs and cats in jail but we put humans
[time=1684] because humans alone are built in them by the Creator God with this rational, moral and spiritual dimension. Notice please the command that God gives Adam and Eve.
[time=1704] You may surely eat of every tree of the garden but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat for in the day you eat of it you shall surely die.
[time=1712] See humans are created to live in a relationship with their Creator and the Creator gives them commands and they give them the choice to obey or disobey.
[time=1724] Evolutionists will tell you that at the beginning there were cave men and women who grunted and who couldn't understand and who couldn't write.
[time=1733] There's nothing like that in the Bible, nothing like that in the Bible. When God created Adam and Eve they were fully functional just like the entire universe and they were able to understand what God said to them.
[time=1746] When God said to them you may surely eat. They knew what that meant. You don't see Adam and say God what does that mean?
[time=1756] What does it mean to die? Remember Adam and Eve have never seen death. How do they know? They know because God gave the immoral spiritual dimension and rational dimension to understand.
[time=1771] There is no room for cave men and women. There is no room for people who are grunting until they learn how to sing and until they learn how to talk. There is nothing like that in the Bible.
[time=1782] Remember when I said last time my dear brothers and sisters we are fighting the battle for truth and if we abandon the truth that God is the Creator and created us in His image then everything else is fair game.
[time=1796] Everything else is fair game but God created the animals according to their kind and He created humanity in His own image.
[time=1808] Not only that because God created us in His image He created us to rule over His creation.
[time=1817] Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.
[time=1828] I know some of us don't like this idea of dominion that we are created to have dominion and to rule over God's creation but that's clear in the rest of the Bible.
[time=1839] Psalm 8, David writes, "When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars which you have set in place, what is man that you are mindful of him and the son of man that you care for him?
[time=1854] You have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor. You have given him dominion."
[time=1863] The same expression that you have in Genesis you have in Psalm 8.
[time=1867] You have given dominion over the works of your hands.
[time=1871] You have put all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen and the beasts of the field, the birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea, whatever passes along the paths of the sea.
[time=1882] However, my dear brothers and sisters, we also need to understand that to have dominion over God's creation doesn't mean we have the right to abuse the creation.
[time=1892] So if you are a Christian and you throw trash on the ground, you are not acting like God intended you to be.
[time=1902] Ruling over God's creation, having dominion of God's creation does not mean to abuse it.
[time=1909] Why then the evangelical Christians are always last at the table when we talk about how to care for God's creation? Why?
[time=1918] I'm asking that because I just got back from a conference like that in North Carolina on creation care and there were many people at the table and the greatest college in theological seminary was invited.
[time=1929] Kind of a second thought because we like to talk about the Bible and we like to talk about God the Creator, but when it comes to creation care, we're last at the table.
[time=1940] Why is that my dear brothers and sisters? Don't get me wrong, I love animals, especially chicken parmigiana and veal marsala.
[time=1956] By the way, if you're a vegetarian, I have good news for you, the word vegetarian comes from an ancient word that means bad hunter.
[time=1974] However, what is surprising to me is that a lot of times the people who care about creation and don't like it when humans kill whales have no problem with killing unborn babies in their womb.
[time=1990] All I'm asking is for some consistency, that's what I'm asking for.
[time=1994] Let's be consistent in the way we read the Bible and in the way we obey the Bible, understanding the subduing and having dominion over God's creation does not mean to abuse it.
[time=2006] But if we care about the animals and the birds, let us start with the babies and those who cannot speak for themselves, we cannot value only certain life and not the other life.
[time=2025] I think that's a first for me, thank you, thank you very much. I'll be here all week.
[time=2032] Notice, please, verse 28. We as evangelicals like the Great Commission, right? Go into all the words and make disciples of all nations, right?
[time=2041] But the first commission is not in Matthew, the end of the Gospel of Matthew, is in Genesis 1, 28, God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living that moves on the earth."
[time=2059] This is the first commission. Before we talk about the Great Commission, we need to talk about the first commission.
[time=2069] We cannot just practice supermarket theology, just take whatever we like from the Bible, we cannot do that.
[time=2079] "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth." I like what Alan Ross says in his Genesis commentary. "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth." He says, and I quote, "For believers, childbirth is an act of worship, a sharing in the work of God, the one who created life." Isn't that beautiful?
[time=2100] For the believer. Childbirth, because it says here, "Be fruitful and multiply." Childbirth is an act of worship, a sharing in the work of God, the one who created life.
[time=2115] Only after that we have subdue and have dominion over creation. So the question is, my dear brothers and sisters, how are we going to rule over creation?
[time=2126] Are we going to rule with an iron fist, a selfish heart, or are we going to rule with a benevolent heart and altruistic spirit? That's the question.
[time=2138] To rule over God's creation does not give us license to exploit, but it means to take care of it.
[time=2146] To be created in the image of God means that we need to reflect and represent our Creator, and it means that we are to rule over his creation, and furthermore it means that we are created to live in relationship.
[time=2160] Then the Lord got formed the man out of the dust from the ground and breathed into his nostril the breath of life, and the man became a living creature.
[time=2170] We are told in Genesis 1 that God created a male and female, but now in chapter 2 we have a description of day 6 of creation, a description of the detailed accounts of what happened that day.
[time=2184] It tells us how it happened. The Lord God formed the man. That verb form is very important. It means that you and I are not created on an assembly line in Detroit.
[time=2196] We are formed by the very hands of God. It's a creative activity of God. That's why there's no two people alike in the world because God creates uniquely.
[time=2210] We are God's work of art. That's why David can explain in Psalm 139. I praise you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[time=2221] Wonderful are your works. My soul knows it very well.
[time=2227] Not only are we created to live in relationship, but God put us in a garden.
[time=2234] I know some of you want to go on a field trip to the Garden of Eden. We don't know where the Garden of Eden was.
[time=2241] Now we do know from Genesis that the Garden of Eden was somewhere between those two rivers, Tigris and Euphrates.
[time=2249] You see the Tigris and Euphrates, and in between you have Mesopotamia. The word Mesopotamia means the land between two rivers.
[time=2258] So we know where Mesopotamia was. It's still there today. So scholars get together and say, okay, where is the Garden of Eden?
[time=2266] Well, the book of Genesis also gives us the names of the river, Gihon and Pichon there in the south, but we don't know where those are.
[time=2274] Probably they were destroyed at the flood. We don't know the topography has changed, but we still know where the Tigris and Euphrates were.
[time=2283] So scholars get together and they recommend two options for the Garden of Eden.
[time=2288] If the Garden of Eden is in southern Mesopotamia right there above the Persian Gulf,
[time=2294] that means that the Garden of Eden was somewhere in present-day Iraq.
[time=2300] If the Garden of Eden was somewhere in the north where you have the green possible location for the Garden of Eden, then that's in present-day Turkey.
[time=2310] It's really not important as far as the physical aspect of it, but we know it's somewhere there in the Middle East, in the ancient Near East.
[time=2321] But what's important to understand is that God created us to live in relationship.
[time=2328] Notice please what God says here in verse 18. It is not good for man to be alone.
[time=2339] I will make him a helper fit for him. Remember the days of creation? God says everything was good, good, good, and in verse 31 says very good.
[time=2351] And all of a sudden something is not good. God says it is not good that men should be alone.
[time=2362] I will make him a helper fit for him.
[time=2368] I grew up in a country, and I've heard many people interpret this saying, see it's a helper. So the woman is inferior to the men, because the woman was a helper for the men.
[time=2385] It follows then that the woman is inferior, and I'm here to tell you that's not biblical truth.
[time=2392] I know that because in the Bible I read in Psalm 46.1, God is our refuge and strength. A very present helped the same word is used.
[time=2403] Help in trouble. Does that mean that God is our inferior? No, no.
[time=2410] So please we cannot use that verse for such false teachings like that. No, no.
[time=2415] And it says, does not just say helper, it says helper fit for him literally according to his opposite.
[time=2423] As one scholar says, what he lacked she supplied, and it is safe to say that what she lacked he supplied for life in common requires mutual help.
[time=2435] So God goes to work, and we have here the first surgery ever done. Genesis 2.21.
[time=2442] So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.
[time=2450] And the ribbed that the Lord God has taken from the men, he made into a woman and brought her to the men. I like Matthew Harry's insight.
[time=2460] And I quote, she was now made out of his head to rule over him, nor out of his feet to be trampled by him.
[time=2469] But out of his sides to be equal with him, under his arm to be protected, and near his heart to be loved.
[time=2477] Like that? I like that.
[time=2481] A woman made to be loved by the men. Thank you.
[time=2491] Thank you, Tim.
[time=2501] I like Adam's reaction.
[time=2504] This, at last, is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.
[time=2508] She shall be called woman because she was taken out of men. I like the message translation.
[time=2514] The man said finally, bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh.
[time=2521] And while we have here, my dear brothers and sisters, we have the blueprint for the marriage relationship.
[time=2529] Notice, please, the marriage is not a social custom. Marriage is designed by God.
[time=2538] And that's what we have here. Therefore, a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.
[time=2547] I like the King James Version here.
[time=2550] She'll leave and cleave. The leave and cleave principle. Very important to be preached and taught for young couples.
[time=2563] You see, when your kids get married, they form a new family unit.
[time=2568] And we are told in studies that one of the biggest reasons for divorce is because the man or the woman in the newly developed family cannot cut the umbilical cord.
[time=2584] And the mother or the father meddles in the business of the new family, and they create problems for the new couple.
[time=2594] It says here, that's why it says here, the man and his wife, they will enter this union.
[time=2601] They shall cleave to one another, but they shall first leave their father and mother.
[time=2608] Don't get me wrong, he doesn't say they shouldn't call their father and their mother.
[time=2613] It doesn't say you shall not obey or respect your father and your mother.
[time=2620] But it does say you shall leave your father and your mother.
[time=2626] I don't know why that was important to God, but God thought it was very important.
[time=2633] Notice, please, the oneness here is very, very important. They shall become one flesh.
[time=2642] For those of you who are married, you know, that this means not just a commitment to God, there needs to be a commitment to one another.
[time=2650] But before there's a commitment to one another, there needs to be a commitment to God.
[time=2655] That's why Paul writes in 2 Corinthians 6, 14, do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers.
[time=2663] For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness?
[time=2666] Or what fellowship has light with darkness?
[time=2670] See, this prohibition is actually based on Leviticus 19, 19, where the law prohibited a farmer to plow
[time=2680] with an ox and a donkey in the same yoke, because the ox and the donkey are two different animals.
[time=2689] One would want to go one way and the other would want to go the other way.
[time=2693] And God says to the Apostle Paul, you cannot have a believer and an unbeliever going in the same direction.
[time=2700] That's why there's no such thing as missionary dating.
[time=2706] First, make sure that you follow the same God before you commit your life to one another.
[time=2713] There needs to be that commitment to God first and then the commitment to one another.
[time=2718] That's why when someone gets married, we say, "Till death do us part." There needs to be that commitment too, right?
[time=2726] There needs to be that commitment.
[time=2728] Actually, I discovered that in some weddings, right now, people don't like that expression anymore.
[time=2733] They have changed it to, "From till death do us part." They changed it to, "For as long as we continue to love each other."
[time=2743] They gave up till death to us part till, "For as long as our love shall last, or until our time together is over." See, they're trying to leave room, right?
[time=2753] To get out of it.
[time=2755] Until death do us part becomes relative.
[time=2758] My dear brothers and sisters, this is God's blueprint for marriage.
[time=2765] A man and a woman committed to God and committed to one another.
[time=2770] It really doesn't matter what the Supreme Court says.
[time=2773] The Supreme Court is not the Supreme Being God.
[time=2777] I know it's hard because we go to work and we go to places where we are told that we're bigoted
[time=2784] and we are told that we are fossils and whatever we are called.
[time=2789] But I'm here to tell you my dear brothers and sisters, we need to stick to the truth of Scripture
[time=2795] because this is God-inspired truth.
[time=2798] Everything else will change over time.
[time=2802] This will not change.
[time=2806] That's why Genesis 1 and 2 are key to understanding not just who God is, but who we are
[time=2812] and what marriage is.
[time=2816] And lastly, I'm going to close with this idea at the beginning of chapter 2.
[time=2822] God created us to live in relationship but also created us to rest.
[time=2828] Beginning of Genesis 2.
[time=2831] Does the heavens and the earth were finished and all of the host of them?
[time=2835] And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done.
[time=2843] So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.
[time=2851] Now I want to tell you that this word translated here "God Rested" is from where you have the word Sabbath.
[time=2857] And that can be translated "he rested" or it can be translated "he ceased" or he stopped from his creative activity.
[time=2865] That's important because you and I get tired and we need to rest, right?
[time=2869] Does this say that God was tired and he had to rest?
[time=2872] No, it says that God ceased from his creating activities.
[time=2877] He stopped creating.
[time=2879] So when it says here God rested, I think a better translation would be God ceased from his creating activities.
[time=2886] It doesn't matter what's important for us to understand that God invites us into his rest.
[time=2895] See this was a slap in the face of the other false religions.
[time=2898] Because the false religions that were there during the time of Moses, they sanctified space.
[time=2906] And you had sacred temples and sacred places, but God does not sanctify space, he sanctifies time.
[time=2916] He says this day is holy when he gives us the fourth commandment.
[time=2920] It says you shall keep the Sabbath day to make it holy, to sanctify it.
[time=2926] So it's not just for rest, but it's also for worship.
[time=2929] So we here are listening to God's command to keep a day for worship.
[time=2935] The question is do we rest?
[time=2938] We live in a society that tells us you're good if you work 24/7, right?
[time=2944] But according to God, it should be 24/6.
[time=2949] There should be a time for rest, there should be a time for worship.
[time=2954] And the idea is going in the New Testament that it's not just a physical rest, but they're talking about a spiritual rest.
[time=2962] The author of Hebrews in chapter four says this.
[time=2966] So then there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God, for whoever has entered God's rest has also rested from his works as God did from his.
[time=2975] Let us therefore strive to enter that rest so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience.
[time=2982] So God is inviting us into his rest, that's why Jesus says, come to me, all who you labor, and are heavy laden, and I will give you what?
[time=2991] Rest.
[time=2993] See, there's one thing to have physical rest, and we need it.
[time=2997] But there's the spiritual rest when we need to enter into the relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=3003] The question is not if Jesus is the Savior.
[time=3007] The question is, is Jesus your Savior?
[time=3011] Have you entered into that rest where you don't have to work for your salvation anymore, but you realize that he has finished under the work of Jesus Christ?
[time=3021] So as I close, I want to ask ourselves three ways in which we can apply God's truth.
[time=3030] First of all, we need to reflect and represent the Creator well.
[time=3037] As evangelical Christians, let us not go into the workplace and act like pagans.
[time=3044] In the way we treat God's creation.
[time=3047] And if you're at your place of work, you have a recycling program, you'll be the first to recycle.
[time=3054] It's small things. I'm not asking you to go climb on a tree or do anything like that.
[time=3060] No, that's the abuse of that teaching.
[time=3064] But we as evangelical Christians need to be at the forefront of caring for God's creation.
[time=3071] Represent God well.
[time=3074] Do not abuse your responsibility.
[time=3079] And then, how are we ruling over God's creation?
[time=3083] Are we doing with benevolence or are we doing it from a selfish heart?
[time=3090] See, we need to check our hearts here.
[time=3093] And how are we ruling over God's creation?
[time=3097] And lastly, live in a godly relationship.
[time=3104] God has designed marriage to be the way to live our lives.
[time=3112] If you are married, God has called you to be in a committed relationship to God and one another.
[time=3120] Maybe some of you need to go home and ask forgiveness from your spouse.
[time=3125] From the fact that you did treat them until now is inferior.
[time=3130] And maybe you abused that.
[time=3132] Maybe it's time to go home and say, "I'm sorry." Maybe you're sitting here and you realize that your relationship is now where it should be.
[time=3141] There's always room and time for forgiveness.
[time=3146] Let's pray.
[time=3148] Dear Father, we thank you.
[time=3150] We thank you that you are the Creator God who, in your power and grace, created everything for your glory.
[time=3159] Thank you that you did not create us like the animals with instinct, but created us in your image to reflect and represent you.
[time=3166] May we do that well in the way we speak, in the way we act at school and our place of employment on the sports court or in the sports field, wherever we are, may we represent you well.
[time=3182] Forgive us for the time when we abused the responsibility to not care for the creation, but we abused your creation.
[time=3190] Give us wisdom to be at the forefront of that relationship.
[time=3195] Understanding that the gospel starts within the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
[time=3200] And I pray for our families.
[time=3202] May we live in a Godly relationship that you designed between a man and a woman in a marriage relationship to death.
[time=3214] Do us part.
[time=3216] And I pray that if there are people here with family problems that today will be a day of healing,
[time=3224] that they have restoration, that they have reconciliation, and teach us what it means to rest.
[time=3231] Rest in the work of Jesus Christ who died on the cross for our sins.
[time=3235] In His name we pray.
[time=3237] [AMEN]
