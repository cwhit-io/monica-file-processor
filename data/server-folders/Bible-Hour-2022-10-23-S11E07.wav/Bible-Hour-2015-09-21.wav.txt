[time=12] [MUSIC - 544 seconds]
[time=560] But as the years went on, although I was in youth group and continued all of the Bible camp and all of the Sunday school and church and singing in the choir, the trappings of teenage life and the culture of teenage life, even decades, decades ago.
[time=580] It still was hard. It was hard to maintain that. I was a good person, but I kind of got hung up in the teen years.
[time=588] So the next 20 plus years were filled with pregnancies and marriages and divorces that I just wasn't mentally and emotionally prepared to handle.
[time=605] And so one day out of desperation and I think whisper from the Holy Spirit, I made a phone call to an aunt and uncle.
[time=618] And I told them I said I was just really caught up in the fact that I wanted intimacy, but I wasn't getting it. I wasn't being satisfied with it.
[time=629] I didn't have the skills or the insight of my own errors and my mistakes. That aunt and uncle were Lois and Wayne Whitter and they lived in Fort Wayne.
[time=639] And amazingly left, they went to a large church on the north side of Fort Wayne called Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=647] So they told me to come down and see them. So I made the trip down to Fort Wayne and I met with them on the south side of Fort Wayne at the ETS ice cream parlor on Tillman Road.
[time=658] So I began my tale of woe and frustration with God with them.
[time=664] And at that time I was seven months pregnant. I was alone and raising an eight year old daughter.
[time=672] And I was really frustrated with God because I thought, couldn't God do miracles?
[time=678] Couldn't God fix everything about my life? I had been bargaining with him for months and nothing seemed to be changing.
[time=687] And an amazing thing happened that night. They listened to my story and they looked at me and they said, "You know, when you called, we'd been waiting for your call."
[time=700] I thought that was very interesting that they'd been waiting for my call. I know now that they've been praying for me.
[time=706] And then my aunt looked at me and she said, "Cathy, God could fix your marriage and he may very well want to someday."
[time=715] But the one thing he's most concerned about right now is your relationship with him.
[time=722] That's the relationship he wants to fix. It's like pow. How could I have been raised in the church?
[time=730] How could I have learned all about doctrine? How could I have spent all those times listening to the gospel?
[time=737] That one comment meant more and has a bigger impact on me than anything I'd ever heard.
[time=745] So we sat there that evening and they talked to me and talked to me about my acceptance of the Lord when I was a child.
[time=754] I don't remember a lot of that conversation. I just remember that one comment they made to me.
[time=760] I think that God and I had a lot of conversation on the way home that night. It was an hour's drive. I don't remember any of it.
[time=769] But it must have been really good because when I got up the next morning, I was a changed person.
[time=776] I was different, supernaturally changed. And for anybody who's not had that experience, that's your experience, that's your story.
[time=783] I know some that accepted the Lord when they were young and have lived that life.
[time=789] But mine was supernatural and this is how I know it.
[time=792] I was no longer interested in anything that I was interested in before.
[time=796] All of a sudden, the wave of depression was starting to lift off of me.
[time=802] I was getting up in the morning. I was facing the day with a smile on my face.
[time=807] I was devouring Scripture. I was devouring all the books and the magazines they had given me to read. I couldn't get enough of it.
[time=816] I sought out a church I went to as a child that I knew was doctrinally strong.
[time=823] And I sought out a mentor. Within weeks, I had a mentor.
[time=828] I mean, it was amazing. And people around me that knew me were commenting on the change.
[time=834] It was like an affirmation. They knew something was different.
[time=839] So that was 38 years ago, 1977.
[time=846] The year that Elvis died, I normally would have been sad about that, but I have to tell you, it was the best year of my life.
[time=853] My circumstances didn't really change a lot right away.
[time=858] My parents didn't get answered the way I thought they would. But that year, it was great.
[time=867] God became my friend, my husband, my Lord, everything to me.
[time=874] And he's been faithful to me all these years, raising my children.
[time=881] So, I would like to leave you with my life first with just Matthew 633.
[time=888] "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness." And all these things will be added unto you. Amen.
[time=900] Now, the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the Lord had made.
[time=906] He said to the woman, "Did God actually say you should not eat of any tree in the garden?"
[time=913] And the woman said to the serpent, "We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden, but God said,
[time=919] "You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, and neither shall you touch it, lest you die."
[time=926] But the serpent said to the woman, "You will not surely die, for God knows that when you eat of it, your eyes will be opened,
[time=934] and you will be like God, knowing good and evil." So, when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate.
[time=949] And she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate.
[time=955] Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked, and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves loincloths.
[time=964] And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden.
[time=975] But the Lord God called to the man and said to him, "Where are you?" And he said, "I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself."
[time=988] He said, "Who told you that you were naked?
[time=991] Have you eaten of the tree which I commanded you not to eat?" The man said, "The woman whom you gave to him, be with me. She gave me the fruit of the tree, and I ate."
[time=1002] Then the Lord God said to the woman, "What is this that you have done?" And the woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate." The Lord God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock, and above all beasts of the field.
[time=1019] On your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.
[time=1025] I will put enmity between you and the woman, in between your offspring and her offspring.
[time=1030] He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel." To the woman he said, "I will surely multiply your pain and childbearing, and pain you shall bring forth children.
[time=1043] Your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you." But to Adam he said, "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and of eaten of the tree which I commanded you, you shall not eat of it.
[time=1056] Curse it as a ground because of you, and pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life.
[time=1062] Thorns and thistles, it shall bring forth for you, and you shall not eat the plants of the field.
[time=1069] By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken.
[time=1076] For you are dust, and to dust you shall return." The man called his wife's name Eve because she was the mother of all living.
[time=1085] And the Lord God made for Adam and his wife garments of skins and clothed them.
[time=1090] Then the Lord God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil.
[time=1096] Now lest he reach out his hand and take also the tree of life and eat, and live forever.
[time=1102] Therefore the Lord God sent him out of the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken.
[time=1108] He drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the chair of him,
[time=1114] and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life.
[time=1119] Good morning.
[time=1134] Please open your Bibles to Genesis chapter 3.
[time=1137] Thank you, Cathy, for sharing your testimony with us.
[time=1141] And I pray that by the end of today, if you have not experienced that relationship with God,
[time=1148] that restored relationship, that today will be the day of your salvation as well.
[time=1153] Two weeks ago we looked at Genesis 1, and we saw how God created everything in six days.
[time=1162] And last week we saw how God created Adam and Eve and placed them in the garden of Eden.
[time=1171] In paradise.
[time=1173] Paradise is a word that means garden that came later to us in usage.
[time=1180] And today we're learning how this paradise was lost.
[time=1184] And the Bible teaches us in the process who our enemy is, what his strategy is,
[time=1192] and we'll learn about the tragedy of the fall.
[time=1197] The penalty and ultimately the recovery.
[time=1201] First of all, we learn who our enemy is.
[time=1205] Verse 1 of chapter 3.
[time=1209] Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the Lord God made.
[time=1214] He said to the woman, "Did God actually say, 'You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?'
[time=1220] We are introduced to public enemy number one, Satan, also known as the devil.
[time=1227] And how do we know that this is Satan?
[time=1230] We know by looking in the rest of Scripture.
[time=1233] 2 Corinthians 11, 3, Paul writes, "But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts be led astray from a sincere, pure devotion to Christ."
[time=1247] And then in Revelation 20 verse 2 we read, "And he sees the dragon that ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years." So whatever is happening here, Satan is tempting Eve to disobey God.
[time=1265] And then we find out his strategy, two-fold strategy.
[time=1270] First, he questions God's word.
[time=1274] Did God actually say, "You shall not eat of any tree in the garden?"
[time=1280] By the way, did God ever say that?
[time=1283] No.
[time=1284] We're going to look back with me in Genesis chapter 2, 16 and 17.
[time=1288] The Lord God commended them and saying, "You may surely eat of every tree
[time=1294] of the garden, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat, for in the day you eat of it you shall surely die."
[time=1304] And here we see Eve's first mistake.
[time=1307] She alters God's word. She changes God's word.
[time=1312] Now you might say it's not such a big deal, but look what she does.
[time=1316] She changes it just a little bit.
[time=1319] The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden, but God said you shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden.
[time=1330] Neither shall you what?" Touch it. Did God say that?
[time=1334] No. God never said that.
[time=1337] You might say, "Tiberius, that's not such a big deal." You know, you change God's word a little bit, the word here and there, but the Bible is very clear.
[time=1344] Proverbs 30 verses 5 and 6.
[time=1347] Every word of God proves true.
[time=1350] He is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
[time=1353] Do not add to his words.
[time=1355] Let's hear rebuke you and be found a liar.
[time=1358] And then in Revelation 22 we are told that we cannot take stuff out of the Bible either.
[time=1363] If anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city which are described in this book.
[time=1374] First Satan wants you to change God's word.
[time=1377] Did God actually say that?
[time=1379] That's how every heresy starts.
[time=1382] Did God really say that?
[time=1384] Oh, come on.
[time=1385] We can change it a little bit to fit our culture, to fit our society, but we cannot do that.
[time=1391] Satan starts with altering God's word, questioning God's word, and then he goes on to deny God's word.
[time=1398] But the serpent said to the woman, you will not surely die.
[time=1404] For God knows that when you eat of it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God knowing good and evil.
[time=1414] Satan takes advantage of the fact that the woman is willing to negotiate,
[time=1420] to change the word a little bit.
[time=1422] Now he goes a step further and denies God's word. God said when you eat of it,
[time=1430] you will surely die and Satan says no.
[time=1436] You will not surely die.
[time=1439] That's why Jesus calls Satan the father of lies.
[time=1444] Remember, my dear brothers and sisters, it's always the battle for truth.
[time=1450] Sometimes we have to distinguish what's true and almost true.
[time=1456] Because sometimes Satan comes with statements that are almost true.
[time=1461] They kind of look true, but they're not true.
[time=1464] So here, he says, God says you will surely die and Satan says you will surely not die.
[time=1472] When Jesus is arguing with the Pharisees, he talks about this fact that Satan is the father of lies.
[time=1482] You are of your father, the devil, harsh words, harsh words.
[time=1488] Jesus says, and your will is to do your father's desire.
[time=1492] He was a murderer from the beginning and has nothing to do with the truth because there is no truth in him.
[time=1498] When he lies, he speaks out of his own character for he is a liar and the father of lies.
[time=1505] And Satan continues with the rampage against God in verse 5.
[time=1510] For God knows that when you eat of it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God knowing good and evil.
[time=1517] See, Satan doesn't stop there. He attacks God's integrity.
[time=1521] What basically Satan is saying to Eve is this.
[time=1525] God is the cosmic party pooper.
[time=1528] He doesn't want you to have any fun.
[time=1532] You are here. God is there and he doesn't want you to have any fun.
[time=1537] But if you listen to what I say, you will be like him.
[time=1541] Dad, my dear brothers and sisters, this essence of every temptation.
[time=1545] God says something and Satan says no, this is not how you should live your life.
[time=1550] You should do it the way I tell you to do it.
[time=1553] And this always happens because Satan convinces us
[time=1559] that his way is better than God's way.
[time=1564] How does Satan know what it means to be like God or to want to be like God?
[time=1570] Isaiah gives us a glimpse into his fall.
[time=1573] Isaiah 14, 13 and 14, an account of Satan's fall.
[time=1578] I will go up to heaven. I will put my throne above God's stars.
[time=1581] I will sit on the mountain of the gods on the slopes of the sacred mountain.
[time=1585] I will go up to the tops of the clouds. I will be like God.
[time=1590] That's how Satan wanted to be, but he cannot.
[time=1595] He can never deliver because he is just lying.
[time=1600] And the tragedy, the tragedy is that both Adam and Eve disobeyed God
[time=1607] and chose to listen to the words of Satan.
[time=1613] Look, please, at the verbs employed here, I underlined them here on the screen.
[time=1620] When the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was the delight to the eyes and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate and she also gave some to her and he ate.
[time=1636] Warren Wiesby writes, "Humans are so constructed that they must believe in something.
[time=1642] If they don't believe the truth, then they'll believe lives."
[time=1648] If we don't accept God's truth, we've got to come up with something else.
[time=1653] And if we don't accept God's truth, the alternative is a lie.
[time=1658] I like Max Schuchato's insight about Eve's thought process.
[time=1664] Max Schuchato writes, "Eve stroked her chin as she replayed that promise.
[time=1670] You will be like God." The snake pulled back the curtain to the throne room and invited Eve to take a seat.
[time=1679] Put on the crown, pick up the scepter, put on the cape.
[time=1683] See how it feels to have power.
[time=1687] See how it feels to be in control.
[time=1690] Eve swallowed the hook.
[time=1692] The temptation to be like God eclipsed her view of God and the crunch of the fruit echoed in the kingdom.
[time=1701] But look at the results.
[time=1703] The results were anticlimactic, Genesis 3, verse 7.
[time=1707] Then the eyes of both were open and they knew they were naked and they saw fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths.
[time=1718] What was right until now, all of a sudden, is very wrong.
[time=1724] Did they become like God?
[time=1727] Not really.
[time=1729] James Montgomery Boyce has this great insight.
[time=1734] He writes, "By sinning, our first parents came to know evil as well as good."
[time=1741] Which is what Satan had said.
[time=1744] "But they came to know it not from the standpoint of God who loves good and hates evil,
[time=1750] but as fallen creatures who love evil and hate good." Satan would have been perfectly truthful if he had said, "For God knows the one you eat of it, your eyes will be open and you will be like me knowing good and evil." And that's exactly what happened.
[time=1768] Since then, we then try to make up for this rebellion
[time=1775] by sowing fig leaves together and making loincloths.
[time=1781] It's called man-made religion.
[time=1783] We try to cover our sin by our own power and our own methods.
[time=1790] That's man-made religion.
[time=1792] Because remember, if you reject the truth, you've got to come up with something.
[time=1796] If you don't accept the truth, you've got to come up with something else.
[time=1802] Guilt and shame, my dear brothers and sisters, are direct and immediate consequences of sin.
[time=1811] They felt guilty and shameful and they tried to hide that.
[time=1816] Guilt and shame are direct and immediate consequences of sin.
[time=1822] But you see, sin cannot be covered with fig leaves.
[time=1828] Sin cannot be covered with man-made religion.
[time=1832] People have tried before.
[time=1836] Your sin cannot be covered with giving to church.
[time=1839] Your sin cannot be covered by doing good things, by feeding the hungry, by whatever.
[time=1846] You cannot cover your sin by doing anything.
[time=1851] No matter how great that something is.
[time=1856] The tragedy is that the humans rebelled, and the tragedy is that there was a broken relationship as Kathy, so beautifully described.
[time=1868] What happens is when we disobey God, our relationship is broken.
[time=1873] Look in verse 8.
[time=1876] And they heard the sound of the Lord walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden.
[time=1885] But the Lord got called to the man and said to him, "Where are you?" And he said, "I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, and I hid myself."
[time=1902] There are some liberal scholars who say, "God is asking, 'Where are you?' because he doesn't know where they are."
[time=1911] Wow.
[time=1914] I want to argue that God is asking exactly because they know.
[time=1919] He knows where they are.
[time=1921] My dear brothers and sisters, this is not a geographical question.
[time=1924] It's a theological question.
[time=1927] "Where are you?" It's a chance to give them to repent and to say, "We are wrong, we have sinned, but that's not what they do, is it?" I remember when our youngest son Nicholas was about, I think he was about four years old.
[time=1943] He came to me and said, "Daddy, let's play hide and seek." He wanted to play hide and seek in the house.
[time=1951] Maybe it was winter, I don't remember exactly, but I said, "Okay, let's play." And he said, "Daddy, and I'm going to hide over here."
[time=1962] But I wanted to play.
[time=1965] So I went around the house and I asked Nicholas, "Nicolas, where is Nicholas?"
[time=1972] Nicholas, Nicholas, where is Nicholas?
[time=1976] Did I ask before I didn't know where he was?
[time=1980] No, I asked exactly because I knew where he was.
[time=1984] I didn't ask for myself, I asked for him, for his sake.
[time=1989] When God is asking us, 'Where are you?' He's not asking because he doesn't know, he knows exactly where you are.
[time=1996] You're here, you're here, you're here, you know exactly.
[time=1999] He's not asking for himself, he's asking for you.
[time=2002] Do you need to repent?
[time=2004] Do you need to come back to him?
[time=2006] He knows where you are.
[time=2008] The question is not a geographical question, it's a theological question.
[time=2013] Where are you?
[time=2015] I'm hoping that by the end of this sermon you will answer where you are, if you are lost, you will come to his salvation that he's still offering today.
[time=2026] The tragedy here is that there's a broken relationship.
[time=2030] Starting in verse 11, "Who told you that you were naked?
[time=2033] Have you eaten of the tree of which I commend you not to eat?" The man said, "The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree and I ate." Then the Lord got set to the woman, "What is this that you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent deceived me and I ate." What we see here is the first valuable game in history, played not with a ball but with guilt.
[time=2059] Instead of accepting responsibility for sin, they blame one another.
[time=2068] First valuable game in history was played with a ball called "blame."
[time=2074] Failure to accept responsibility for one sin is a direct consequence of sin.
[time=2087] Why did you sin?
[time=2088] My parents were too strict.
[time=2091] Why did you sin?
[time=2092] My parents were not strict enough.
[time=2095] Why did you sin?
[time=2096] Well, peer pressure was too great.
[time=2098] Why did you sin? Well, the consequence, the circumstances were too wicked.
[time=2106] My family gene pool is corrupt.
[time=2108] Well, I have news for you.
[time=2112] Going back to Adam and Eve, all our family pool is corrupt.
[time=2121] What is remarkable is that Adam blames God.
[time=2125] Notice, he doesn't say, "The woman gave me fruit to eat." He said, "The woman whom you gave me, God, it's your fault." Everything was so good when I was by myself.
[time=2140] But it's not the woman, it's the woman whom you gave me.
[time=2146] The woman you gave me, God turns to Eve and asks, "What is this that you have done?"
[time=2152] And the serpent received me, the devil made me do it, right?
[time=2155] You know that one, right?
[time=2157] The devil made me do it.
[time=2159] We always have an excuse.
[time=2161] We always blame others because, again, the failure to accept responsibility for sin
[time=2168] is a direct consequence of sin.
[time=2172] The German theologian and reformer Martin Luther says, "By the way, he doesn't like to mean his words, so I quote directly from him." He says, "Let us learn, then, this perversion and stupidity always accompany sin."
[time=2189] And that sinners accuse themselves by their excuses and betray themselves by their defense,
[time=2195] especially before God.
[time=2197] This is the nature of sin.
[time=2199] Unless God immediately provides a cure and calls the sinner back, he flees endlessly from God, and by excusing his sin with lies, he's sin upon sin,
[time=2210] until he arrives at blasphemy and despair.
[time=2219] Adam and Eve chose to disobey God.
[time=2221] They rebelled against God.
[time=2224] The tragedy was clear.
[time=2227] There was a broken relationship between them and God.
[time=2230] And because of that, because God is the gracious God, he steps in and gives the penalty for sin.
[time=2237] Did you ever think that penalty for sin is an act of grace?
[time=2242] It is.
[time=2243] Grace was not invented in the New Testament.
[time=2246] Grace originates in the Old Testament.
[time=2249] Why didn't God kill Adam and Eve on the spot?
[time=2253] Because of grace.
[time=2254] God gave them grace.
[time=2256] God gave them grace, and we'll see they gave them.
[time=2258] He gives them more grace later on.
[time=2261] But we see here the penalty for the serpent.
[time=2265] Starting in verse 14.
[time=2267] The Lord said, God said to the serpent, because you have done this curse, are you above all livestock and above all beasts of the field on your belly, you shall go, and thus you shall eat all the days of your life.
[time=2281] Some scholars suggest that the serpent was not always a crawler.
[time=2289] I don't know, it seems that that could be the case.
[time=2294] Someone said that the punishment implies that the serpent was originally upright,
[time=2300] and only as a result of God's judgment did the serpent become a crawler.
[time=2307] I don't know, but what I don't know is verse 15.
[time=2312] We call this the first gospel.
[time=2314] We are in the series, the gospel project.
[time=2317] And we come to verse 15, and in the midst of the penalty, we have good news.
[time=2323] We have good news.
[time=2325] That's why this is called the protoevangelium, the first gospel.
[time=2329] God says to the serpent, I will put the end minutely between you and the woman and between your offspring and her offspring.
[time=2335] He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.
[time=2340] Wherein weirs be says, at the cross, Satan bruise Christ's heel.
[time=2345] But because of his death and resurrection, Christ crushed Satan's head and won a complete victory over him.
[time=2352] Good news.
[time=2353] We are fighting a defeated enemy.
[time=2359] We are fighting a defeated enemy because Christ crushed Satan's head
[time=2366] when he died on the cross for our sins and when he rose again.
[time=2372] Look at the penalty for the woman.
[time=2376] To the woman he said, I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing.
[time=2379] In pain you shall bring four children.
[time=2381] Your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.
[time=2388] For those of you who had children, and for any man who was in the room with your wife
[time=2397] when she gave birth, if looks could kill, all of us would be dead by now.
[time=2407] And all that goes back to this word.
[time=2411] I will multiply your pain in childbearing.
[time=2414] I don't know if the multiplication here is from zero to ten, or from four to ten.
[time=2421] Because pain is not necessarily a direct result of sin.
[time=2425] Pain is a good thing.
[time=2428] If you and your body cannot feel any pain, you have a serious condition.
[time=2432] You should see the doctor.
[time=2436] But there is definitely a multiplication here that says I will multiply your pain in childbearing.
[time=2445] Not only that, your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.
[time=2455] John Sallheimer puts it like this.
[time=2458] "Thus the Lord affirms in the oracles of judgment the order creation.
[time=2462] The serpent is subjected to the woman, the woman to the man and all to the Lord.
[time=2467] In those moments of life's greatest blessing, marriage and children, the woman would serve more clearly the painful consequences of her rebellion from God."
[time=2482] But the man is also punished.
[time=2485] Look at the penalty for Adam.
[time=2488] To Adam he said, "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the three of which I commend you, you shall not eat of it.
[time=2496] Curse is the ground because of you. In pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life.
[time=2502] Thorns and thistles which shall bring forth for you, and you shall eat the plants of the field.
[time=2506] By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken, for you are dust, and to dust you shall return."
[time=2517] Allow me to illustrate this with a funny story.
[time=2521] Please don't read anything theological into it, it's just a funny story.
[time=2527] But it illustrates this penalty.
[time=2532] I read somewhere that when God created the mule, He told them, "You are the mule." Working constantly from dusk to dawn, carrying heavy loads on your back, you will eat grass and you will lack intelligence.
[time=2547] You will live for 50 years.
[time=2552] And the mule answered, "To live like this for 50 years is too much.
[time=2557] Please give me no more than 20." And it was so.
[time=2562] Then God created the dog and told them, "You will hold vigilance over the dwellings of men to whom you will be the greatest companion.
[time=2572] You will eat his stable scraps and live for 30 years." And the dog responded, "Lord, to live 30 years is a dog is too much.
[time=2582] Please no more than 15." And you are so.
[time=2587] And then God created the monkey and told them, "You are a monkey.
[time=2591] You will swing from three to three acting like an idiot.
[time=2596] You will be funny and you shall live for 40 years." The monkey responded, "Lord, to live 40 years as the clown of the world is too much.
[time=2606] Please, Lord, give me no more than 30." And it was so.
[time=2610] Finally, God created men and told them, "You are a man." The only rational being that walks the earth.
[time=2617] You will use your intelligence to have mastery over the creatures of the world.
[time=2621] You will dominate the earth and live for 20 years.
[time=2627] And the man responded, "Lord, to be a man for only 20 years is too little.
[time=2635] Please, Lord, give me the 30 years, the mill refused.
[time=2638] The 15 years, the dog refused, and the 10 years, the monkey rejected, and he was so."
[time=2644] So God made men to live 20 years as a man.
[time=2657] Then Mary and lived 30 years like a mule working and carrying heavy loads on his back.
[time=2663] Then his children will become teenagers, and he will live 15 years as a dog.
[time=2669] Guarding his house and eating leftovers after they emptied the pantry.
[time=2675] And then in his old age, he will live 10 years as a monkey acting like a fool to amuse his grandchildren.
[time=2688] Sometimes things are so serious we either cry or laugh about it.
[time=2692] But the truth is that all these are the penalty for our sin.
[time=2698] God created us in his image, different than the animals.
[time=2704] Remember, the animals were created with instinct.
[time=2706] We were creating the image of God.
[time=2708] Now as the result of the fall, the image of God was not erased, but it was defaced.
[time=2718] How do we get the image back?
[time=2720] If the story would end here, it would be a sad story, but the story does not end here.
[time=2725] Isn't that good news?
[time=2727] That's great news, because the story doesn't end here.
[time=2730] It continues with God, providing redemption for them, the recovery.
[time=2737] Verse 21, "The Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skin, and clothed them."
[time=2743] Here we have the first sacrifice.
[time=2747] Remember, Adam and Eve tried to cover themselves with fig leaves.
[time=2751] Man made religion, but God cannot have that.
[time=2754] He wants to provide for them garments of skin, which means that he had to kill an animal,
[time=2763] to provide that for them.
[time=2766] This, my dear brothers and sisters, is what theologians call foreshadowing.
[time=2770] This is a finger pointing towards one who will come and cover our sin.
[time=2780] Genesis 3.22, then the Lord God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil." Now lest he reach out, he send and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever.
[time=2790] Therefore, the Lord God sent him out of the Garden of Eden to work the ground which he has taken.
[time=2795] He drove out of the man and at the end of the Garden of Eden he placed the cherubim, a flaming sword,
[time=2802] that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life.
[time=2807] So paradise was lost.
[time=2811] Paradise was lost. Can we ever get it back again?
[time=2816] And the answer is yes.
[time=2819] I want you to look at this chart that basically shows the tragedy versus the recovery.
[time=2827] There are two very important words that describe Eve's sin.
[time=2832] She took and she ate.
[time=2838] When Jesus initiates the Lord's Supper, he invites us to take and eat.
[time=2845] What Jesus is saying is this.
[time=2848] The problem that you have is not a small problem.
[time=2853] The problem that you have is called a sin problem.
[time=2857] That originates when Eve took an eighth.
[time=2861] And the only resolve is when I invite you to take and eat from my body.
[time=2867] Whenever we take communion, we remember this.
[time=2870] Now for us maybe doesn't sound that important, but for a Hebrew speaking person, when Jesus
[time=2878] says take and eat, they immediately go back to Genesis when Eve took an eighth.
[time=2886] Very, very important words, not accidental, but clear that Jesus says the problem of sin
[time=2892] that originates in Genesis 3 can only be resolved by me who is inviting you to be in a relationship with me.
[time=2899] Paul writes in Romans 5.
[time=2903] Therefore, just a sin came into the world through one man and death through sin.
[time=2907] So death spread to all men because all sinned.
[time=2911] For sin was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law, verses 18 and 19 in Romans 5.
[time=2919] Therefore, as one trespass led to the condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to the justification and life for all men.
[time=2928] For as by the one man's disobedience, the many were made sinners.
[time=2933] So by the one man's obedience, the many will be made righteous.
[time=2938] There is so much there, but the idea is this.
[time=2943] When we sinned back in Genesis 3, the image of God in us was defaced.
[time=2949] We got to get it back, and the only way to get it back is to be in Christ who is the image of the invisible God.
[time=2957] There is the only way. There is no other way.
[time=2960] If there would be a third way, I would tell you, trust me, but there is no other way.
[time=2966] The only way is through Jesus and who invites us to take and eat.
[time=2972] Donald Drey Barnhouse writes, "Sin, death and judgment flowed from the act of Adam.
[time=2979] Righteousness, life and kingship flowed from the cross of Christ.
[time=2983] The sin of Adam was a stone cast into a pool which sent ripples to every inlet.
[time=2988] The cross of Christ was the rock of ages, cast into the ocean of the love of God.
[time=2993] And it is the destiny of all who are in Christ to be carried on the swell of his majestic love and life and power both now and forever."
[time=3006] Kent Hughes writes, "It was midnight in the Garden of Eden. Curses and judgments rained down. Paradise was lost."
[time=3016] Yet there was grace.
[time=3019] God's curse upon Satan meant that his own son would one day become a curse for us.
[time=3025] Satan would strike his heel, but the wound received would mean that the son would strike a death blow to Satan.
[time=3031] Grace is rooted in Christ's victory.
[time=3036] Let me ask you, my dear friends, is Jesus your savior?
[time=3042] See, the question is not if Jesus is the savior, because God made Jesus the savior.
[time=3049] You don't have the power to say he's not the savior.
[time=3052] The question is, is he your savior? That's the question.
[time=3056] Some people think of Jesus, you know, Jesus is sitting somewhere in the corner there waiting for you to invite him into your life.
[time=3062] You know, he's somewhere hiding. No.
[time=3064] The Bible says that God made him Lord and master.
[time=3068] And sometimes people ask you, "Well, do you only do you only Jesus be your person, Lord and savior?"
[time=3074] He is the Lord. He is the savior. The question is, "Do you want to, are you going to submit under his authority?"
[time=3080] That's the question.
[time=3082] He already is. God made him that. You don't have the power to strip that away from him, because God the creator became the savior.
[time=3091] The question is, "Is he your savior?" That's the question.
[time=3097] You have the image of God in you, but it's been defaced by sin.
[time=3102] The only way to get it back is to be in Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ to be he and you.
[time=3109] Jesus says, "He who has the son has life.
[time=3113] He who does not have the son of God shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides in him."
[time=3119] Do you have Jesus? Is Jesus your Lord and savior?
[time=3124] If not, I invite you this morning to come and surrender your life to him.
[time=3129] I'm not going to promise that all your problems will be resolved.
[time=3133] But this is what the Bible does promise you. Forgiveness of sin and eternal life with him forever.
[time=3141] Isn't that good? If you're sick and tired living with your sin on your head and always looking back to see if someone sees you,
[time=3149] if somebody knows, I can tell you that when you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and savior, when you submit under his authority, you will experience the peace that passes all understanding.
[time=3161] You don't need to look back anymore because you will walk down the straight and narrow path that he intended for you.
[time=3169] After I pray, if you want to come here and pray, we'll have elders who are willing to pray with you to make this the day of your salvation.
[time=3178] Wouldn't that be great? It's up to you. God never forces you.
[time=3183] He's the ultimate gentleman. He invites you. He invites you.
[time=3190] As we will close with the song, make a decision that will affect your eternity. Let's pray.
[time=3199] Dear Father, we thank you for giving us grace and truth, truth and grace.
[time=3208] Thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ into the world to invite us into his relationship with him to take and eat,
[time=3217] to sit down, and to experience not just forgiveness of sin, but also eternal life with you forever.
[time=3227] I pray that if someone is here and they went astray for a while and they want to rededicate their life to you,
[time=3237] I pray that you will engrave in their hearts that your sin can still forgive sins.
[time=3243] It is still powerful enough. There is still power in the blood.
[time=3251] Someone is here and never surrendered their life to Christ, and they are leading a lost life.
[time=3257] They're sick and tired of living in sin, and they want to experience the peace that passes on understanding.
[time=3263] If they want eternal life and a great relationship with you now and forever, I pray that through the Holy Spirit you will speak to them and they will surrender their life to you.
[time=3273] I pray that Blackhawk will continue to be a light in this dark world, and many people will come to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ as the result of their ministry.
[time=3281] It is in Christ's name that we pray. Amen.
