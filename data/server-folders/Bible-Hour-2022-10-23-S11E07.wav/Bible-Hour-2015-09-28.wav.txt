[time=686] The mercy and grace are ending love, amazing grace, an ending love, amazing grace.
[time=707] [APPLAUSE]
[time=716] This is from Genesis.
[time=718] Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain and said, "I have acquired a man from the Lord."
[time=727] Then she bore again, this time his brother Abel.
[time=731] Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
[time=736] And in the process of time, it came to pass that Cain brought an offering of the fruit of the ground to the Lord.
[time=743] Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat, and the Lord respected Abel and his offering.
[time=753] But he did not respect Cain and his offering, and Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.
[time=761] So the Lord said to Cain, "Why are you angry, and why is your countenance fallen?
[time=767] If you do well, will you not be accepted?
[time=770] And if you do not do well, sin lies at the door, and his desire is for you, but you should not rule over it."
[time=780] Now Cain talked with Abel, his brother, and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him.
[time=790] Then the Lord said to Cain, "Where is Abel, your brother?" He said, "I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?" And he said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground.
[time=806] So now you are cursed from the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
[time=814] When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield its strength to you.
[time=819] A fugitive and a vagabond you shall be on the earth." And Cain said to the Lord, "My punishment is greater than I can bear.
[time=830] Surely you have driven me out to stay from the face of the ground. I shall be hidden from your face.
[time=836] I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth, and it will happen that anyone who finds me will kill me."
[time=843] And the Lord said to him, "Therefore whoever kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.
[time=851] And the Lord said a mark on Cain lest anyone finding him should kill him."
[time=857] And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and named him Seth.
[time=862] For God has appointed another seed for me instead of Abel, whom Cain killed.
[time=868] And as for Seth, to him also a son was born, and he named him E. Nosh.
[time=874] Then men begin to call on the name of the Lord.
[time=878] Good morning.
[time=883] My chains are gone. I've been set free.
[time=888] And like a flood has mercy reigns on ending love, amazing grace.
[time=893] I know you go to sporting events. I know you watch them on television, and I know you get excited.
[time=898] But let me remind you, my chains are gone. I've been set free.
[time=904] Amen?
[time=906] Don't force me to have my son-in-law Adam teach you how to cheer, because he would do it.
[time=912] Let's try it one more time. My chains are gone. I've been set free.
[time=921] I love that song, Darren. Thanks for choosing that one.
[time=924] My name is Rich Diverny. I'm an elder here at Blackhawk, and I'm a sinner.
[time=930] I'm a sinner.
[time=932] I'm a sinner saved by grace.
[time=936] I have in my life sin crossroads. We're going to talk about today.
[time=942] Crossroads that I come to when I have a decision and a choice, I can make a decision to be obedient,
[time=949] or I can make a decision to follow sin.
[time=954] And sometimes, as much as I want to honor the Lord and as much as I want to obey Him,
[time=960] and as much as I want to praise Him, sometimes I make the choice at that crossroad towards sin.
[time=969] And I've even entered a sin spiral. Have you done that?
[time=976] I'm Rich Diverny. I'm a sinner.
[time=979] But, Rich, you're an elder. Yeah, I am, but I'm a sinner.
[time=983] Rich, you're preaching today. Yeah, I am, but I'm a sinner.
[time=988] And you know what? Some day soon, I hope there's going to be a man who's going to stand here whose job it is to be our lead pastor.
[time=996] I don't know who he is, but I'll guarantee you this.
[time=998] He is a sinner redeemed by grace.
[time=1003] Just because you stand here doesn't make you any different.
[time=1008] We are sinners, and today, we get to talk about sin in Genesis 4.
[time=1013] It's really important when, in education, I'm an educator, it's really important that you have English teachers teach English, and you have math teachers teach math, and science teachers teach science.
[time=1023] That makes sense to us, right?
[time=1025] So, if you want to teach about sin, you ought to have a sinner do it.
[time=1030] That's why they chose me. See, Paul said, I am the chief among sinners.
[time=1036] That's only because he never met me.
[time=1039] Amen, and he's never met you, right?
[time=1043] All right, so we're going to talk about sin today.
[time=1046] I hope you've enjoyed our study through the book of Genesis, I have.
[time=1050] It's good to return to the beginning to make sure that we understand exactly what God teaches, especially in a time when the world is trying to change what God teaches,
[time=1060] and to make application for us in the year 2015.
[time=1063] I thank Dr. Radha for his teaching and his insights.
[time=1068] The last time we saw our first couple, the only first couple,
[time=1074] God had just removed them from the Garden of Eden because of their disobedience and sin.
[time=1081] Today, we get to take a look at our first experiences outside of the Garden, and our narrative begins with a happy story.
[time=1088] The happy news to Adam and Eve are going to have a family.
[time=1092] Now, I've always wondered this. Have you ever wondered this?
[time=1096] How did they react to the pregnancy?
[time=1099] They were created as fully functioning adults, right?
[time=1103] So, how did Eve announce to Adam she was pregnant?
[time=1107] How did that go for them?
[time=1110] I have always wondered that.
[time=1112] How did they handle the baby bump, right?
[time=1115] I really wondered that.
[time=1117] There are a lot of questions I want to ask when I get to heaven, but I want to ask that.
[time=1122] When we experienced pregnancy, my wife always said, "I'm creating a peanut butter and banana sandwich." And then I knew we were going to have another baby.
[time=1132] That was awesome. I wonder how Eve did that to Adam.
[time=1135] That's a commercial. That's just what I think sometimes.
[time=1139] Let's take a look at a family snapshot.
[time=1143] In verse 1 of chapter 4, Adam knew his wife, and she conceived in Borkane and said, "I have acquired a man from God." They're excited about having this child, and all of us when we have children, we get excited, and we look at them, and we think about the wonderful and amazing things that they're going to accomplish in their lives.
[time=1161] And we have this preconceived path that we want them to travel.
[time=1165] Don't we admit it because it's true.
[time=1167] They're going to be an all-ay honors student, and they're going to get a full ride scholarship to college to play golf or football or whatever.
[time=1175] We have that preconceived notion.
[time=1177] Adam and Eve had the same view of Cain, the same hope,
[time=1183] but they took it to another step.
[time=1185] See, Adam and Eve thought Cain was the Messiah.
[time=1190] Why?
[time=1191] Jump back to chapter 3 in verse 15.
[time=1194] In verse 14 and 15 it says, "I will put enmity," and this is where God is proclaiming the curse on the snake or the serpent or Satan.
[time=1202] He says, "I will put enmity between your seed and her seed."
[time=1209] What he's telling him is that Satan, your descendants, those who are ungodly unbelievers, sinners, I will put strife between you and her seed.
[time=1221] Her seed was the Messiah.
[time=1223] So, we know that Adam and Eve were fully functioning adults, and they had to be intelligent.
[time=1228] You know how you know how to be intelligent?
[time=1229] I can tell you.
[time=1230] I know the answer.
[time=1231] They were never exposed to the common core.
[time=1233] They weren't.
[time=1234] Okay.
[time=1235] I'm sorry.
[time=1236] Bad teacher joke.
[time=1238] Okay.
[time=1239] So, they were intelligent beings and Eve, that registered with her.
[time=1242] Yes.
[time=1243] The seed.
[time=1244] My seed.
[time=1245] Now I have this son.
[time=1246] Here's my seed.
[time=1247] I've got him.
[time=1248] This is the one that's going to defeat Satan.
[time=1250] It's going to defeat the serpent.
[time=1252] And that's the view they had for Cain.
[time=1256] See, Eve thought she was holding the Messiah, but she was really holding, was a killer.
[time=1264] She didn't know that.
[time=1267] Fortunately, God blessed them again, and they had another son by the name of Abel.
[time=1271] And then in verse two, we learn what their occupations were.
[time=1273] They were going to become farmers.
[time=1275] Abel was going to raise sheep and Cain was going to be a killer of the soil.
[time=1281] I grew up a farmer.
[time=1283] That's tough work.
[time=1284] Good work.
[time=1285] Good, honest, wholesome work being a farmer.
[time=1287] And that's the occupation that they've chosen.
[time=1292] Well, Dad was a farmer.
[time=1293] They stayed in the family business.
[time=1296] We see the agriculture and the domestication of animals started very early with humans.
[time=1302] But at some point in time, as we learn in verses three to five, it came time to worship.
[time=1307] In verse three, and in the process of time, it came to pass that Cain brought an offering of the fruit of the ground to the Lord.
[time=1314] Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and their fat and the Lord respected Abel in his offering.
[time=1319] But he did not respect Cain in his offering, and Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.
[time=1325] We have two guys.
[time=1326] They're coming to offer something to the Lord, to make an offering.
[time=1331] Dr. David Jeremiah, who was a previous pastor of our church, he says Cain and Abel reflect every person's choice regarding how to approach the Almighty God.
[time=1343] Two guys, two different types of worship.
[time=1347] Let's evaluate their choices and the difference in their worship.
[time=1351] First of all, Abel offered the best of his flock and God respected him.
[time=1357] Abel was careful to make sure that his offering, that he offered something in according to God's terms and his instructions, because ultimately, Abel was trying to please the Lord.
[time=1368] Abel was going to worship God, he wanted to please God.
[time=1372] And Cain are able offered a blood sacrifice, and we know if we jump ahead into the Bible into Hebrews, we know that blood was required for the forgiveness of sin.
[time=1383] Hebrews 922 sells us, and according to the law, almost all things are purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood, there is no remission or forgiveness of sin.
[time=1394] So Cain was making an offering that he knew would please God, or that he was trying to do the best he could to please God.
[time=1403] Cain, on the other hand, Cain wasn't really concerned about pleasing God.
[time=1410] See, Cain's offering, he offered some of his produce, but God did not respect his offering, because Cain's offering was about him.
[time=1418] Cain's offering was all about Cain doing it his way.
[time=1423] At the crossroads, Cain's at the crossroads.
[time=1428] I can be obedient, and I can offer the way God wants us to, or I can follow sin.
[time=1434] Cain chose sin.
[time=1436] Cain chose to be disobedient to God.
[time=1441] You know, a lot of people have discussions about the type of offering that was made, whether it was a grain offering, a blood sacrifice, and I really don't think it matters.
[time=1451] I mean, we really don't, because I think Cain could have offered anything, but the problem wasn't what he was offering.
[time=1457] His heart was so bad, his heart was evil, and because his heart was evil, his offering would not have been accepted, because he had no intention of trying to please the Heavenly Father.
[time=1468] He did not offer the proper heart, and so to him, it became sin.
[time=1474] See the difference in their offerings was faith.
[time=1479] And that's a condition of your heart.
[time=1483] It's not a condition of what you offer, it's a condition of your heart, your faith.
[time=1489] That was the difference in their offerings.
[time=1492] We know this because we'll use a supplemental passage.
[time=1495] If you don't know what a supplemental passage is because that's kind of a big word sometimes.
[time=1499] A supplemental passage is another passage of Scripture that we can use to help us understand the one we're studying.
[time=1507] Okay?
[time=1508] So we'll use a supplemental passage back in Hebrews.
[time=1512] Hebrews chapter 11 verse 4, "By faith able offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain."
[time=1520] There it is.
[time=1521] By faith, Cain's offering was through faith.
[time=1530] I'm sorry, Abel's offering was through faith.
[time=1532] Cain's was faithless, and that was the difference of their offerings.
[time=1539] I believe that Cain's offering was probably more aesthetically pleasing.
[time=1543] I mean, have you seen a really nice fruit platter or vegetable platter?
[time=1547] Aren't they beautiful?
[time=1548] They really are.
[time=1549] If you go into a party and there's this big fruit platter and this big vegetable platter, they're really pretty.
[time=1554] I don't like to eat them, but they're still really pretty to look at.
[time=1558] I'm all about the meat.
[time=1560] Yeah, there you go.
[time=1562] Okay?
[time=1563] Now, picture this.
[time=1564] We've got the table out in front of us, and we've got a fruit platter, a vegetable platter,
[time=1570] and a slaughtered lamb, which one looks better?
[time=1573] You know, I mean, that would be more aesthetically pleasing.
[time=1576] If you look at the lamb and Brother Rick Raber would say, "That is a blessed mess." But here's the thing.
[time=1585] Man looks on the outward appearance.
[time=1589] God looks at the heart.
[time=1592] God was more interested in the condition of the boy's hearts than their presentation.
[time=1601] That needs to ring true with us today.
[time=1606] When we worship, we have to bring the best we've got.
[time=1609] We have to do our best to worship and honor the God.
[time=1612] Don't just go through the motions.
[time=1614] That's what Cain did.
[time=1615] He went through the motions.
[time=1617] Throughout history, there have always been two types of worshipers.
[time=1621] Those who desire to meet God on his terms and those who practice something else.
[time=1627] Those who desire to please the Lord and those who don't.
[time=1631] There's no middle ground there.
[time=1633] There's no grades of this.
[time=1635] Either your heart is pure to worship the Lord or it's not.
[time=1641] How's your heart today for worship?
[time=1645] See Abel did his best to please to worship God.
[time=1650] Cain was just going through the motions.
[time=1652] Abel's offering was made out of a heart of faith.
[time=1656] Cain's was made out of a faithless heart.
[time=1659] Alan Ross quoted it says, "People with a living faith make it their desire to please God.
[time=1666] They come before God with their gifts, not because it is a duty to perform,
[time=1672] but because they know that they need God and need to acknowledge that He is the source of all life and goodness."
[time=1680] When I wake up in the morning on Sunday, I had to have a passion to go worship the Lord.
[time=1688] I ought to have a passion to worship the Lord on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[time=1693] Everything that I do is an expression of my worship to the Lord.
[time=1698] And I ought to be excited for that.
[time=1701] Not just going through the motions.
[time=1703] Man, when I was in high school, I went through the motions.
[time=1705] I was really good at motions.
[time=1707] I knew all the right verses and I knew all the right songs just saying and I knew all the right Christian ease to speak.
[time=1715] Amen, you know that? Okay, my heart wasn't there.
[time=1719] My heart wasn't there until God renovated it.
[time=1723] Okay, we have to have a heart pure worship.
[time=1727] See, Cain faced a crossroad, a sin crossroad.
[time=1734] He chose disobedience and that began his sin spiral.
[time=1740] The very first line in your outline there for the sin spiral starts with Cain's disobedience
[time=1746] and that's how sin starts for us.
[time=1748] It starts with disobedience.
[time=1751] And once we've disobeyed, now we're at a position where God will meet us.
[time=1757] God met Cain.
[time=1764] Cain offered an unacceptable sacrifice and rather than falling humbly on his knees asking for forgiveness for his disobedience.
[time=1772] And his offering was rejected by God.
[time=1775] He took another step down that path and he became angry.
[time=1781] And his countenance fell and we read about that in verse 5, Cain's anger.
[time=1787] See, God met him where he was because God shows up in verse 6.
[time=1794] Why are you angry?
[time=1796] Why is your countenance fallen?
[time=1798] God is there.
[time=1800] God is there with Cain giving him the opportunity to repent.
[time=1804] Now as a parent, we have three children and our children were not perfect growing up.
[time=1810] And sometimes they would make a bad decision or a bad choice.
[time=1814] And I knew that and my wife knew that.
[time=1817] All right, we didn't look at them and say you did something bad.
[time=1820] You did something wrong.
[time=1822] Sometimes I would just go sit by them.
[time=1826] We just have a conversation.
[time=1828] We'd be talking.
[time=1829] What am I waiting for?
[time=1831] I'm waiting for them to say, Daddy, I messed up.
[time=1836] Daddy, I shouldn't have done this.
[time=1839] Daddy, I'm in a mistake.
[time=1841] I said something I shouldn't have said.
[time=1843] That's what I'm waiting for.
[time=1844] I'm putting myself in proximity to them to give them the opportunity to repent.
[time=1850] That's what God's doing for Cain.
[time=1852] God didn't come down and said, Cain, you know what?
[time=1855] You need to repent for that bad offering.
[time=1858] He didn't do that.
[time=1860] God came to Cain and said, why are you angry?
[time=1865] Why is your countenance fallen?
[time=1867] Countenance is your face or your facial expressions.
[time=1870] We all know people who we can read their face, can't you?
[time=1873] You know, right?
[time=1874] You know that.
[time=1876] God says, why is your countenance fallen?
[time=1879] If you do well, if you're obedient, will you not be accepted?
[time=1884] And if you do not do well, just sin lies at the door and its desire is for you.
[time=1890] Now, I'm not a linguist, so I'm not really up on the original languages, but I read about this part.
[time=1897] And when it says that sin lies at the door, that could be translated,
[time=1903] crouching, like the devil or the demon is crouching at the door, ready to jump and take you over.
[time=1910] And then God says, but you should rule over it.
[time=1915] You should rule over it.
[time=1917] We have to rule over sin.
[time=1919] We prevent sin from ruling over us by allowing God to master us first.
[time=1926] Without God as our master, we will be slaves to sin.
[time=1931] So when you are at that crossroad of sin and you're making decision on whether or not you're going to be obedient to God, or you're going to follow sin,
[time=1942] when you are at that crossroads, you have to master sin.
[time=1948] And if you've not mastered sin, if God is not your master at that point in time,
[time=1954] sin will lead you.
[time=1960] That's what happened to Cain.
[time=1962] Sin had mastered Cain.
[time=1964] And he began his spiral.
[time=1968] His sin spiral.
[time=1973] Rather than falling humbly on his knees and asking for forgiveness for his disobedience, and sin, Cain sets out to plot against his brother.
[time=1985] And we read about Cain's premeditated murder in Genesis 4, verse 8.
[time=1993] See what Cain did.
[time=1995] He was angry.
[time=1996] He had made a bad decision.
[time=1998] He was angry.
[time=1999] And now he was going to get back at the person he could get back at.
[time=2003] He couldn't get back at God, but he could get back at his brother.
[time=2006] And so he chose to set out to murder his brother.
[time=2010] So he takes him, wraps his arm around him.
[time=2012] Let's go out and let's go look at the crops.
[time=2014] He's into a great day.
[time=2015] He's in a beautiful day.
[time=2016] He got out where nobody else was around, and he murdered his brother.
[time=2020] He thought that would solve his problems.
[time=2022] It's because he up to this point, no human had ever died.
[time=2028] This was the first recorded death of a human.
[time=2031] It's also the first recorded murder in the Bible.
[time=2034] Cain was the first one to murder someone.
[time=2036] He murders his brother.
[time=2038] Cain didn't realize that people could be murdered or people would die eventually.
[time=2043] He didn't realize that.
[time=2044] All he saw was the way that they would sacrifice animals.
[time=2047] And so he chose to sacrifice his brother, not on an altar, but he chose to kill him.
[time=2053] Because that's what they would do with animals.
[time=2056] Sin.
[time=2057] He entered the sin spiral, and he was getting to the bottom.
[time=2061] One little act of disobedience became anger, became murder.
[time=2069] If I was in charge at that point in time, I'd have said sorry about your luck, Cain.
[time=2073] I was struck him down right there, but God is merciful.
[time=2078] God is merciful, and God met him again.
[time=2086] God said, where's your brother Abel?
[time=2091] Where's your brother Abel?
[time=2093] Do we think God did not know where Abel was?
[time=2096] No.
[time=2097] This is not once again a geographical question like Dr. Rowda talked about last week.
[time=2101] It's not a geographical question.
[time=2103] This is a question reflecting Cain's heart.
[time=2108] And God wants to give him that opportunity to come forth and say, Father, I messed up.
[time=2116] I killed my brother, but Cain chose not to.
[time=2120] Again, a decision to be disobedient became anger, became murder, became a lie.
[time=2130] Became disrespect towards God.
[time=2135] God said, where's your brother Abel?
[time=2139] Cain says, I don't know.
[time=2141] Am I my brother's keeper?
[time=2143] I don't know.
[time=2144] There's the lie.
[time=2145] Am I my brother's keeper?
[time=2147] That's disrespectful.
[time=2149] Parents, you know this one, don't you?
[time=2153] Whatever, like I'm supposed to know, middle school principal, I've heard them all.
[time=2162] Okay?
[time=2163] Yeah.
[time=2164] Disrespect.
[time=2166] The spiral continues for Cain.
[time=2169] He can't get out of it.
[time=2173] God engaged Cain one more time to give him the opportunity to repent and Cain chose not to.
[time=2180] Cain chose the lie.
[time=2181] How futile is it for Cain to lie?
[time=2185] How senseless, pointless is it for Cain to lie?
[time=2189] You can't lie to God.
[time=2191] How senseless is it for us to lie?
[time=2194] We have in our hearts.
[time=2196] Now, be honest with yourself.
[time=2199] I'm at the crossroads of sin.
[time=2201] I have the chance to be obedient, but I choose sin.
[time=2204] And then I take another step down in sin.
[time=2207] And I take another step down in sin, but I dress really nice and go to church.
[time=2212] Right?
[time=2213] And all this time inside of us, inside of us is a lie.
[time=2219] We're living out that lie.
[time=2221] But you guys don't see that.
[time=2224] But God does.
[time=2225] He sees it all the time.
[time=2227] And just like when I would be sitting on the couch next to my son or daughter, and we would be talking and I've been waiting for her or him to repent, God is sitting right next to
[time=2238] you, waiting to have you repent.
[time=2242] It's all of us, every one of us.
[time=2246] Just because I'm wearing a suit and tie doesn't mean I'm perfect.
[time=2250] I'm a sinner.
[time=2253] Just because you work in church ministry.
[time=2256] You're a sinner.
[time=2257] Just because you play the piano like Darren and sing really well.
[time=2261] Darren's a sinner.
[time=2263] Right, Darren?
[time=2267] We're all sinners.
[time=2269] But we are sinners saved by grace.
[time=2273] And here's the thing.
[time=2275] If we deny that, if we deny that or downplay that, we are believing one of the biggest lies
[time=2284] Satan has for us.
[time=2288] We're sinners saved by grace.
[time=2292] That's what makes being a Christian.
[time=2295] Awesome.
[time=2298] Well, you know what?
[time=2301] Cain continued down that sin spiral.
[time=2304] And it got to the point where God said, okay, I'm going to give you over to your sin.
[time=2308] Here we go.
[time=2309] Let's take a look at God's judgment in Genesis 4 to 10.
[time=2314] God says, what have you done?
[time=2316] The voice of your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground.
[time=2319] And here's the judgment.
[time=2320] So now you are cursed from the earth, which is open its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
[time=2325] Then you will, till the ground, it shall no longer yield a strength to you.
[time=2330] A fugitive and a vagabond you shall be on this earth.
[time=2335] Dear brothers and sisters, get out of your sin spirals.
[time=2341] Return to the Lord, because we don't want the Lord casting judgment like this upon us.
[time=2349] Because see, the curse on Cain, who was a farmer like Dad, was Adam's curse amplified.
[time=2358] Adam, if bringing forth food from the ground for Adam was going to be more difficult because
[time=2366] of sin, it was going to be impossible for Cain.
[time=2370] If Adam was evicted from the garden of Eden, Cain would have nowhere to live and to be safe.
[time=2380] Nowhere.
[time=2382] God amplified the original curse to Adam for his son.
[time=2387] And how does Cain respond?
[time=2389] Does he drop to his knees and repent?
[time=2393] Now he plays the victim.
[time=2398] My punishment is greater than I can bear.
[time=2402] Donald Barnhouse says, one of the consequences of sin is that it makes the sinner pity himself
[time=2409] instead of causing him to turn to God.
[time=2412] One of the first signs of new life is that the individual takes sides with God against
[time=2420] himself.
[time=2424] One of the first signs of a new life is that the individual, me, takes sides, I'm on God's
[time=2431] side, against myself and recognize my sin.
[time=2436] But that's not what Cain does.
[time=2439] Cain plays the victim.
[time=2442] Cain pities himself.
[time=2446] Interesting thing.
[time=2447] Let's take a look at God's judgment real fast.
[time=2449] God said to Cain, you are a curse from the earth.
[time=2452] He said, you are a fugitive in a vagabond that you shall be on the earth.
[time=2456] That's what God said.
[time=2458] Cain recognized that God had cursed him from the earth.
[time=2462] Cain recognized that he would be a fugitive in a vagabond.
[time=2465] But Cain added something to this.
[time=2470] He said, I shall be hidden from your face.
[time=2475] Did God say that?
[time=2477] No, Cain did.
[time=2478] Where have we seen that before?
[time=2480] Where have we seen someone try to change God's words?
[time=2484] Back in Genesis chapter 3.
[time=2490] Again, we see someone trying to change God's words.
[time=2493] See, we know Cain would have been forgiven.
[time=2496] Cain could have been forgiven if he had repented.
[time=2500] It doesn't mean that he would have lost his consequences, but he would have been forgiven for his sins.
[time=2505] God met him each step along the way and said, here I am.
[time=2509] Waiting for you to repent.
[time=2511] If Cain would have repented, he would have been forgiven.
[time=2516] But rich murder is really, really bad.
[time=2519] I know.
[time=2520] I agree.
[time=2522] But God met him there waiting for his repentance.
[time=2527] Matthew chapter 1231, you feel like you can't be forgiven for your sins?
[time=2533] Listen to this verse.
[time=2535] "Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against
[time=2543] the Spirit will not be forgiven men." Verse 32, "Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man," that's Jesus, "it will be
[time=2552] forgiven him, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come." Cain's murder could have been forgiven if he would have repented.
[time=2566] I don't know what your sin spiral leads to.
[time=2569] I know what mine leads to.
[time=2571] I don't know what your sin crossroads leads to, but I know this.
[time=2575] God will forgive you if you ask.
[time=2579] But we get proud, don't we?
[time=2582] And we think we've got to fix us before we can be forgiven and approach God.
[time=2589] That's not the way God does business.
[time=2591] God met Cain every step along the way, from the disobedience to the anger, to the murder,
[time=2599] to the lie, to the disrespect.
[time=2602] God met him there and waited for him to repent, and Cain chose not to.
[time=2608] And that is when God marked him.
[time=2617] We go on in verse 15 and God placed a mark on Cain so that if anyone were to try to kill
[time=2623] him, that God's wrath would be sevenfold.
[time=2626] I don't know what your mark is.
[time=2629] Maybe you're marked.
[time=2631] Maybe your mark is that you've sin entered your life and ultimately you lost a job or
[time=2637] lost a career.
[time=2640] Maybe your mark is broken relationships with your kids.
[time=2645] Maybe you look back and say, "Well, if I would have done this, if I would have been this, maybe your anger got out of control to the point where you've lost that trust with your children." I don't know.
[time=2656] Maybe you lost your reputation because of sin that entered your life.
[time=2664] Divorce.
[time=2665] I have friends who are divorced.
[time=2666] And I'll tell you what, if you talk to them, they can follow a path back to sin on somebody's
[time=2674] part that led to that.
[time=2678] And now they're marked.
[time=2680] They feel marked.
[time=2683] God loves you.
[time=2685] God forgives all.
[time=2692] I don't know what mark is at the bottom of your sin spiral, but you do.
[time=2698] Let's jump ahead a little bit in the chapter and let's look at Dad and Mom.
[time=2701] We also refer to Adam and Eve by their names, Adam and Eve.
[time=2704] But remember, in this chapter, they're Dad and Mom, right?
[time=2707] And they have experienced a ton of pain.
[time=2710] Let's relive their pain life.
[time=2713] They were evicted from their first home, paradise, because they did not keep the rental agreement.
[time=2719] They got booted.
[time=2722] That's no good.
[time=2725] They brought the plague of sin into all humanity.
[time=2727] Let that one settle in for you.
[time=2730] They brought the plague of sin to all humanity.
[time=2734] Their first child was wicked evil.
[time=2738] And he killed the second child.
[time=2740] How much pain are Adam and Eve in?
[time=2743] They got to feel like they're downtrodden.
[time=2747] But you know what?
[time=2751] God meets them there.
[time=2755] Kids.
[time=2756] And we're all kids.
[time=2757] If you have a parent, you're a child, right?
[time=2760] Our decisions and choices impact our parents and our family.
[time=2764] We may think we live in an independent vacuum, but that's not the truth.
[time=2769] It impacts your family, the ones you love.
[time=2772] So be aware of that.
[time=2775] Because it's heartbreaking for a parent to watch their children flounder and sin.
[time=2785] It is heartbreaking to watch that, understand the actions of Cain impacted Adam and Eve.
[time=2797] But you know what?
[time=2798] God visited them right where they were.
[time=2802] Verse 25, "Adam knew his wife again, and she bore him a son and named himself."
[time=2808] God blessed them and gave them another son.
[time=2811] For God has appointed another seed for me instead of Abel whom Cain killed.
[time=2817] Interesting twist in there.
[time=2818] Notice that Eve recognizes Abel as the seed.
[time=2823] Who was the firstborn child?
[time=2825] It was Cain, wasn't it?
[time=2827] That was the firstborn child, but she recognized Abel as the seed.
[time=2831] So sometime during their lives, Adam and Eve must recognize Cain was evil and transferred
[time=2838] that birthright, if you will, to Abel.
[time=2843] Maybe mom knew.
[time=2845] Let's take a look at another supplemental passage in 1 John 3.
[time=2850] Maybe mom knew this.
[time=2853] In 3 verse 10, "In this, the children of God and the children of Devar manifest it, whoever
[time=2859] does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.
[time=2864] For this is the message that you heard from the beginning that we should love one another, not as Cain who was of the wicked one and murdered his brother.
[time=2875] And why did he murder him?
[time=2876] Because his works were evil and his brothers were righteous.
[time=2880] Cain was evil.
[time=2882] Adam and Eve knew that and they decided, "Hey, our seed is going to go through Abel."
[time=2889] Same twist of words there.
[time=2894] Verse 26, "And as for Seth, to him also was born, and he named him Enosh.
[time=2899] And then men began to call in the name of the Lord." There's joy right there for mom and dad.
[time=2905] They have a son who has a son, and because of them, men are repenting and turning to
[time=2911] the Lord.
[time=2912] That's joy.
[time=2914] As much as parents agonize over their children floundering in sin, they rejoice when we are
[time=2923] honoring God.
[time=2926] And that's what, that's the roller coaster that Adam and Eve got to ride.
[time=2931] All right, we just got a few minutes left, how about some lessons for life?
[time=2936] Realize that every one of us have sin crossroads in our lives.
[time=2939] Every one of us, no one in this room is immune from that.
[time=2943] All of us have a crossroad in our life of sin, where we can make a decision to be obedient to God or obedient to sin.
[time=2951] Every one of us has a sin crossroad.
[time=2956] We know that because Romans 3.23 says, "For all have sinned, for all have sinned and fall
[time=2964] short of the glory of God." He made a choice to be a disobedient, what about you at your crossroad?
[time=2974] And when you do make a mistake, or you do fall into sin, what does God want you to do?
[time=2982] God wants us to simply, or humbly, repent and restore fellowship.
[time=2987] When we make the wrong decision, and we step over here towards sin, God's not going to throw you out with the water at that point, He's like pulling you back.
[time=2996] That's why you have the Holy Spirit prompting your heart and leading you back to Him.
[time=3000] He wants to bring you back into His fellowship.
[time=3003] And we know that because 2 Peter chapter 3 verse 9 says, "The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, has some count slackness, but is long suffering toward us, not willing that
[time=3013] any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."
[time=3019] God wants you.
[time=3021] He wants you.
[time=3023] Come to Him.
[time=3025] Recognize if we continue in sin.
[time=3027] If we continue in sin, God will give us over to that.
[time=3031] A couple verses for you there, Psalm 81-11, "But my people would not heed my voice, and Israel wouldn't have none of me, so I gave them over to their own stubborn heart to walk in their own counsel." Romans 1-24, "Therefore God also gave them up to their uncleanness, in the lust of their hearts, to dishonor their bodies among themselves, who exchanged the truth of God for a lie,
[time=3054] and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator." God will give us over to our sin, and that's where the mark comes from.
[time=3064] If we continue in sin, remember sin will lead to death.
[time=3068] Sin will lead to death.
[time=3070] Romans 6-23, "For the wages of sin is death.
[time=3074] Sin has a death that has to be paid, and that debt can only be paid with death."
[time=3080] And notice in that verse it doesn't say, "Ridges sin, or Ron's sin."
[time=3086] It says sin.
[time=3088] All sin.
[time=3090] The wages of sin is death.
[time=3092] We like to play this game as Christians, "My sin is not as bad as yours."
[time=3099] Look at that guy over there.
[time=3100] His sin is worse than mine.
[time=3102] The verse says, "The wages of sin is death."
[time=3110] And so when God forgives me for my sin, don't I have an obligation to forgive you for yours?
[time=3118] Do I have that obligation?
[time=3121] All I do, Matthew chapter 6-15 makes that very clear.
[time=3130] Basically says, "If you forgive others, I'll forgive you.
[time=3134] If you don't forgive others, not forgiven you." Whoa!
[time=3141] But his sin was so much worse than mine.
[time=3144] I don't care.
[time=3145] If you didn't kill somebody, God was ready to forgive him.
[time=3151] Doesn't matter what your sin is, God will forgive you.
[time=3155] It doesn't matter what somebody else's sin is.
[time=3158] God will forgive them, and you should forgive them too.
[time=3162] Christians should be the most forgiving people in the world.
[time=3165] We should be looking for reasons to forgive people in ways to forgive people.
[time=3170] We should say, "Man, I forgive you.
[time=3172] You wrong me.
[time=3173] I forgive you.
[time=3174] God forgave me.
[time=3175] Let's be a forgiving people." See, God is in the heart business.
[time=3182] He cares about your heart.
[time=3184] I love this line.
[time=3185] I think it's the last line on your outline.
[time=3189] God wants 100% of your heart, 100% of the time for the rest of your life.
[time=3197] Jesus is our example.
[time=3198] He gave 100% of His Himself to pay the penalty for 100% of our sins forever.
[time=3204] Now's your heart.
[time=3206] Here's a better question.
[time=3209] Who has your heart?
[time=3211] If you pursue this, it will change you radically.
[time=3217] It will change your passions, your interests, your approach to worship, your approach to serving, your giving.
[time=3223] Really?
[time=3224] 100% of my heart for my giving?
[time=3225] Absolutely.
[time=3226] Here's the thing.
[time=3227] Giving is not a fundraiser.
[time=3231] Giving is a reflection of your obedience.
[time=3234] Giving is a demonstration of your dependence on God and not yourself.
[time=3241] Giving is not a fundraiser, giving is obedience.
[time=3247] It'll change your forgiveness of others and your whole outlook on life.
[time=3252] Refuse to have the heart of Cain.
[time=3254] When you come to a sin cross road, choose obedience.
[time=3258] During times when you may take a step toward sin, God is there.
[time=3261] He wants to forgive and bring you back.
[time=3264] Go back to Him.
[time=3265] Don't fall in the sin spiral.
[time=3268] He will forgive you if you seek Him.
[time=3271] And remember, we're required in Matthew 6, 15 to forgive others.
[time=3277] Are you ready to choose obedience?
[time=3281] To seek His forgiveness and turn back to God and away from sin?
[time=3286] Lizzy and Darren are going to come.
[time=3290] And we have some elders in the room.
[time=3292] If you're ready, if you are ready to take that step, if you are ready, Lizzy is going to sing a song called "Lord, I'm Ready Now." You are ready to turn your life over to Christ or to have Him forgive you so that you can
[time=3307] get out of your sin spiral.
[time=3309] We'll have some elders down here.
[time=3312] Please come.
[time=3314] It's not a show.
[time=3317] It's not a contest.
[time=3319] It's just Christians being real with themselves and understanding that God requires us to come
[time=3328] to Him.
[time=3330] Gives us the opportunity to come to Him so that we can be forgiven.
[time=3334] Lord, I'm ready now.
[time=3340] I don't let go and I feel exposed, but it's so beautiful, because this is who I am.
[time=3368] I have been such a mess, but now I can't care less, so we'll lead to death.
[time=3385] Lord, I'm ready now, hold the walls are down, time is running out, and I want to make this
[time=3398] count.
[time=3399] I ran away from you, and I did what I wanted to.
[time=3405] I don't want to let you down, Lord, I'm ready now, Lord, I'm ready now.
[time=3417] I was so caught up in who I'm not, can you please forgive me?
[time=3440] Lord, I'm ready now, hold the walls are down, time is running out, and I want to make this
[time=3458] count.
[time=3459] I ran away from you, and I did what I wanted to.
[time=3464] I don't want to let you down, Lord, I'm ready now, Lord, I'm ready now, there's nothing left
[time=3476] to hide, no reason left to lie, and give me another chance, Lord, I'm ready now.
[time=3493] All my walls are down, time is running out, and I want to make this count.
[time=3503] I ran away from you, and I did what I wanted to.
[time=3511] I don't want to let you down, Lord, I'm ready now, Lord, I'm ready now.
[time=3522] Lord, I'm ready now, Lord, I'm ready now.
