[time=130] All these pieces broken and scattered.
[time=140] In mercy gathered, meant that an old.
[time=146] And he handed, but not forsaken.
[time=152] I've been set free.
[time=159] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound.
[time=165] And save the rest like me.
[time=171] I once was lost, and now I'm down.

[time=210] [MUSIC]
[time=220] Take our failure, you take our weakness.
[time=226] You set your treasure in times of pain.

[time=476] How great of pain of searing loss.
[time=482] The father turns his face away.
[time=488] As losers find the chosen one.
[time=493] Prepared his sons to glory.
[time=508] Behold the men upon the cross.

[time=530] It was my sin that held him there.

[time=585] I should.
[time=587] I give all his people.
[time=590] I cannot give an answer.
[time=596] But this I know with all my heart.
[time=601] His wounds have been my ransom.
[time=606] Why should I give all his people?

[time=895] [APPLAUSE]
[time=900] The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth.
[time=905] And that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
[time=910] The Lord regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart.
[time=915] So the Lord said, "I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land.
[time=921] Man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens.
[time=926] For I am sorry that I have made them, but Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord." These are the generations of Noah.
[time=934] Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation.
[time=937] Noah walked with God, and Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
[time=944] Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight, and the earth was filled with violence.
[time=948] And God saw the earth, and behold it was corrupt, for all the flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.
[time=955] And God said to Noah, "I have determined to make an end of all the flesh, for the earth is filled with violence through them.
[time=963] Behold, I will destroy them with the earth. Make yourself an ark of gopher wood.
[time=968] Make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch.
[time=972] And this is how you are to make it, the length of the ark, 300 cubits, and its breadth, 50 cubits, and its height, 30 cubits.
[time=982] Make a roof for the ark, and finish it to a cubit above, and set the door of the ark in its side.
[time=989] Make it with lower, second, and third decks. For behold, I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh,
[time=997] in which the breath of life under heaven.
[time=1001] Everything that is on the earth shall die, but I will establish my covenant with you,
[time=1007] and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you.
[time=1015] And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark to keep them alive with you.
[time=1023] They shall be male and female, of the birds according to their kinds, and of the animals according to their kinds,
[time=1031] of every creeping thing of the ground according to its kind.
[time=1035] Two of every sort shall come into you to keep them alive.
[time=1040] Also, take with you every sort of food that is eaten and stored up, it shall serve as food for you and for them.
[time=1047] Noah did this, and he did that all that God commanded him.
[time=1052] And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, "The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every bird of the heavens,
[time=1062] upon everything that creeps on the ground, and all the fish of the sea, into your hand they are delivered.
[time=1069] Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you, and as I gave you the green plants I give you everything.
[time=1076] Be shall not eat flesh with its life, that is its blood, and for your life blood I will require a reckoning.
[time=1084] From every beast I will require it, and from man.
[time=1088] From his fellow man I will require a reckoning for the life of man.
[time=1093] Whoever sheds the blood of man by man shall his blood be shed for God made man in his own image.
[time=1101] And you be fruitful and multiply, increase greatly on the earth and multiply it, then God set to Noah into his sons with him.
[time=1111] Behold, I establish my covenant with you and your offspring after you,
[time=1117] and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the livestock, and every beast of the earth with you,
[time=1124] as many came out of the ark, it is for every beast of the earth.
[time=1129] I establish my covenant with you that never again shall all the flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood,
[time=1137] and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth."
[time=1145] Good morning. Please open your Bibles to Genesis chapter 6, and let's look at what the Bible has to teach us about God's grief, God's judgment, and God's grace.
[time=1162] Last week, Rich so masterfully showed us how, after Adam and Eve sinned, this sin spread.
[time=1170] There was a downward spiral, and in chapter 4, we saw the first homicide in history.
[time=1177] Not just the first homicide, the first fraticide, the first brother killing an own brother.
[time=1185] And the Bible shows us that the spiral of sin continues to such an effect, that in chapter 6, verse 6,
[time=1193] we read that the Lord regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart.
[time=1205] Certain versions say, "And the Lord was sorry that he had made man on the earth."
[time=1215] But let's start in verse 1, please.
[time=1219] When the man began to multiply on the face of the land, and daughters were born to them, the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were attractive, and they took as their wives any they chose.
[time=1231] So chapter 6 starts with an interpretive difficulty.
[time=1237] Who are these sons of God?
[time=1242] The expression of sons of God appears elsewhere in scripture in the Old Testament,
[time=1248] and they usually refer to angels.
[time=1252] So some people believe that these were fallen angels that come and have sexual relations with women.
[time=1262] Church fathers such as Clement of Alexandria and Nemesis of Emesa suggested these, and some have said that.
[time=1271] However, Jesus, when he talks about marriage in heaven, says this in Matthew 22.30,
[time=1279] "For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels in heaven."
[time=1288] According to Jesus, angels cannot have sexual relations with anybody.
[time=1297] But I heard a view that actually these are aliens.
[time=1303] Whenever he doesn't fit, you just say, "Okay, aliens or UFOs, right?"
[time=1310] There are many views out there.
[time=1313] I, in my humble but correct opinion...
[time=1319] I can't be wrong on this one.
[time=1322] I believe that this represents the line of Seth.
[time=1327] Remember after Cain, remember as Rich said last week, he was not the Messiah as they thought, he was actually evil.
[time=1341] The Sethites, the other descendant of Adam and Eve, represents the godly line.
[time=1351] It seems that the Sethites were marrying the descendants of Cain.
[time=1359] Where in Wiersby explains, "When the Sethites compromised by mingling with the Cainites, they fell from God's blessing.
[time=1368] God was grieved that they married Godless Cainites, choosing wives as they pleased without considering God's will."
[time=1377] Martin Luther, the German reformer and John Calvin also believed this view.
[time=1383] I have to say though, I might be wrong.
[time=1387] And if that's the case, it would not be the first or the last time.
[time=1393] But what is important to see is that whatever is happening here, the sin is spiraling down to such an effect that God is sorry for creating humanity.
[time=1406] This is 6 verse 3, "Then the Lord said, 'My spirit shall not abide in man forever, for his flesh, his day shall be 120 years.'"
[time=1417] 120 years there does not talk about the longevity of people, because we know after the flood people lived longer than 120 years.
[time=1427] So 120 years refers to the time left for the human race until the flood comes.
[time=1435] That's what 120 years represents.
[time=1437] And then verse 4 introduces us to another difficulty, the Nephilim.
[time=1443] The Nephilim were on the earth in those days and also afterward when the sons of God came into the daughters of men and they bore children to them.
[time=1454] They were the mighty men who were of all the men of renown. This word, the Nephilim, occurs one other time in the Bible in Numbers, Chapter 13, verse 33.
[time=1466] When it refers to the Anakim, people of great stature, some of your Bible's column giants.
[time=1477] Now remember the context. Moses is writing this as the children of Israel are going towards the Promised Land.
[time=1485] And when they get into the Promised Land, they will be tempted to intermarry with pagans, right?
[time=1492] What God is trying to show them, look, nothing good can come between a godly and ungodly union.
[time=1500] These are not here by accident. And also yet they will encounter these giants, these strong men of renown.
[time=1509] But God wants them to understand that no matter how big those people are, God is still in control.
[time=1515] And God is going to give them victory. So whatever is happening here is not by accident.
[time=1522] God is the one who's in control even though humanity seems continually looking, verse 5.
[time=1529] The Lord saw that the wickedness of men was great in the earth.
[time=1534] And that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
[time=1540] In Genesis 1 and 2, we saw that God says he was good, right? He was good, he was good, he was very good.
[time=1550] And now it says it's not good. It's not good.
[time=1560] All the thoughts of his heart was evil continually.
[time=1565] My dear brothers and sisters, the Bible teaches us that our problem is a heart problem, a heart problem.
[time=1575] Every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
[time=1579] The scholars develop this into the theology of total depravity.
[time=1584] And we can understand that we are not basically good, but we are basically evil.
[time=1591] We are not born good. We are born in sin, David says.
[time=1597] This is very important because that's an important starting point for anything.
[time=1602] If you show up before God and you say, "God, I'm basically good, God can't do anything with that."
[time=1609] But if you come to him and say, "Lord, have mercy on me a sinner," then he can take that and turn into a great man and woman of God.
[time=1618] The idea that they were basically evil is from the beginning of Genesis 3 and then continues to Genesis 4, 5, and here we see in verse 6, the key verse here in verse 6.
[time=1630] The Lord regretted or was sorry that he had made men on the earth and it grieved him to his heart.
[time=1636] We see a window into God's heart.
[time=1641] Contrast that with the human heart, full of evil, God's heart is pained by our sin.
[time=1650] God's heart is pained, but he also has a plan.
[time=1655] The Bible says that God judges sin.
[time=1659] So the Lord said, "I will blot out men whom I have created from the face of the land, men and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them."
[time=1672] Well, Tiberius, I thought God is loving and merciful.
[time=1676] He is.
[time=1678] But God is also holy, righteous and just.
[time=1682] And he must punish sin.
[time=1685] It's not a different God.
[time=1687] It's the same God.
[time=1689] God is loving and merciful, but God is also holy, righteous and just.
[time=1693] And he must punish sin.
[time=1695] And in his justice, he says, "I will blot out men whom I have created." Verse 11 elaborates on this corruption of men.
[time=1704] Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight and the earth was filled with violence.
[time=1709] The word for violence, Hamas.
[time=1713] Have you heard of Hamas anywhere in the news?
[time=1717] Yes, it's the name of the terrorist Palestinian organization, Hamas.
[time=1721] It means violence.
[time=1724] And the Bible says here that the whole earth was filled with violence.
[time=1730] Verse 13, God said to Noah, "I have determined to make an end of all flesh for the earth is filled with violence.
[time=1737] Through them, behold, I will destroy them with the earth." And verse 17, God tells us how he will do it.
[time=1744] "Behold, I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life under heaven.
[time=1750] Everything that is on the earth shall die." Basically what we have here is a reversal of creation.
[time=1758] It's a reversal of creation. God created everything.
[time=1760] It was very good, but now God says, "I am going to de-create.
[time=1766] I am going to undo my creation. I am going to destroy it." Verse 17, "Everything that is on the earth shall die."
[time=1777] Look at me in chapter 7, please. It shows us how God did it.
[time=1783] In the 600th year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the 17th day of the month,
[time=1789] on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth and the windows of the heavens were opened and rain fell upon the earth 40 days and 40 nights.
[time=1798] So the Bible says that the flood happened not just because of the rain, but also water came from above and water came from beneath.
[time=1808] Skeptus tells us that we could not have had so much water.
[time=1813] Really? Isn't the whole earth like 70% water?
[time=1821] Starting in verse 19 of chapter 7, "And the waters prevail so mightily on the earth." I want you to count with me the number of times the word "all" appears.
[time=1834] Starting in verse 19.
[time=1837] "And the waters prevail so mightily on the earth that all the high mountains under the whole earth were covered.
[time=1843] The waters prevail above the mountains covering them 15 cubits deep.
[time=1847] And all flesh died to the movement on the earth.
[time=1850] Birds, livestock, beasts, all swarming creatures, the swarm on the earth, and all mankind."
[time=1857] Everything on the dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died.
[time=1861] He blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground.
[time=1865] Man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, they were blotted out from the earth.
[time=1870] Only Noah was left.
[time=1872] And those were within the ark, and the waters prevailed on the earth 150 days.
[time=1881] Would you say that that's a day that lives in infamy?
[time=1885] Yeah, we think about December 7, 1941.
[time=1890] And we think about September 11, 2001.
[time=1894] But I would say that day God destroyed the earth.
[time=1898] That was a day that lived in infamy.
[time=1901] And if the story would end there, it would be a sad story, but it doesn't end there.
[time=1906] Because God is the God of grace, and God gives grace.
[time=1911] Oh, I love verse 8, "But Noah." Noah says, "But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord." These are the generations of Noah.
[time=1921] Noah was the righteous man, blameless in his generation.
[time=1924] Noah walked with God.
[time=1927] Notice, please, it doesn't say, "Noah earned grace."
[time=1934] It doesn't say that, does it?
[time=1936] It doesn't say that Noah worked for his grace, does it?
[time=1941] It says, "Noah found grace." Grace was bestowed upon Noah by God himself.
[time=1951] Bible says here that he was righteous.
[time=1954] This is the first time in the Bible, the word "righteous" occurs.
[time=1959] It's your right standing before God, blameless in his generation, the Bible says,
[time=1965] which teaches us a very important concept in biblical theology.
[time=1970] That God will always have a righteous remnant that will be saved.
[time=1976] Notice, it doesn't say that God will save everybody.
[time=1979] That's universalism.
[time=1981] It doesn't even say that God will save most people.
[time=1986] Jesus says, "Noah, narrow is the way."
[time=1992] And narrow is the gate that leads to salvation.
[time=1995] It's not right, it's narrow.
[time=1997] We will always be in the minority, my dear brothers and sisters.
[time=2001] Only is the Bible says that Jesus says that in here we have the same thing.
[time=2005] Out of everybody, only eight people were saved.
[time=2010] What a difference between Noah and Adam.
[time=2013] Adam walks away from God.
[time=2015] He tries to hide from God.
[time=2017] Noah walks with God.
[time=2023] What a difference.
[time=2028] My dear brothers and sisters, this is the first point of application for us.
[time=2033] Are we walking with God, or are we walking away from Him?
[time=2040] There's no middle of the road.
[time=2043] Are we walking with God every day, or are we walking away from Him?
[time=2048] I'm reminded of the old Him, and He walks with me, and He talks with me, and He tells me I am His own.
[time=2055] And the joy we share as we carry there none other has ever known.
[time=2061] One was the last time you experienced that.
[time=2066] Or you say, "My life is too busy to do that." No, no, no.
[time=2071] Noah is presented as a righteous man, blameless, obedient, walking with God, and the book of Hebrews tells us how he was able to do that, chapter 11 verse 7 in Hebrews, "By faith Noah, being learned by God concerning events, yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household.
[time=2095] By this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith." Noah is such so remarkable that when God wants to brag about His people, He chooses three people in history.
[time=2110] Noah, Job, and Daniel.
[time=2115] Top three, not bad, huh? Top three.
[time=2118] Not bad, Ezekiel 14, 13, 14, son of man.
[time=2122] When a land sins against me by acting faithlessly, and I stretch out my hand against it, and break its supply of bread and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast.
[time=2132] And even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, they would deliver, but their own lives by their righteousness, declares the Lord.
[time=2144] And God says to Noah, "Make yourself an ark of gopher wood, make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside with pitch."
[time=2156] This is a rendition of how the ark would have looked in comparison with the Boeing 747.
[time=2165] As you can see there, you have, I think, a giraffe down at the bottom, and then you have some dinosaurs.
[time=2175] What is amazing about this ark is that the captain was God, but the designer was also God.
[time=2183] Aren't you glad God is not asking Noah to, "Hey, sit down and design a boat for me." Oh, God gives him the instructions how to build it.
[time=2194] Starting in verse 18 of chapter 6, God says, "I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you, and of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark to keep them alive with you.
[time=2212] There shall be male and female of the birds, according to their kinds, and of the animals, according to their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground, according to its kind.
[time=2223] Every search shall come in with to you to keep them alive." Did you see that?
[time=2229] No, I didn't have to go catch them.
[time=2235] They will come to you.
[time=2239] God is still in control.
[time=2242] Also, take with you every sort of food that is eaten and store it up.
[time=2245] It shall serve as food for you and for them.
[time=2250] Very besides the story of creation, no story is more ridiculed than Noah's ark.
[time=2256] And skeptics and liberals tell us this could not have happened.
[time=2260] This could not have happened.
[time=2266] I quote from our friends that answers in Genesis, "One commonly raised problem is how could Noah fit all those huge dinosaurs on the ark?"
[time=2276] Didn't you ask yourself that? Someone asked you that, didn't they?
[time=2281] Here's what the answer.
[time=2283] First, of the 668 supposed types of dinosaur, only 106 weighed more than 10 tons when fully grown.
[time=2293] Second, the Bible does not say that the animals had to be fully grown.
[time=2298] The largest animals were probably represented by teenage or even younger specimens.
[time=2303] It may seem surprising, but the median size of all animals on the ark
[time=2309] would most likely have been that of a small rat.
[time=2313] Only about 11% would have been much larger than a sheep.
[time=2320] Whenever you watch Jurassic Park or all those nice shows about dinosaurs,
[time=2327] Noah didn't have to take on the ark the biggest and the baddest dinosaurs.
[time=2332] All he had to do was take 2 dinosaurs.
[time=2336] Is it possible that dinosaurs became extinct after the flood?
[time=2342] Have animals become extinct since the flood all the time?
[time=2347] All the time.
[time=2349] According to the Bible, dinosaurs were created on day 6, like every other land animal.
[time=2356] And Noah had to take some sort of animals with him on the ark, even of the dinosaur type.
[time=2366] How many of you have been to the Grand Canyon?
[time=2369] Some scholars suggest that the Grand Canyon is a great proof or lesson of the great flood.
[time=2380] I'm not a scientist, no their son of a scientist, so I'll let you watch this video clip
[time=2387] from our Friends of Answers in Genesis.
[time=2390] Dr. Andrew Snelling, who has appeared in geologists explains some reasons why the flood,
[time=2397] not just happened, was a global flood, and that we have evidence of it all over the world.
[time=2402] Take a look at this video clip.
[time=2409] What are some of the best flood evidences?
[time=2413] If the flood really did occur, what evidence would you look for?
[time=2417] You know, most people haven't even thought of that question, let alone thought of an answer.
[time=2421] You know, the Bible says that the fountains of the Great Deep were open, the rain fell from heaven for 40 days and 40 nights, the waters rose, 150 days until all the high hills under the hole of the heaven were covered and the mountains were covered.
[time=2435] We're told that all land-dwelling air-breathing life perished except for those on the earth.
[time=2439] Wouldn't we expect to find billions of dead plants and animals buried in rock layers laid down by water over the earth?
[time=2445] And that's exactly what we find.
[time=2447] Billions of dead things called fossils buried in rock layers laid down by water over the earth.
[time=2451] But let's expand on that.
[time=2453] Let's look at six of the best evidences for the flood.
[time=2456] Evidence number one, sea creatures buried high in mountains on the continents.
[time=2460] That's right, marine creatures that live on the ocean are found in mountains like the Himalayas.
[time=2466] How did they get there?
[time=2468] Unless the ocean waters rose up over the continents.
[time=2471] And we find marine creatures in rock layers all over the continents everywhere around the world.
[time=2476] Evidence number two, we'd find rapidly buried plants and animals.
[time=2482] What we do, fossils, we find fossils not only of plants, but of bees, of bats, we find fish
[time=2488] that haven't finished having their breakfast eating another fish they're buried in fossilized.
[time=2493] Icthea saws giving birth to babies and they're fossilized.
[time=2497] We find delicately preserved fossilized jellyfish.
[time=2500] How do you fossilize a jellyfish slowly?
[time=2503] Evidence number three, rapidly deposited sediment layers right across the continents.
[time=2509] We find that everywhere we look, look at the Red Wall limestone, full of fossils in the Grand Canyon.
[time=2515] Yet the same limestone layer is found in the same position over in Pennsylvania.
[time=2520] Then over in England, and even in the Himalayas, the chalk beds, the white cliffs of Dover.
[time=2527] We find the same chalk beds in Europe, in the Middle East, over into Kazakhstan.
[time=2532] We find the same chalk beds with the same fossils in Texas and the Midwestern United States.
[time=2537] We find the same chalk beds in Western Australia.
[time=2540] The coal beds of Pennsylvania and West Virginia are also found in England and Europe right across to the Ural Mountains.
[time=2548] Evidence number four, long transport distance of sediments.
[time=2553] The coconino sandstone in the Grand Canyon, the sand grains are believed to have been eroded and washed from it far north as at least Wyoming.
[time=2562] The Navajo sandstone in Zion National Park, those huge white cliffs, the sand grains are believed to have been eroded and washed all the way from the Appalachians right across North America.
[time=2575] Evidence number five, rapid or no erosion between sediment layers.
[time=2581] Again, in terms of the coconino sandstone and the hermit shell, there's a knife-edge flat, featureless boundary between those two rock layers.
[time=2591] For mile after mile through the Grand Canyon, yet the geologists claim that there's 10 million years missing at that boundary.
[time=2597] What would have happened during 10 million years of weathering and erosion?
[time=2600] You'd get a topography, not a flat, featureless boundary.
[time=2604] The bottom of the Grand Canyon, the topite sandstone sits on the pre-flood rocks and we have evidence of huge erosion there,
[time=2612] with boulders being picked up from the underlying rock layers indicating rapid erosion.
[time=2618] Evidence number six, we find whole rock layer sequences deposited rapidly in quick succession.
[time=2625] Look at the walls of the Grand Canyon from the topites at the bottom to the kibab limestone at the top,
[time=2632] supposed to be representing 300 million years of slow and gradual sedimentary deposition.
[time=2638] When the plateau was pushed up, those rock layers were bent and folded, but they were folded without fracturing.
[time=2646] They had to be soft if they were bent without fracturing.
[time=2651] That means that they could only have just of being deposited, but that means the 300 million years never happened.
[time=2659] All those rock layers had to be rapidly deposited in quick succession during the flood year.
[time=2664] So you see when you ask the right question, you get the right answers.
[time=2668] Who are we going to believe? The scientists who weren't there, who don't know everything, who sometimes make mistakes, or the word of God who was there, who saw what happened and told us what happened during the flood.
[time=2679] And what we see in God's world agrees with what we read in God's word.
[time=2685] Amen, I apologize for His accent.
[time=2691] Apparently He's from Australia or somewhere like that.
[time=2695] I love verse 22, look in chapter 6 verse 22, "Noah did this, he did all that God commanded him."
[time=2704] Notice it doesn't say, "Noah did most of what God commanded him." "Noah did all that God commanded him." My dear brothers and sisters, the main characteristic of a man over a woman of God is obedience.
[time=2718] Full obedience. And I love about this text that it doesn't stop there.
[time=2725] God re-creates. If through the flood God de-creates.
[time=2731] If the flood is a reversal of creation and the creation order, God comes and re-creates.
[time=2740] Verse 1 in chapter 8, "But God remembered Noah and all the beasts of old and all the livestock that were with him in the ark.
[time=2750] And God made a wind blow over the earth and the waters subsided." Notice, please, it is God that takes the initiative.
[time=2758] It says, "God remembered Noah." And here it doesn't mean that God somehow forgot about Noah.
[time=2766] In the Bible, when we read that God remembers, it means that he fulfills a promise made on behalf of someone.
[time=2777] This is not the only time that occurs, by the way.
[time=2780] We read this in other places in Scripture where God remembers his promises.
[time=2787] In chapter 30, verse 22, "God remembered Rachel and God listened to her and opened her womb."
[time=2797] God doesn't forget. When it says God remembers, it is to fulfill a promise.
[time=2809] Isn't it like us sometimes to think that God forgot about us?
[time=2815] We've been praying and we've been a pastor for over a year and we think that God forgot about Blackhawk.
[time=2824] But that's not the kind of God I read about in the Bible.
[time=2827] I read about a God who remembers his people.
[time=2831] And you have to believe that and you have to pray like that and say, "God, remember us."
[time=2838] Not that you forgot about us, but you have a plan for us, fulfill that plan for us.
[time=2845] Pray about that.
[time=2850] It appears in conjunction with Abraham. God remembers Abraham in chapter 19.
[time=2858] Like Noah, we need to wait patiently on God.
[time=2862] Chapter 8, verse 4, "In the seventh day of the Mount of the Ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat."
[time=2870] Now, I wish I could tell you that Indiana Jones found the Ark of the Covenant.
[time=2875] I know some of you are bombarded with emails saying that they found the Ark and we have pictures and proofs and all that.
[time=2882] These are the same people who major in minors.
[time=2888] They look for the Ark of the Covenant but they miss the presence of God.
[time=2893] Do you think if they find the Ark of the Covenant, do you think that people will all of a sudden believe?
[time=2900] Jesus says even if someone raises from the dead, they still won't believe.
[time=2905] Don't believe archaeological evidence will show anybody that God exists or that His word is true.
[time=2911] No!
[time=2913] Jesus says if they do not hear Moses and the prophets neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead.
[time=2924] God said to Noah, "Go out from the Ark, you and your wife, your sons and your sons' wives with you."
[time=2931] And I like Noah's response, verse 20, "Then Noah built an altar to the Lord and took some of every clean animal and some of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar."
[time=2942] The proper response before God is worship.
[time=2946] And that's what Noah does.
[time=2948] Noah wants to worship God.
[time=2950] See, but this was not the first time.
[time=2952] Noah worshiped God before the storm and now Noah worshiped God after the storm.
[time=2957] And we are asked to do the same thing and we're even asked to worship God through the storm as we sing.
[time=2971] God not only recreates but He blesses chapter 9 verse 1.
[time=2977] God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply and feel the earth."
[time=2985] Verse 1, we have the blessing.
[time=2988] Be fruitful, multiply and feel the earth.
[time=2991] And verse 3, we have the provision.
[time=2994] Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you and as I gave you the green plants I gave you everything.
[time=3002] It does seem from these verses that until now humans were vegetarians.
[time=3009] Remember I made some type of jokes some Sundays ago.
[time=3013] The vegetarian is an ancient word for bad hunter, remember that?
[time=3019] It does seem from these verses that until now humans were vegetarians.
[time=3024] And now God says, now I give you everything.
[time=3028] See in chapter 1 verse 29 God says, "Behold I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth.
[time=3037] And every tree you would seed in its fruit you shall have them for food.
[time=3040] But after the flood in chapter 9 verse 3 God gives humans the right to eat animals as well.
[time=3047] Every moving thing that lives shall be for food for you.
[time=3050] As I have given the green plants I give you everything.
[time=3055] But according to that comes the prohibition.
[time=3058] So some of you might have to consider how you grill your meat.
[time=3062] Verse 4 says, "You shall not eat flesh with its life, that is its blood."
[time=3069] No comment on how you eat the rare steak.
[time=3072] Okay, verses 5 and 6, "And for your life blood I will require a reckoning.
[time=3077] From every beast I will require it and from man.
[time=3080] From his fellow men I will require a reckoning for the life of man.
[time=3083] Whoever sheds the blood of man by man shall his blood be shed for God made man in his own image."
[time=3092] So the death penalty is not instituted by the American law system.
[time=3099] The capital punishment, the death penalty was not instituted by some pastors who got together and said,
[time=3105] "Let's impose this on the people." The death penalty was not even imposed by Moses on Poland to the people.
[time=3112] The death penalty was established by God himself back in Genesis chapter 9
[time=3118] and his reasoning for it is because God has made in his image.
[time=3125] And then God makes a covenant with Noah.
[time=3129] Genesis 9 verses 9, 3, 11, "Behold I establish my covenant with you and your offspring after you.
[time=3135] And with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the livestock and every beast on the earth, with you as many as come out of the ark it is for a beast of the earth.
[time=3143] I will establish my covenant with you that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood
[time=3149] and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth." My dear brothers and sisters, this is very, very important.
[time=3157] Because if this was not a global universal flood, God is a liar.
[time=3164] Because God did destroy other people through local floods, he is the flood, right?
[time=3171] But here he says, "I will never destroy it like I did back then." So the Genesis flood was a universal flood that covered all the earth and destroyed everybody
[time=3182] and it's very clear from the establishment of this covenant.
[time=3187] Never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood.
[time=3194] I will establish my covenant with you and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons and your wives with you.
[time=3203] Not only that, but God gives the sign of the covenant, the rainbow.
[time=3208] Isn't that beautiful?
[time=3210] The rainbow is God's sign of the covenant.
[time=3216] So whenever you see the rainbow, you should think about God's promises and how God is faithful to his promises.
[time=3224] But see, I also have there a hunting bow.
[time=3227] Because in Hebrew the word for rainbow is the same word for the hunting bow.
[time=3233] Basically what God says, "I'm going to take my hunting bow that was now until now directed towards you and I destroy the earth.
[time=3240] I'm going to take it, I'm going to hang it up in the sky, and that's going to be my rainbow now."
[time=3246] I'm not going to destroy you anymore.
[time=3248] It's a visual picture of what God is doing.
[time=3250] He's taking his hunting bow and putting it up in the sky.
[time=3254] That's the sign of my covenant with you.
[time=3256] Whenever you see it, you shall remember that I keep my promises and that I will never destroy the earth by the flood again.
[time=3266] Some people have hijacked the rainbow.
[time=3270] I want you to bring back the meaning of the rainbow.
[time=3273] Whenever you see it anywhere, remind people of God's faithfulness.
[time=3278] Remember that God is not just the God who creates, but he's a God who can de-create and a God who can recreate.
[time=3286] I like what some of what a scholar says about the rainbow.
[time=3292] We see that God is a God of beauty.
[time=3295] God makes signs of beauty to say, "I know the life is filled with tragedy.
[time=3300] Sin is ugly, but I am a God of beauty.
[time=3303] I am the God who is able to overcome these things and I call you away from them to myself."
[time=3312] How do we apply the truth?
[time=3315] First of all, if you are a believer, look for the rainbow of God's promises.
[time=3322] As you go through your own storms of life, remember the promises of God.
[time=3329] And remember, just like Noah was dependent on God, we have to stay dependent on God always.
[time=3335] And even if you go through storms and through trials, we need to remember that God will always be faithful.
[time=3344] Like Noah, we need to be true worshipers.
[time=3348] If he lived today, probably, Noah would have been called a fossil himself.
[time=3355] He would have been called politically incorrect.
[time=3358] He would be called intolerant.
[time=3360] He would be called bigoted.
[time=3362] And whatever else you'd be called, but he was a faithful and true worshipper.
[time=3367] Be that.
[time=3369] Be a woman and a man of integrity who says what he means and means what he says.
[time=3376] We need more men and women like Noah in this case.
[time=3381] And for those of you who are not yet believers, don't miss the boat.
[time=3385] And what I mean by that, back then, God provided an arc, a boat for the salvation of eight people.
[time=3393] By about 2,000 years ago, God erected another wooden edifice.
[time=3397] It's called the cross.
[time=3401] The boat, the arc only saved eight people, but the cross can save many, many more.
[time=3410] Don't miss that boat.
[time=3413] Nobody here will be saved because Noah's faith.
[time=3417] We are saved because what Jesus Christ has done on that cross 2,000 years ago.
[time=3422] Don't miss that boat of salvation.
[time=3424] Listen to the words of Jesus who says as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
[time=3431] In those days, before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the arc, and they were unaware, until the flood came and swept them away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
[time=3445] This morning, to prepare you, not to be not prepared, there is another judgment coming.
[time=3453] Let me ask you, will it be local?
[time=3455] Or will it be a universal judgment?
[time=3458] Universal, just like the first one.
[time=3461] But you have a way of escape, not through an arc, but through the cross of Jesus Christ.
[time=3467] He who has the Son has life, but he who does not have the Son of life shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides in him.
[time=3476] As Darren and the choir come and sing, we will have elders here that will pray for you if you want to pray to receive Christ as your Lord and Savior.
[time=3484] But don't miss the boat.
[time=3486] Let us pray, dear Father, we thank you, for man like Noah.
[time=3492] I pray that you forgive us when we do not live righteously, and we do not live patiently and obediently.
[time=3500] And I pray that you will teach us what it means to be true worshipers, not just on Sunday, but on Monday and on Wednesday, and every day of the week.
[time=3508] May we obediently follow and worship you.
[time=3514] I pray for those who are not yet believers, that today will be the day of salvation, that today they will come and cling not to a boat, but to your cross.
[time=3523] And they will accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.
[time=3526] Pray they take away their sins and give them eternal life and forgiveness of sin.
[time=3531] In Christ's name I pray. Amen.
