[time=169] In Christ alone, my hope is found.
[time=175] He is my life, my strength, my soul.
[time=180] This corner's stone, this solid ground.
[time=185] What do the ferns is strong and strong?
[time=190] What heights of love, what depths of peace?
[time=196] When tears are still, when striving sees, my comfort, my own in awe.
[time=207] Here in the love of Christ, I stand.
[time=212] [MUSIC - 539 seconds]
[time=781] >> Let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its tops in the heavens and let us make a name for ourselves lest we be dispersed all over the face of the whole earth.
[time=795] And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of man had built.
[time=803] And the Lord said, "Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do.
[time=814] And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them.
[time=819] Come, let us go down and there confuse their language so that they may not understand one another's speech.
[time=829] The Lord dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth and they left off the building of the city.
[time=838] Therefore its name was called Babel because there the Lord confused the language of all the earth.
[time=846] And from there the Lord dispersed them over the face of all the earth.
[time=852] [MUSIC - 10 seconds]
[time=869] >> No wonder how alone I was feeling and the emptiness I tried so hard to hide.
[time=883] Though I left and said my life was fine without you.
[time=891] I was covering up the secret tears I cried.
[time=898] Then one day someone told me of your mercy.
[time=906] And the love you showed upon a hill called Calvary.
[time=912] There you died and purchased my redemption.
[time=920] When you broke since power and said my spirit free.
[time=927] I'm amazed as you loved me.
[time=934] I'm amazed how you came through your precious blood.
[time=945] I've come burning and my sins are washed.
[time=953] There all washed away all my sins are washed away.
[time=964] [MUSIC]
[time=978] >> Yes it's true there have been days when I've failed you.
[time=985] Lord you know the many times I've gone astray.
[time=992] But I've learned your love is stronger than my weakness.
[time=1000] And your ear is open every time I pray.
[time=1006] No one else has ever cared for me like you.
[time=1014] Other friends could never be as close to me.
[time=1021] I'm not afraid to face the problems of tomorrow.
[time=1028] Knowing you are everything I'll ever need.
[time=1036] I'm amazed how you loved me.
[time=1043] I'm amazed how you came through your precious blood.
[time=1054] I've come burning and my sins are washed.
[time=1062] There all washed away all my sins are washed away.
[time=1072] I'm amazed how you came through your precious blood.
[time=1083] I've come burning and my sins are washed.
[time=1098] There all washed away all my sins are washed away.
[time=1109] I'm amazed how you came through your precious blood.
[time=1130] I've come burning and my sins are washed away.
[time=1138] I'm amazed how you came through your precious blood.
[time=1144] There all washed away all my sins are washed away.
[time=1151] I'm amazed how you came through your precious blood.
[time=1158] I've come burning and my sins are washed away.
[time=1165] Good morning.
[time=1170] Please open your Bibles to Genesis chapter 11.
[time=1175] Thank you, Doug and Darren and the choir for leading us in that great, great song.
[time=1183] Is that good news? Our sins are washed away.
[time=1186] We don't have to live with that burden on our shoulders anymore.
[time=1191] If you're here this morning and your sins are still heavy on your shoulders.
[time=1197] I'm here to tell you there's good news.
[time=1200] Today can be the day of salvation and you can do away with those.
[time=1204] Jesus can take them all away and that's the good news of the gospel.
[time=1209] We are in a series called the Gospel Project.
[time=1213] It's a series in which we look at both the Old and the New Testaments and we started in September and we are in Genesis 11.
[time=1224] We started in Genesis 1 and because of that I was asked to do a little review
[time=1231] of what we've studied so far before I get into the text for today.
[time=1238] The Book of Genesis can be divided into two parts.
[time=1243] The Book of Genesis can be divided into many parts but one way it can be divided is to divided into two, chapters 1 through 11, the beginning of history
[time=1255] and chapters 12 through 50, the history of the patriarchs.
[time=1260] Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and actually the Jews also have Joseph as one of the upright patriarchs.
[time=1272] So today what we're going to do is we're going to get to chapter 11 and then go into chapter 12.
[time=1277] We're going to go from the first part to the second part.
[time=1281] But in the first Sunday I was here we talked about how in Genesis 1 God created the universe in six days.
[time=1295] God reveals himself as the powerful God who creates not just the universe but he creates humanity.
[time=1303] Now he creates the animals with animal instinct and we saw that he created humans differently.
[time=1310] We are created in the image of God, different, rational, spiritual, moral beings.
[time=1321] Notice, please from the beginning humanity they're not cave men and women grunting
[time=1329] and trying to figure out what to say, what to do.
[time=1333] No, no, God creates them as moral, spiritual, rational beings.
[time=1338] God can talk to them and they can talk back to God.
[time=1345] While God created humanity in his image he also created humanity with free will.
[time=1352] In chapter 2 God places Adam and Eve in a garden and gave him a choice.
[time=1360] The Lord commanded men saying you may surely eat of every tree of the garden but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
[time=1366] you shall not eat for in the day you eat of it you shall surely die.
[time=1374] Notice, please Adam and Eve don't say we don't really understand God what you're telling us.
[time=1381] No, no, no, no.
[time=1382] They are created in his image and they know exactly what God is asking and requiring of them.
[time=1389] And not only does God create Adam and Eve and puts him in a garden and gives him free will but he creates the institution of marriage.
[time=1399] There are two institutions that God creates, marriage and the church.
[time=1405] And only one will last forever.
[time=1408] The marriage lasts until death do us part and the church will last forever.
[time=1414] But it's very important to see from the beginning of Genesis that this marriage that God institutes,
[time=1421] it's to be covenantal, monogamous and heterosexual.
[time=1428] God does not allow for anything else.
[time=1431] When Jesus comes to earth and the Pharisees want to know if they can divorce their wives,
[time=1437] Jesus says from the beginning it was not so.
[time=1442] If you want to know what God wants of us when it comes to marriage we have to go back to the beginning.
[time=1450] And the beginning clearly says that God creates Adam and Eve to be in this relationship that is again covenantal, monogamous and heterosexual.
[time=1461] Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife and they too shall become one flesh.
[time=1470] That is God's design from the beginning.
[time=1474] But then we get to chapter three. In chapter three we see that humans disobeyed and rebelled.
[time=1483] God says you may eat from all the trees of the garden, but from this one you shall not eat and that's exactly from the one they chose to eat.
[time=1493] God did not predesten them to sin, to say that to make God the author of sin.
[time=1502] God gave them a free will and they chose to disobey and rebel against God.
[time=1510] And because God is not just loving and merciful he is also holy righteous and just God punishes their sin.
[time=1517] And we saw that in chapter three, but also we see that God gave grace.
[time=1523] The Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins and clothed them.
[time=1528] Not only gave them clothes to wear, he gave them a promise.
[time=1534] Genesis 3.15 we call this the first gospel message.
[time=1539] I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and her offspring. He shall bruise your head and you shall bruise his heel.
[time=1548] And we saw how this is the first gospel message that points towards the coming of Jesus Christ who will come to defeat the works of Satan.
[time=1556] And that's exactly what Jesus came to do.
[time=1559] That's why there is no salvation in anyone else but the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=1565] And so this is called the gospel project because we have to preach the good news from the beginning of Genesis until the end of Revelation.
[time=1573] The good news does not start in Matthew 1, it starts in Genesis 1.
[time=1579] Then we saw the consequences of sin.
[time=1583] Rich showed us how this sin spread and we have the first homicide in history, the killing of a man by another man.
[time=1594] And the first frater side in history, the killing of a man by his own brother.
[time=1600] And sin spreads. If you read chapter 5, it's no fun to read. It's really no fun to read.
[time=1608] But I ask you to go home and read it to see the bad news because you can't understand the good news unless you first understand the bad news.
[time=1618] And the bad news in chapter 5, we read over and over again and he lived and then he died.
[time=1625] He lived and then he died and he died and he died and he died and he died.
[time=1629] And we see that death is the consequence of sin.
[time=1635] And we saw last Sunday how God destroys the creation through the flood.
[time=1642] He de-creates, we can say, he de-creates and then he recreates.
[time=1651] By giving them the same grace and blessing that he gave Adam and if he gives to Noah.
[time=1660] Be fruitful, multiply and fill the earth.
[time=1664] That same blessing and command that he gave to Adam and he gives now to Noah and his descendants.
[time=1671] And then we get to chapter 11.
[time=1676] We get to chapter 11, but before we get to chapter 11 we actually have chapter 10.
[time=1682] See chapter 10 and chapter 11 go together.
[time=1686] But I also have to stop here and tell you that the Bible is not always written in chronological order.
[time=1693] We would like it for that to be that case, right?
[time=1696] Starting Genesis and I'm going to end the revelation and everything is chronological, right?
[time=1701] No.
[time=1702] Even in chapter 10 in 11 here they're not in chronological order.
[time=1707] Chapter 11 the one we're going to look at today shows us the cause of the dispersion.
[time=1714] And chapter 10 shows us the effect of this dispersion that God does in chapter 11.
[time=1720] So in chapter 10 we have what's called the table of the nations and it shows us how the descendants of Noah were scattered abroad after the incident at the tower of Babel.
[time=1734] So chapter 10 shows us the effect and then we're going to go back to chapter 11 to see the cause.
[time=1741] So the descendants of Noah are Shem, Ham and Jaffet.
[time=1748] So on this map you can see, you might see clearly or not so clearly,
[time=1755] but the descendants of Ham, Noah's, please, they're in green there.
[time=1760] They inhabit North Africa, the western coast of the Arabian Peninsula, the fertile crescent all the way from Egypt to Mesopotamia.
[time=1770] And then where towards Europe that's where we have the descendants of Jaffet.
[time=1776] They go all the way to present day Europe and then present day India.
[time=1783] So there is a split there. Jaffet goes northwest and northeast.
[time=1789] Then you have the sons of Ham and then you have the descendants of Shem.
[time=1795] These are the Semitic people.
[time=1798] They inhabit the region around the Persian Gulf today and it includes the people of God, Israel.
[time=1811] The Hebrews, the nation of Israel, come from the Semitic line.
[time=1817] And so if someone is anti-Semitic, they are against the Jewish people.
[time=1822] That's where this comes from, comes from the name of the descendant of Noah Shem.
[time=1828] This is very important to understand how the people will spread, but we are not told why they spread it until chapter 11.
[time=1836] And that's where we get to our text today.
[time=1840] We see that the people rebel just because God recreates, gives them another opportunity
[time=1848] to follow Him, doesn't mean they do that.
[time=1851] We see that they again rebel against God, chapter 11 starting in verse 3.
[time=1859] And they said to one another, "Come, let us make bricks and burn them thoroughly." And they had bricks for stone and bitumen for mortar.
[time=1866] They said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens."
[time=1873] And let us make a name for ourselves.
[time=1876] The last would be dispersed over the face of the whole earth.
[time=1881] First, let's see how their downfall begins.
[time=1884] It's basically in two stages.
[time=1887] First, they're ingenious and they make bricks.
[time=1891] Second, their initial success motivates them to build a city with a tower.
[time=1896] By the way, there's nothing wrong with being innovative.
[time=1900] There's nothing wrong with living in the city, by the way.
[time=1904] There's nothing wrong with that, generally speaking.
[time=1908] But we have to understand that back then, the cities were not places like here where people would live.
[time=1914] People would live in the country.
[time=1916] It was an agrarian society.
[time=1919] There was no industry, so to speak.
[time=1923] They lived in the villages where they tended their flocks and their work to the ground.
[time=1929] Cities were not places where one lived. Cities were places for public things and for worship.
[time=1938] If you wanted to go to the city, so to speak, you'd go because that's where the temple complex was,
[time=1945] and you wanted to go and meet with your gods because they were a polytheistic society.
[time=1954] Cities were for public and religious purposes.
[time=1958] The great German reformer Martin Luther suggests that the fact that this tower was to reach to Heaven's quote
[time=1964] should not be applied to the height alone, but rather should be seen as denoting that this was a place of worship.
[time=1973] See, four generations, they wanted people to say, "Oh, the great city that those guys built."
[time=1980] They wanted people to say, "Oh, what great technology. Oh, what great place we can see it from miles away."
[time=1988] By the way, we don't know how the tower of Babel looked like.
[time=1993] What we do know is that archaeologists have uncovered about 60 of these structures in the ancient nearest in the Middle East of today.
[time=2002] I had a student who was in the military, and he sent me not just pictures, but sent me videos of these places.
[time=2010] These things are called ziggurats.
[time=2013] Now, they look like an unfinished pyramid, doesn't it?
[time=2017] It looks like an unfinished pyramid.
[time=2020] Now, the pyramids in Egypt were tombs for pharaohs and their queens.
[time=2024] These ziggurats were not the same thing.
[time=2028] Actually, these places are filled inside. There are no rooms inside.
[time=2032] This is literally a stairway to heaven. Notice, please, the stairway aspect to it.
[time=2038] You're actually just going to supposed to be going up the stairways, and on top, there would be a room.
[time=2044] And they would set up the room there with chairs, tables, and even a bed.
[time=2049] And this is where you would go to meet with your gods.
[time=2054] It would be a place of worship.
[time=2058] They discovered this even in Ur.
[time=2061] Remember, Abraham was called from Ur of the Chaldeans.
[time=2065] God is calling Abraham from a polytheistic people, and this is, again, I'm not saying this is how the tower of Baba looked like.
[time=2073] I can tell you, it didn't look like the artist tried to portray it.
[time=2077] Like a real big skyscraper, or like a tower of peace that is not leaning that's straight.
[time=2085] They're probably reading a lot into it. We don't know how the tower of Baba looked like.
[time=2091] It could have looked like this, we don't know. The problem is with the motive of these people.
[time=2099] Let us make a name for ourselves lest we be dispersed over the whole face of the earth.
[time=2109] Pride, my dear brothers and sisters. Pride is their motivation.
[time=2114] They want to make a name for themselves.
[time=2118] But the Bible is clear about pride. Psalm 31, 23.
[time=2122] Love the Lord, all you sayings. The Lord preserves the faithful but abundantly repays the one who acts in pride.
[time=2130] Proverbs 8, 13. The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance.
[time=2136] And the way of evil, the perverted speech, I hate.
[time=2141] I like how Maxal Kato puts it, and I quote.
[time=2144] It says, "Why was the tower being built? Selfishness.
[time=2149] A hundred percent selfishness. The bricks were made of inflated egos and the mortar was made of pride.
[time=2156] Men were giving sweat and blood for a pillar. Why?" So that somebody's name could be remembered. We have a name for that.
[time=2165] Blind ambition. Blind ambition. Success at all costs.
[time=2171] Becoming a legend in one own's time. Climbing the ladder to the top.
[time=2175] King of the mountain. Top of the heap. I did it my way.
[time=2181] We make heroes out of people who are ambitious. We hold them up as models for our kids and put their pictures on the cover of our magazines.
[time=2189] Ambition is that grit in the soul which creates this enchantment with the ordinary and puts the dare into dreams.
[time=2196] But left unchecked, it becomes an insatiable addiction to power and prestige.
[time=2202] The growing hunger for achievement that devours people as the lion devours an animal living behind only the skeleton remains of relationships.
[time=2211] The classic examples of near-sighted tower builders come quickly to mind.
[time=2216] You'll recognize them perhaps too well.
[time=2219] The husband who feeds his career with 12 hour days, flight schedules and apologies for being gone so much.
[time=2226] But it's just a matter of time. I'll get my feel on the ground.
[time=2229] The social conscious mother of three who never misses a chance to serve on a committee or attend a luncheon.
[time=2235] It's all for a good cause, she fools herself.
[time=2238] I'll only need to do this once justifies the salesman as he lies about his product. Anything to get to the top of the tower.
[time=2245] Blind ambition. Distorted values. The result?
[time=2250] Rootless lives bouncing like tumbleweeds through ghost towns. Abandoned dreams, crumbling homes, wind-swept futures.
[time=2258] All with one thing in common, a half-finished tower that stands as a stirring epitaph to those who follow.
[time=2266] God won't tolerate it, Lecula writes.
[time=2269] He didn't then and he don't now. He took the climb to heaven campaigning to his own hands.
[time=2274] With one sweep he painted the tower grey with confusion and he sent workers babbling in all directions.
[time=2279] He took my man's greatest achievement and blew it into the wind like a child blows and that dillion.
[time=2287] Are you building any towers?
[time=2291] Examine your motives.
[time=2293] And remember the statement imprinted on the base of the wind-swept tower of Babel.
[time=2298] Blind ambition is a giant step away from God and one step closer to catastrophe.
[time=2305] What was wrong with what they wanted to do?
[time=2309] Not just the fact that they were prideful, they also the fact that actually they rebelled against God.
[time=2314] Remember God's command.
[time=2317] Be truthful, multiply and fill the earth.
[time=2321] And they said we don't want to fill the earth, we want to stay right here.
[time=2326] It's not just pride, it's pure, disobedience, it's pure, rebellion.
[time=2332] Notice please the language employed.
[time=2335] Verse 3, let us make bricks.
[time=2337] Verse 4, let us build ourselves a city.
[time=2340] Verse 4b, let us make a name for ourselves.
[time=2344] Alan Richardson writes, the hatred of anonymity drives men to heroic feats of valor or long hours of drudgery.
[time=2353] Or it urges them to spectacular acts of shame or of unscrupulous self-preformant.
[time=2360] And it's worse forms, attempts men to give the honor and glory to themselves which properly belongs to the name of God.
[time=2369] But just like before God intervenes, God is not allowing people to live in their rebellion and he intervenes
[time=2376] and he humbles and disperses these people.
[time=2381] Starting, I want to start in verse 5.
[time=2384] The Lord came down to see the city and tower which the children of men had built.
[time=2391] The children of men is literally the children of Adam, the children of Adam.
[time=2399] And I like verse 5 because there's irony here.
[time=2403] If you think the Bible is not funny, you're not reading enough.
[time=2408] The Bible says that they were trying to build a city that goes to heaven, right?
[time=2413] But God has to come and see you.
[time=2415] What are you guys doing over there?
[time=2418] I can't even see it.
[time=2420] I have to come down to see it.
[time=2423] Oh, there's great irony here.
[time=2426] They're trying to build a tower up to heaven, but God has to come down to see it because it's so puny.
[time=2434] The Bible is very, very funny.
[time=2436] We have to read the entire thing.
[time=2439] The signs of Adam, think that their tower will go to heaven, but the God of heaven needs to come down to look at it.
[time=2450] Verse 6, "And the Lord said, 'Behold, they are one people and they have one language, and this is the only beginning of what they will do,
[time=2456] and nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them.' I like what Kent Hughes writes, and I quote, "God was not threatened by humankind's corporate potential."
[time=2467] Oh, instead he was troubled what would happen to humanity if the human family was left unchecked.
[time=2475] Come, God says, let us go down, and they're confused their language so that they may not understand one another's speech.
[time=2486] And just like he acted in the case of Cain, just like he acted in the case of Adam and Eve, God acts again.
[time=2496] So the Lord dispersed them from there over all the face of the earth, and they left off building the city.
[time=2502] Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the Lord confused the language of all the earth, and from there the Lord dispersed them over the face of all the earth.
[time=2514] The children of Adam want to make a name for themselves, but they will be remembered by the word Babel.
[time=2522] We even have an English word, I had to look it up in the dictionary.
[time=2527] It means to speak, repeat oneself incoherently, to speak foolishly, to Babel.
[time=2538] Every time we say that word, we are reminded of Genesis 11, and what the people try to do, and we see what God does.
[time=2549] God humbles and disperses the people.
[time=2555] You see chapter 11 and chapter 12 go together, because in chapter 11, the people want to make a name for themselves.
[time=2565] But in chapter 12, God says to a man named Abram, I will make your name great.
[time=2570] See the name motif makes the bridge between the first part of Genesis 1 through 11 and 12 through 50.
[time=2578] This is a very important name, because we are actually looking now at the beginning of God's covenant with Abraham.
[time=2585] At this point he's not called Abraham, he's called Abram. Look at me in chapter 12.
[time=2593] Starting in verse 1.
[time=2597] Now the Lord said to Abram, go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you.
[time=2605] Remember, the Bible tells us that he lived in Ur of the Chaldeans.
[time=2609] He lives in the Mesopotamian valley where Sinai was, where the tower of Babel was built.
[time=2616] And God says, I'm going to take you from there, I'm going to show you a land where you will go.
[time=2622] And now listen to the three promises God makes to Abraham.
[time=2626] Again, now he's called Abram, later he will change his name to Abraham.
[time=2633] Verse 2 in chapter 12, I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great so that you will be a blessing.
[time=2644] There are three promises here in chapter 12.
[time=2648] First of all, God will make Abram a great nation.
[time=2654] The children of Adam at the tower of Babel wanted to make their name great, and God says to Abram, I will make your name great.
[time=2662] And I will make you a great nation.
[time=2665] By the way, this promise was fulfilled by the beginning of the Book of Exodus.
[time=2670] In Exodus 1.7, there arose a Pharaoh who knew not Joseph, and the Bible says the people of Israel were fruitful and increased greatly.
[time=2680] They multiplied and grew exceedingly strong so that the land was filled with them.
[time=2686] By the second Book of the Bible, God's promise is fulfilled.
[time=2690] God makes Abram a great nation, and God gives Abram a great name.
[time=2697] I will bless you and make your name great so that you will be a blessing.
[time=2701] A great name means a great reputation.
[time=2704] That's why we pray in Jesus' name.
[time=2707] It's not just a formula.
[time=2709] We pray because we believe that Jesus, we go to God on behalf of Jesus and what He has done, not on behalf of us.
[time=2718] We don't say, "Please do this because I'm good." We don't say, "Lord, hear my prayer because I gave to the church." No, no, we pray in Jesus' name based on His reputation, based on what He has done.
[time=2732] That's what He means to pray in Jesus' name, and this name motif is from the beginning of the Bible.
[time=2738] I will make you a great name.
[time=2741] And again, this promise was fulfilled by the Book of Exodus because the Pharaoh is afraid of them because the people of Israel are great and they already have a great name.
[time=2752] Not only dabble when before God gives them the 10 commandments, He calls Israel my treasured possession.
[time=2759] Isn't that a good name?
[time=2760] Oh, that's a great name.
[time=2762] Just my people are of treasured possession.
[time=2765] That's a great name.
[time=2767] But I want you to look with me, please, at the end of chapter 2.
[time=2771] See, here in the ESV, and I assume whatever version you are using, it's in the indicative.
[time=2778] It says, "You will be a blessing." It's not what it is in Hebrew.
[time=2784] In Hebrew, it's actually a command.
[time=2788] Be a blessing.
[time=2793] See, God gives promises, but He also gives commands.
[time=2798] The idea that we are to be a blessing is not optional.
[time=2801] It doesn't say, "Yeah, it'd be a blessing if you feel like it.
[time=2803] It'd be a blessing if you think you have time." No, no, no.
[time=2806] This is a command.
[time=2807] Be a blessing.
[time=2810] I don't know why different versions translate it as an indicative, but it is an imperative.
[time=2816] My dear brothers and sisters, to be a blessing in this world, it's not an option for us.
[time=2821] It's a command.
[time=2822] We need to be a blessing.
[time=2824] Doesn't our world need a blessing?
[time=2826] Oh, they need a blessing, and we need to be that blessing.
[time=2830] And He says to Abraham, "To you, all the families of the earth shall be blessed."
[time=2836] And we'll look at that next Sunday, and we'll see how all these promises are fulfilled in the person and work of Jesus Christ.
[time=2845] A great nation, a great name, and lastly, a great land.
[time=2851] Verse 7, "Then the Lord appeared to Abraham and said to your offspring, I will give this land." So He built there an altar to the Lord who had appeared to Him.
[time=2860] I don't know if you watch the news, but you see that there's a lot of unrest in Israel today, isn't it?
[time=2867] Let me ask you, what are they fighting over?
[time=2871] The land, the land.
[time=2875] For about 4,000 years, people are fighting over the land.
[time=2882] We're going to talk more about that next Sunday.
[time=2886] But again, I love the promise here in verse 3, "In all the families of the earth shall be blessed."
[time=2897] In Revelation 7, 9 and 10. At the end of history, John writes, "After this I looked and behold, a great multitude that no one could number from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes with palm branches in their hands and crying out to the loud voice, salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne and to the Lamb."
[time=2921] Isn't that good news?
[time=2923] Because in heaven, we'll have people from all nations, we'll have Americans and canyons and Romanians and Mexicans and even people from Texas.
[time=2935] I'm told they will be there. Anybody from Texas? No, you're probably in Texas.
[time=2944] I love Abraham's response, obedience, obedience. Verse 4 simply says,
[time=2950] "Abram went as the Lord told him."
[time=2957] Abraham was 75 years old when he departed from Haran.
[time=2963] Imagine that God appears to you and tells you, "Move 600 miles away."
[time=2969] And I'm not going to tell you where you're going, I'm going to show you where you're going.
[time=2973] This is before you halls and before our location services.
[time=2978] And I love his response, "Abram went." And the author of Hebrews tells us how Abraham was able to do this.
[time=2984] By faith, Abraham, Hebrews 11, 8 through 10.
[time=2989] By faith, Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance.
[time=2996] And he went out not knowing where he was going.
[time=2999] By faith, he went to live in the land of promise as in a foreign land, living in tents with eyes that can Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise.
[time=3008] For he was looking forward to the city that has foundations whose designer and builder is God.
[time=3015] And I like the second part of verse 7.
[time=3018] Not only God tells him I'm going to give you a great land, but look at Abraham.
[time=3022] His response is worship. So he built there an altar to the Lord who had appeared to him.
[time=3030] I'm going to impact this more next week, but I want to give you a definition of worship
[time=3036] from a former colleague of my Anna Ross who writes in his book, Recalling the Hope of Glory, the definition of worship.
[time=3045] True worship, he writes, is the celebration of being in covenant fellowship with the sovereign and holy triune God.
[time=3053] By means of the reverent adoration and spontaneous praise of God's nature and works, the expressed commitment of trust and obedience to the covenant responsibilities, all with the confident anticipation of the fulfillment of the covenant promises in glory.
[time=3070] Next Sunday, I promise I'm going to have that written in your bulletin because there's so much in that definition.
[time=3077] And as we talk about God's covenant with Abraham, we're going to talk about what true worship is.
[time=3086] But the response to God is obedience.
[time=3091] So as we approach our closing, I want to ask ourselves, how are we applying the truth?
[time=3098] Two very simple ways of applying today's truth.
[time=3102] First of all, obey God.
[time=3106] If God says, be fruitful, multiply and fill the earth, don't say I'm going to stay here.
[time=3112] If God is calling you to say, go as a missionary to Africa, don't say I'm staying here.
[time=3117] If God is calling you to be a missionary to Romania or Papua New Guinea, don't say I'm staying here, obey God.
[time=3123] Nothing good can come from your disobedience.
[time=3132] And second of all, magnify His name.
[time=3137] Are you trying to build any towers for yourself?
[time=3141] Think about just what you did this last week.
[time=3144] How much of all we did this last week magnified His name or we were trying to magnify our name?
[time=3153] Are you serving God and are you obeying Him even if your name is not on the door?
[time=3158] Even if your name is not on the bulletin, even if your name is not on the marquee,
[time=3164] are you serving and praising God even though your name is not magnified?
[time=3170] If so, you're in good company.
[time=3173] God needs people like that.
[time=3175] God needs people to magnify His name.
[time=3182] Whose name are you trying to make great?
[time=3187] I believe that Warren Wiersby is right when he writes.
[time=3190] What humanity can't achieve by means of its proud towers.
[time=3194] Jesus Christ has achieved by dying on a humiliating cross.
[time=3198] All who trust Jesus Christ are one in Him and will share Heaven together regardless of race, nation, language, or tribe.
[time=3208] That good news?
[time=3210] One race.
[time=3212] Students ask me all the time, Tiberius, what do you think about interracial marriage?
[time=3216] The Bible says clearly there's only one race, the human race.
[time=3222] And Jesus came to die for the race of Adam.
[time=3228] And if you're from Mars, there's bad news.
[time=3234] But if you're part of the race of Adam, there's good news.
[time=3238] Because Jesus came to die for the race of Adam.
[time=3247] See what kind of love the Father has given to us that we should be called children of God.
[time=3254] We have a great name, but it's not our name that we need to be glorifying.
[time=3260] We need to be glorifying the name of Jesus.
[time=3263] I was reminded this week of an old hymn.
[time=3267] Some of you will remember.
[time=3269] There is a name I love to hear.
[time=3272] I love to sing its worth.
[time=3274] It sounds like music in my ear, the sweetest name on earth.
[time=3280] Oh, how I love Jesus.
[time=3285] Sometimes we sing, oh, how I love myself.
[time=3289] I have the power, I have the talent, it's all about me, me, me.
[time=3294] And all week long we feed the me monster.
[time=3297] And yet the song says, oh, oh, how I love Jesus.
[time=3302] Because he first loved me.
[time=3307] Let's pray.
[time=3309] Father, we come before you asking for forgiveness.
[time=3313] For the many times when we try to build for ourselves towers, build with pride and blind ambition.
[time=3326] I pray this morning that you will forgive us for our sin and teach us what it means to live a life of obedience to you.
[time=3334] Teach us what it means to magnify your name in the way we learn in school and we act at work and we play sports on the soccer field or on the baseball diamond or on the tennis court, wherever we are.
[time=3350] May we magnify your name in such a way that people will see you and will give you praise and glory.
[time=3359] May the people that come in contact with us learn to say the same thing.
[time=3366] Oh, how I love Jesus. Because he first loved me. In his name we pray.
[time=3375] [AMEN - 71 seconds]
[time=3450] Jesus, in your name we pray.
[time=3455] [AMEN] Fill our house to name and give us strength to live for you and glorify your name.
[time=3475] Your name is a strong and mighty tower. Your name is a shelter like the water.
[time=3488] Your name is a strong and mighty tower. Your name is a shelter like the water. Your name is a shelter like the water.
[time=3515] Your name.
[time=3519] Let the nation sing it louder.
[time=3523] There's nothing has the power to say but your name.
[time=3534] [AMEN]
