[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=30] And even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, your perfect love is casting out fear.
[time=58] And even my own car, in the middle of the storms of this life, I won't turn back, I know you are near.
[time=71] And I will fear no evil, for my God is winning.
[time=83] And if my God is winning, who may shall I fear, who may shall I fear?
[time=97] Oh no, you never let go, through the storm, oh no, you never let go.
[time=106] Every high, every low, oh no, you never let go, 'cause you never let go of me.
[time=120] Time to see a light, and it's coming for the heart that holds on.
[time=127] Every morning, it's like beyond all come care.
[time=132] And there will be an end to the troubles, but until that day comes,
[time=139] we'll live to know you here on the earth.
[time=144] And I will fear no evil, for my God is winning.
[time=156] And if my God is winning, who may shall I fear, who may shall I fear?
[time=170] Oh no, you never let go, through the storm, oh no, you never let go.
[time=179] Every high, every low, oh no, you never let go, oh no, you never let go of me.
[time=194] Oh no, you never let go, through the storm, oh no, you never let go.
[time=204] Every high, every low, oh no, you never let go, oh you never let go of me.
[time=216] I can see a light that is coming for the heart that holds on.
[time=224] And there will be an end to the troubles, but until that day comes,
[time=231] still I will praise you, still I will praise you.
[time=242] It's time to see a light that is coming for the heart that holds on.
[time=248] And there will be an end to the troubles, but until that day comes,
[time=255] still I will praise you, still I will praise you.
[time=267] Oh no, you never let go, through the storm, oh no, you never let go.
[time=276] Every high, every low, oh no, you never let go, oh no, you never let go of me.
[time=291] Oh no, you never let go, through the storm, oh no, you never let go.
[time=301] Every high, every low, oh no, you never let go, oh no, you never let go of me.
[time=312] Oh no, you never let go of me.
[time=331] I have decided to follow Jesus.
[time=352] No turning back.
[time=358] Don't go with me, still I will follow.
[time=377] No turning back.
[time=383] When you leave me, I will follow.
[time=393] Jesus, take me down that road.
[time=396] When you leave me, I will follow.
[time=405] Anywhere Lord I will fall, I will go.
[time=412] I have decided to follow Jesus.
[time=430] No turning back.
[time=437] Don't go behind me.
[time=440] Don't cross me for me.
[time=443] Don't go behind me.
[time=446] Don't cross me for me.
[time=449] Don't go behind me.
[time=452] Don't cross me for me.
[time=455] Don't turn back.
[time=458] No turning back.
[time=461] When you leave me, I will follow.
[time=470] Jesus, take me down that road.
[time=473] When you leave me, I will follow.
[time=482] Anywhere Lord I will go.
[time=486] When you leave me, I will go.
[time=1086] Last week, we saw how God made Abraham a few promises.
[time=1093] In chapter 12, the passage that Darren read earlier,
[time=1099] we see that the God who created the universe wants to be not just God the Creator and God the Sustainer, but He is the God who makes a covenant with people.
[time=1114] God wants to be in a relationship with humanity.
[time=1117] Not only did God create us, but He wants to be in a relationship with us through covenant.
[time=1126] Also, we have to remember that Abraham was 75 years old when God made those promises to him.
[time=1135] The three great promises.
[time=1136] I will make you a great nation.
[time=1138] I will give you a great name.
[time=1140] In other words, you will have a great reputation and then I will give you a great land.
[time=1146] By definition, a covenant is a contract or an agreement between two or more people.
[time=1154] For example, I am going to make a covenant to Steve.
[time=1157] I say, "Steve, I am going to give you ten cows.
[time=1160] You are going to sell me your Ferrari." Don't worry, he is not driving a Ferrari.
[time=1166] Don't worry.
[time=1168] Covenants like that occurred all throughout the ancient Uris.
[time=1172] There was not something strange.
[time=1174] Actually, if you read in the Bible, there were many people who made covenants between themselves.
[time=1180] But now God, the creator of the universe, wants to make a covenant with people.
[time=1184] That's different.
[time=1186] Those covenants are different.
[time=1188] First of all, in this case, the covenant is unilateral.
[time=1193] That means a couple of things.
[time=1195] First of all, it means that God sets the terms and the conditions of the covenant.
[time=1199] We don't negotiate with God.
[time=1201] God doesn't say, "Okay, I am going to give you ten commandments." And Moses says, "How about nine?" You never see that, do you?
[time=1211] No, because God sets the conditions in terms of the covenants.
[time=1214] You either obey or disobey.
[time=1217] It's the same thing with Abraham.
[time=1219] God says to Abraham, "Abraham, I am going to make these promises to you.
[time=1222] I am going to make you a great nation.
[time=1224] I'll give you a great name, and I'm going to give you a great land." But the fact that it's unilateral will learn today is that God takes it upon himself
[time=1234] that he will do what he promises to do.
[time=1239] It's not a bilateral covenant thing that, "Hey, Abraham, I'm going to do this if you do this."
[time=1245] This is no negotiation, and it really depends on me.
[time=1250] That I will keep the promises of these covenants.
[time=1253] Of this covenant, especially.
[time=1256] Again, when he's 75 years old, Abraham hears these words,
[time=1263] "Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you, and I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great so that you will be a blessing." Remember, in the Hebrew it was an imperative.
[time=1277] Be a blessing.
[time=1279] It's a command.
[time=1281] "And I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you, I will curse, and he knew all the families of the earth shall be blessed." And the Lord appeared to Abraham and said to him, "I will give this land to your seed." And Abraham built an altar there to the Lord who appeared to him.
[time=1298] We saw last time that Abraham's response was twofold.
[time=1305] He believed the Lord, and then he worshiped the Lord.
[time=1310] And last time I promised you that I'm going to have this definition for you, what is true worship?
[time=1316] From my former colleague, Alan Ross, in his book Recalling the Hope of Glory,
[time=1322] he gives this definition of worship, and I like it very much so I put it in your bulletins, and it's here as well.
[time=1328] True worship, he writes, is the celebration of being in covenant fellowship
[time=1334] with the sovereign and holy triune God.
[time=1337] By means of the reverent adoration and spontaneous praise of God's nature and works, the expressed commitment of trust and obedience to the covenant responsibilities,
[time=1349] all with the confident anticipation of the fulfillment of the covenant promises in glory.
[time=1356] So just to take this apart, by the way, you can chew on this all week long.
[time=1361] But to unpackage just three points here, worship, in worship we should rejoice.
[time=1367] Worship is a celebration.
[time=1370] And it's not just celebration through singing.
[time=1372] That's great that we sing, but this is not just worship.
[time=1376] Sometimes we make the mistakes of saying this is a worship pastor, and what he means, what we mean is he leads us in music.
[time=1383] Worship is not just music.
[time=1387] Music can be part of worship, but it doesn't stop at praise.
[time=1392] It doesn't stop at singing.
[time=1394] Worship is a response to everything who God is and what he has done.
[time=1399] But it should always be rejoicing, we should rejoice.
[time=1403] In worship we should magnify God.
[time=1405] True worship is the celebration of being in covenant fellowship with the sovereign and holy triune God.
[time=1414] The doctrine of eternity, again, it's a biblical theological concept, but we have the blessing to read the Bible from right to left.
[time=1422] Abraham didn't have that.
[time=1425] They didn't have that.
[time=1426] We have the whole thing.
[time=1429] We can read the Bible from right to left.
[time=1431] We know what's going to happen, and we know even what happened to Abraham.
[time=1436] So in worship we rejoice.
[time=1438] In worship we magnify God and in worship.
[time=1441] Notice, please, we have responsibilities.
[time=1444] The express commitment of trust and obedience to the covenant responsibilities.
[time=1449] I have to believe God.
[time=1451] I have to trust in him, and I have to obey him.
[time=1454] Those of you who are older, remember the great old hymn.
[time=1457] Trust and obey.
[time=1460] Trust and obey, for there's no other way.
[time=1464] There's no other way.
[time=1466] So Abraham responds in obedience, and he responds in worship.
[time=1473] And then in chapter 15, when the actual covenant is being made, we see that he believes God.
[time=1480] Faith then becomes the foundation of this covenant.
[time=1485] Look with me in chapter 15, starting in verse 1.
[time=1489] What we have here is a dialogue between God and Abraham.
[time=1494] Look at Abraham.
[time=1497] Abraham is a few questions for God, and God answers.
[time=1502] But we learn early in history that God's calling requires faith.
[time=1506] Starting in verse 1 of chapter 15.
[time=1509] After these things, the word of the Lord came to Abraham in a vision.
[time=1512] Fear not, Abraham, I am your shield, your word shall be very great.
[time=1517] But Abraham said, oh Lord God, what will you give me?
[time=1521] Before I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus.
[time=1527] And Abraham said, behold, you have given me no offspring.
[time=1531] And a member of my household will be my heir.
[time=1533] And behold, the word of the Lord came to him, this man shall not be your heir.
[time=1538] In Hebrew, there's emphasis there.
[time=1541] Actually, that phrase starts with not.
[time=1545] That's how it is in Hebrew.
[time=1546] God wants to emphasize to not.
[time=1550] He will not be.
[time=1553] There's an emphasis there that we don't see in English.
[time=1555] But God basically says, no, no, not.
[time=1559] This man shall not be your heir.
[time=1561] Your very own son shall be your heir.
[time=1564] And he brought him outside and said, look toward heaven and numbered the stars.
[time=1567] If you are able to number them, then he said to him, so shall your offspring be.
[time=1574] And he believed the Lord.
[time=1577] And he counted it to him as righteousness.
[time=1580] My dear brothers and sisters, if we are in a covenant relationship with God, the first thing we need to do is to trust God, is to put our faith in God.
[time=1593] The greatest mistakes we make in our lives is when we put our trust in who we are and what we can do.
[time=1602] We learn very early that faith is the foundation of a covenant relationship with God.
[time=1609] And later in Hebrews, we are told that without faith, it is impossible to please God.
[time=1617] I am no longer a slave to fear, we sing.
[time=1621] That's only true if we believe God and if we trust in him.
[time=1630] And then in chapter 15, we have this strange ritual, the strange actually making of the covenant,
[time=1639] the ritual of the covenant.
[time=1644] It's strange because we don't do it anymore and we should be grateful that we don't do it anymore.
[time=1650] But this is called the ritual of the covenant or we can call it the ratification of the covenant.
[time=1657] And it's again a little strange because we don't do it today.
[time=1665] Look in chapter 15.
[time=1668] After God and Abraham go back and forth and they have the dialogue,
[time=1674] we see this ritual, this making of the covenant.
[time=1682] As the sun was going down, starting in verse 12, "A deep sleep fell on Abraham and behold, the dreadful and great darkness fell upon him, then the Lord said to Abraham, 'No, for certain, that your offspring will be sojourners in land that is not theirs and will be servants there and they will be afflicted for 400 years.'
[time=1700] But I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve and afterward they shall come out with great possessions.
[time=1706] As for yourself, you shall go to your fathers in peace and you shall be buried in an old age."
[time=1713] Now verse 17, this is where the ritual actually takes place.
[time=1716] The making of the covenant, the cutting of the covenant.
[time=1719] When the sun had gone down and it was dark, behold, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.
[time=1727] On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abraham.
[time=1732] Now this is a strange sight, isn't it?
[time=1737] We have never experienced anything like that.
[time=1740] When we made a covenant with God, and even in the Old Testament there's only one other text that can help us.
[time=1747] It's Jeremiah 34, 18 and 19 gives us a glimpse of what happened here.
[time=1752] Basically if you made a covenant with someone, to ratify that covenant, sometimes you would cut an animal in half
[time=1760] and then you would walk through the animal, through the pieces.
[time=1763] Basically saying, "If I don't hold the end of my bargain, may I become like this carcass."
[time=1772] And we know that because Jeremiah 34, 18 and 19.
[time=1777] We read, "The man who transgressed my covenant and did not keep the terms of the covenant that they made before me,
[time=1784] I will make them like the calf that they cut in two and pass between its parts made before me.
[time=1793] The officials of Judah, the officials of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests and all the people of the land who passed
[time=1799] between the parts of the calf, God says they have not kept the end of the bargain, they will become like this carcass."
[time=1807] Remember I told you this covenant is unilateral, right? Because Abraham doesn't walk through the carcass.
[time=1815] Only God does, that's why this covenant is unilateral.
[time=1818] Basically God says, "I am going to keep my end of this bargain." When the sun had gone down and it was dark, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.
[time=1830] The symbol of God going through the pieces, God says, "I am going to make sure I keep the end, my end of the covenant."
[time=1841] Aren't you glad that promises of God are dependent on God alone and on his faithfulness rather than ours?
[time=1852] In essence, God guarantees his people and his promises that the promises will be fulfilled in spite of the prospects of their death and suffering.
[time=1863] Remember, God just told them, "Hey, your descendants who spent 400 years in slavery in Egypt, how does that fit with the promises?
[time=1874] I thought I'm going to have a great name and a great nation and a great land." Yeah, but in the process you'll be 400 years in slavery.
[time=1884] God gives them a glimpse of the future.
[time=1889] And after this happens, they lived happily ever after, right?
[time=1895] Wrong. Looking chapter 16. But before we are harsh on our brother Abram, I want you to know that about 10 years have passed.
[time=1906] 10 years have passed since God said to Abraham, "I'm going to make you a great nation and I'm going to give you a great name and I'm going to give you a great land."
[time=1914] And he still without a child.
[time=1918] Now, just in case we forgot, chapter 16 starts exactly like that.
[time=1924] Now, Sarah Abram's wife had born him no children.
[time=1929] She had a female Egyptian servant whose name was Hagar, and what we learn here, my dear brothers and sisters, is that sometimes even the faithful make mistakes.
[time=1940] And worldly methods produce complications.
[time=1943] Have you ever done that?
[time=1945] Have you ever gone ahead of God's will?
[time=1948] You didn't want to wait for God's promises to be fulfilled, so you took matters in your own hands.
[time=1953] I'm going to help God with this one.
[time=1957] You don't have to raise your hand.
[time=1959] We all, I'm sure, have done it.
[time=1964] Even though God ratifies the covenant and says, "Abraham, I'm going to keep my end of the covenant.
[time=1972] Abraham is still a man and he still makes mistakes." So Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan.
[time=1981] Canaan, Sarah Abram's wife took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, and gave her to Abram, her husband, as a wife.
[time=1992] We learn something very interesting and very important.
[time=1996] A wise man once said, "Biblical characters are not portraits of morality, they are mirrors for identity."
[time=2007] I'm going to say that again.
[time=2009] Biblical characters are not portraits of morality, they are mirrors for identity so we can see ourselves in them.
[time=2017] Because like Abraham, we have done the same thing many times.
[time=2022] But this mistake here that Abram makes, I want you to understand, he was culturally approved.
[time=2033] Culture, in that they approved of a man taking his wife's maidservant as a wife.
[time=2041] Now we know that we cannot have many wives because of what Jesus says that nobody can have two masters.
[time=2050] I want you to understand how bad this decision was.
[time=2061] Even though he was culturally approved, there is a clear linguistic parallel between Genesis 3 and Genesis 16.
[time=2072] As Moses is writing these words, inspired by the Holy Spirit, he is making a very clear connection between the sin of Adam and the sin of Abram.
[time=2085] And the sin of Eve and the sin of Sarah.
[time=2089] They are very similar, they are very key linguistic parallels here.
[time=2095] And if you were a Jewish person reading this in Hebrew, you would have noticed them even more than we do in English.
[time=2104] She goes first to says, "Abraham listened to the voice of Sarah."
[time=2111] Now Abram should have listened to the voice of God.
[time=2115] But he listens here to the voice of Sarah and what the Bible says here is that Abram's sin is just as bad as Adam's sin.
[time=2128] And Sarah's sin was just as bad as Eve's sin.
[time=2134] Now remember that Hagar is an Egyptian maidservant, right?
[time=2139] Now they just left the land of Egypt and they're going towards the promised land.
[time=2144] What is the teaching there?
[time=2146] God is trying to tell them, "Look, nothing good can come from your intermarion, pagans, nothing."
[time=2154] Last time that happened, Ishmael was produced.
[time=2160] And if you know history from then on, Ishmael was always a thorn in the sight of Isaac, the son of promise.
[time=2171] So let me ask you, my dear brothers and sisters, let me ask us, how many Ishmaels do we have running around?
[time=2180] I'm not talking about actual children, because children are a blessing from the Lord, I know that.
[time=2186] But I'm talking about things that have happened in our lives because we did not want to wait for the promises of God.
[time=2192] But took matters in our own hands and we decided to help God with this one.
[time=2201] Remember, even though it's culturally approved, we have to ask, "Is it God approved?"
[time=2210] See, I'm not asking, "Is it legal?" No, no, I'm asking, "Is it God approved?" That's the question.
[time=2220] I'm not just asking. If everybody does it, no, no, no, is it God approved?
[time=2229] Because even the code of Hammurabi had something in there about you can take your wives, maidservant and have another wife.
[time=2239] Culturally approved, but not God approved.
[time=2244] And even though Abraham messes up in a big way, God does not give up on him.
[time=2256] She's going to have a son, Ishmael.
[time=2260] So from then on in history, we're going to have the descendants of Ishmael, the Arabs, and the descendants of Isaac, the Jews.
[time=2269] And they will be fighting over the land for years and years. Actually, it's been about 4,000 years now.
[time=2276] And they're still fighting over the same thing. Why? Because one man was now willing to wait for God's promises to be fulfilled.
[time=2285] So we cannot say that, "Oh, it's not such a big deal. It's just one little thing." And besides it's approved by the culture, it's legal, it's everybody does it.
[time=2297] And yet we still live with a consequence of that sin.
[time=2303] But I like the fact that God does not give up. He does not give up on Abraham, looking in chapter 17.
[time=2311] When Abraham was 99 years old, okay, so in just a few chapters, we went from him being 75 to him being 85, and now in 99.
[time=2324] When Abraham was 99 years old, chapter 17, the Lord appeared to Abraham and said to him, "I am God Almighty."
[time=2332] In Hebrew, El Shaddai. And here we are given the purpose of the covenant, which is relationship.
[time=2341] What God wants to have with Abraham is what he wanted to have with Adam and Eve. A relationship.
[time=2350] But starts in chapter 17, verse 1.
[time=2353] "I am El Shaddai. I am God Almighty. Walk before me and be blameless." Was Abraham blameless?
[time=2360] We just saw that. And we only talked about chapter 16. We didn't talk about chapter 12.
[time=2365] When he lied about Sarah being his sister, not his wife.
[time=2369] And by the way, there was also something that was culturally approved.
[time=2376] Also, by the way, produced complications. Could it be that Hagar came from chapter 12?
[time=2386] Ah, remember when the king to pacify everything says, "I am going to give you servants."
[time=2396] Could it be that Hagar is the result of that lie in chapter 12? I don't know, I am just asking. It could be.
[time=2405] Talk about complications. But God doesn't give up on us just because we disobeyed.
[time=2413] Walk before me and be blameless that I may make a covenant between me and you.
[time=2417] And may multiply you greatly. Then Abraham fell on his face. And God said to him,
[time=2423] "Behold, my covenant is with you, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations." No longer shall you name be called Abraham. Abraham meant exalted father.
[time=2434] God says, "I am going to change your name from exalted father to Abraham, the father of a multitude."
[time=2442] Why? For I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.
[time=2447] I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make you into nations, and kings shall come from you.
[time=2452] And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations
[time=2458] for an everlasting covenant to be God to you and to your offspring after you.
[time=2464] Do you see that? I will be their God. What God wants is relationship.
[time=2470] Actually, after this God will continue saying this covenant formula, "I will be your God and you will be my people."
[time=2478] And I will be their God and they will be my people. It's all throughout the Old Testament.
[time=2483] You will appear in the Mosaic covenant. You will appear in the Davidic covenant.
[time=2487] You will appear in the New Covenant because God does not change.
[time=2492] And he still wants the same thing from us to be in a relationship with him through faith.
[time=2500] Even though we mess up, even though we have ishmaels running around.
[time=2506] Even though sometimes we do what's culturally approved and not what's God approved.
[time=2514] However, we cannot say, "Okay, Tiberius, what God wants from us is the relationship, so we can forget about all those laws and regulations."
[time=2526] Wrong.
[time=2531] Have you ever seen a couple that says, "Okay, now we're married. We made a covenant, so now we can do whatever we want." Have you ever seen that?
[time=2540] I hope not. No, no. When you make a covenant with someone, you actually say, "I'm going to be true to you alone."
[time=2549] You cannot say, "I made a covenant, so now I can do whatever I want." No, no, no, no.
[time=2553] God wants a relationship, but God also writes this love letter called the Ten Commandments and then the whole Bible.
[time=2560] I see here, you know what I see? I see rules and regulations, but therefore the purpose of keeping up the covenant relationship.
[time=2570] Without the rules and regulations, no relationship will last.
[time=2579] The text doesn't end here. Remember how God gave Noah the sign of the covenant, a rainbow?
[time=2588] Abraham doesn't have that benefit.
[time=2591] His covenant sign is circumcision.
[time=2596] Circumcision is the sign of the covenant.
[time=2600] So parents, when you talk to your children about what they learned today in church, good luck.
[time=2615] Genesis 17, 11, "You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your four skins, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you."
[time=2630] Alan Ross has the right, and I quote, "This sign was sexual. The promise was for a seed. The covenanters would be reminded one, the human nature alone was unable to generate the promised seed if God was not willing to grant such fruitfulness.
[time=2650] And two, that impurity must be laid aside, especially in marriage. The sign formed a constant reminder for the people to preserve the purity of marriage in order to produce godly seed."
[time=2665] This is in chapter 17, and remember, because chapter 19 is coming with Sodom and Gomorrah, which means that a lot of times in their history we saw that they did not keep the covenant stipulations and the promises or the sign of the covenant.
[time=2688] And God learns against not obeying the covenant. Chapter 17, verses 12 through 14, "He who is eight days old among you shall be circumcised every male throughout your generation, whether born in your house and bought with your money from any foreigner who is not of your offspring, both he who is born in your house and he who is bought with your money shall surely be circumcised, so shall my covenant be in your flesh, an everlasting covenant."
[time=2715] Any circumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off from his people. He has broken my covenant."
[time=2726] Ken Matthews explains this in Genesis commentary, "Such excommunication symbolically meant the person's death in the eyes of the community.
[time=2734] Breach of disgust was more than a repudiation for the community, for the culprit in doing so rejected the Lord himself."
[time=2743] Now remember that this was just a sign of the covenant was not the covenant itself.
[time=2749] This was just a sign of the covenant and apart from faith, you really didn't matter if you were circumcised or not.
[time=2756] Because some people said, "Well, I'm circumcised, I'm a Jew, it really doesn't matter what I do." No, no, no. Apart from faith, you cannot be in the covenant relationship.
[time=2767] The circumcision was just something outwardly that showed that something inside happened, that you have faith to be in a covenant relationship with Yahweh the Creator God.
[time=2777] How do we know that God was always after the heart and not just the body?
[time=2786] Deuteronomy 30 verse 6, "And the Lord your God will circumcise your heart."
[time=2792] This is not New Testament, it sounds like the New Testament, doesn't it? No, no, no. This is Deuteronomy 30 verse 6, "And the Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your offspring so that you will love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and that you may live."
[time=2808] Because we get to the New Testament times and there are some people who say to Paul, "Look Paul, I'm a Jew, I've been circumcised on the eight day, I'm a Jew, and Paul comes and says no, no, no."
[time=2818] True circumcision is the circumcision of the heart.
[time=2823] A Jew is one inwardly and a circumcision is the matter of the heart.
[time=2827] By the Spirit, not by the letter, his praise is not from man, but from God.
[time=2832] Starting in verse 22 of Romans chapter 2, you say that one must, you who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery?
[time=2843] You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law?
[time=2850] For it is written, "The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you."
[time=2856] For circumcision indeed is the value if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.
[time=2864] So if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?
[time=2872] Then he who is physically and circumcised but keeps the law will condemn you, who have the written code and circumcision, but break the law.
[time=2882] For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical, but a Jew is one inwardly.
[time=2892] And circumcision is the matter of the heart by the Spirit, not by the letter.
[time=2899] So what does Abraham have to do with Jesus?
[time=2903] Some people have decided we're not going to read the Old Testament, we're just going to read the New Testament because it's all about Jesus, right?
[time=2910] Well here it is, if you don't understand Abraham, you don't understand Jesus.
[time=2914] Because when Paul comes and writes his letter to Galatians, he makes sure that we understand that you need to be in Christ.
[time=2922] You see, Abraham didn't save anybody. Abraham didn't die for anybody's sins, but Jesus did.
[time=2930] So you have to be in Christ, look what Paul is writing.
[time=2934] When it comes to our salvation, there is neither Jew nor Greek.
[time=2938] You can add whatever nationality you want here.
[time=2942] There is neither slave nor free. There is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
[time=2950] And if you are Christ and you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise.
[time=2956] Do you see that?
[time=2957] That means, remember the great name and the great nation and the great land?
[time=2961] That's ours if we are in Jesus Christ.
[time=2965] And I'm not talking about a parcel of land in the Middle East, I'm talking we get heaven.
[time=2970] Heaven, that's good news.
[time=2973] That's good news.
[time=2976] God still has a plan for the nation of Israel and God will fulfill His promises for them, no doubt.
[time=2983] But as far as you and I who are in Christ, we get a great name to be called children of God.
[time=2991] We're no longer a slave to fear. Isn't that great?
[time=2996] That I can put my head down on the pillow and I can sleep like a baby because I don't have to fear anything.
[time=3002] If I'm in Christ. If Jesus Christ is my personal Lord and Savior, so as far as application, let's think about these three things.
[time=3010] We have to trust Yahweh, we have to worship Yahweh and then we have to obey Yahweh.
[time=3016] So for those of you who Jesus Christ is now your Lord and Savior, I want to implore you to make today the day of salvation.
[time=3023] Make this song that we sang earlier. I have decided to follow Jesus. Make that your song today.
[time=3030] And after you say that, then you can sing, "I am no longer a slave to fear." But you have to sing the first one before you sing the second one.
[time=3038] You have to be first in Christ and Jesus Christ is to be your Lord and Savior.
[time=3042] We'll have elders here to pray with you if you're sick and tired of living in fear of whatever it is.
[time=3051] When Jesus Christ comes into your life, He cannot live with fear because He is peace.
[time=3062] He is our peace, the Bible says. But we have to trust Him and we have to worship Him, be a true worshipper.
[time=3070] When God says something, do it right away because you see, worship and obedience centers, they all go together.
[time=3076] You can say, "I have just one but not the other." No, no, no, no. If you trust God, you will worship Him and you obey Him.
[time=3083] You will trust and obey for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.
[time=3090] I said, "Tiberius, but I blew it."
[time=3096] I got a couple of ish meals in my life.
[time=3099] I did things that are society approved. I still seek to get their approval and I blew it.
[time=3109] Didn't Abraham blow it? Not once, but twice, but many times probably.
[time=3116] Remember, there's only one perfect biblical character in his name is Jesus.
[time=3122] Everybody else? Not portraits of morality, mirrors for identity.
[time=3128] So maybe you're looking in the mirror and you see Abraham.
[time=3131] What I want you to do is to break the mirror and see Jesus Christ.
[time=3135] Because God says through Jesus Christ, "I want to make you." I want to mold you not in the image of Abraham, not in the image of Moses.
[time=3143] I want to make you in the image of my son, Jesus Christ.
[time=3146] And that's only possible if we put our trust in God alone.
[time=3151] Make today the day of your salvation.
[time=3153] And maybe God is calling you to do certain things that are strange and that are difficult.
[time=3158] Obey, obey.
[time=3161] Even if he calls you like Abraham to call him from Ur of the Chaldeans to go 600 miles.
[time=3168] Maybe that's what God is calling you to obey, even if it's difficult.
[time=3175] Let's pray.
[time=3177] Dear Father, we thank you for men of faith.
[time=3182] Not perfect men, but men of faith.
[time=3187] Who obeyed when it was difficult, sometimes they stumbled and made mistakes.
[time=3193] I pray that you forgive us for the many times when we went ahead of your will.
[time=3198] And we decided to go ahead and help you out on certain things.
[time=3204] And in the process we disobeyed you and we did what was culturally approved and was even legal.
[time=3215] But we gave into peer pressure.
[time=3218] I pray that you forgive us.
[time=3221] Teach us what it means to trust and obey fully.
[time=3226] Teach us what it means to be true worshipers of you, not just on Sunday mornings, but every day.
[time=3233] I pray for those who are here and don't have Jesus Christ as a person, Lord and Savior, that today will be the day of salvation.
[time=3241] I pray that today they will sing, "I have decided to follow Jesus." And they will follow that by singing, "I am no longer a slave to fear."
[time=3251] In Christ's name I pray. Amen.
[time=3263] He's stand with us. Let's sing about Jesus and His great name.
[time=3282] Last I said, find a way at the sound of your ring name.
[time=3295] Call from death, feel no shame at the sound of your ring name.
[time=3308] Every fear has no place at the sound of your ring name.
[time=3320] The enemy, he has to live at the sound of your ring name.
[time=3334] Jesus, Murley is the land that was slain for us.
[time=3344] Son of God and man, you are high and lifted up.
[time=3351] And all the world will praise your ring name.
[time=3365] Oh, believe, find their strength at the sound of your ring name.
[time=3379] Hungry souls may see grace at the sound of your ring name.
[time=3392] Fatherless, they find their rest at the sound of your ring name.
[time=3405] The sick of your ring and the dead are raised at the sound of your ring name.
[time=3419] Jesus, Murley is the land that was slain for us.
[time=3428] Son of God and man, you are high and lifted up.
[time=3434] All the world will praise your ring name.
[time=3443] The ring name.
[time=3451] God and man, you are high and lifted up.
[time=3471] Jesus, the name of Jesus, you are high and lifted up.
[time=3493] And all the world will praise your ring name.
[time=3500] Murley is the land that was slain for us.
[time=3506] Son of God and man, you are high and lifted up.
[time=3512] And all the world will praise your ring name.
[time=3521] Oh, believe, find their strength at the sound of your ring name.
