[time=467] The two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom.
[time=475] When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them, and bowed himself with his face to the earth.
[time=483] And said, "My lords, please turn aside to your servant's house, and spend the night and wash your feet.
[time=491] And then you may rise up early and go on your way." They said, "No, we'll spend the night in the town square." But he pressed them strongly, so they turned aside and entered his house, and he made them a feast and baked them unleavened bread, and they ate.
[time=510] But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man surrounded the house.
[time=522] And they called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we may know them."
[time=530] Lot went out to the men at the entrance and shut the door after him, and said, "I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly.
[time=539] Behold, I have two daughters who have not known any man. Let me bring them out to you and do to them as you please, but only do nothing to these men,
[time=549] for they have come under the shelter of my roof." But they said, "Stand back." And they said, "This fellow has come to sojourn, and he has become the judge.
[time=561] Now we will deal worse with you than with them." Then they pressed hard against Lot, and drew near to break the door down.
[time=573] Just then, the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them and shut the door.
[time=580] And they struck, they struck with blindness the men who were at the entrance of the house, both small and great, so that they wore themselves out groping for the door.
[time=593] Then the men said to Lot, "Have you anyone else here, sons-in-law, daughters, sons, anyone who you have in the city,
[time=602] and bring them out of the place?" For we are about to destroy this place because the outcry against its people has become great before the Lord.
[time=612] And the Lord has sent us to destroy it.
[time=615] So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, "Up, get out of this place, for the Lord is about to destroy the city."
[time=625] But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be jesting.
[time=630] As the morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, "Up, take your wife and your two daughters who are here,
[time=637] lest you be swept away in the punishment of the city." But he lingered.
[time=642] So the men seized him and his wife and his daughters by the hand.
[time=647] The Lord being merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him outside of the city.
[time=652] And as they brought them, one said, "Escape for your life. Do not look back or stop anywhere in the valley.
[time=661] Escape to the hills lest you be swept away." And Lot said to them, "Oh, no, my Lord. Behold, your servant has found favor in your sight,
[time=672] and you have shown me great kindness by saving my life.
[time=676] But I cannot escape to the hills lest the disaster overtake me and I die.
[time=682] Behold, this city is near enough to flee to, and it's a little one.
[time=687] Let me escape there. Is it not a little one? And my life will be saved."
[time=693] He said to him, "Behold, I grant you this favor also, that I will not overthrow the city which you have spoken.
[time=702] Escape there quickly, for I can do nothing until you arrive there. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar."
[time=710] The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.
[time=714] Then the Lord rained on Sodom and Gomorrah, sulfur, and fire from the Lord out of heaven.
[time=722] And he overthrew those cities and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the city, and what grew on the ground.
[time=731] But Lot's wife behind him looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.
[time=737] And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the Lord.
[time=743] And he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the valley.
[time=749] And he looked and behold, the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace.
[time=757] So it was that when God destroyed the cities of the valley, God remembered Abraham
[time=763] and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which Lot had lived.
[time=770] If you are like me, a lot of the times I forget what goes on on Sunday mornings.
[time=783] I forget maybe what I've heard, what I've sung. I sing a lot of neat things.
[time=788] This next song we're going to sing is one that I need to remember a lot.
[time=794] And it's called Flawless.
[time=797] It's what he's done for us, no matter what happens.
[time=801] It really can be flawless.
[time=805] And it's a hard one to sing along with, except when we get to the chorus.
[time=809] So I want you to sing this time on The Chorus.
[time=813] But there's got to be more.
[time=823] But then going back and forth from doing right to doing wrong.
[time=828] 'Cause we were thought that's who we are.
[time=830] Well come on, get in line right behind me.
[time=833] You along with everybody.
[time=836] Think of this word than what you do.
[time=840] Then like a hero who takes the stage when we're on the edge of our seats saying it's too late.
[time=852] Let me introduce you to amazing grace.
[time=859] No matter the bumps, no matter the bruises, no matter the scars.
[time=865] Still the truth is a cross has made.
[time=870] The cross has made you flawless.
[time=877] No matter the hurt or how deep the wound is, no matter the pain.
[time=885] Still the truth is a cross has made, the cross has made you flawless.
[time=895] It couldn't possibly be that we simply can't believe that this unconditional kind of love would be known to.
[time=907] Take a filthy wretch like this and wrap him up in righteousness.
[time=912] But that's exactly what he did.
[time=916] No matter the bumps, no matter the bruises, no matter the scars.
[time=923] Still the truth is a cross has made, the cross has made you flawless.
[time=935] No matter the hurt or how deep the wound is, no matter the pain.
[time=942] Still the truth is a cross has made, the cross has made you flawless.
[time=952] No matter the hurt or how deep the wound is, no matter the pain.
[time=972] Then like a hero who takes the stage when we're on the edge of our seats saying it's too late.
[time=983] Well let me introduce you to grace, grace, God's grace.
[time=993] No matter the bumps, no matter the bruises, no matter the scars.
[time=1000] Still the truth is a cross has made, the cross has made you flawless.
[time=1012] No matter the hurt or how deep the wound is, no matter the pain.
[time=1019] Still the truth is a cross has made, the cross has made you flawless.
[time=1031] No matter what they say, or what you think you are, the day will come his name.
[time=1044] You make you flawless, you make you flawless.
[time=1050] No matter the bumps, no matter the bruises, no matter the scars.
[time=1057] Still the truth is a cross has made, the cross has made you flawless.
[time=1072] Good morning.
[time=1074] Please open your Bibles to Genesis chapter 18.
[time=1083] Thank you Darren for leading us in worship through music.
[time=1089] Last week, Pastor Jesse showed us how Abraham was called to sacrifice his only son Isaac.
[time=1099] His only son, I say his only son because that was the son of the covenant.
[time=1106] We want to back up a little bit to chapter 18 and we meet Abraham, not the worshipper,
[time=1114] not the one who is ready to sacrifice, but at the end of chapter 18, Abraham is the intercessor.
[time=1126] Genesis chapter 18, starting in verse 20, the Bible says that the Lord said, "The outcry against Solomon Gomorrah is great and their sin is very grave.
[time=1136] I will go down and see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry that has come before me.
[time=1142] And if not, I will know." Verse 23, then Abraham drew near and said, "Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?" And Abraham starts negotiating with God.
[time=1155] And he says, "Lord, if there's fifty righteous people in the city, will he destroy these cities?"
[time=1161] And Abraham says, "No, I will not." And the negotiation continues and he goes all the way down to ten people.
[time=1175] "O let the Lord not be angry and I will speak again but this once."
[time=1182] Verse 32, "Suppose ten are found there." He answered, "For the sake of ten I will not destroy it." And the Lord went his way when he finished speaking to Abraham and returned to his place.
[time=1198] And then chapter 19, we read that God sends his messengers to the wicked cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.
[time=1207] What is interesting not that God sends the angels, but what's interesting is that a lot, Abraham's nephew, is sitting in the gate of Sodom.
[time=1217] Now that might not mean anything to you and I, but for the people of the ancient Yerish,
[time=1223] if you were to sit at the gate of a city, that means you were one of its leaders.
[time=1229] Because at the gate of the cities, people would come to do negotiations and business transactions and civil transactions.
[time=1236] Lot, not only lived in Sodom, he was one of its leaders.
[time=1246] And Lot is hospitable. He says to the angels to come.
[time=1252] And verse 3 says, "He pressed them strongly so they turned a sign to him and entered his house and he made them a feast and baked on 11 bread and they ate." Like Abraham, Lot is hospitable.
[time=1265] The problem is with Sodom here in Gomorrah that the city is very, very wicked.
[time=1271] The Bible says that the wicked seek to corrupt even God's messengers, starting in verse 4.
[time=1277] But before they lay down the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last men surrounded the house and they called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight?
[time=1287] Bring them out to us that we may know them."
[time=1293] Lot went out to the men at the entrance, shut the door after him and said, "I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly." The fact of the Bible says here that they were both young and old, tell us, tells us that the sin has become intergenerational, intergenerational.
[time=1316] Sodom's sexual immorality was pervasive.
[time=1319] "Where are the men who came to you tonight?" is only a rhetorical question because they say,
[time=1325] "You bring them out that we may know them, to know them." That verb, "to know" appears in Genesis 4.1 when the Bible says that Adam knew Eve.
[time=1336] To know there doesn't mean an intellectual knowledge, it means a sexual knowledge,
[time=1342] a sexual intimacy.
[time=1345] As one commentator says, "The wicked men of Sodom make no pretense their business.
[time=1351] They openly make no their intentions to assault the visitors sexually." By the way, Moses told us that earlier in Genesis 13, 13 says, "The men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the Lord." And again in chapter 18 we saw how the outcry of these cities went out before the Lord.
[time=1374] The 17th century preacher Matthew and Harry comments on the wickedness of Sodom,
[time=1380] and he says, "It was the most unnatural and abominable wickedness that they were now set upon,
[time=1387] a sin that still bears their name, and it's called Sodomy.
[time=1391] They were carried headlong by those vile affections which are worse than brutish, and the eternal reproach of the human nature which cannot be thought of without horror by those that have the least spark of virtue and any remains of natural light and conscience.
[time=1408] Those that allow themselves in unnatural uncleanness are marked for the vengeance of eternal fire.
[time=1414] They were not ashamed to own it and to prosecute their design by force and arms.
[time=1419] The practice would have been bad enough if it had been carried out on by intrigue and whittling,
[time=1425] but they proclaimed war with virtue and made open defiance to it.
[time=1432] My dear brothers and sisters, there's no question that homosexuality was and is an abomination before God.
[time=1444] The text is clear. Now what happens next is very interesting, especially if you have children, you'd ask yourself, "What is Lot thinking?" In verses 8 and 9, he says, "Behold, I have two daughters who have not known any men.
[time=1459] Let me bring them out to you to do them as you.
[time=1462] Please only do nothing to these men for they have come under the shelter of my roof."
[time=1470] I think what's going on here, it seems to be that Lot is saying,
[time=1477] "Commit the lesser of the two evils." He's not saying, "This is okay and this is not okay," or, "This is okay and this is okay." No, I think he's saying, "This is the lesser of the two evils,"
[time=1491] but they said, "Stand back," and they said, "This fellow came to soldier, and he has become the judge.
[time=1496] Now we will deal worse with you than with them." And they pressed hard against the men lot and drew near to break down the door.
[time=1505] The Bible is very clear, looking at Leviticus. Leviticus chapter 18 verse 22.
[time=1512] "You shall not lie with the male as with the woman, it is an abomination." Now I understand the context, the children of Israel were going towards the Promised Land and they were going to enter into a land where this was acceptable.
[time=1527] This was acceptable, but remember, just because its society approved doesn't mean it's got approved.
[time=1534] It happened in chapter 16. Remember in chapter 16 where Abraham took Hagar?
[time=1538] There was society approved too.
[time=1541] But just because its society approved doesn't mean it's got approved.
[time=1545] Looking Leviticus 20 verse 13.
[time=1549] "If a man lies with the male as with the woman, both of them have committed an abomination.
[time=1553] They surely be put to death. Their blood is upon them."
[time=1559] But sometimes when we read the Bible we ignore the rest of the Bible.
[time=1564] And the Bible actually clarifies that the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah were not just homosexuality.
[time=1571] For some reason, because maybe it's political or otherwise, we focus on those sins, but that's not the only sin of Sodom and Gomorrah.
[time=1580] Look in Jeremiah chapter 23. Jeremiah 23 verse 14 tells us what the other sins of Sodom and Gomorrah were.
[time=1590] But in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing.
[time=1594] They commit adultery and walking lives.
[time=1597] They strengthen the hands of evil doers so that no one turns from evil.
[time=1601] All of them have become like Sodom to me and it's inhabitants like Gomorrah.
[time=1607] So if you are a man and you're sleeping with someone other than your wife, you also live in Sodom and Gomorrah.
[time=1620] And you're also committing an abomination.
[time=1623] We have to be consistent by their brothers and sisters if we are to stand by the truth of God.
[time=1629] We cannot just say this is sin and this is not sin or this is bigger than the other sin.
[time=1634] Notice, please, it's here adultery and walk in lies.
[time=1638] Look in Ezekiel chapter 16 verse 49.
[time=1643] Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom.
[time=1646] She and her daughters had pride, excess of food and prosperous ease, but do not aid the poor and the needy.
[time=1653] Uh-oh.
[time=1656] Oh, this is okay.
[time=1658] It's okay if you don't do that, but if you ignore the poor and the needy, then you're not such big a sinner.
[time=1662] But it looks like God puts them all on the same plane.
[time=1667] So it seems like we have to revisit our theology.
[time=1673] And we need to be consistent when we talk about sins and we need to say that sin brings death.
[time=1681] All sin brings death.
[time=1684] And we cannot just pick and choose which sins we like.
[time=1687] This cannot be supermarket theology.
[time=1690] I just pick and choose what I like.
[time=1692] No, we either we take it all or we don't take any of it.
[time=1698] Notice, please, the sins that are mentioned here.
[time=1701] They did not aid the poor and the needy.
[time=1706] We just saw some examples of the need that's around the world.
[time=1714] How are we dealing?
[time=1715] How are we doing with the poor and the needy?
[time=1718] How is it when we come to voting with our checkbooks?
[time=1722] If someone were to do a check on our checkbooks, what would they find out about us?
[time=1729] Where do we spend our money?
[time=1731] How much of our money goes to the poor and the needy?
[time=1739] What we see here in this text is not that these cities are sinful, but God delivers,
[time=1747] in this case, a lot, and his family.
[time=1751] The men stretch out starting in verse 10, actually.
[time=1753] The men reach out their hands and brought a lot into the house with them and shut the door.
[time=1757] And they struggle blindness.
[time=1758] The men who are at the entrance of the house, both small and great, so that they were themselves out groping for the door.
[time=1764] Then the men said to a lot, "Have you anyone else here, sons and daughters, or anyone you have in the city, bring them out of the place, for we are about to destroy this place." Because the outcry against its people has become great before the Lord,
[time=1779] and the Lord has sent us to destroy it.
[time=1782] So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law who were to marry his daughters up, get out of his place, for the Lord is about to destroy the city.
[time=1790] But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be jesting.
[time=1797] The men seized him and his wife, and his two daughters by the hand, verse 16.
[time=1801] The Lord being merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him outside the city.
[time=1809] We're in the series, "The Gospel Project." My dear brothers and sisters, this is the good news, that God wants to deliver people from the wickedness of the world.
[time=1819] That's the good news.
[time=1821] The good news is not to say that's okay and everybody's okay.
[time=1824] No, that's sin, but God wants to bring us out of our sin.
[time=1829] That's the good news.
[time=1835] Now sometimes, if you're like me, we want a badmout lot.
[time=1839] What are you doing living in Sodom?
[time=1842] Not only are you in Sodom, you're a leader in Sodom.
[time=1845] But before I do that, I have to look in the Scripture and 2 Peter 4.
[time=1850] 2 Peter 2 starting in verse 4 calls Lot a righteous man, so I cannot do that.
[time=1856] The Bible says, "For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment.
[time=1866] If he did not spare the ancient world but preserved Noah, a herald of righteousness, with seven others when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly.
[time=1874] If by turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes, he condemned them to extinction, making them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly.
[time=1883] If he rescued righteous Lot greatly distressed by the sensual conduct of the wicked,
[time=1892] for as that righteous man lived among them day after day, he was tormenting his righteous soul over their lawless deeds that he saw and heard.
[time=1901] Then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment.
[time=1911] And especially those who indulge in the lust of defiling passion and despise authority.
[time=1918] It seems like the angels actually have to drag Lot out of Sodom.
[time=1925] And again, he's got family there and maybe we can understand that, but the Bible doesn't say why Lot hesitated.
[time=1933] But the Bible says that the man, the angels have to seize him and his wife
[time=1939] and bring him out of the hand and his daughters out of the city.
[time=1945] Then the Bible is very clear what happened to Sodom and Gomorrah.
[time=1948] The Bible says that God destroys the wicked and the cities that they live in.
[time=1952] Then the Lord reigned on Sodom and Gomorrah, sulfur and fire from the Lord out of heaven, and he overthrew those cities and all the valley and all the inhabitants of the cities and what grew on the ground.
[time=1963] Lot's wife behind him looked back and she became a pillar of salt.
[time=1971] Some liberal scholars suggest that what happened here was just a natural disaster.
[time=1979] The 20th century German priest and Old Testament scholar Gerhard von Rad says this,
[time=1986] that there was a series of earthquakes that caused the rift in the earth.
[time=1990] As the result gases from the earth were released and then ignited, setting the sulfur and petroleum deposits a flame resulting in a catastrophic firestorm.
[time=2001] That's very creative.
[time=2006] Why? Look at the text, please.
[time=2008] Verse 24 says, "The Lord reigned on Sodom and Gomorrah, sulfur from from and fire from where?
[time=2018] From the Lord out of heaven." Twice it says, "From the Lord, from the Lord." I even checked the German translation.
[time=2028] It says, "The-her, the Lord, the Lord." So it's not a matter of not understanding the text.
[time=2036] It's a matter of again doing supermarket theology, taking out of the Bible just what you want and what you please.
[time=2042] You cannot do that.
[time=2045] German or no German?
[time=2047] The verse 26 again says, "Bolotzweib behind him looked back and she became a pillar of souls."
[time=2053] She disobeyed the instruction of the angels who said in verse 17, "Do not look back or stop anywhere in the valley."
[time=2062] One commentator puts it like this, he says, "Lotzweib may have been a sodomite.
[time=2069] The woman is nameless, no more than a prop in the story whose tragic end became a dreaded lesson."
[time=2076] Mrs. Lott becomes a sodium chloride monument.
[time=2080] The generations of Israelites will view.
[time=2083] Actually, the first century theologian Jewish historian, Josephus,
[time=2091] claims that in the first century they were still able to see that pillar of salt.
[time=2100] But Jesus uses Lottzweib as an example.
[time=2103] Look 17 starting in verse 28.
[time=2106] Likewise, just as it was in the days of Lottz, they were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building, but on the day when Lottzweib went out of Sodom, fire and sulfur, rain from heaven and destroy them all, so it will be on the day when the Sodom is revealed.
[time=2122] On that day led the one who was on the housetop with his goods in the house, not come down to take them away, and likewise led the one who was in the field, and not turn back, remember Lottzweib, whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will keep it.
[time=2138] My dear brothers and sisters, I think that text is very clear what is trying to teach us.
[time=2143] We have to take God seriously.
[time=2147] We have to take God seriously, and we have to take God at his word.
[time=2155] By the way, the New Testament is also clear on this.
[time=2158] You might say, Tiberius, we're not under the Old Covenant, we're not under the Old Testament.
[time=2162] Do you have any New Testament passages for us?
[time=2164] Because we're New Testament believers.
[time=2168] I'm glad you asked.
[time=2170] Jude, verse 7.
[time=2173] Jude, actually I'm going to start in verse 5.
[time=2180] Now I want to remind you, although you once fully knew it, that Jesus who saved the people out of the land of Egypt after destroyed those who did not believe, and the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, beloved their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day, just as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued a natural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire.
[time=2214] So please don't tell me that Jesus changed things, and now sexual immorality is not sexual immorality anymore.
[time=2223] It is the same.
[time=2225] Look in Romans chapter 1.
[time=2227] Paul preaches.
[time=2229] I'm going to start in verse 18.
[time=2231] In Romans chapter 1, "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and righteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.
[time=2242] For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them for His invisible attributes, namely His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived ever since the creation of the world in the things that have been made.
[time=2256] So they are without excuse, for although they knew God, they do not honor Him as God or give thanks to Him.
[time=2262] But they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.
[time=2267] Claiming to be wise, they became fools, and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal men, and birds, and animals, and reptiles.
[time=2278] Therefore, God gave them up in the last of their hearts to impurity to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshipped and served a creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever, amen.
[time=2295] For this reason, God gave them up to dishonorable passions.
[time=2300] For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature, and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the dupe penalty for their error.
[time=2317] And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to an unrighteousness, to a debased mind to do what are not to be done.
[time=2326] They were filled with all manners of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice.
[time=2332] They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness.
[time=2339] They are gossiped, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, and ruthless, though they know God's decree that those who practice such things deserve to die.
[time=2354] They not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.
[time=2359] Tiberius should say, "But we cannot legislate morality." You are right.
[time=2366] But in the process, we have legislated immorality.
[time=2370] We cannot legislate morality.
[time=2376] But in the process, we have legislated immorality.
[time=2380] G.K. Chesterton said, "He who marries the spirit of the age will find himself widowed in the next." You see, the good news is that God can change people.
[time=2396] I want to give you a testimony from David Fountain, conference director of Exodus International.
[time=2404] He talks about the fact that he lived a homosexual lifestyle, but God freed him up and delivered him from that.
[time=2413] He joined the church and he actually says in his testimony, and I quote from him, "As I joined the community and began serving a church, I found those healthy friendships that I had longed for.
[time=2427] I found other guys willing to walk alongside me, keeping me accountable and encourage me." These guys weren't just my friends.
[time=2435] They were God's provision as the very covenant companions I had longed and prayed for.
[time=2440] So why was it worth it?
[time=2442] I no longer walk around confused about my identity, given has given me the wholeness and healing that I was so desperate for.
[time=2450] He not only saved me, he liberated me and continues to liberate me.
[time=2454] I finally understand what it means to just not just to be a Christian, but to have a personal relationship with an awesome, loving and gracious God.
[time=2464] I'm not only free from the bondage of unwanted same-sex attraction.
[time=2468] I continue to act free of anything that hinders my relationship with him.
[time=2473] The processes brought me closer to God and has shown me my complete dependence on him.
[time=2479] As a testimony to his faithfulness in my life, I now serve on staff at Exodus International.
[time=2485] God has taken what he has done in my life to give others hope.
[time=2489] To share the very message that as a student I was so desperate for, my passion is to help the church became a place of safety, refuge and support
[time=2500] for those struggling with unwanted homosexuality.
[time=2504] After all, the churches where I among many others have found healing.
[time=2510] If you tell me that Jesus cannot liberate and save you,
[time=2518] you are telling me he's not powerful enough.
[time=2522] You're telling me he's not strong enough.
[time=2524] You're telling me he's not loving or gracious enough, but the Bible says that we can come to him in repentance and he will save us.
[time=2537] Tiberius, you don't have to worry about me.
[time=2538] I'm not like the people who saw him in Gomorrah.
[time=2542] Listen to what Jesus says.
[time=2545] Listen to what the words of Jesus.
[time=2549] In Luke chapter 3, chapter 13, starting in verse 1, there were some present at the very time who told him about the Galileans whose blood pilot had been all due to their sacrifices.
[time=2563] And he answered them, "Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered in this way?
[time=2570] No, I tell you.
[time=2572] But unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.
[time=2577] Or those 18 on whom the tower of Silom fell and killed them.
[time=2581] Do you think that they were worse offenders than all of others who lived in Jerusalem?
[time=2585] Jesus says, "No, I tell you, but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish."
[time=2592] That's why I titled the sermon "Unless you repent." Not unless they repent, unless we repent.
[time=2602] You see the Bible gives us good news.
[time=2605] But it's good news if we only first understand the bad news.
[time=2609] Look at the bad news, 1 Corinthians 6.
[time=2612] This is the bad news.
[time=2613] Do you now know that their unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God?
[time=2617] Do not be deceived, neither the sexual immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunken, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=2631] Are you on that list?
[time=2635] Look at the good news. The good news is this.
[time=2639] The good news is this, and such were some of you.
[time=2645] Is that good news?
[time=2647] In other words, we hear the people who are saved used to be like that, but we're not because God has saved us. That's the good news.
[time=2657] That's the good news that Jesus can save.
[time=2661] We sang here. The cross has made us flawless.
[time=2666] But we've got to get by the cross. We've got to accept Christ's forgiveness.
[time=2671] Again, look at the list.
[time=2678] The church is full of people who used to be like that, and not like that anymore, because God has changed us and saved us through the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2688] He still has the power and the grace and the willingness to do it.
[time=2693] And such were some of you. That's why I put this in your bullet.
[time=2697] It's there in the middle as a key verse, and such were some of you, and it's in bold,
[time=2703] and such were some of you.
[time=2708] David Fountain, the one I just quoted from you, says, "Our culture is telling youth, men and women to accept and embrace their struggle
[time=2717] as their identity, while the church has remained silent.
[time=2720] We are living in a time where sin is not only being tolerated, it's being celebrated.
[time=2726] The church has a great opportunity. If we will seize this moment, there is a great harvest waiting to be discovered.
[time=2737] Sometimes when I feel down, I like to listen to music.
[time=2743] Sometimes I listen to the great theologian Elvis Presley.
[time=2752] This week I listened to the great theologians, the gaiters. There was a song that came on
[time=2759] that reminded me of God's grace, and what He has done for me.
[time=2767] It says, "Yes, I know. Yes, I know. Jesus' blood can make the vilest sinner clean,
[time=2783] And that's my story, and that's your story.
[time=2788] If you accepted Jesus Christ as your person, Lord and Savior, that's your story, and that's my story, and such were some of us, we can say.
[time=2798] That's why if you struggle with any sin here, we can tell you that all of us have struggled with probably that sin too.
[time=2807] Find someone to talk to.
[time=2811] Find someone to share with, and this leads me to my application this morning.
[time=2818] First of all, study the Bible to know why you believe and to develop biblical convictions.
[time=2823] If we are to share the good news with people, my dear brothers and sisters, we need to know what the Bible says.
[time=2830] Tell them Tiberius said, don't tell them Pastor Jesse said, don't tell them Darren is saying, tell them what the Bible says.
[time=2838] Before you get up to say, "This says the Lord," make sure you know what says the Lord.
[time=2845] Study the Bible and know what it says.
[time=2849] So when someone lies to you, you can counteract that with the truth of Scripture.
[time=2855] And second of all, we got to share the good news that Jesus Christ still saves.
[time=2860] And then He still has the power to change lives for time and eternity.
[time=2868] We have to learn my dear brothers and sisters how to speak the truth in love.
[time=2875] We have to get rid of bad words that are in our vocabulary.
[time=2879] They refer to people that are not like us in a demeaning way.
[time=2884] I can't say those words, but you know what they are.
[time=2888] We have to get rid of those words from our vocabulary.
[time=2891] And we have to stop telling people that we are against them and we have to tell them what we are for.
[time=2897] That we are for Jesus Christ changing their life and giving them a new life not just for time but for eternity.
[time=2905] The world knows what we are against.
[time=2909] Do they know what we are for?
[time=2912] We like to quote John 3.16, right?
[time=2916] "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life." Then verse 17 says, "For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world but in order that the world might be saved through Him." That's the good news.
[time=2934] That's the good news.
[time=2936] But we cannot separate verses 16 from verse from verse 17.
[time=2940] We need to learn how to speak the truth in love.
[time=2944] Share to the you are a sinner saved by grace.
[time=2949] We got to get rid of this.
[time=2952] I am holier than thou mentality.
[time=2956] Sheila Walsh said, "My brokenness is a better bridge for people than my pretend wholeness ever was."
[time=2964] Let me say that again.
[time=2967] "My brokenness is a better bridge for people than my pretend wholeness ever was."
[time=2974] Let's stop pretending that we are not dealing with pressures and temptations like these other people like all the people around us do.
[time=2981] The only difference is that we have the Holy Spirit and we have the word of God and we can say no to these temptations.
[time=2992] Rosaria Butterfield was a tenured professor at Syracuse University.
[time=2999] At the age of 28 she declared herself to be a lesbian.
[time=3005] When she was 36, a pastor and his wife invited her to dinner.
[time=3011] Eventually she served her life to Jesus Christ and then she writes this and I quote,
[time=3017] "When the Lord calls someone to obedience out of a life of sin that's going to hurt a lot of people." It just is.
[time=3026] A lot of people were hurt by my obedience.
[time=3029] I'm grateful that when I had this stirring, I was not in a church that minimized it.
[time=3034] I never heard anyone say, "God has a perfect plan for your life." No.
[time=3039] They said, "Rosaria, count the costs.
[time=3044] This is going to be brutal.
[time=3046] This is going to be bloody." When I said, "Look at all these hurting people." Nobody said, "Serves them right.
[time=3055] Boy, there are a bunch of sinners." No.
[time=3058] Instead of people in church rolled up their sleeves and said, "Okay.
[time=3062] How can we help?
[time=3065] How can we get to know your friends?" We need to understand that Jesus died for all sinners.
[time=3077] Not just the ones that we like or we don't like.
[time=3081] And Paul, when he talks about it, he says, "And I am the chief of sinners."
[time=3088] A few weeks ago, Rich said, "He's the chief of sinners." And I have to agree.
[time=3095] You are the chief of sinners.
[time=3097] I'm a close second.
[time=3098] Oh, maybe there and maybe there is first.
[time=3100] I don't know.
[time=3101] I think we...yeah.
[time=3106] Some things are so serious that we either cry or laugh about it.
[time=3111] But we need to come and say, "This is what the Bible says." As children of God, we will not compromise the truth.
[time=3119] We cannot call sin not sin.
[time=3122] But we also have to come and say, "Jesus Christ died for all sinners." And we also have to come and say, "Look, we are struggling too." In a church this size, I have a feeling people struggle with all types of sins.
[time=3137] But let's not look down upon each other and say, "I am holier than thou." Rather, let's come along ourselves and say, "How can we help?"
[time=3148] "How can we lift these people out of their sin and into a right relationship with Jesus Christ?"
[time=3158] Imagine that you're going to be in an airplane next to a couple.
[time=3163] You might be a homosexual couple or you might be a couple who live in sin.
[time=3168] What's the difference?
[time=3170] They both need Jesus Christ.
[time=3173] And whenever you talk to a couple of deliverance, you never attack what they're doing, right?
[time=3180] Why do we do that with other people?
[time=3183] You know what?
[time=3185] Tell them about Jesus.
[time=3188] And that Jesus is not against them, but Jesus is for them.
[time=3192] For them, coming into a relationship with Him for time and eternity.
[time=3198] We need to tell them the good news, but they also need to understand that if they choose to live a life apart from God,
[time=3206] they will spend a godless eternity without God forever.
[time=3210] And we need to understand that here.
[time=3213] Without Jesus Christ, we are lost forever.
[time=3218] But Jesus Christ came into the world to die for sinners, such as I and such as you.
[time=3226] Let's bow our heads and pray.
[time=3230] And if you want to do business with God and you want to come and surrender your life of Jesus Christ,
[time=3238] maybe you want to confess things that nobody else knows,
[time=3244] we'll have elders here that will pray for you as Darren leads us in singing.
[time=3251] Dear father, we thank you for your word.
[time=3256] I pray that we will learn to take you seriously from Genesis to Revelation.
[time=3263] And not just today, but every day.
[time=3267] I pray that you will give us a spirit of repentance, that we will repent of our sin, wherever that sin is.
[time=3275] Maybe you was mentioned this morning, maybe you was not mentioned this morning.
[time=3280] I pray that you will fill us with your Holy Spirit, give us a sense of repentance that we will confess and repent of our sin and turn from our sin to you.
[time=3291] I pray that if someone here doesn't know you are Lord and Savior, that today will be the day of salvation, that they will surrender their life to you.
[time=3298] I pray that this church will be a light in this dark world, and many people will come to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ as a result of their ministry.
[time=3307] I pray that this will be a safe place where people will come and follow you.
[time=3312] Thank you for your son Jesus Christ who came to redeem us from a life of sin.
[time=3319] Now we go into the world and share the good news that Jesus still saves, that Jesus still saves.
[time=3327] In Christ name I pray. Amen.
[time=3337] Oh Spirit, come make us humble.
[time=3345] Return our eyes from evil things.
[time=3352] Oh Lord, we cast an aridos.
[time=3357] Give us three hands.
[time=3361] Give us your hearts.
[time=3366] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[time=3372] Give us the hands.
[time=3376] Give us your hearts.
[time=3380] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[time=3386] Oh God let us be a generation that sees.
[time=3393] Seek your face, oh God of Jacob.
[time=3400] God let us be a generation that sees.
[time=3407] Seek your face, oh God of Jacob.
[time=3416] We know our hearts, we tend our needs.
[time=3426] Oh Spirit, come make us humble.
[time=3433] Return our eyes from evil things.
[time=3440] Oh Lord, we cast an aridos.
[time=3445] Give us three hands.
[time=3449] Give us your hearts.
[time=3453] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[time=3459] Give us three hands.
[time=3467] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[time=3473] Let us be a generation that sees.
[time=3479] Seek your face, oh God of Jacob.
[time=3486] God let us be a generation that sees.
[time=3493] Seek your face, oh God of Jacob.
[time=3503] So give us clean hands.
[time=3507] Give us your hearts.
[time=3511] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[time=3518] Give us clean hands.
[time=3522] Give us your hearts.
[time=3526] Let us not lift our souls to another.
