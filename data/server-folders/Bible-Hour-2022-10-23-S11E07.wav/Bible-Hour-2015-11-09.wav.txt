[time=160] King Kingston, who knew no sin, that we might become.
[time=168] It's righteousness that we humbled himself in the cross.
[time=179] Love so amazing.
[time=191] Jesus, the sire, may love all be less than a demon.
[time=209] Man you were, the rescue for sinners, the ransom from heaven.
[time=227] Jesus, the sire, lie upon His mighty love bread, His blood the one.
[time=246] Prove Him for now, all for love, the heart of tremble and the family's soul.
[time=260] But so amazing.
[time=266] Love so amazing.
[time=272] Jesus, the sire, may love all be less than a demon.
[time=290] Man you were, the rescue for sinners, the ransom from heaven.
[time=308] Jesus the sire, lie upon.
[time=320] All our hope is in you.
[time=332] All our glory to you now, the light of the world.
[time=344] All our hope is in you.
[time=356] All our glory to you now, the light of the world.
[time=371] Jesus, the sire, may love all be less than a demon.
[time=389] Man you were, the rescue for sinners, the ransom from heaven.
[time=407] Jesus the sire, lie upon.
[time=437] All our glory to you now, the light of the world.
[time=799] Then Jacob made a vow saying, "If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear so that I come again to my father's house in peace, then the Lord shall be my God."
[time=815] And this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house, and of all that you give me, I will give you a full tenth to you.
[time=829] At the beginning of Genesis, we saw how God reveals himself as Yahweh, as the God who makes a covenant with his people.
[time=840] But we are not introduced to God to Yahweh as a covenant making and a covenant keeping God before we learn that he's actually the powerful Creator who creates everything.
[time=854] But the Creator God wants to be in a relationship with us through covenant.
[time=859] So he makes a covenant with Abraham and he makes those three promises. I'm going to make you a great nation. I'll give you a great name and I'll give you a great, what's the third one? Land, that's right.
[time=872] Name, nation, and land. Now for them to have all these things, we need generation after generation to keep on these covenant promises, but God is not just Yahweh, the covenant making God, he's the covenant keeping God.
[time=891] Because we saw that Abraham was not a perfect man, he made mistake after mistake, but the covenant is dependent on God alone, he will keep his end of the covenant.
[time=907] And we see how over and over God keeps his covenant promises. I don't know what English version you are using, but whenever you get to the word Lord, and it's good capital L, that usually means that that word Lord is the English translation of this word Yahweh.
[time=929] It's a special name, it's a covenant making and a covenant keeping God. We get to chapter 24 in Genesis and the focus shifts from Abraham to Isaac because in chapter 23 Sarah dies.
[time=948] In chapter 25 we'll see that Abraham dies. So in chapter 24 we have Isaac and Abraham is looking for a spouse or a wife for Isaac. Sarah dies in chapter 23, Abraham dies in chapter 25, and we learn very quickly that a generation comes and a generation goes, but God is the same.
[time=971] And we need to know that because a generation always comes and a generation always goes, but God will be the same God who will keep his covenant promises.
[time=984] At the end we'll see that there is a change between the matriarch and the patriarch of the family, but first we see that Abraham cares about his son's future and he wants a wife.
[time=1000] He wants a wife for Isaac, his son, and in chapter 24 verse 3 he commands his servant not to take a wife or Isaac from the daughters of the Canaanites.
[time=1015] Now remember as Moses is writing this they are about to enter the land of Canaan. So he wants to make sure, hey, don't get any wives from the Canaanites because remember God always spoke against intermarriage with the pagans nations.
[time=1031] And here he is careful to select a bride for his son from those who worship Yahweh. And he sends his servant, by the way his servant is nameless.
[time=1043] We don't know who is the servant. He doesn't have a name in this story. He is not that important in this story, but we see that he is faithful.
[time=1053] First of all, before we get to verses 18 and 19, look please in chapter 24 verses 12 through 14. This servant asks for guidance from God, from Yahweh.
[time=1063] Said, "O Lord, God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today and show steadfast love to my master Abraham.
[time=1072] Behold, I am standing by the spring of water and the daughters of men of the city are coming out to draw water. Let the young woman to whom I shall say, please take your jar that I may drink, and who shall say drink and I will water your camels. Let her be the one to whom you have appointed for your servant Isaac.
[time=1091] By this I shall know that you have shown steadfast love to my master." What's interesting about this request is that the servant is not asking for a miracle.
[time=1102] He's asking for something that goes on every day. And we see that his prayer is answered in verses 21 through 25.
[time=1121] Then the man gazed at her as silence to learn whether the Lord has prospered him his journey or not. When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing a half shekel and two bracelets for her arms weighing ten gold shekels and said, "Please tell me whose daughter you are. Is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?"
[time=1139] She said to him, "I am the daughter of Bethwell, the son of Milka whom she brought to Nahore." She added, "We have plenty of both straw and father and room to spend the night."
[time=1151] What we see here is that God Yahweh is guiding the servant to a place where he will select a bride for Isaac.
[time=1162] It's the same way God directed Abraham from earth the Chaldeans to the Promised Land. It is the same God who directed Abraham to Mount Moriah where God provided their am for the burnt offering in place of Isaac.
[time=1180] It is the same God that now guides and he provides. She said, "Drink my Lord," and she quickly let her jar upon her hand and gave him a drink. When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, "I will draw water in your camels also until they have finished drinking."
[time=1200] Like what Kent Hughes says, there will be no miracle in this story. As we usually think of miracles, no rearrangement of molecules, no sun standing still, no healing, no river stopped up.
[time=1213] Rather, God will bring about the acquiring of Isaac's bride through the normal events of life, the delays, the customs, the stresses, the chance meetings.
[time=1225] As J.I. Packer says, "Believers are never in the grip of blind fortune. Blind forces, fortune, chance, luck, fate. All that happens to them is divinely planned, and each event comes as a new summons to trust, obey, and rejoice."
[time=1245] Not only is God providing and He's guiding, but we see as a result the faithful worships and blesses God.
[time=1257] The servant realizes what's going on here. He realizes that God guided and He provided.
[time=1264] That's why He worships God, verses 26 and 27. The man bowed, he said, and worshiped the Lord and said, "Blessed be the Lord, the God of my master, Abraham, who has not forsaken His steadfast love."
[time=1278] Very important word right there. And His faithfulness toward my master, as for me the Lord has led me in the way to the house of my master's kinsmen.
[time=1288] My dear brothers and sisters, the proper response to God's guidance and providence and to God's guidance and blessing to us should be worshiped.
[time=1299] Our worshiping God should be a response to who God is and what He has done. That's why we cannot say we're only worshiping Sunday morning at 10.30. That would be a huge mistake.
[time=1310] Our worship should be every day, all day long. And it's because of His steadfast love. I usually don't like to talk about Hebrew and Greek and all those fancy languages, but I'm going to teach you one Hebrew word today that you'll need to know for the rest of your life.
[time=1327] It's this word for steadfast love. In Hebrew is the word Hhesed. Repeat after me, Hhesed. Very important word. It's the covenant loyal love that God has for us in the New Testament that you'll be translated as Agape, the sacrificial love.
[time=1347] It's God's love for us. And notice how many times He talks about this Hhesed, this steadfast love. It's in verse 12 when He prays, says, "O Lord God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today and show Hhesed, show steadfast love to my master Abraham."
[time=1365] And then in verse 14, "By this I shall know that you have shown Hhesed, steadfast love to my master, and now in verse 27, blessed be the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his Hhesed, his steadfast love, his loyal love in other versions, and his faithfulness toward my master."
[time=1387] And I like the end of this story. Look at the end of chapter 24, how the story ends. You have this arranged marriage, not by people, but arranged by God Himself.
[time=1407] Now Isaac had returned from the Ehrla High Royal and was dwelling in the Negev. And Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward the evening and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold there were camels coming.
[time=1419] And Rebecca lifted up her eyes and when she saw Isaac she dismounted from the camel and said to the servant, "Who is that man walking in the field to meet us?"
[time=1430] The servant said, "It is my master." So she took her veil and covered herself and the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. Then Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah, his mother, and to Rebecca and she became his wife and he loved her.
[time=1446] So Isaac was comforted after his mother's death. And we learned that our generation comes and our generation goes, but God is faithful and he guides and he provides.
[time=1463] What is the practical lesson for us? For those of us who are parents, we need to learn how to pray and to pray specifically for our children's futures.
[time=1474] That God will give them Godly, Godly spouses, who will love them, will love God, and together they can love God.
[time=1487] Maybe your children are very small. You can't start too early.
[time=1494] I started praying for my boys' wives when they were little and I'm still praying the same prayer. God give them Godly wives. They will love you and will love them and together they can serve and love you.
[time=1512] Pray early and pray specifically. Think about how specific this prayer was. It's okay to pray specific prayers.
[time=1525] The end result is that Sarah, the matriarch is replaced by Rebecca. Rebecca is now the matriarch of the family and Isaac becomes the patriarch of the family because in chapter 25 we see that Abraham dies.
[time=1544] The second lesson we're learning in chapter 25, in chapter 25 is that God makes a choice.
[time=1552] We have a few very important theological lessons here. God is not just the creator and the covenant maker, but God elects a people.
[time=1563] There's the doctrine of election. In chapter 25 starting in verse 19, these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son, Abraham fathered Isaac, and Isaac was 40 years old when he took Rebecca to be his wife.
[time=1579] The daughter of Beth welder, the Aramean of Padan Aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, and Isaac prayed to the Lord for his wife because she was barren and the Lord granted his prayer on Rebecca, his wife conceived.
[time=1592] Where have you heard this problem of the wife being barren? Have you heard it before? Yeah, it happened with Abraham and Sarah, but Isaac does not repeat his father's mistake.
[time=1604] Instead, he actually goes to God in prayer. Isaac prayed to the Lord for his wife.
[time=1613] Men, we learn in these chapters that not only are we to pray for our children, we are to pray for our wives.
[time=1623] Sometimes we pray about everything and anything and we forget to pray for our wives. It seems to me that we need to start there first.
[time=1635] And we see that God listens to the prayer of Isaac starting in verse 22.
[time=1648] The children struggle together within her and she said, "If it is thus, why is this happening to me?"
[time=1654] God, here's Isaac's prayer, Rebecca becomes pregnant, so she went to inquire of the Lord what's going on in her belly.
[time=1663] And the Lord said to her, "Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you shall be divided.
[time=1668] The one shall be stronger than the other and the older, the older shall serve the younger."
[time=1676] We are very, very important concept here. God is making a choice about who is going to be the leader.
[time=1686] In the Hebrew, it's very interesting, it says here that the children smash themselves inside of her.
[time=1693] Now, I assume only women who are pregnant can understand this, especially those of you who had twins.
[time=1703] But just like Isaac, Rebecca understands the importance of prayer, and she also prays to the Lord.
[time=1709] And God says to them a few very important things. There are two heads of nations in your womb.
[time=1715] They will be divided and the older, yourself, the younger.
[time=1720] We call this sovereign election. By sovereign election, Ross says God declared that the promised line would belong to Jacob the younger son.
[time=1729] Jacob thus owed his supremacy not to natural order or to human will, but to divine election.
[time=1737] Again, we learn very important. God is not just the creator. God is not just the covenant maker,
[time=1743] but God is the one who leads the doctrine of what we call election.
[time=1748] In his sovereign grace, God chooses Jacob over Esau.
[time=1754] Paul picks this up in Romans 9 when he explains not only so, but we also, when Rebecca had conceived children by one man, our forefather Isaac.
[time=1765] Though they were not yet born and had not yet either good or bad, they had done neither good or bad.
[time=1772] In order that God's purpose of election might continue, not because of works, but because of his call, she was told the older will serve the younger.
[time=1783] And this is exactly what's going to happen.
[time=1787] And we see that the faithful acknowledge God's sovereign plan, starting in verse 24 of chapter 25.
[time=1797] When her days to give birth were completed, behold, there were twins in her womb.
[time=1802] The first came out red, all his body like a hairy cloak, so they called his name Esau. Esau means red or reddish.
[time=1815] Afterward, his brother came out with his hand holding Esau's heel. Try to imagine the scene.
[time=1823] The twin comes out of the one, the second one, holding his brother's heel.
[time=1832] So they named him Jacob. You ready for this?
[time=1837] Literally, Jacob means the one who grabs the heel.
[time=1844] Grabber boy. And God hears the faithful when they pray, but God chooses the recipient of the promises, not on human merit, but by sovereign election.
[time=1860] And you might say, "Oh, they understand that and they're going to listen to that and they're going to live happily ever after, right? No."
[time=1867] See, sometimes we learn, just like people before them, that sometimes we make mistakes.
[time=1874] Sometimes we act on impulse and miss certain blessings.
[time=1878] Now, don't get me wrong, God would have kept his promises, no doubt.
[time=1882] But what's happening here, many times we miss God's blessings before we're trying, because we're trying to resolve problems by worldly methods.
[time=1892] And that's what's happening in this text. It's really interesting what's happening here.
[time=1901] Jacob and Esau grow up, and Esau is the hunter. Jacob is more of a mama's boy. He likes to stay home.
[time=1914] The Bible says that, "But look what happens now when they grow up.
[time=1923] Once when Jacob was cooking stew, Esau came in from the field and he was exhausted.
[time=1929] And Esau said to Jacob, "Let me eat some of that red stew, for I am exhausted. Therefore his name was called Edom.
[time=1938] The second time we have this motif of red. He came out to read from his mother's womb, and now he wants to eat some red stew."
[time=1948] Literally in Hebrew it's giving you some of that red stuff. There's no word for stew.
[time=1959] The descendants of Esau are called Edomites. See, therefore his name was called Edom.
[time=1965] As they're going towards the promised land, can you guess through what country they're going to go?
[time=1970] They're going to go through the country of Edom.
[time=1974] They're learning their ancient history here. What's going on here?
[time=1979] But Esau is a card-carrying member of the Instant Gratification Club.
[time=1986] That's what's happening here. I want it and I want it now. I don't want to wait.
[time=1993] The New Testament helps us. The Hebrews 12 says, "See that to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God.
[time=2000] The no root of bitterness brings up and causes trouble, and by it many become defiled.
[time=2005] Then no one is sexually immoral and unholy like Esau."
[time=2012] Do you see where the problem is? Here, this is not just an election based on anything.
[time=2018] Everyone knows the future. And Esau becomes sexually immoral and unholy like Esau,
[time=2024] who sold his birthright for a single meal. Jacob is shrewd.
[time=2033] And Jacob says, "sell me your birthright now." Esau said, "I'm about to die of what uses a birthright to me."
[time=2040] Jacob said, "swear to me now." So he soared to him and sold his birthright to Jacob.
[time=2045] Jacob gave Esau bread and lentils to and he ate and drank and rose and went his way.
[time=2050] Thus Esau despised his birthright.
[time=2055] My dear, what's the big deal of the firstborn? I mean, I have two older sons and the oldest son doesn't have any more rights than I do.
[time=2065] In our culture, that's probably true. But not so in the ancient Near Eastern cultures.
[time=2071] In some cultures, it is the same.
[time=2075] But it seems that in the ancient Near East, the oldest son would get two-thirds of the inheritance
[time=2083] versus the one-third if there were only two children.
[time=2087] There were blessings that would come with being the first born.
[time=2091] And Esau says, "I don't need any of that because he lives by the model.
[time=2096] I eat, drink, and be merry." Esau not only treated his birthright as worthless
[time=2103] by trading it for lentils, soup, or by a soup of some sort, but he came to despise it the Bible says.
[time=2110] As one scholar puts it, "We learn that profane people are willing to relinquish things of lasting
[time=2116] spiritual value because they live to satisfy their basic appetites."
[time=2122] And we live that in that society today.
[time=2128] But not only is Esau in the wrong, we see that Jacob, even Rebecca,
[time=2135] are trying to employ worldly methods to get the blessing.
[time=2141] And again, the principle is that sometimes God's people create tension by using worldly methods.
[time=2149] We are set up in chapter 27.
[time=2157] Chapter 27 at the beginning sets up the story.
[time=2161] When Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, he called Esau, his older brother, his older son, and he said to him, "My son," and he answered, "Here I am," he said, "Behold, I am old, I do not know that they have my death.
[time=2173] Now take your weapons, your equivalent, your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me and prepare for me delicious food such as I love and bring it to me so that I may eat, that my soul may bless you before I die."
[time=2188] Now, Rebecca was listening when Esau spoke to his son, Esau.
[time=2194] You see, Isaac realizes that he is old, so he decides it's time to bless the first born.
[time=2201] He knows how things should go.
[time=2204] But what we see here is we see a lesson and unfortunately of what not to do.
[time=2213] Not only does Rebecca do this, but Jacob is in on it.
[time=2219] And they're trying to solve this idea of a blessing by deceptive means.
[time=2226] Deception, my dear brothers and sisters, is never God approved.
[time=2233] Just like Abraham does earlier in chapter 16, looks like Rebecca says, "God, I think I need to help you on this one.
[time=2241] I'm not going to wait for Jacob to be blessed.
[time=2244] I'm going to do it on my own." And to do that, notice please, it almost looks like a comedy.
[time=2252] If you think about it, it looks like a really bad comedy/tragedy.
[time=2259] When Esau went to the field to hunt for the game and bring it, Rebecca said to her son, "I heard your father speak to your brother Esau.
[time=2266] Bring me game and prepare for me delicious food that I may eat.
[time=2270] And bless you before the Lord, before I die." Now, therefore, my son, obey my voice and I commend you.
[time=2277] Go to the flock and bring me two young goats so that I may prepare them.
[time=2282] Delicious food for your father such as he loves.
[time=2285] And you shall bring it to your father to eat so that he may bless you before he dies.
[time=2291] By the way, who decided that Jacob will be blessed?
[time=2295] God did. God did.
[time=2298] But Rebecca says, "I'm going to help God on this one.
[time=2301] And in order to do that, I'm going to employ deception."
[time=2308] Now, Jacob wants to go with this, but not because he's a man of integrity, but he's afraid he's going to get caught.
[time=2315] Right? That's what he says.
[time=2317] He says, "Behold, my brother Esau is a hairy man and I'm a smooth man.
[time=2322] Perhaps my father will feel my arms.
[time=2325] I shall seem to be mocking him and bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing." His mother said to him, "Let the curse be on me, my son.
[time=2334] Only obey my voice and go bring them to me." Can you imagine the absurd scene?
[time=2344] Some people say, "Well, yeah, but Rebecca is only trying to help God out.
[time=2349] If Rebecca would not have intervened, the blessing would have gone to Esau." Really?
[time=2355] If you believe that, your God is way too small.
[time=2358] If God says we'll do something, he will do something.
[time=2361] He doesn't need your help of deception.
[time=2364] As Griffith Thomas said, righteousness can never be laid aside, even though our object is yet more righteousness.
[time=2373] In personal life, in home life, in church life, in endeavors to win men for Christ, in missionary enterprise, in social improvement, and in everything connected with the welfare of humanity, we must insist upon absolute righteousness, purity, and truth in our methods,
[time=2390] or else we will bring utter discredit on the cause of our master and lord.
[time=2398] Sometimes we do the same and we think we want to help God out.
[time=2406] They go on with the plan.
[time=2409] They go through the plan.
[time=2412] Imagine the scene Jacob goes before his father.
[time=2416] His father fills the hair on his arms.
[time=2422] How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son, verse 20?
[time=2426] He answered, "Because the Lord, your God granted me success."
[time=2433] The use of religious language to cover up sinful behavior is simply wrong.
[time=2440] Let me say that again.
[time=2442] The use of religious language to cover up sinful behavior is simply wrong.
[time=2447] Do we do that?
[time=2450] We do that. We do that too.
[time=2454] For example, someone messes up and you want to gossip about it, but you can't because you know gossip is a sin.
[time=2461] So you go to your little group and you say, you know, this is just a prayer request.
[time=2467] Have you heard that before?
[time=2469] I'm just telling you this so we can pray about it.
[time=2473] And you proceed to gossip about something that someone else has done.
[time=2479] And you're employing your religious language to cover up your sin.
[time=2483] That's wrong.
[time=2488] Or, I see a lot of young people here.
[time=2491] Young people, you want to date someone and they're not a believer, and you say to your parents, "Yeah, yeah, but I'm praying for her salvation." Right?
[time=2499] Employing your religious language to cover up sinful behavior that never works.
[time=2504] There's no such thing as missionary dating.
[time=2510] I mean, if you're two missionaries, yeah, you can date.
[time=2514] You know what I mean.
[time=2518] Or, you're a businessman.
[time=2522] And you cut corners.
[time=2524] You cut ethical corners.
[time=2527] And then you say, "Praise the Lord, my business is going well." That's sinful.
[time=2534] Just because you employ religious language to cover that sin, that doesn't make it right, it's just as wrong.
[time=2541] Righteousness can never be laid aside even though our object is yet more righteousness.
[time=2551] You know the end of the story.
[time=2556] God blesses Jacob and then Esau comes home and he's distraught because he realizes
[time=2567] that he's not going to get the blessing.
[time=2570] By the way, who's guilty of that?
[time=2572] Who sold his right?
[time=2574] He's the right of his firstborn, he did, didn't he?
[time=2578] But now he wants the blessing that he gave up.
[time=2584] He finds out what happened.
[time=2586] The Bible says that Esau, that Isaac trembled very violently and said, "Who was the then that hunted the game and brought it to me and ate it all before you came?
[time=2596] And I have blessed him.
[time=2597] Yes, and he shall be blessed as soon as Esau heard these words of his father.
[time=2601] He cried out to an exceedingly great and bitter cry and said to his father, "Bless me, even me also, oh my father." But he said, "Your brother came deceitfully and he has taken away your blessing." Esau said, "Is he not right named Jacob?" Remember his name?
[time=2616] The one who grabs the heel.
[time=2618] What he's saying, "He grabbed my blessing." But he doesn't say that actually he gave it up.
[time=2624] Either way, the Bible says he has cheated me these two times.
[time=2628] He took away my birthright and behold now he has taken away my blessing.
[time=2632] While we learn in Genesis chapter 3, "Failure to accept responsibility for sin" is the direct consequence of sin.
[time=2643] Then he said, "Have you not reserved a blessing for me?" Isaac answered and he said to Esau, "Behold, I have made him Lord over you and all his brothers I have given him to him for servants and with grain and wine I have sustained him.
[time=2659] What then can I do for you, my son?" Esau said to his father, "Have you but one blessing, my father?
[time=2666] Bless me even me also, oh my father." And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.
[time=2671] Then Isaac, his father answered and said to him, "Behold, away from the fatness of the earth shall your dwelling be and away from the do of heaven on high, by your sword you shall live and you shall serve your brother, but when you grow restless you shall break his yoke from your neck." And what happens after this?
[time=2692] Esau now wants to kill Jacob.
[time=2696] Did Rebecca solve anything?
[time=2699] No, what Rebecca did, she complicated matters.
[time=2702] And that's what we do when we are not ready to wait for God's promise.
[time=2707] It's exactly what happened with Abraham when he went into Hagar and had Ishmael.
[time=2712] When we don't want to wait for God's promises to be fulfilled and want to resolve them in worldly methods, we always produce complications.
[time=2721] If we do that, my dear brothers and sisters, let's not look up to heaven and say, "Why me, Lord?" Because you know why.
[time=2730] Let's not even go to the religious language and say, "Oh, God is doing this to me." No, you did it with your own hands.
[time=2739] But we are made very fast and very quick to blame God for what's happening to us, even though what he might be is we are suffering the consequences of our own sin.
[time=2750] Fortunately, we learned that God is still with his people, looking in chapter 28.
[time=2761] My time is always gone, so I'm going to have to run through this.
[time=2765] Jacob is running from his brother Esau.
[time=2769] Esau is trying now to kill Jacob.
[time=2772] So Jacob is running away.
[time=2777] But the Bible says that as he's running away from his brother,
[time=2783] and as he's paying the consequences for his deception, because this is what this is, God still appears to him.
[time=2793] And we need to learn that even though we mess up, God is still with us.
[time=2798] Isn't that beautiful?
[time=2800] I can put my head on my pillow tonight, that even though I mess up many, many times, God is still with me.
[time=2808] Because he's not with me based on what I have done, but he's with me based on what Jesus Christ has done for me.
[time=2816] And he's with me because the Holy Spirit dwells within me, and he will never leave me nor forsake me.
[time=2822] That should give me peace.
[time=2827] Starting in verse 12 of chapter 28, "And he dreamed that behold there was a ladder, set up on the earth, and top of a rich to heaven.
[time=2834] And behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on them.
[time=2837] And behold, the Lord stood above it and said, "I am Yahweh.
[time=2840] I am the Lord, the God of Abraham, your father, and the God of Isaac.
[time=2844] The land on which you lie, I will give to you in your offspring.
[time=2847] Your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south, and in you.
[time=2855] And your offspring shall all the families of the earth shall be blessed." Have you heard that before?
[time=2860] Yeah, that was the promise given to Abraham.
[time=2863] But again, we learn that a generation comes and a generation goes, but God will still keep his promises.
[time=2868] And he makes the same promises, he made to Abraham.
[time=2871] He made them to Isaac and now he makes them to Jacob again.
[time=2874] And we learn again that we have one story of salvation from Genesis to Revelation.
[time=2878] There are not many stories, it's one story.
[time=2881] And that's why we have the Gospel project, not the Gospel projects.
[time=2886] It's one project from beginning to end.
[time=2891] God wanting us to be in a relationship with Him through covenant.
[time=2900] Verse 15, "Behold, I am with you, and I will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land, for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you." Jacob realizes what's going on and he worships God.
[time=2919] And the last two things I want to talk about is this, the faithful worship through remembrance.
[time=2926] What Jacob does, he takes the stone on which he slept and puts it in the middle of the desert.
[time=2931] Now if you walk through the desert and you find a stone, you know that someone put it there.
[time=2938] And in this case, the Bible says that he wanted this to be for remembrance.
[time=2946] Early in the morning, Jacob took the stone and he had put it under, he said, and set it up for a pillar and poured oil.
[time=2953] Later in the law, we'll see that it represents worship.
[time=2959] You pour out an offering.
[time=2963] He called the name of that place, "Beth El, the house of God."
[time=2970] Previously it was called "Lose," which means "Almond." Now if you like to eat almonds, this was called "Almond" or "Almond."
[time=2982] And then he says, "Now it's the house of God." Jacob didn't have a congregation to join him in worship, but by naming that place "Beth El, the house of God," he was inviting people to worship for generations to come.
[time=3000] That's why when we come, we come to the house of God.
[time=3004] Every time we worship, we are at battle.
[time=3008] We are worshiping in the house of God and the faithful worship through dedication.
[time=3015] Notice, please, what Jacob says.
[time=3019] Starting in verse 20, then Jacob made a vow saying, "If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go, and I will give my bread to eat and clothing to wear so that I come again to my Father's house in peace, then the Lord shall be my God, and the stone which I have set up for a pillar shall be God's house." And all of that you give me, I will give a full tent to you.
[time=3042] We have a here worship through dedication and worship through commitment.
[time=3048] How do we apply this truth?
[time=3050] First of all, we need to develop a life of prayer.
[time=3056] Ask God and learn how to pray specific prayers.
[time=3062] Again, for your children, for your spouse, for your family, for the world, ask specific prayers, just like Abraham's nameless servant,
[time=3072] just like Isaac, just like Rebecca.
[time=3075] We pray and we need to learn to pray unselfishly, but specifically.
[time=3081] Second, take comfort in God's presence.
[time=3083] Like Jacob, we do have God's promise of He's being present with us and probably the best verses that we can think about are the words of Jesus in Matthew 28.
[time=3096] And while we call the great commission, Matthew 28,
[time=3102] all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[time=3105] Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to obey and to observe all that I have commanded you.
[time=3115] And behold, I am with you, how long?
[time=3118] Always until the end of the age.
[time=3122] Take comfort in God's presence.
[time=3125] If Jesus Christ is now your Lord and Savior, you don't have that.
[time=3129] How awful life must be without knowing that God is with you.
[time=3135] How miserable life can be without knowing that God is in you through the Holy Spirit.
[time=3142] I'm here to tell you that life can be so much better when Jesus Christ becomes your Lord and Savior.
[time=3147] I'm not saying that all your problems will be solved, but I don't know two things.
[time=3151] You'll get eternal life and forgiveness of sin, and that gives anybody peace.
[time=3158] Lastly, we need to worship God through dedication and commitment.
[time=3164] We have so many opportunities at this church to give you.
[time=3167] I heard a few and I know there are many others.
[time=3170] Let's learn to worship God by giving ourselves to Him.
[time=3175] Let's pray.
[time=3178] Dear Father, your word is so rich.
[time=3182] Thank you for revealing yourself to us as the creator God, as the covenant-making God, and especially as the God who keeps His covenant promises.
[time=3194] I pray that you forgive us for the many times when, instead of praying and waiting for your answer, we go ahead of you and we make a mess of things, and we come up with worldly methods,
[time=3210] and we produce complications.
[time=3212] Forgive us.
[time=3214] We pray that we intervene in our lives if that's the case, and bless us.
[time=3220] Thank you for the fact that we have your presence and your power, not just today, but every day.
[time=3227] Feel us with your Holy Spirit.
[time=3229] Make us good witnesses to a lost and dying world.
[time=3233] As we go through the day, may we tell people that Jesus Christ still saves, and Jesus Christ still changes lives.
[time=3243] We pray for comfort for those who are hurting in France, in Lebanon,
[time=3253] in America, all over the world.
[time=3256] May you show yourself strong, and may many people come to the saving knowledge of you.
[time=3260] Help us to trust in you, your greatness, and your faithfulness.
[time=3266] In Christ name I pray. Amen.
