[time=813] Genesis 32, 24 through 32, and Jacob was left alone and a man wrestled with him until the breaking of day.
[time=823] The man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he touched his hip socket, and Jacob's hip was put out of joint as he wrestled with him.
[time=833] Then he said, "Let me go for the day has broken, but Jacob said I will not let you go unless you bless me."
[time=840] And he said to him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Jacob." Then he said, "Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men and have prevailed."
[time=853] Then Jacob asked him, "Please tell me your name." But he said, "Why is it that you ask my name?" And there he blessed him.
[time=862] So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, saying, "For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been delivered."
[time=870] The sun rose up upon him as he passed Peniel limping because of his hip.
[time=876] Therefore, to this day, the people of Israel do not eat the sinew of the thigh that is on the hip socket because he touched the socket of Jacob's hip on the sinew of the thigh.
[time=892] Good morning. Thank you, Matt. Darren, the choir and the band for leading us in worship so far. Please open your Bibles to Genesis 31.
[time=903] While you do that, I want to wish you a happy Thanksgiving.
[time=907] As a family, we are grateful that we can be here to minister during such a time as this.
[time=914] And as we said before, my title is interim preaching pastor. Matt, can you read my lips? Interim. Interim.
[time=926] To use a, maybe you can understand a baseball analogy better. I am what you call a relief pitcher.
[time=935] The one that can only go like one inning. If you put that guy to pitch the whole game, it will be a disaster.
[time=943] But let's talk about the Bible because I have to do about four or five chapters in 35 minutes.
[time=953] It's like trying to get a penny hose on a wild cat in a telephone booth.
[time=960] I know what you're asking. What's a telephone booth?
[time=966] Ask your grandparents.
[time=974] From the beginning, we saw that God, the Creator God wants to be in a relationship with people.
[time=979] And he wants to be in a relationship through what the Bible calls a covenant.
[time=984] So God made a covenant with Abraham and promised him three things. A great name, a great nation and a great land.
[time=992] And then he kept, he started fulfilling his promises.
[time=997] Abraham had a son named Isaac. And Isaac had Jacob and Esau. And we saw last time how Jacob, even though he was younger, got to be leading Esau.
[time=1012] He got the first born right.
[time=1018] We didn't have time to do this, but in chapters 29 and 30, we see that deceiver Jacob is deceived himself.
[time=1028] Just like Jacob deceived his brother with the help of his mother, now Jacob himself is deceived by the one who will become his father-in-law, Laban.
[time=1043] You know the story. Jacob falls in love and he wants to marry Rachel.
[time=1054] And he works for her for seven years. And in the wedding night, again, verse chapters 29 and 30.
[time=1062] And again, we can't really understand in our Western Esau this happens, but on the wedding night,
[time=1070] Jacob goes to bed and it's not Rachel, her sister, Leah.
[time=1077] And he wakes up in the morning and the Bible says, and behold, there was Leah.
[time=1085] We don't have time to go through all the explanations, but basically what happens is Jacob ends up with both Rachel as a wife and Leah as a wife.
[time=1101] As a result of him being deceived by his own father-in-law, Genesis 29, 25 and behold, in the morning, there was Leah.
[time=1117] Now look at me in chapter 31. We fast forward to chapter 31.
[time=1124] Now, Jacob heard that the sons of Laban were saying, Jacob has taken all that our father was our fathers and from all of our fathers, he has gained all his wealth.
[time=1134] And Jacob saw that Laban did not regard him with favor as before.
[time=1138] The first principle, my dear brothers and sisters, is that sometimes God speaks indirectly through our circumstances.
[time=1147] Some of you maybe have worked for Laban. You have been treated unfairly.
[time=1153] And sometimes you see the writing on the wall and you think it's time for me to move on.
[time=1159] But it is very important for us to rely on the Holy Spirit and to know when it's time to move on.
[time=1166] In this case, God was speaking through Jacob indirectly through his circumstances.
[time=1175] Jacob has taken all that was our fathers and from what was our fathers, he has gained all this weight, all this wealth.
[time=1185] Laban, Jacob's father-in-law was not very happy either.
[time=1189] Laban realized that God was prospering Jacob at his expense and Laban's attitude changed as well.
[time=1195] Verse 2 says, "And Jacob saw that Laban did not regard him with favor as before.
[time=1201] Sometimes we need to understand circumstances that sometimes God speaks through circumstances."
[time=1210] For example, if the elders would come and say, "Tiberius, we want to reward you for what you've done."
[time=1216] And here's the one-way ticket to Siberia.
[time=1222] You should be able to parse that and say, "I've got to learn something to that circumstance."
[time=1230] It's not the case.
[time=1232] My point is that we need to understand through the Holy Spirit what is going on.
[time=1236] And sometimes God does speak through circumstances.
[time=1240] In this case, God was speaking to Jacob through the bitterness of the brothers-in-law and through Laban's ugly mood.
[time=1250] Sometimes we are in that position.
[time=1252] Again, some of you know, some of you actually have shared that you have worked for Laban.
[time=1259] And the worst case of that is when Laban is actually family.
[time=1265] Sometimes God speaks indirectly through circumstances, but most of the time God speaks directly through his word.
[time=1273] In Genesis 31, verse 3, God actually appears to Jacob and talks to him directly.
[time=1280] Then the Lord said to Jacob, "Return to the land of your fathers and to your kindred, and I will be with you."
[time=1292] A long time has passed, but finally God says to Jacob, "Go back to where you came from."
[time=1300] And we need to understand that we need to learn how to wait for God's word to us.
[time=1305] Even though he speaks sometimes through circumstances, sometimes he will speak directly to his word, and we need to understand the difference.
[time=1313] We need to learn the art of waiting on God.
[time=1318] Psalm 37, 34 says, "Wait for the Lord and keep his way, and he will exalt you to inherit the land."
[time=1325] Isaiah 40, verses 30 and 31, "Even youths shall faint and be weary, and young men shall fall exhausted, but they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength."
[time=1334] "They shall mount up with wings like eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint."
[time=1343] Is waiting laziness?
[time=1346] G. Campbell Morgan, the famed preacher of London's Westminster Chapel, said this, "Waiting for God is not laziness; waiting for God is not going to sleep; waiting for God is not the abandonment of effort; waiting for God means first activity under command."
[time=1363] Second, readiness for any new command that might come.
[time=1367] Third, the ability to do nothing until the command is given.
[time=1371] Lamentations 3, 25, 26, "The Lord is good to those who wait for him, to the soul who seeks him.
[time=1379] It is good that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord."
[time=1385] God appears to Jacob and speaks to him directly through his word. He spoke to him indirectly through circumstances, but now he speaks directly to his word.
[time=1395] And God promises his presence, "I will be with you."
[time=1401] The promise of presence is very, very important. It appears over and over again in Scripture.
[time=1408] "I will be with you." It's God's comforting and encouraging promise.
[time=1415] But since Jacob is a husband, he needs to inform his wife, excuse me, his wife's, of what God has been telling him.
[time=1427] By the way, I think we established why we are against polygamy, right? We're established, okay?
[time=1435] Because no one can serve two masters. For those of you who are not here, the son that we established that.
[time=1442] No, no, that was Mark Twain.
[time=1447] But notice, please, now Jacob will look back and recall how God has blessed him, and he's sharing that with his wife's.
[time=1460] Starting in verse 4.
[time=1465] So Jacob sent a cold Rachel and Leon to the field where his flock was and said to them, "I see that your father does not regard me with favor as he did before,
[time=1475] but the God of my father has been with me." Jacob teaches us something very important. It's what the Danish philosopher Kierkegaard said.
[time=1489] "Life must be lived forwards, but can only be understood backwards."
[time=1497] We need to live our life day by day forwards, but we can see better what God has done when we stop and look back and see what God has done for us.
[time=1505] Life must be lived forwards, but it can only be understood backwards, and now Jacob recounts what God has done for him.
[time=1516] Verse 6 and on, "You know that I have served your father with all my strength, yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times, but God did not permit him to harm me."
[time=1529] If he said, "The spotted shall be your wages, then all the flock bore spotted." And if he said, "The stripped shall be your wages, then all the flock bore stripped." Does God has taken away the livestock of your father and given them to me?
[time=1544] Jacob understands that even though he was cheated by his own father-in-law, God is still in control.
[time=1551] That's right.
[time=1552] And God blesses, and he protects Jacob all throughout, even though we have established earlier that Jacob was not a perfect man, right?
[time=1562] He cheated his own brother. He lied to his own father. He's not perfect either, but God is with him and blesses and protects him in spite of who he is and in spite of what he does.
[time=1577] Genesis 31, verses 14 through 16, then Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, "Is there any portion of inheritance left for us in our father's house?
[time=1588] Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and he has indeed devoured our money.
[time=1594] All the wealth that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children now, then whatever God has said to you, do."
[time=1604] And while we see that God is blessing Jacob and his wife's understanding, they move on, but we learn, just like we've seen in the past, that sometimes we complicate matters.
[time=1617] Remember Abraham? How Abraham complicated matters? Remember that?
[time=1621] By going into Hagar and having Ishmael, he complicated matters. He lied about his wife being his sister.
[time=1628] Isaac complicated matters. He wanted to bless Esau, even though he knew that the promise would go through Jacob.
[time=1636] Jacob and Rachel, Jacob and Rebecca, complicate matters by deceiving Isaac.
[time=1645] And now Rachel complicates matters, starting in verse 17.
[time=1652] So Jacob arose and said his sons and his wives on camels, he drove all his livestock, all his property that he gained, the livestock in his possession that he had acquired in Padan Arran.
[time=1663] To go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac, Laban had gone to sheer his sheep, and Rachel stole her father's household gods.
[time=1672] And Jacob tricked Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he intended to flee.
[time=1680] He fled with all that he had and arose and crossed the Euphrates and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.
[time=1688] Jacob knows he's going to run. He picks the perfect timing.
[time=1694] In this case, sheep shearing season.
[time=1699] You know how that is, right? No.
[time=1704] Here's the explanation. Sheep shearing was a springtime activity in which large flocks necessitated large shearing crews and would labor for extended periods away from their home.
[time=1716] In 1933, a group of French archaeologists digging in Syria discovered 23,000 clay tablets that shed light on the world of the Bible. They're called the Mari tablets.
[time=1728] And here's what he reveals. He reveals that three to four hundred men worked for a period of three days to complete the shearing.
[time=1739] Wow. That's a big enterprise. Now, instead of Jacob helping, Jacob is fleeing.
[time=1749] Now, we don't know why Rachel stole her father's idols. The Bible doesn't say.
[time=1758] Some suggest that Rachel stole the idols because in some cultures having those particular idols would increase the inheritance.
[time=1767] It could be that Rachel stole the idols to show contempt for her father.
[time=1773] We don't know. What we do know is that Rachel, by stealing the idols, complicates matters and puts everyone in moral danger because that's exactly what Laban will try to do.
[time=1788] But again, we learned that God intervenes, just like God intervened with Abraham. And with Isaac, he again intervenes here.
[time=1799] Starting in verse 22. When he was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled, he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him for seven days and followed close after him into the hill country of Gilead.
[time=1812] But God came to Laban, the Armenian, in a dream by night and said to him, "Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad."
[time=1821] By the way, in English it doesn't come out, but in Hebrew, to pursue and follow, those are militaristic terms.
[time=1829] Jacob was not just coming to say, Laban was not just coming to say, "Hi to Jacob."
[time=1835] He was coming with a military force to kill him. He is ready for his own shock and awe campaign.
[time=1845] But God is in control and again he intervenes and he appears to Laban, be careful not to say anything, either good or bad.
[time=1854] God intervenes to protect his people. Is that not your story? Is that not my story?
[time=1861] Even though we complicate matters through our sinful behavior and whatever we do, God always intervenes and makes it right.
[time=1869] God is still in control, even though we complicate matters.
[time=1875] Now we are going to fast forward to chapter 32, the passage that Matt has read.
[time=1889] One important thing here to remember is that 20 years have passed.
[time=1894] Between chapter 28 and chapter 32, 20 years have passed. Keep that in mind.
[time=1903] 20 years have fastened, Jacob has that dream, where he remembered a stairway to heaven and God appears to him and promises that he will be with him,
[time=1915] recounts the blessings given to Abraham, but now again the faithful encounter dangerous situations.
[time=1926] In this case, look what happens starting in verse 1.
[time=1932] Jacob went one his way and the angels of God met him and when Jacob saw them he said, "This is God's camp."
[time=1939] So he called the name of that place Mahanaim. Now Jacob escaped the danger from his father-in-law and now he is assured of God's presence because the angels are here with him.
[time=1960] Sometimes God does that with us too, Psalm 34-7.
[time=1965] The angel of the Lord encamps around us who fear him and delivers them.
[time=1973] But what's happening, there's something of a collision course that happens, looking verses 3 and on.
[time=1983] And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau, his brother in the land of Seir, the country of Adam, instructing them,
[time=1990] "Thus you shall say to my Lord Esau, 'Thus says your servant Jacob, I have female servants, I have sent to tell my Lord in order that I may find favor in your sight.'
[time=2000] And the messengers returned to Jacob saying, 'We came to your brother Esau and he is coming to meet you.'
[time=2006] And there are 400 men with him.
[time=2009] Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed. He divided the people who were with him and the flocks and the herds and camels into two camps,
[time=2016] thinking if Esau comes to one of the camps and attacks, then the camp that is left will escape.
[time=2023] Now remember, 20 years ago when he left, he left because Esau was trying to kill him. Remember that?
[time=2030] That was the direct result of Jacob's deceit.
[time=2034] And now they come on a collision course. Not only is Esau coming, but he's coming with 400 men.
[time=2043] So Jacob sends gifts and he refers to Esau as 'my Lord.' Wow.
[time=2060] In his Genesis commentary, can he suggest that this is for the first time in his life, Jacob wanted to be last.
[time=2068] For the first time in his life, Jacob is not all about him. He realizes he's in mortal danger.
[time=2074] But he does something right. He turns to God in prayer, looking verses 9 through 12.
[time=2082] And Jacob said, "Oh God, my Father, the God of my Father, Abraham, and the God of my Father, Isaac,
[time=2089] O Lord, who said to me, return to your country and to your crinder, kindred, that I may do you good."
[time=2095] See, in prayer, Jacob recognizes God's sovereignty. He's in control.
[time=2103] And he recognizes, "I'm only a servant." Verse 10, "I am not worthy of the least of all the deeds of steadfast love
[time=2110] and all the faithfulness that you have shown to your servant for.
[time=2113] With only my staff, I crossed his Jordan, and now I have become two camps."
[time=2119] He recognizes what God has done for him, and notice, please, in verse 11, he prays specifically.
[time=2125] We learned that last time, we need to learn how to pray specifically.
[time=2129] Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him that he may come and attack me, the mothers, with the children." See, Jacob doesn't say, "Oh, I'm not afraid of anybody." He doesn't even say, "I'm not afraid because God is on my side." He doesn't say that.
[time=2148] "He is transparent. I'm afraid, Lord. I'm afraid."
[time=2154] And we need to do the same thing with God to be transparent with how we feel, but knowing that he remembers his promise. But you said, verse 12, "I will surely do you good and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude."
[time=2175] And the text is beautiful because we see that God blesses the dependent believer.
[time=2180] That was true yesterday, and it was true 3,000 years ago, and it's true today.
[time=2186] But notice, please, what happens here?
[time=2188] Sometimes God needs to cripple self-sufficient believers in order to bless them.
[time=2193] Uh-oh. Do you hear that?
[time=2196] Sometimes God has to cripple us in order to bless us.
[time=2201] I don't like that.
[time=2204] I thought blessing has everything to do with what's good for me, and I don't want any pain or suffering in my life.
[time=2210] If that's how you read the Bible, you're reading it wrong.
[time=2215] The principle is that sometimes, not single the time, but sometimes God has to cripple self-sufficient believers in order to bless them.
[time=2230] In anticipation of his encounter with Esau, Jacob sends his family ahead, so Jacob remains alone.
[time=2241] Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day.
[time=2247] When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he touched his hip socket, and Jacob's hip was put out of joint as he wrestled with him.
[time=2256] Now remember that it's time that Jacob is 99 years old.
[time=2261] Jacob is 99 years old, and he's fighting with a nameless, silent opponent.
[time=2270] The Bible doesn't say who this person is.
[time=2274] No name doesn't say anything. They just are fighting.
[time=2280] The fight is real, and it's physical.
[time=2285] And the limping is the result of the struggle.
[time=2296] The turning point of the bout came when the man touched Jacob.
[time=2299] That's a very interesting translation there.
[time=2304] If you read it in English, it says "touched".
[time=2308] In Hebrew, that word can mean "touch", but when the direct object takes a certain preposition, it means to strike.
[time=2318] It doesn't mean to touch, you know, to caress. It means to strike.
[time=2324] That's what it means here. It doesn't mean, "Oh, he just touched him".
[time=2329] It caressed him. No, no, no, he struck him.
[time=2333] It's right there in the text. It just doesn't come out in our English translations.
[time=2341] This was God's hand imparting crippling grace.
[time=2346] Now, you like that song that we sing, right? "Crippling Grace".
[time=2352] You don't like it? Oh, because we don't have one like that.
[time=2357] We like amazing grace, and we like saving grace, but we don't like crippling grace.
[time=2363] But that's what's going on here.
[time=2365] God is crippling Jacob in order to bless him.
[time=2370] Tiberius, I don't like that. That doesn't look good on calligraphy in my office.
[time=2375] "Crippling Grace". In 1968, after Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated,
[time=2383] Robert Kennedy quoted the following from the Greek poet, Eskelus,
[time=2390] "Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget, falls drop by drop upon the heart,
[time=2399] until in our own despair against our will comes wisdom through the awful grace of God".
[time=2409] The awful grace of God, crippling grace, and the answer is yes.
[time=2418] The crippling grace and the awful grace of God.
[time=2423] Arthur Pink is correct when he affirms that God was wrestling with Jacob, "to reduce Jacob to a sense of nothingness, to cause him to see what a poor helpless
[time=2433] and worthless creature he was, he was to teach us through him the all important lesson that in recognized weakness lies our strength".
[time=2444] And only after this episode, God can bless Jacob.
[time=2453] Starting in verse 26, then he said, "Let me go, for the day has broken".
[time=2458] But Jacob said, "I will not let you go unless you bless me".
[time=2461] And he said to him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Jacob".
[time=2464] Then he said, "Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed".
[time=2472] And Jacob asked him, "Please tell me your name".
[time=2474] But he said, "Why is the day you ask me my name?" And there, he blessed him.
[time=2479] What is your name as a rhetorical question?
[time=2483] God knew his name, but it's here to show the contrast between Jacob and Israel.
[time=2489] Remember what Jacob meant? The one who grabs the heel.
[time=2493] Because remember when they came out, Jacob was grabbing his brother Esau's heel.
[time=2502] And now God changes his name from the one who grabs the heel to Israel, which means God fights.
[time=2511] Isn't that the story of Israel?
[time=2515] Isn't that the story of Israel today? Who's fighting on Israel's behalf?
[time=2521] God is. Whenever you say Israel, you say God fights.
[time=2526] So you better be right and you get on the right side of the line.
[time=2532] God fights. And this is very important because as you look in their history,
[time=2538] Israel will be fighting a lot, won't they? A lot.
[time=2542] But what a comfort it is that God will fight for you.
[time=2547] And then God will fight with you.
[time=2552] Jacob called the place of the name Peniel, the face of God.
[time=2557] For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been delivered.
[time=2563] How do we know this, the one who he fights is with God?
[time=2569] We know that because of what Jacob says, and we know that because of what Prophet Hosea says.
[time=2574] The Prophet Hosea clarifies things for us in Hosea 12.3.
[time=2578] In the womb he took his brother by his heel, and in his manhood his stroke would God, he fought with God.
[time=2586] The rest of biblical literature will tell us that this is not other than God fighting with Jacob, Jacob fighting with God. And then God blesses Jacob and God changes his name.
[time=2599] The sun rose upon him as he passed Peniel limping because of his hip.
[time=2609] Therefore to this day the people of Israel do not eat the sin of the Thai that is on the hip socket because he touched the socket of Jacob's hip on the sinew of the Thai.
[time=2625] Are you wrestling with God right now?
[time=2631] Does God need to cripple you in order to bless you?
[time=2636] Sometimes he does that. I'm not saying he does that all the time.
[time=2639] But sometimes he needs to cripple us in order to bless us.
[time=2644] As one scholar puts it, remember that before self-sufficient Jacob can enter the promised land,
[time=2650] God needs to change Jacob into Israel.
[time=2653] Remember when they're entering the promised land, they're going to enter into the land of Canaan.
[time=2659] They will become the land of Israel, not the land of Jacob.
[time=2663] You'll become the land of Israel. But something more beautiful about what's happening here.
[time=2670] It is only after this episode that God will be known as the God of Abraham, Isaac and until now you won't have that.
[time=2679] See, God has to do something in his life for God to become the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
[time=2688] God sometimes does something in our lives by crippling us.
[time=2692] See what happens as brothers and sisters, we actually belong to the army of the crippled.
[time=2703] God who cripples us in order to bless us.
[time=2709] So if you think visually about this, it would be like us walking and limping and singing.
[time=2715] We're marching to Zion, the army of the crippled.
[time=2721] That's us.
[time=2723] We're marching through Zion limping.
[time=2729] We're marching upward to Zion, the beautiful city of God.
[time=2736] And in chapter 33 we see that God does bring reconciliation. And we see this place where Esau meets Jacob and instead of Esau killing Jacob, look the beautiful verse for Esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him.
[time=2763] That good resolution to the story.
[time=2767] Yeah.
[time=2768] Great ending to the story.
[time=2773] There's nothing in Esau that says, "Brother, how could you?"
[time=2779] There's nothing of that.
[time=2781] There's nothing broader.
[time=2782] Why did you do it?
[time=2783] Nothing like that.
[time=2785] It's just reconciliation.
[time=2788] Reconciliation.
[time=2791] He would be right.
[time=2793] Jacob had seen God face to face, but he said nothing to Esau about it.
[time=2798] He didn't tell Esau that he had a new name.
[time=2801] He was made a prince, but was acting like a pauper.
[time=2807] And verses 8 to 11 shows us how Jacob pressed Esau to receive a gift from him.
[time=2812] Esau said, "What do you mean by all this company that I met?" Jacob answered to find favor in your sight of my Lord, but Esau said, "I have enough, my brother.
[time=2820] Keep what you have for yourself." Jacob said, "No, please.
[time=2823] If I found favor in your sight, then accept my present from my hand for I have seen your face, which is like seeing the face of God.
[time=2831] And you have accepted me.
[time=2833] Please accept my blessing that is brought to you because God has dealt graciously with me
[time=2839] and became and because I have enough.
[time=2842] Thus he urged him and he took it."
[time=2848] Jacob was not ready to see Esau's face until he saw God's face.
[time=2856] And maybe you need the reconciliation this morning.
[time=2859] Maybe your family life is on the rocks.
[time=2864] Before you look in the eyes of the one who you need to reconcile with, you need to look in the face of God.
[time=2871] And you need to look in the face of God's Word that tells us what to do.
[time=2877] Remember, I said earlier, that God speaks through circumstances, but God also speaks through his Word, and those two will never go against each other.
[time=2885] You can never say, "Well, God's told me this, but his Word says something else.
[time=2889] That will never happen." God speaks through circumstances, but he will never go against his Word.
[time=2901] Maybe you need reconciliation, seek God's face first, and then seek reconciliation.
[time=2911] The divine encounter, someone said, prepared the way for the human encounter.
[time=2916] God's crippling of Jacob preceded his reconciliation with Esau.
[time=2921] Jacob could not give back the blessings, but he could share the fruit of the blessings.
[time=2930] Please accept my blessing that is brought to you because God has dealt graciously with me and because I have enough.
[time=2938] How can we apply God's Word today?
[time=2941] First of all, we need to pray that God will teach us how to listen to his voice and his Word.
[time=2949] As we prepare for Thanksgiving and then for Christmas, remember that Jesus is called in John 1, the Word.
[time=2960] In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[time=2968] That's the good news, that God still speaks.
[time=2974] His revelation is right here.
[time=2977] You need to know God's will, it's right here.
[time=2980] I tell you everything you need to know about your relationship with him and about your relationship with others.
[time=2986] And if you say, "Oh God told me this," you make sure that it accords to this.
[time=2994] They don't go against each other.
[time=2999] Second of all, don't complicate matters.
[time=3003] And if you complicate matters through sin, Jesus is there to accept you if you come or repent and confess your sin.
[time=3012] John 1, 9, God is faithful if we confess our sin.
[time=3024] Thirdly, develop a life of prayer and wait on him.
[time=3029] Jesus is a great example for us of prayer. He prays in the morning, he prays at night, he prays at the beginning of his ministry, he prays at the end of the ministry.
[time=3037] Do you know what Jesus does now? The Bible says Jesus prays for us.
[time=3041] Isn't that great? Jesus prays for us.
[time=3048] And I want you to know that when I say you are my dear brothers and sisters, I mean that.
[time=3054] And I pray for you. Well, I assume I pray for some of you because I pray through the directory.
[time=3062] So if you're not in the directory, I am praying for you.
[time=3068] No, I'm probably praying for other people that are in the directory and are not here.
[time=3073] So I think it balances out.
[time=3079] Develop a life of prayer, not just at home, but even a church as you're seeing.
[time=3084] Pray for there and pray for those people who make announcements, pray for Matt, even though sometimes they speak untruth.
[time=3092] Pray for them. Pray for the people who are singing. Pray for the people who are taking the offering.
[time=3099] Just keep praying. Just make it a habit of praying.
[time=3102] It doesn't have to be a certain position.
[time=3105] By the way, this list is not exhaustive. This list of application, I'm just giving you three options.
[time=3111] Maybe you can see something else in this word. Look at it and develop your own application points.
[time=3119] But the Bible is always about application. We need to learn God's word so we can apply it to our daily lives.
[time=3128] Let's pray.
[time=3131] Dear Father, as we look into your word, we find some really, really interesting characters.
[time=3137] We are reminded that biblical characters are not portraits of morality, but they are mirrors for identity.
[time=3145] Pray that you forgive us when we complicate matters by doing things that are wordly.
[time=3150] When we take shortcuts, when we do things that are popular, but they're not biblical.
[time=3155] I pray that you forgive us and you bring reconciliation between us and you, and you bring reconciliation between us and our brothers and our sisters.
[time=3165] Or wherever there needs to be reconciliation, I pray that today will be that day.
[time=3171] Our families will be reconciled to you and to each other.
[time=3176] Maybe there's a son or a daughter that's rebelled against his or her parents.
[time=3186] I pray that today will be the day of reconciliation.
[time=3189] I pray that both parties will seek you, your face first, and then they will seek to be reconciled to each other.
[time=3198] I pray that you make us into men and women of prayer, that we will be men and women of prayer every day and whatever we go.
[time=3206] May we just be praying all the time as your word says.
[time=3211] Give us the sensitivity of the Holy Spirit to listen to your voice and to listen to your word and to do what it says.
[time=3218] And we thank you that you are the God who always intervenes in our mess and wants to bless and protect us,
[time=3226] even though we are not what we should be many times.
[time=3230] As we approach thanksgiving, I pray that you give us a grateful heart.
[time=3234] We will be grateful not just today or Thursday, but every day.
[time=3239] And may we give you praise and glory to everything day we say and do.
[time=3242] May we point others to Jesus Christ who alone can save.
[time=3248] In his name I pray. Amen.
[time=3256] [MUSIC]
[time=3333] You give life, you are love, you bring light to the darkness you give hope.
[time=3346] You restore every heart that is broken.
