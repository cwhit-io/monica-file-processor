[time=79] I was made to worship you with all my heart.

[time=673] forever to live with you, and feed us forever to live with you, and feed us forever to live
[time=787] the children also of Makhir, son of Manasseh, were counted as Joseph's own, and Joseph said to his brothers, "I am about to die, but God will visit you and bring you up out
[time=798] of this land to the land that he had sworn to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
[time=804] Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying, "God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here." So Joseph died, being 110 years old.
[time=816] They embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
[time=822] Good morning.
[time=824] Please open your Bibles to Genesis 41.
[time=828] Genesis 41.
[time=834] Today we're concluding the book of Genesis, but we are continuing with our series, The Gospel Project, and the Gospel Project again goes through both the Old Testament and the
[time=845] New Testament, and last Sunday, Pastor Jesse started the Joseph narrative, the story of
[time=854] Joseph, how God allowed Joseph to go through pain in order to accomplish his purposes.
[time=865] But again, we're in the Gospel Project, and the word Gospel means the good news.
[time=869] And when we talk about the good news, we refer to the fact that Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins, and rose again to give us two things, forgiveness of sin and
[time=880] eternal life with him forever.
[time=883] That's what the Gospel is, and that's why it's good news.
[time=888] But some of you might be wondering, but why do you always have to talk about Jesus?
[time=893] You're in Genesis, why do you always talk about Jesus and get Jesus into here?
[time=897] Because we're in Genesis, it's 1800 years before Jesus would come, why you always talk
[time=904] about Jesus?
[time=907] And the reason we talk about Jesus is because Jesus asked us to.
[time=912] We need to learn how to read the Bible Christologically.
[time=916] Father Jesus rises from the dead, he's on the road to EMS, and he is talking to a couple
[time=924] of disciples that didn't get it.
[time=928] They didn't get it, and Jesus rebukes them because they didn't get the fact that the
[time=935] Old Testament was about Jesus.
[time=938] Notice, please, the words of Jesus to these disciples.
[time=943] No foolish ones and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken.
[time=950] Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into glory and beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures,
[time=962] the things concerning whom, himself.
[time=966] Jesus is telling the disciples and he's telling us, if you read the Old Testament and don't see Jesus there, you have missed the main point.
[time=976] That's why we always talk about Jesus because the whole Bible is about him.
[time=982] After Jesus appears to the 11 disciples, Judas is no more.
[time=990] In the same chapter, verse 44, Jesus said to them, "These are my words that I spoke
[time=998] to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the law of Moses, and
[time=1004] the prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled." You see, the Old Testament in Hebrew is divided into three parts, the law, the prophets, and
[time=1016] the writings.
[time=1018] And basically, Jesus says, "All those three parts talk about me."
[time=1024] And that's why we always talk about Jesus even though we are in the Old Testament.
[time=1031] Now, having established that, let's go back to the Joseph narrative.
[time=1036] I want us to see the timeline of Joseph's life because, again, last week, Pastor Jesse
[time=1046] referred to the time when Joseph was about 17 years old.
[time=1054] He's a teenager and God selected Joseph to be a leader in such a way that he shows him
[time=1063] through a couple of dreams that not only will he be a leader, but his own family will
[time=1069] bow down to him.
[time=1071] Again, this is not a self-made dream.
[time=1075] This was a God-given dream.
[time=1079] God gave this dream to Joseph, and he said, "There will be coming one day when your brothers
[time=1085] and your parents will bow down to you." He doesn't see that because he's going through the pain of being sold into slavery by his
[time=1097] own brothers.
[time=1098] And then, Pastor Jesse's point was that sometimes God uses pain to accomplish his purposes.
[time=1108] But God is always with us.
[time=1111] And not only was God with Joseph, God elevated Joseph to the position of what we would call
[time=1117] today prime minister.
[time=1120] Look with me now in chapter 41, please, starting in verse 39.
[time=1126] We see now that God's promises given to Joseph are being fulfilled.
[time=1133] Genesis 41 is starting in verse 39.
[time=1137] Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God has shown you all this, there is none so discerning and wise as you are.
[time=1144] You shall be over my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you command.
[time=1150] Many as regards, the throne will be I greater than you."
[time=1156] And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt." Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck.
[time=1171] And he made him ride in his second chariot, and they called out before him, "Bao Danyi." Thus, he set him over all the land of Egypt.
[time=1183] Thirteen years have passed.
[time=1186] Thirteen years of Joseph going through suffering.
[time=1189] And the book of Psalms explains what happened in that prison.
[time=1193] He was in chains.
[time=1197] And of course, Pharaoh put him over, or Potiphar put him over all the prison.
[time=1202] But still, the Bible says he was in chains.
[time=1208] He's about thirty.
[time=1210] Thirteen years have passed.
[time=1211] Now, notice, please, what happens here with the narrative.
[time=1216] It would take fourteen more years before Joseph and his brothers would be reconciled.
[time=1222] And I want us now to think not about Joseph.
[time=1224] I want us to think about the brothers for a little bit.
[time=1230] You're living with the burden of sin upon you for so many years.
[time=1238] Thirteen years of living with the guilt and shame of sin that you have basically sold
[time=1244] your brother into slavery.
[time=1247] Not only do thirteen years pass, but another fourteen after that.
[time=1252] I know some of you are told there will be no math today, but apparently there is a little
[time=1258] of a math to be done, because this is very important.
[time=1261] Why does Joseph get so much press?
[time=1265] In the whole book of Genesis, we get from the creation of the world to Joseph thirty-six
[time=1272] chapters.
[time=1274] And from chapter thirty-seven to fifty, we get only a hundred years of history.
[time=1279] Why?
[time=1280] Because it's important.
[time=1282] Not only that, the Bible deals here a little bit not just to Joseph, but what happens to the brothers?
[time=1288] And here's principle number one.
[time=1292] Sometimes God allows us to experience extreme need in order to stir our conscience.
[time=1302] Let me say that again.
[time=1304] In order for God to stir our conscience, sometimes God puts us in a place of extreme
[time=1310] need.
[time=1312] God wants to stir the conscience of the brothers who are living with the guilt of the sin they
[time=1318] have done many, many years before.
[time=1322] And God is putting them in a place of extreme need.
[time=1327] Genesis chapter forty-two, the first five verses.
[time=1330] When Jacob learned that there was grain for selling Egypt, he said to his sons, "Why do you look at one another?" And he said, "Behold, I have heard that there is grain for selling Egypt.
[time=1340] Go down and buy grain for us there that we may live and not die."
[time=1346] So ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt, but Jacob did not send Benjamin
[time=1352] Joseph's brother with his brothers, for he feared that harm might happen to him.
[time=1357] Does the sons of Israel came to buy among the others who came for the famine was in the
[time=1364] land of Canaan?
[time=1367] God is trying to stir the conscience of the brothers.
[time=1374] God slowly but surely is trying to awaken the sleeping conscience of Joseph's brothers.
[time=1384] Notice please that not just the brothers, but Jacob was also affected by the famine.
[time=1391] Does the sons of Israel came to buy among the others who came for the famine was in the land of Canaan?
[time=1398] My dear brothers and sisters, we need to learn this lesson today.
[time=1403] The sometimes God allows us to be in a place of extreme need in order to stir our conscience.
[time=1413] Maybe that's not you today, but maybe it is you today.
[time=1416] You have to ask yourself, "Why is this happening?
[time=1420] Could it be that God is trying to stir my conscience because of an unconfessed, unrepentant sin?" I cannot answer this for you and you cannot answer it for me.
[time=1432] But if God is trying to stir your conscience, you need to respond to him.
[time=1439] And you can either respond by hardening your heart or you can respond by confessing your sin and coming clean before God.
[time=1448] God was working in the hearts and minds of the brothers.
[time=1451] Not only did God allow them to go through a place of extreme need, God allowed them to
[time=1459] go through a place of harsh treatment.
[time=1464] Starting in verse 6, this is the second principle.
[time=1467] In order for God to stir our conscience, sometimes he puts us in a place of harsh treatment.
[time=1475] Starting in verse 6, now notice please where the harsh treatment is coming from, from his own, from their own brother.
[time=1482] Remember the one?
[time=1483] They sold into slavery.
[time=1485] Joseph was governor over the land, starting in verse 6.
[time=1489] He was the one who sold to all the people of the land and Joseph's brothers came and do what?
[time=1495] What does your version say?
[time=1498] They bowed themselves before him with their faces to the ground.
[time=1503] The promises that God gave early are now being fulfilled.
[time=1511] God always keeps his promises.
[time=1515] They bowed down before him with their faces to the ground.
[time=1519] Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he treated them like strangers and spoke
[time=1525] roughly to them.
[time=1528] Where do you come from, he said, from the land of Canaan to buy food, and Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.
[time=1537] And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed of them, and he said to them, "You
[time=1543] are spies.
[time=1545] You have come to see the nakeness of the land," they said to him, "No, my Lord, your servants have come to buy food again." His verses are in direct fulfillment of God's promises that he had back in chapter 37.
[time=1559] For those of you who are not here last week, Genesis 37, verses 7 to 9, Joseph is explaining
[time=1568] the dreams.
[time=1569] "Behold, you are binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaves were owned and stood upright, and behold, your sheaves gathered around it and bowed down to my sheaves." His brothers said to him, "Are you indeed to reign over us?
[time=1582] Are you indeed to rule over us?" And they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.
[time=1589] Then he told them another dream and told it to the brothers and said, "Behold, I have another dream.
[time=1594] Behold, the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars were bowing down to me."
[time=1600] And these are becoming a reality.
[time=1603] And if he takes, let's see, 13 plus 14, I can't count that how you have a calculator.
[time=1614] Even though he takes over 20 years, God will fulfill his promises.
[time=1620] How long did it take for Abraham to get a son?
[time=1624] About 25 years, right?
[time=1626] Now it's over, it's about 27 years and finally this is becoming reality.
[time=1633] But in order for God to stir their consciences, God is allowing the brothers to have this
[time=1639] harsh treatment from even Joseph, not looking verse 11.
[time=1646] I like verses 11, 12, 13 and on because apparently they're playing a game.
[time=1651] I just found out this week that in America, people play a game called Two Throughs and Alive.
[time=1657] Have you ever played that game?
[time=1660] I came to the States when I was 15, so there's a gap in my microphone apparently.
[time=1669] There's a gap in my technology and there's a gap in my games, I guess.
[time=1674] I'm still learning certain games.
[time=1676] Notice, please, verse 11, they're playing a game, Two Throughs and Alive.
[time=1685] We are all sons of one man, is that true?
[time=1690] We are honest men, is that true?
[time=1694] No.
[time=1697] And then your servants have never been spies, that's true.
[time=1702] Two Throughs and Alive.
[time=1704] We are honest men, is alive.
[time=1708] They are scheming the seedful wicked men who sold their brother in slavery.
[time=1715] For money.
[time=1716] Why?
[time=1717] Because the Bible says they hated him.
[time=1722] And God is trying to stir their conscience.
[time=1727] Verses 12 and 13, they're playing another game.
[time=1731] Three Throughs and Alive, verses 12 and 13, you try to detect the lie.
[time=1737] No, it is the nakeness of the lander you have come to see and they said, "We are your servants,
[time=1743] our twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan, and behold the youngest
[time=1749] is this day, with our father and one is no more." Have you caught the lie?
[time=1755] One is no more.
[time=1756] The one in front of them is no more.
[time=1760] The one they're talking to is no more.
[time=1764] And then Joseph continues his harsh treatment, starting in verse 14.
[time=1768] But Joseph said to them, "It is that I said to you, you are spies.
[time=1772] By this you shall be tested by the life of Pharaoh.
[time=1774] You shall not go from this place unless your youngest brother comes here.
[time=1779] Send one of you and let him bring your brother while you remain confined, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you or else.
[time=1788] By the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies."
[time=1796] Sometimes God allows us to grow through extreme need or harsh treatment in order to stir our
[time=1803] conscience.
[time=1806] If you go through something like this today, ask yourself, could it be that's what God
[time=1813] is trying to do?
[time=1816] Jerry Bridges explains, and I quote, "God does not delight in causing us to experience
[time=1822] pain or heartache.
[time=1824] He always has a purpose for the grief he brings or allows to come into our lives.
[time=1830] Most often we do not know what the purpose is, but it is enough to know that his infinite wisdom and perfect love have determined that that particular sorrow is best for us.
[time=1842] God never wastes pain.
[time=1844] He always uses it to accomplish his purpose, and his purpose is for his glory and our good."
[time=1853] Not only does God allow us to go through extreme need or harsh treatment, sometimes God allows
[time=1859] us to experience misery in order to find mercy.
[time=1867] This is the third principle.
[time=1869] In order to stir our conscience, sometimes God allows us to experience misery in order
[time=1875] to find mercy.
[time=1879] Look in chapter 43, please.
[time=1881] Now the famine was severe in the land, and when they had eaten the grain that had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, "Go again, buy us a little food," verses 8 and
[time=1892] verses 3 and 5, "But Judah said to him, 'The man solemnly warned us, saying, 'You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.
[time=1899] If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food.
[time=1903] But if you will not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, 'You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.'"
[time=1915] And Judah said to Israel, his father, verses 8 and 9, "Send the boy with me, and we will
[time=1921] arise and go, that we may live and not die, both we and you and also our little ones.
[time=1928] I will be a pledge of his safety.
[time=1930] From my hand you shall require him, if I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever."
[time=1942] Looking verses 11 through 13, please, then their father Israel said to them, "If you must be so, then do this.
[time=1948] Take some of the choice fruits of the land in your bags and carry a present down to the man, a little balm and a little honey, gum, mer pistachio nuts and almonds.
[time=1959] Take double the money with you, carry back with you the money that returned in the mouth of your sacks.
[time=1964] Perhaps it was an oversight, then also your brother and arise and go again to the man."
[time=1972] I want to argue that misery is the word that describes the situation in Jacob's family.
[time=1981] First of all, they are ravaged by famine and misery is the word that describes the situation
[time=1987] in Jacob's heart.
[time=1989] He is sending his youngest son into the unknown.
[time=1994] Last time he did that, his son never came back.
[time=1999] Misery is what his family experiences and misery is what Jacob experiences in his heart.
[time=2007] What do you do when you experience misery?
[time=2009] What do you ask for?
[time=2011] And we need to learn from Jacob to ask for mercy.
[time=2015] Look in verse 14, please.
[time=2017] This is a key verse, "May God almighty grant you mercy," again, I don't know what version
[time=2026] you are using, but the word mercy should be that word in your version.
[time=2033] If that word is not mercy in your version, get another version.
[time=2040] May God almighty grant you mercy.
[time=2042] That's very important.
[time=2044] It's very important to the story.
[time=2046] And may he send back your other brother and Benjamin as, for me, if I am bereaved of my
[time=2054] children, I am bereaved.
[time=2057] The reason that word mercy is important here is because it's the first time the word occurs in the Bible.
[time=2065] Another that God was not merciful until now.
[time=2068] Another that God was not merciful or gracious until now, but this is the first time the word mercy occurs in the Bible, Genesis 43-14.
[time=2079] Jacob teaches us that when we live in misery, we need to ask for God's mercy.
[time=2086] Now sometimes misery is self-made.
[time=2089] We sin and we suffer the consequence of that sin.
[time=2094] As a result, we are miserable, but sometimes God allows us to experience misery in order
[time=2101] to drive us to our knees to ask for mercy.
[time=2106] We need to learn that lesson.
[time=2109] And whenever we experience misery, we need to ask ourselves, "Is this self-made?
[time=2116] Or is God trying to teach me something?
[time=2119] Is God trying to lead me to my knees?"
[time=2125] Joseph is treating them harshly.
[time=2129] They experience misery in order to find mercy.
[time=2140] Okay, verse 16 and 17.
[time=2145] When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, think about this.
[time=2148] You have not seen your little brother for more than 20 years, and you finally see him.
[time=2157] God goes through your mind.
[time=2159] What goes through your heart?
[time=2162] When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, "Bring the men into the house and slaughter an animal and make ready for the men, art to dine with me anoon, the man did as Joseph had told them and brought the men to Joseph's house."
[time=2180] Look in verse 18, "The brothers are still living in misery, and the men were afraid
[time=2186] because they were brought to Joseph's house, and they said it is because of the money which was replaced in our sacks, the first time they were brought in so that he may assault
[time=2197] us and fall upon us and make a servant and seize our donkeys." But I want you to see what happens next.
[time=2203] Their misery leads them to a confession.
[time=2207] So they went up to the steward of the Joseph's house and spoke with him at the door of the house and said, "Oh my Lord, we came down the first time to buy food, and when we came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks.
[time=2219] And there was each man's money in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight.
[time=2225] So we have brought it again with us, and we have brought other money with us to buy food.
[time=2229] We do not know who put our money in our sacks.
[time=2232] The steward comes their anxiety." Verse 23, "He replied, 'Peace be to you, do not be afraid.
[time=2239] Your God, the God of your father has put treasure in your sacks for you.
[time=2243] I received your money, then he brought Simeon out to them.'"
[time=2249] I want you to imagine the scene.
[time=2251] The brothers are living in misery, and God is giving them grace and mercy.
[time=2260] Verse 26, "When Joseph came home, they brought into the house to him the present.
[time=2264] They had with them, and they did what?
[time=2266] They bowed down to him to the ground."
[time=2272] Again, part of the fulfillment of the promises given back in chapter 37.
[time=2279] And he inquired about their welfare and said, "Is your father well the old man of whom you spoke?
[time=2284] Is he still alive?" They said, "Your servant, our father is well.
[time=2287] He is still alive, and they bow their heads and prostrated themselves." And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, "Is this your youngest brother of whom you spoke to me, God be gracious to you, my son?"
[time=2303] Now if you remember verse 14, when Jacob is asking for mercy, I want you to look again
[time=2309] in verse 30.
[time=2311] The word "mercy" occurs again.
[time=2315] Jacob asked for mercy, and now Joseph has mercy.
[time=2321] Verse 30, "Then Joseph heard out for his compassion grew warm for his brother."
[time=2327] That word "compassion," translated compassion, is the word "mercy."
[time=2333] Even the ESV gets it wrong here.
[time=2337] But I want you to see the connection.
[time=2340] In verse 14, Jacob is asking for mercy, and in verse 30, Joseph has mercy.
[time=2350] And Joseph heard out for his compassion grew warm for his brother, and he sought a place to weep, and he entered his chamber and wept there.
[time=2359] If Jeremiah is the weeping prophet, Joseph is the weeping patriarch.
[time=2366] He's weeping in chapter 43, he's weeping in chapter 45, he will weep in chapter 50.
[time=2373] But again, the word translated here "compassion," I want you to see is the word "mercy."
[time=2382] The Hebrew literally reads his mercies were heated up for his brother.
[time=2389] But what verse 30 wants to show is that this is the answer to Jacob's prayer.
[time=2395] He prayed for mercy in the midst of misery.
[time=2402] And now God answers his prayer, and in the heart of Joseph, there is mercy.
[time=2412] Something that his brothers didn't have about 20 some years before.
[time=2419] I want us to move to the next to the next principle.
[time=2429] Here's what happens here is reconciliation.
[time=2432] The chapter of Genesis basically ends with the brothers being reconciled to Joseph.
[time=2438] But in order for reconciliation to be possible, first we need to understand God's sovereignty.
[time=2444] We need to understand that God is in control.
[time=2449] Joseph reveals himself to the brothers.
[time=2452] He hid the fact that he is the brother, the lost brother, until now.
[time=2458] And finally, Joseph reveals himself to his brothers, chapter 45.
[time=2464] Starting in verse 1, "The Joseph could not control himself before all those who stood by him.
[time=2470] He cried, 'Make everyone go out from me.' So no one stayed with him, and Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and he wept aloud, so that the Egyptians heard it, and the house of Pharaoh heard it.
[time=2485] And Joseph said to his brothers, 'I am Joseph.
[time=2489] Is my father still alive?' But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence.
[time=2499] Why are they dismayed?
[time=2502] We sold our brother into slavery, and you are the Prime Minister of Egypt.
[time=2510] Why?
[time=2511] How did that happen?
[time=2513] It happened because all along God was in control.
[time=2517] And Joseph understands this.
[time=2522] He says in verse 4, "Come near to me, please." And they came near, and he said, "I am your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt.
[time=2532] And now do not be distressed or angry with yourselves, because you sold me here for God
[time=2540] sent me." Oh, if you underline in your Bibles, this is one to underline.
[time=2547] And now do not be distressed or angry with yourselves, because you sold me here for God
[time=2553] sent me before you to preserve your lives.
[time=2563] My dear brothers and sisters, reconciliation is only possible when we realize that God
[time=2569] has always been in control.
[time=2571] Even if people have done unspeakable things to us, we need to understand that God is in
[time=2578] control.
[time=2581] You are living in misery if you don't understand that God is in control.
[time=2588] But God wants to bring you to a place of mercy and understand that even though whatever the brothers did was evil and wicked, God is in control.
[time=2597] See, Joseph doesn't say, "Hey, whatever you guys did to me is okay." He doesn't say that.
[time=2603] He doesn't say, "What have you guys did to me is not a sin." He doesn't say that.
[time=2607] But he does recognize that even though people are wicked and even though people will sin against you, God is still sovereign and in control of our lives.
[time=2617] We need to understand that.
[time=2619] And Joseph understands that.
[time=2620] That's why he opens the door to reconciliation by understanding that God is in control.
[time=2628] God, verse 7, "God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to
[time=2634] keep alive for you many, many survivors."
[time=2641] Not only is reconciliation possible when we understand God's sovereignty, but we actually have to forgive.
[time=2650] Reconciliation is possible only when we forgive.
[time=2654] The key verse, the key verse of the entire Joseph narrative is chapter 50 verse 20.
[time=2661] As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good.
[time=2668] To bring it about that many people should be kept alive as they are today.
[time=2676] I don't know how you have reacted to this, but in chapter 45 we are told how Joseph reacts.
[time=2693] Verse 14, back in chapter 45, "Then he fell upon his brothers, Benjamin's neck, and wept,
[time=2702] and Benjamin wept upon his neck." Now you might not be surprised that he's kissing Benjamin, the younger son.
[time=2713] You're not surprised that he's kissing Benjamin, but you should be surprised what's happening
[time=2719] next.
[time=2720] Verse 15 in chapter 45, "And he kissed all his brothers, and wept upon them.
[time=2731] And he kissed all his brothers, and wept upon them.
[time=2733] After that his brothers talked with him."
[time=2740] My dear brothers and sisters, is anyone here today that you need to forgive?
[time=2748] Or are you in a state where you have not forgiven someone in God forbid over 20 years?
[time=2755] You know, there's no one in the Bible does say that someone has to ask you forgiveness
[time=2761] in order for you to forgive them.
[time=2763] That's nowhere in the Bible.
[time=2766] You can look it up.
[time=2769] There's nowhere in the Bible where it says in order to forgive someone they have to ask for forgiveness, or they have to confess, or they have to be repented nowhere.
[time=2778] The Bible only says, "You have to forgive."
[time=2786] I read a story about two friends who are walking through the desert, and as they're walking
[time=2792] through the desert they got into an argument, and one of them slapped the other one on the face.
[time=2800] And the guy who was slapped on the face wrote in the sand, "Today my friend slapped me in
[time=2807] the face." They walked a little farther, and they came to an oasis, and they saw water, so they went and jumped in, not just to drink, but to swim, and one was actually the guy who was slapped
[time=2822] and I was actually dying in the mire and was drowning.
[time=2828] And the brother and his friend, who earlier slapped him, now saved his life.
[time=2833] And when the guy got out, he wrote on the stone, "Today my friend saved my life."
[time=2843] And the guy who was first slapped and then saved asked, "Why?"
[time=2851] When I slapped you, you wrote in the sand, but when I saved your life, you wrote on the
[time=2860] stone.
[time=2862] And he said, "When someone hurts us, we should write it down in the sand, where winds of
[time=2870] forgiveness can erase it away.
[time=2873] But when someone does something good for us, we must engrave it in stone, where no wind can ever erase it." My dear brothers and sisters, learn to write your hurts in the sand and carve your benefits
[time=2888] in stone.
[time=2892] That's what Joseph did.
[time=2897] And Joseph points us to none other than Jesus Christ.
[time=2902] See, we cannot read the Joseph narrative without understanding that Joseph, the Bible is not
[time=2909] about Joseph.
[time=2911] The Bible is about Joseph who's pointing to another Joseph, his name is Jesus.
[time=2918] See, God was in control and sent Joseph down to Egypt to save a few people.
[time=2927] But God sent Jesus down from heaven to save many people.
[time=2933] Joseph didn't die for our sins, but Jesus did.
[time=2937] A few people bow down before Joseph, but Philippians 2 tells us that at the name of
[time=2943] Jesus, every knee should bow in heaven and on earth.
[time=2948] So the story of Joseph is a finger pointing towards the coming of the Messiah.
[time=2956] As Joseph was the Prime Minister, he brings his family, and they live with him in Egypt.
[time=2965] But Jesus says to us, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[time=2972] No one comes to the Father except through me.
[time=2978] Let not your hearts be troubled, believe in God, believe also in me.
[time=2981] In my father's house, there are many rooms, if you are not so, I would have told you that I go and prepare a place for you." How do we apply the truth?
[time=2995] First of all, the question is not if Jesus is the Savior, the question is, "Is Jesus
[time=3001] your Savior?" If you were to die tonight, are you sure that you would go to heaven?
[time=3008] If not, maybe today is the day you want to surrender your life to Jesus Christ.
[time=3012] Jesus said, "He who has the Son has life, he who does not have the Son of God shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides in him." We're going to be a miserable Christmas for you to celebrate Christmas without Christ,
[time=3029] and how joyous should it be?
[time=3031] And by the way, Christmas should be a joyous occasion, and for us Christians, it should be the most joyous occasion, right?
[time=3038] We should rejoice more than anybody else on this world, because Jesus is born.
[time=3045] But for those of us who are believers, the question is this, does anyone need our forgiveness?
[time=3052] I want you to listen to the words of Jesus, on the Sermon on the Mount, about forgiveness.
[time=3061] Very important words, Matthew 6, 14, and 15, "For if you forgive others their trespasses,
[time=3072] your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
[time=3077] But if you do not forgive others, their trespasses neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."
[time=3086] You don't like those verses, but they are through, they are as true as John 3, 16.
[time=3092] They are as true as John 14 that I read to you.
[time=3098] If you spend Christmas in unforgiveness and bitterness, you will live a miserable Christmas.
[time=3109] If Jesus died, not just to forgive us, he died so we can forgive one another.
[time=3117] There will be elders here at the end if you need to come and pray, and we will sing and we will give and we will worship through different means, but one of the best ways you can worship is to forgive.
[time=3130] Let's pray.
[time=3132] Dear Father, we thank you for your word that is beautiful, that is wonderful.
[time=3137] Thank you for your word that is true.
[time=3139] It was true 4,000 years ago, 3,000 years ago, and it's true today.
[time=3149] Thank you that you are in control and thank you that sometimes in order to start our conscience, you put us through extreme need, you put us through harsh treatment.
[time=3162] Help us to see your hand at work.
[time=3166] Even though we are not seeing what you are doing, help us to trust your hand, help us to trust your heart.
[time=3174] I pray that if someone here does not know Jesus Christ as their personal, ordained Savior, that today will be the day of salvation and they will surrender their life to you.
[time=3184] And especially I want to pray for the families here that need forgiveness.
[time=3194] Maybe today there is bitterness and resentment and there is evil and wickedness and all types
[time=3201] of things.
[time=3203] I pray that this season at Christmas, we will understand what it means to forgive one another and to experience the power of reconciliation that is only possible when we understand who
[time=3214] you are and when we forgive.
[time=3220] I pray that we will understand Jesus' forgiveness in our life and we will understand that we need to forgive others.
[time=3228] In Christ's name I pray, amen.
[time=3232] Praising grace, how sweet the sound, and say the rich, like me, I once was lost in the
[time=3251] world, and found, for life, but now I see.
[time=3266] Praise and talk my heart to you, and grace my views freely.
[time=3284] My chains are gone, I've been set free, My God, my Savior, His red song ye.
[time=3310] And like the flood, His mercy erades, unending love, amazing grace.
[time=3328] The Lord has drawn His Word to me, His word, my hope, same yours, He will now shield and
[time=3352] the Lord shall be, as long as life renews, My chains are gone, I've been set free, My
[time=3368] God, my Savior, His red song ye, and out of love, His mercy erades, unending love,
[time=3387] amazing grace.
[time=3392] The earth shall soon dissolve like snow, the sun forever to shine, my God, who calls me
[time=3414] here below will be forever mine, you are forever mine, my chains are gone, I've been set free,
[time=3438] My God, my Savior, His red song ye, and like the flood, His mercy erades, unending love,
[time=3458] amazing grace.
[time=3461] My chains are gone, I've been set free, My God, my Savior, His red song ye, and
[time=3476] I have loved His mercy erades, unending love, amazing grace, unending love, amazing grace.
[time=3506] Thank you.
[time=3536] You
