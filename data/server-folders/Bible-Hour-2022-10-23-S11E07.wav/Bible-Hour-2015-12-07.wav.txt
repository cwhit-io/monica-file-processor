[time=100] All right, now put your hands together.
[time=105] [MUSIC]
[time=110] Can't believe that a king would need a beautiful place that we can't conceive.
[time=117] A place where the streets are gold and the gates are burned.
[time=125] But that's what he did so long ago.
[time=129] He came as a babe so the world would know of a cradle.
[time=136] Cradle that rocked the world.
[time=140] [MUSIC]
[time=170] What a brilliant, perfect man.
[time=178] Bringing love no earthly power can sever.
[time=186] Heaven's story will never end.
[time=189] It's all will be sung again.
[time=193] Forever and ever, a son of God becomes son of man.
[time=201] Heaven's birthday king is a perfect land.
[time=206] We're building a plan that was made before the stars were unfurled.
[time=213] A song 'cause the air everything has changed.
[time=217] All of the heavens were ever raised by a cradle.
[time=223] Cradle that rocked the world.
[time=227] Oh, yeah, my cradle, cradle, cradle that rocked the world.
[time=238] [MUSIC]
[time=241] Son of God and son of man.
[time=250] Heaven's king is a perfect land.
[time=258] Cradle, cradle that rocked the world.

[time=590] Thank you, Info.
[time=592] Captain's Log, March 25, 2015.
[time=596] Location, Deep Space.
[time=598] Captain Travis Magellan, in command of the SSM manual, the world's most advanced spaceship.
[time=603] We blasted off from the space center hours ago.
[time=606] We are departing Earth orbit into deep space.
[time=608] Our mission is to discover, witness, and record the indescribable beauty and size of God's creation.
[time=614] Our ship, the Emmanuel, can travel at or near light speed, which will allow us to complete in just six months or would take a normal ship decades.
[time=622] Our mission motto is Psalm 19-1.
[time=624] The heavens declare the glory of God and the skies proclaim the work of his hands.
[time=629] [MUSIC - 41 seconds]
[time=678] [APPLAUSE]
[time=682] Captain's Log.
[time=684] Here's the Log, Captain.
[time=686] Captain's Log, December 24, 2015.
[time=691] The six-month mission of the SSM manual is now in its ninth month.
[time=695] I and the crew have documented the most incredible creations of God known to man.
[time=700] We have seen planets larger than our home solar system.
[time=703] We have seen nebulous, which remind us of the scriptures.
[time=705] When we see your moon and your stars, what is man that you are mindful of him?
[time=709] But due to some navigation difficulties, we have not yet returned to Earth.
[time=717] Though we have never intended to be in space this long, tonight we celebrate Christmas.
[time=721] And tomorrow, the birth of Christ, so info.
[time=725] Give me the status reports on the Christmas plans.
[time=728] Look, we're decorating.
[time=730] Decorating?
[time=731] With what?
[time=732] We didn't bring any decorations with us.
[time=734] Did we zip?
[time=735] Nope, Captain, but that isn't stopping us.
[time=737] We're making our own decorations.
[time=739] See, Captain, this is one of the ball bearings from the broken outright amount.
[time=746] How creative, Otto?
[time=749] Look what I've got.
[time=751] Tinsel, where'd you find that?
[time=753] It's not tinsel.
[time=754] It's the electrical cable from the camera probe that got zapped in the meteor storm.
[time=758] I've never seen something so beautifully ruined.
[time=760] And what do you have there, Sparky?
[time=763] It's a miniature Christmas tree.
[time=768] Wow.
[time=770] That looks familiar.
[time=773] Where did you get that Christmas tree?
[time=775] It was in a big metal can.
[time=777] Down in the environmental bay.
[time=779] That can yellow with weird letters on it.
[time=782] There's a supply, do not touch.
[time=784] Yes, it did.
[time=785] Sparky, that's a filter for our breathing here.
[time=788] It's essential for our survival.
[time=790] Without it, we haven't lost a day.
[time=792] Oh.
[time=797] Should I put it back?
[time=799] I would recommend sometime today.
[time=802] Okay, robot.
[time=804] You guys sure don't have much Christmas spirit.
[time=809] So info back to those decorating status reports.
[time=813] Well, the Christmas decorations are going up.
[time=815] The hot chocolate is just about ready.
[time=817] And we're going caroling through decks 25 through 179 tonight.
[time=821] And the nativity scene?
[time=823] We're doing what we can, Captain.
[time=825] But it's not as easy as Christmas decoration.
[time=828] Well, I'm sure you're all doing great.
[time=830] We're trying.
[time=831] We're making our own little Bethlehem in outer space.
[time=834] We are, but I still miss home.
[time=836] Hey, I have an idea.
[time=838] Let's decorate the whole ship.
[time=841] Are you going, Miss Polo?
[time=843] Getting my space suit.
[time=844] I'm going to go hang me outside lights.
[time=846] Where did I leave my hammer?
[time=848] Hammer!
[time=849] Where did she go?
[time=850] Her seat goes out.
[time=851] No nails.
[time=852] You hear me?
[time=853] No nails.
[time=854] I want to be.
[time=855] I really want to be home.
[time=856] Home for Christmas.
[time=857] I want to be.
[time=858] I really want to be home.
[time=859] Home for Christmas.
[time=860] I want to be.
[time=861] I really want to be home.
[time=862] Home for Christmas.
[time=864] I want to be.
[time=865] I really want to be home.
[time=866] Home for Christmas.
[time=867] And the shot leads to deck for patience.
[time=868] So even though we're going to have to date in the college day for, we should know how to go.
[time=869] We should know how to go.
[time=871] I want to be.
[time=872] I really want to be home.
[time=873] Home for Christmas.
[time=875] And the shot leads to deck for patience.
[time=876] We should know how to go.
[time=879] Home for Christmas.
[time=881] Something wrong, Zip?
[time=882] I just kind of miss Christmas presents.
[time=884] It's nice to know people are thinking about me.
[time=887] I got you a present.
[time=888] I was going to wait until Christmas.
[time=890] But, well, here.
[time=892] Wow.
[time=893] What is it?
[time=894] A paperweight.
[time=895] In the shape of the jar, all that keeps our ship from being pulled straight into the sun.
[time=900] Erm, maybe?
[time=902] I'll get you something else, but I was thinking about you.
[time=905] I want to be.
[time=907] I really want to be home.
[time=909] Home for Christmas.
[time=911] I want to be.
[time=913] I really want to be home.
[time=915] Home for Christmas.
[time=916] I want to be.
[time=918] I really want to be home.
[time=920] Home for Christmas.
[time=921] A wrap up presents for our country.
[time=924] And shape the ones I know are for me.
[time=927] The toilet tastes more.
[time=928] Me too now I'm home.
[time=931] Home for Christmas.
[time=933] I miss all the Christmas food.
[time=935] The candy.
[time=937] The snickerdoodles.
[time=938] I just wish the cooks knickerdoodle word because my mom's.
[time=942] Our cook doesn't know how to make snickerdoodles.
[time=946] You're telling me the ones they put out in the library are as hard as rocks.
[time=950] Were they black and about the size of baseballs?
[time=953] Yep, and burnt to our crisp.
[time=955] Eat them all, though.
[time=956] Great.
[time=957] Now we have to plant more meteorite samples.
[time=960] It's just alright.
[time=963] We'll be out of sight.
[time=966] We'll look out and see from family.
[time=969] My ears away from love so near this Christmas time.
[time=974] It will be divine.
[time=977] If all of us were together, it would make them all the day fair.
[time=983] I want to be.
[time=985] I really want to be home.
[time=987] Home for Christmas.
[time=989] I want to be.
[time=991] I really want to be home.
[time=993] Home for Christmas.
[time=995] It's all my cooking.
[time=996] Slightly burning.
[time=997] A lightly forming me next door.
[time=1000] It's all a taste for me to know I'm home.
[time=1004] Just those little kids remind me of home.
[time=1009] Surrounded by my friends and family I'm home.
[time=1015] Home for Christmas.
[time=1019] Navigator Polo.
[time=1023] Where's the navigator?
[time=1025] She may be lost on the ship again.
[time=1027] Again?
[time=1028] I last detected her wandering on deck 79 about ten minutes ago.
[time=1033] I thought we gave her a map of the ship.
[time=1035] You know she's not good with maps, Captain.
[time=1038] There you are, Polo.
[time=1040] Where?
[time=1041] On the bridge, of course.
[time=1043] What a relief.
[time=1044] I thought it was done for.
[time=1045] Miss Polo.
[time=1046] Do you have any idea how we can get back to Earth?
[time=1048] Captain, what if I told you I had a plane that could get us home tonight?
[time=1052] What are you talking about, Miss Polo?
[time=1054] That's impossible.
[time=1056] Otto, you're the pilot.
[time=1057] Exactly how fast is this ship?
[time=1059] No one has any idea.
[time=1062] You know that.
[time=1063] We're limited to Actus v. 10.
[time=1065] This ship is so powerful that scientists are afraid of field binder up.
[time=1069] She can disrupt all the physics.
[time=1071] It could go well over Actus v. 10.
[time=1073] And to hyperactus v.
[time=1074] No one knows what might happen.
[time=1076] Well, I think I do.
[time=1078] We would approach the speed of light and be home in minutes.
[time=1080] That's my plan.
[time=1082] Wait.
[time=1083] If we go one mile per hour faster than the speed of light, it could be a disaster.
[time=1087] No one's ever flown that fast.
[time=1089] I'll be careful.
[time=1090] I'll just give this button a little push.
[time=1093] No!
[time=1094] Don't do that!
[time=1095] Miss Otto.
[time=1098] Holds back from hyper speed.
[time=1100] Hey, Otto.
[time=1101] I wasn't finished.
[time=1105] Damage control report.
[time=1107] Hey, my computer's orbiting Earth.
[time=1118] In fact, we're of Washington, D.C.
[time=1121] It's Earth.
[time=1123] We're home.
[time=1124] Land, sweet land.
[time=1126] Actually, we're still on the ship.
[time=1128] Well, then let's do something about that.
[time=1131] Zip, prepare the zoom beam transporter.
[time=1134] Let's surprise Penny, our faithful ground control, by beaming her up to the ship.
[time=1138] Boy, is she going to be excited to see us.
[time=1140] Zoom beam ready.
[time=1142] We're well.
[time=1143] Zip the zoom beam.
[time=1144] Zip zapping.
[time=1145] Oh, no.
[time=1152] Oh, that's not Penny.
[time=1154] But isn't that the guy on the penny?
[time=1157] We went too fast.
[time=1159] We worked time.
[time=1160] We went backwards in time.
[time=1162] How far?
[time=1163] More like 200 zip.
[time=1168] Be Mr. Lincoln back to Earth and fast.
[time=1170] Apparently going faster than the speed of light wasn't a good idea.
[time=1173] Now we're time travelers, but I'll get you home crew.
[time=1176] Hello.
[time=1180] I just had a thought.
[time=1182] If we accidentally discovered how to travel back in time, what would keep us from going back to all the way when Jesus was on the Earth?
[time=1189] It would be incredible.
[time=1190] It might work.
[time=1191] But how will we find the right time place?
[time=1194] That little thing with President Lincoln was a total accident.
[time=1197] Info.
[time=1198] Give me a Bible.
[time=1199] Got one right here.
[time=1200] Okay.
[time=1201] Let's see.
[time=1202] His mother Mary was from Nazareth in Galilee.
[time=1207] Jesus was born in Bethlehem, but they returned to Galilee where Jesus grew up.
[time=1213] He called his disciples right around the Sea of Galilee, and most of his ministry was in the Galilee region.
[time=1218] Polo, chart a course for the time of King Herod and Caesar Augustus.
[time=1222] Hiya, Captain.
[time=1248] Holy water.
[time=1250] Every choice in the same God is great.
[time=1253] In Galilee, born and far away.
[time=1258] Holy clothes have a bad life.
[time=1261] How silly sea lies.
[time=1264] Love, love, love, love, keep in tree.
[time=1267] Let's see.
[time=1268] The sun is harsh.
[time=1269] No lie.
[time=1270] Again, in light, our streets shine.
[time=1273] In the everlasting light.
[time=1276] The hearts and fears of all values are met in thee tonight.
[time=1284] In a Galilee far, far away.
[time=1287] Very intrusive, troubled night is it.
[time=1290] In Bethlehem, where Christ was born.
[time=1293] And gives your life for all the world.
[time=1296] The sun's open, good of love and peace.
[time=1299] The light could walk, and the light could see you.
[time=1302] God's great life was art displayed.
[time=1305] In a Galilee, born and far away.
[time=1310] Pro-com, all be faithful.
[time=1314] Joyful and triumphant.
[time=1317] Oh, come, hear, oh, come, hear today.
[time=1323] Come and behold Him, who are left to be an angel.
[time=1330] Rejoice!
[time=1336] Oh, come let us adore Him.
[time=1339] And come, come on.
[time=1343] In a Galilee far, far away.
[time=1346] Hope for the world for every change.
[time=1349] Put a cord to keep a key.
[time=1351] It's not to rescue every dew.
[time=1354] When there's dew, there's a tree from grey.
[time=1357] In a Galilee far, far away.
[time=1370] Christ the Lord has come to stay.
[time=1374] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1379] Ms. Polo, position report.
[time=1381] Captain, get in closer.
[time=1383] But we'll still need to stay in hybrid activity for several more minutes.
[time=1386] Captain, may I ask a question.
[time=1388] Why would you delay going home to see a child born 2,000 years ago?
[time=1393] Oh, robot, it's not just a child, it's the Son of God.
[time=1397] God, the creator of the world.
[time=1399] That's right.
[time=1400] God created people in His own image to know Him and to have a relationship with Him.
[time=1405] But we rejected Him and decided we wanted to go our own way.
[time=1409] The created rejected the creator unacceptable.
[time=1413] That's right, robot, we're like lost people walking in darkness.
[time=1417] That's why Jesus came.
[time=1418] Christmas is when the Son of God became a man like us to bring us back to Him and to save us from our hopelessness.
[time=1424] All the amazing lights and space that we've been seeing, that's God's handiwork.
[time=1429] But the Bible says, Jesus is the light of the world.
[time=1432] Before He was born, the prophets said, to those who walk in darkness, a great light has dawned.
[time=1438] That was Jesus, the light of the world.
[time=1441] Why is this information not in my data banks?
[time=1444] Well, I'm afraid it might be some bad programming, robot.
[time=1447] We have some great computers, but the most important information is found right here.
[time=1452] This is the Word of God.
[time=1454] That's right.
[time=1456] If you want to know what God says, it's all right here.
[time=1459] It's all in the book.
[time=1468] In the beginning, a creation, God's been writing His love for us.
[time=1472] It's an amateur story.
[time=1475] I'm God in all this glory.
[time=1477] It comes to rescue the ones that heal.
[time=1479] All in the book is true.
[time=1483] Truth everywhere for He and Him.
[time=1486] Just His love and His love is strong enough.
[time=1491] You save us.
[time=1494] His eyes are breakable.
[time=1497] Never in me knows the good things are all in the book.
[time=1502] We're back in the beginning of creation.
[time=1517] We had a terrible fall.
[time=1520] All I was believed and I loved you and me.
[time=1523] In need of someone to save us all.
[time=1527] All in the book is true.
[time=1530] Truth everywhere for He and Him.
[time=1533] Just His love and His love is strong enough.
[time=1538] You save us.
[time=1541] His love is not breakable.
[time=1544] Never in me knows the good things are all in the book.
[time=1554] After many years, God said now was the time.
[time=1560] In Bethlehem, just like His word said, the Savior of us born would die.
[time=1566] The promise was fulfilled.
[time=1569] His word had been revealed.
[time=1572] He meant the well.
[time=1574] God's only son had come to rescue the ones that heal.
[time=1578] It's all in the book.
[time=1581] And the book is true.
[time=1583] Truth everywhere for He and Him.
[time=1586] Just His love and His love is strong enough.
[time=1591] To save us.
[time=1594] His love is not breakable.
[time=1597] Never in me knows the good things are all in the book.
[time=1603] And the book is true.
[time=1605] It's all in the book.
[time=1609] And the book is true.
[time=1611] Truth.
[time=1612] It's all in the book.
[time=1616] Prepare for deceleration from hyperactivity.
[time=1622] Status, please.
[time=1624] Captain, we're in Earth orbit.
[time=1628] It may be Earth, but what year?
[time=1632] I'm clear on where we are, just not the one.
[time=1635] Captain, sensors detect people in the arrow area we've honed in on.
[time=1641] Turn on the viewport and see who they are.
[time=1645] Those look like shepherds.
[time=1647] Sparky, where are we?
[time=1650] When are we?
[time=1651] Let's get robot on all the feet to see if he can decipher their language.
[time=1658] Captain, this is quite amazing.
[time=1660] We are in orbit over the hills near Bethlehem.
[time=1663] The time appears to be just before the birth of Christ.
[time=1667] Yay!
[time=1669] We overshot Galilee and we're right to Bethlehem.
[time=1672] Be prepared.
[time=1673] Jesus, the son of God, is about to come to Earth as the form of the baby.
[time=1677] And the first ones to know are the shepherds.
[time=1681] What exactly is going to happen?
[time=1683] Well, according to Luke, there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping a watch over their flax at night.
[time=1689] And suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of God shone all around them, and they were terrified.
[time=1695] It's night in Bethlehem. The angels could be arriving at any time.
[time=1698] Should we zap down, Captain?
[time=1700] No, we don't want to interfere in any way.
[time=1703] It's so quiet down there.
[time=1705] Does anybody else hear something?
[time=1707] The shepherds are looking up. Do they see us?
[time=1710] Impossible, but they seem to see something.
[time=1726] It was a night just like any other.
[time=1731] Stiles it up this silent night.
[time=1735] The shepherds watched as their flocks lay sleeping.
[time=1739] Until a host of angels filled the sky.
[time=1746] On the angel singing for the end, for it to God our God.
[time=1754] If your voice is singing for the end, our Savior is born to the end.
[time=1761] For the Savior is born, joy to the world, our Savior is born tonight.
[time=1772] Then I became unlike any other.
[time=1776] As angel voices filled the sky at night.
[time=1780] If you're not, we bring good news and great joy.
[time=1785] Christ our Savior is born tonight.
[time=1791] Shouldn't the angels singing for the end, for it to God our God.
[time=1799] If your voice is singing for the end, our Savior is born tonight.
[time=1807] Our Savior is born, joy to the world, our Savior is born tonight.
[time=1817] For the Lord, in the next time He stands.
[time=1832] When the angels singing for the end, for it to God our God.
[time=1840] If your voice is singing for the end, our Savior is born tonight.
[time=1847] The Savior is born, joy to the world, the Lord has come.
[time=1855] Our Savior is born tonight.
[time=1860] Wow, we just saw the announcement of the birth of Christ, the very Son of God.
[time=1866] That was unbelievable. Can we move in closer? I want to see their faces.
[time=1870] Very well. Mr. Otto Louvas carefully into a lower orbit.
[time=1875] I'll do it! No!
[time=1878] Robot, where do the computers say we are?
[time=1888] We are still over Earth.
[time=1890] See? No problem. We're still over Bethlehem.
[time=1893] But the computers are not programmed to tell us when we are.
[time=1897] Info, engage the viewport.
[time=1899] I'm telling you, it's fine.
[time=1904] It's jammed by hyperactivity.
[time=1906] Very well. Beam up a life form zip that should tell us when we are.
[time=1910] I'm telling you, it's going to be a sheep or shepherd.
[time=1914] Zoom beam ready.
[time=1916] Very well, zip. Zap the zoom beam.
[time=1919] Zip zapping.
[time=1921] Welcome to the SS Emmanuel. Shepherds.
[time=1928] Are you sure those are shepherds?
[time=1930] Hey Betty, cast my bond. These have cats.
[time=1933] Far out.
[time=1934] Dig those crazy duds.
[time=1938] I'm Captain Magellan of the Spaceship Emmanuel.
[time=1942] And this is my crew. And our robot.
[time=1944] Spaceship, I travel right on my cage.
[time=1947] Will you excuse me for a minute?
[time=1949] Robot, what are they saying?
[time=1952] Captain, I may have detected this language in my memory banks.
[time=1955] I might be able to communicate with these beings.
[time=1961] Hey, Clyde. What's buzzing cousin?
[time=1963] Cats.
[time=1965] Rap mix king staff.
[time=1967] They are impressed that I can speak their language.
[time=1970] Cats, we zapped you, and now we're in Nowhere'sville.
[time=1973] We need you to blow this bird, but we need you to slip us the low down.
[time=1977] What language is this robot? Who are they?
[time=1981] Captain, I'm afraid that this is a form of English spoken in the mid-20th century.
[time=1985] And these people might just be your grandparents.
[time=1988] (Laughter)
[time=1995] Great. Now we're lost again.
[time=1998] What's that in her hand?
[time=2001] Oh, this is my transit radio. I'm just listening to my faith song, Johnny Angel.
[time=2006] Uh-oh. I use the coordinates singing and Angel to move us closer.
[time=2011] I guess I should have been more specific.
[time=2014] No, what do we do? We're lost again.
[time=2020] I've just had a thought.
[time=2022] First, uh, beam these cats back down.
[time=2025] Hi, Captain.
[time=2027] We're on a mission to see the glory of God in the universe.
[time=2032] And we're good at finding stars, so why don't we navigate to the star of Bethlehem?
[time=2037] The one that the wise men fold to find Jesus. When he was a baby.
[time=2040] That would be doable.
[time=2041] The light would have created, the star would have created a huge light in the sky over 2,000 years ago.
[time=2048] Sparky, scan for remnants of the energy of that light.
[time=2051] C. Polo, program the computers with these Bible chapters.
[time=2055] Matthew 2.
[time=2056] Matthew 2, II.
[time=2058] Luke 2.
[time=2059] Luke 2, II. Captain, we have location and a course.
[time=2062] Mr. Otto, send us.
[time=2064] Mr. Otto, status report.
[time=2068] Captain, we're hyperactive.
[time=2070] Good. Any moment we should be ready to decelerate into the time of the wise men.
[time=2075] I can't believe...
[time=2077] Look at the viewport!
[time=2079] What is it?
[time=2080] It's a star. Follow it.
[time=2093] Three wise men in a caravan across a desert stamp.
[time=2098] Following a star, three gifts held in their hands for the Son of Man.
[time=2104] Traveling afar.
[time=2107] And they wonder where they are.
[time=2110] The star will shine, showing away, riding at the darkest night.
[time=2119] The faithful guy won't hate you a stray.
[time=2122] The darkest will never hide it fly.
[time=2126] The star will shine, oh, the perfect light.
[time=2132] The shining bright, oh, the darkest night.
[time=2139] The star will shine.
[time=2147] The still wise men go seeking him when the way is dim.
[time=2152] His light is there to cry.
[time=2154] It's true for all of us, no matter what becomes.
[time=2158] He'll never leave our side.
[time=2161] And forever his light will shine.
[time=2165] The star will shine, showing away, riding at the darkest night.
[time=2173] The faithful guy won't hate you a stray.
[time=2177] The darkest will never hide it fly.
[time=2181] The star will shine, oh, the perfect light.
[time=2187] The shining bright, oh, the darkest night.
[time=2194] The star will shine, oh, the darkest night.
[time=2200] The star will shine, showing away, riding at the darkest night.
[time=2221] The faithful guy won't hate you a stray.
[time=2225] The darkest will never hide it fly.
[time=2229] The star will shine, oh, the perfect light.
[time=2235] The shining bright, oh, the darkest night.
[time=2242] The star will shine.
[time=2245] Keep following that star.
[time=2251] Yo fellas.
[time=2253] You?
[time=2254] How did you get back on the ship?
[time=2256] I just don't dig. You rubbed up your hot rod.
[time=2259] And when I blinked, I was like on green.
[time=2262] But I made tracks through the garden gates, and here I am.
[time=2266] Robot, translation please.
[time=2269] Captain, she was apparently not being back to earth, but to our food and vegetable greenhouse.
[time=2275] Well, the target was a field.
[time=2278] But now we're stuck with her, and we can't beam her down to over the mid-20th century.
[time=2284] Ms. Polo, better detour back to the 1960s.
[time=2287] Aye, Captain.
[time=2289] We're gonna take a ride, Clyde.
[time=2295] We'll catch you on the B-side to Thaumaturia at home.
[time=2298] Smooth.
[time=2299] Approaching the 20th century, Captain.
[time=2301] Very well.
[time=2302] Come down from hyperactivity.
[time=2305] Viewport on.
[time=2311] Captain, we're back in Bethlehem.
[time=2313] There's sheep, cows, donkeys.
[time=2315] It's like a zoo down there.
[time=2316] Shepherds, sheep, a manger.
[time=2319] That must be his mother, Mary.
[time=2321] And that would be Joseph.
[time=2323] And there's infant child. We're back.
[time=2325] But how did this happen?
[time=2327] I'm not sure.
[time=2328] And I'm not gonna miss this again.
[time=2330] Mr. Otto, prepare a shore party.
[time=2332] Aye, aye, Captain.
[time=2333] Zoom, beam, officer, zip.
[time=2335] You stay on the bridge.
[time=2336] Everyone else, come with me to the surface.
[time=2338] Hurry.
[time=2339] You may need these to blend in.
[time=2341] There's shepherds clothing.
[time=2343] Great idea.
[time=2344] Zip, zero in on the zoo zone and zap the zoom.
[time=2347] I don't know what to say.
[time=2353] This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.
[time=2355] The birth of the Savior.
[time=2357] When the angel had left them and gone into heaven,
[time=2366] the shepherd said to one another, let's go to Bethlehem and see the things which have happened, which the Lord has told us about.
[time=2373] So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the baby who was lying in a manger.
[time=2377] When they had seen him, they spread word concerning what had been told to them about this child.
[time=2381] All who heard it were amazed at what had been told to them.
[time=2391] What child is this who lay to rest on Mary's lap is singing.
[time=2402] Who angels be within the sea,
[time=2408] while shepherds watch our king be.
[time=2415] After Jesus was born in Bethlehem and Judea during the time of King Herod, Magi from these came and asked, where is the one born king of the Jews?
[time=2424] We saw us when it rose and came to worship him.
[time=2428] On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary.
[time=2432] They bowed down and worshiped him.
[time=2434] Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense and murder.
[time=2451] So bring him in since gold and birth,
[time=2457] confess and king to all him.
[time=2462] The king of kings of nation greats,
[time=2468] black loving hearts and grime in.
[time=2475] Seek him with all your heart.
[time=2480] Christ was born to say, and also to me seek him.
[time=2491] Christ himself today.
[time=2500] This is Christ the King,
[time=2506] who shepherds are and angels sing.
[time=2512] Praise, praise, to bring him what the babe,
[time=2519] the son of Mary.
[time=2527] Seek him with all your heart.
[time=2532] Christ was born to say, and also to me seek him.
[time=2543] Christ himself today.
[time=2551] And also to me seek him.
[time=2558] Christ himself today.
[time=2573] Excuse me, sir.
[time=2575] Can we see the child?
[time=2577] Sparky, nobody here speaks English.
[time=2579] We don't.
[time=2582] Wait, where are we?
[time=2584] We're in Bethlehem, of course.
[time=2586] See, I told you we'd make it.
[time=2588] I'm the Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.
[time=2594] What year is this?
[time=2595] 1741.
[time=2596] Oh dear, we're way off.
[time=2600] You are our first visitors.
[time=2601] Today, Christ received 1741.
[time=2604] We have found it our own town.
[time=2605] Its name is in honor of our Savior, and we are reliving the night of His birth to remember what He's done for us.
[time=2611] My dad, a bank, say that Christians settled here, a place where they could freely worship God.
[time=2617] So this isn't the real Bethlehem, and this is 1741, so we missed it.
[time=2622] We were right there, ready to worship the real baby Jesus.
[time=2626] But after Christ crossing the universe, documenting the glory of God, we missed the biggest moment of all.
[time=2631] Well, not so fast, info.
[time=2634] I don't think we missed one bit of God's glory on display.
[time=2638] Look at where we're witnessing here tonight.
[time=2640] Robot, how far away are we from Galilee right now?
[time=2643] Approximately 7,212 miles, and approximately 1,700 years.
[time=2649] That's right.
[time=2650] And here, on the other side of the world, centuries later, the good news of the Savior's birth is still spreading.
[time=2655] All over the world, for the past 2,000 years, people have been remembering the real Jesus, the one who saved them from their sins.
[time=2663] Captain, you're right.
[time=2664] Of all the evidences we've been seeing of God's glory, this is the best of all.
[time=2670] We've got some good news to broadcast.
[time=2673] Captain Magellan, I'm guessing you, you want me to end this shit back to our tomb?
[time=2677] Exactly right.
[time=2678] Let's get back and spread the news.
[time=2681] Go talent, talent.
[time=2690] In all the universe, there's no greater news.
[time=2693] Go talent, talent, talent to everyone.
[time=2698] Go talent, talent the good news Christ has come.
[time=2702] Joy to the world the Lord has come.
[time=2706] Go talent, talent, talent to all the world.
[time=2711] Go talent, talent with great joy, Christ is born.
[time=2715] Joy to the world the King is born.
[time=2719] Throughout the world of strength and news, God's gift of love is here for you.
[time=2727] Go talent.
[time=2730] While we were lost in darkness, God sent His light.
[time=2736] While we were dead and sinned, our Savior died.
[time=2742] Raised from the grave, His victory is ours if we trust Him and believe.
[time=2749] And everyone who calls on Jesus' name will be said.
[time=2755] Go talent, talent, talent to everyone.
[time=2759] Go talent, talent the good news Christ has come.
[time=2763] Joy to the world the Lord has come.
[time=2767] Go talent, talent, talent to all the world.
[time=2771] Tell them, tell them the great joy, Christ is born.
[time=2776] Joy to the world the King is born.
[time=2780] Throughout the world of strength and news, God's gift of love is here for you.
[time=2788] Go talent.
[time=2790] One, two, one.
[time=2794] A son is given.
[time=2798] One, two, one.
[time=2800] A child is born.
[time=2804] He's King of peace.
[time=2807] And Lord of course, love brings a peace forever more.
[time=2817] To sing out His praise and He's not to save us.
[time=2825] No child to us.
[time=2828] A son is given.
[time=2832] One, two, one.
[time=2835] A child is born.
[time=2838] He's King of peace.
[time=2841] And Lord of Lord, brings a prince of peace.
[time=2847] In the world evermore.
[time=2851] Throughout seeing out His praise and His gift, He's not to save us.
[time=2859] Go talent, talent.
[time=2862] Go talent.
[time=2864] [APPLAUSE]
[time=2871] Full speed ahead, Captain.
[time=2873] We need to back home at approximately ten minutes.
[time=2876] But don't forget to make a quick stop at the 1960s, so Ms. Hepcap here can make the show back at her sock hop.
[time=2884] Thanks, Daddy-O.
[time=2886] And just like I told you, we're all going to be home for Christmas.
[time=2891] Uh-oh, I don't think Mr. Lincoln made it home.
[time=2896] Ms. Polo, better detour back to the 1980s real quick.
[time=2902] Hiya, Captain, and Merry Christmas, everybody.
[time=2906] [APPLAUSE]
[time=2935] [MUSIC - 85 seconds]
[time=3024] [APPLAUSE - 6 seconds]
[time=3036] They did a wonderful job, all the kids, and the parents, and the leaders, and our children ministry, just did such a wonderful job. All the time and the practices that they put into that.
[time=3045] And the story we just heard is real.
[time=3048] It's true. Make a big deal about it.
[time=3051] The experience we just watched and we felt, it's from the Bible, from this book.
[time=3056] And this just isn't a book. It's not just an ordinary book. It's not just ink on a page.
[time=3062] It's God breathed.
[time=3066] God breathed this out. He breathed the scriptures, and it's got communicating to us.
[time=3072] Humanity, it's his way of talking to us. He breathed out life.
[time=3077] It's not a bunch of do's or don'ts.
[time=3080] It's not a bunch of shouldn'ts or don't ever's.
[time=3083] It's not a party killer or it's not restrictive to our fun.
[time=3087] It's not boring or lame or outdated. It's not out of touch.
[time=3092] It's powerful because it is the breath of God.
[time=3095] It's everlasting. It's eternal.
[time=3098] It's God proclaiming, God announcing, God shouting that there is purpose and meaning in this life.
[time=3105] And there is a way that we can know and find that meaning and that purpose.
[time=3110] I've been talking to a friend who I recently met through some texts.
[time=3114] He's kind of exploring this thing called faith in Jesus.
[time=3117] And I gave him a Bible and he asked me the question.
[time=3120] He said, "What is the Bible all about?" It's a little more than you can text.
[time=3126] You know, because it's a story and it's complex and it's a huge question.
[time=3129] It spans thousands of years or 66 books, but they all tell one singular story.
[time=3134] From Genesis to Revelations, it's one single story.
[time=3137] God is the author. He breathed out the words.
[time=3140] And so I text back at its bare at the essence of the scriptures.
[time=3146] It's the story about Jesus.
[time=3149] The story of Jesus, the author God, the father, has breathed out this story about his son, whom he has sent.
[time=3158] And in Jesus we have the greatest example, the clearest picture, the best image of who God is and what he is all about.
[time=3168] And this time of year, I kind of find myself this feeling, you know, Christmas trees and lights and things you drive home.
[time=3176] People have this decorations up, decorations in the lobby.
[time=3178] I just feel this compelling need to kind of read a little bit more.
[time=3182] Read this book a little bit more.
[time=3185] Usually there's snow on the ground, but it feels like spring break out there right now.
[time=3192] Smells like it. Anybody smell spring break? Smells like spring break.
[time=3196] There's something about finding a coffee shop or a taco bell or my kitchen table and just opening it up
[time=3204] and just letting God breathe this story of Jesus into my soul.
[time=3210] And these days around Christmas time, we have this wonderful opportunity to elevate, to make a big deal about what this story is all about, and that's Jesus.
[time=3222] Every single page from beginning to end is about Jesus.
[time=3226] It's not just a story, it's this unique, unrivaled, unmatched story.
[time=3233] And it's unique in purpose, in power, and in person.
[time=3238] And in the purpose, let me read this to you, praise me to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.
[time=3247] For He chose us in Him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in His sight.
[time=3257] The purpose was to make us holy and blameless in His sight so we could have relationship with God.
[time=3267] But there was a problem.
[time=3269] See, as for us, we were dead in our transgressions and our sins in which we used to live when we followed the ways of this world and the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in us, those who are disobedient.
[time=3281] All of us lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our flesh and following its desires and thoughts.
[time=3289] Like the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath.
[time=3293] We were dead in our transgressions, we deserved wrath, but the power of God.
[time=3298] But because of His great love for us, God who has rich in mercy made us alive in Christ even when we were dead in our transgressions.
[time=3309] It is by grace that you are saved, and it is through the person of Christ that saves us, the son who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.
[time=3323] For in Him all things were created, things in heaven and on earth visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities, all things have been created through Him and for Him.
[time=3336] He is before all things and in Him all things hold together and He is the body.
[time=3341] He is the head of the body, the church, this family.
[time=3345] He is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead so that in everything He might have the supremacy.
[time=3351] For God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Him.
[time=3356] That's Jesus.
[time=3357] And through Him to reconcile to Himself all things were the things on earth or things in heaven by making peace through His blood shed on the cross.
[time=3369] Jesus is the one who has come and is to come.
[time=3372] He is the beginning and He has no beginning, He has no end.
[time=3375] He is the same yesterday, today and forever.
[time=3378] Jesus is unchanging, constant and present.
[time=3383] Jesus was Jesus.
[time=3385] He is Jesus, He will always be Jesus.
[time=3387] He is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.
[time=3392] He is the first and the last.
[time=3394] He is before all things, He is in all things.
[time=3398] Sustaining all things, He is the greatest person to ever live, whoever lived and always be living.
[time=3406] Jesus is the light, He is the source of light, He is the center of the story.
[time=3410] God breathed the story of the universe is about Jesus.
[time=3417] Not just a book, not just ink on a page or principles to live by, but the unfolding story of this person named Jesus Christ, who shall be called Jesus.
[time=3429] And Matthew one says that she will give birth to a son.
[time=3433] And you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.
[time=3440] And Luke two, it says this, "Do not be afraid.
[time=3443] I bring you good news, good news of great joy that will, for all the people, good news, great joy, all people."
[time=3453] And what is that, great news? For God so loved, for God so loved the world that He gave.
[time=3463] And we give presence, we are giving, God gave us the greatest gift ever, the only son that whoever, whoever believes in him, shall not perish but have eternal life.
[time=3473] We can know God. For God to not send his son into this world, condemn the world, but to save the world through him.
[time=3482] The story is about Jesus. This time of year is about Jesus.
[time=3486] The purpose was to make us holy and blameless.
[time=3488] The power was to bring us from death to life through the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3493] So I ask you this question today, has there ever been a time in your life when you placed your trust in Jesus Christ?
[time=3501] Would you consider Jesus this Christmas story, this Christmas year, and make him the center of your story?
[time=3509] Would you consider Jesus this year? Would you consider Jesus?
[time=3514] Today, right now as I speak, as you sit there, you can begin a relationship with Jesus Christ today.
[time=3523] He can bring you from death to life.
[time=3527] That's what He was here for.
[time=3529] He came for God so loved that He gave His one and only son, Jesus, for us.
[time=3539] You
