[time=342] [APPLAUSE]
[time=349] You may be seated.
[time=352] My family moved around quite a bit when I was younger.
[time=356] I was in our name, my dad was in the military.
[time=359] So we moved every couple of years.
[time=361] I was raised in the United Methodist Church and we went to church every Sunday, went to Sunday school.
[time=366] A lot of times had church Sunday nights and Wednesday nights as well.
[time=370] But I didn't necessarily take it seriously.
[time=375] As I was growing up, I was kind of like the odd man out, so to speak, like in school and social circles.
[time=382] I looked a little different, talked a little different.
[time=385] So I found that my formative years were fairly lonely.
[time=390] I was bullied a lot, and actually I was also bullied by kids in the church as well.
[time=397] So I really didn't have the best relationship with this cat that they called Jesus.
[time=404] So as I grew older, I became even more isolated, angrier.
[time=410] I started falling into sort of a crowd of folks that probably wasn't the best for me.
[time=416] But they accepted me, they didn't make fun of me or anything like that.
[time=420] So I just kind of followed along with them.
[time=422] However, they were kind of, they were involved with a couple things that weren't too good.
[time=427] They were involved with underage, drinking, drug use, the occult, things like that.
[time=433] So I just kind of followed along with that.
[time=436] And I found that I was feeling more isolated, angrier.
[time=441] And when I was getting to my younger teen years, I was getting angrier and angrier with just life in general.
[time=448] I didn't want to talk to anybody, didn't want to be around anybody.
[time=452] Certainly didn't want to believe the things that they were telling me in church.
[time=457] I dealt with feelings of isolation, dealt with suicidal thoughts and things like that.
[time=465] And I really didn't feel like I had anywhere to go necessarily.
[time=473] So I had quite a few spiritual battles that I was fighting.
[time=478] But after kind of got through those, I felt that it was time that I could kind of take my faith seriously,
[time=491] that I wasn't being lied to, that I wasn't being fooled.
[time=495] You know, that this magical character, God in the sky, was not just something that people made up.
[time=501] So I started to kind of take my faith seriously.
[time=505] And at that time, I felt a call for ministry, didn't know how that was going to turn out.
[time=512] But I just kind of followed along, just kind of towed the line.
[time=516] And then when my dad got out of the military, we moved to Indiana.
[time=521] And I ended up at a church, a local church, and actually ended up volunteering for the youth programming.
[time=529] I did youth ministry for quite a few years and ended up leading their youth group for two years.
[time=535] But I found that we really kind of stopped growing spiritually, me and my family.
[time=541] So my wife and I kind of made a decision to leave that church.
[time=546] And we ended up here at Blackhawk because we had met, we'd met Judy and Dre and several members of this church.
[time=555] And we felt that they were people that could help us grow.
[time=560] So we made that decision to move to Blackhawk.
[time=564] And now, as of handing over more things, more parts of my life to God, I find that he blesses me more, blesses my family more.
[time=576] Obviously, you guys see me on stage quite a bit here at Blackhawk.
[time=580] I'm also the worship leader at a small church plant here in town.
[time=584] It's called The Gathering.
[time=586] And I'm the basis for a local Christian rock group called Filthy Rags.
[time=591] Check us out on Facebook.
[time=593] And I would like to just kind of issue a challenge to whoever's listening to me.
[time=600] I challenge you to hand over your life to God and see how much he blesses you.
[time=607] Because no matter what what paltry gives, we give to God, I find that there's no way that we can out give God.
[time=620] All right, great, great story. That's not cool.
[time=623] I don't want to tell them your name.
[time=626] They saw you in the video, but just make sure you know this is the real you.
[time=629] It's the real me. It's the only one that I've got.
[time=631] My first name is Franklin, but I go by Lee because I'm a little too lazy to say Franklin.
[time=637] So I'm Lee.
[time=639] We're going to baptize today.
[time=642] Baptism is something that's been going on since the beginning of the New Testament times.
[time=648] Baptism is such a cool thing to do.
[time=650] It's part of your story.
[time=651] It's a step of obedience.
[time=652] It doesn't save you, but it shows the world that you want to live for Christ.
[time=657] Have you made that commitment to Jesus Christ?
[time=659] Have you said to Jesus I surrender my heart and soul to him?
[time=662] Yes.
[time=663] Do you want to follow him all the rest of your days?
[time=665] Yes.
[time=666] And it is my privilege and honor to baptize your name, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=679] Hi, my name is Megan, and I'm just going to share a little bit about what God has done
[time=685] in my life.
[time=686] Growing up, I grew up in a broken home.
[time=689] My parents divorced when I was really young.
[time=692] And I often would go to church with my dad on the weekends when I was with him.
[time=698] And I remember enjoying going to children's church, but I don't necessarily remember learning anything.
[time=704] And whenever I was 10, my dad passed away from cancer.
[time=708] And so I quit going to church.
[time=711] And I even remember not considering if he had went to hell or to heaven.
[time=716] And if there was a God and why this would happen, I don't remember having any kind of spiritual questions like that at all.
[time=723] And I wouldn't say that I had an understanding of the gospel or who God was or who Jesus was
[time=730] and how that affected me.
[time=732] And so through elementary school, middle school, and high school, I saw people's approval.
[time=739] And I sought to have good grades and just to be in good standing with everyone.
[time=745] And I often was known as the teacher's pet.
[time=749] And there were many clicks in my school.
[time=752] And it was okay for me to go from one to another to another because I just had that kind of
[time=760] reputation with everyone.
[time=762] And I wanted it to stay like that.
[time=764] And so once I got into college, I started drinking.
[time=769] And at home, I had a good reputation still.
[time=773] And so I knew that that wasn't okay, but I just kept drinking more and more.
[time=778] And it became a frequent thing that I was drinking on the weekends and during the week.
[time=784] And I knew in the back of my head that this was not okay, but I just continued in it.
[time=789] And then in my sophomore year around Halloween, I decided to take a break from drinking.
[time=795] And I had met with a girl with a friend who I knew was religious.
[time=800] And I had told her, "I think I want to start going to church with you." And she was like, "Okay." And so she was involved with a campus ministry called Campus Outreach.
[time=811] And so I began to go with her to their weekly meetings and to go to church.
[time=816] And she began sharing with me.
[time=819] And eventually I went to a conference that Campus Outreach puts on over new years.
[time=823] And at that conference, I had heard the gospel for the first time.
[time=828] And I had just never heard anything like it.
[time=832] That I was a center deserving hell.
[time=835] And that Jesus had come.
[time=837] And he had died on the cross and had taken all of my sin.
[time=841] And that he was offering me eternal life with him.
[time=846] And it just took the step of surrender on my part.
[time=850] And I had just never heard anything like that.
[time=853] And I was blown away.
[time=855] And so at the conference, I just realized that I was a center and I deserved hell.
[time=861] But I didn't know, could I have fun without drinking?
[time=865] Was that even possible?
[time=867] What would my friends think?
[time=869] Would I even have friends?
[time=871] And how could I tell people that I was a Christian?
[time=873] And so I was very aware that I deserved hell.
[time=877] But that I just didn't know if I could do that because of what my friends would think.
[time=884] And so I struggled with that for two months.
[time=887] And then finally in February, I feel like God just really revealed to me that my friends would never die for me.
[time=895] They could not ever offer me eternal life.
[time=898] And it was just foolish of me to be waiting around on them.
[time=901] And so he changed my heart and made me a new person.
[time=905] And so since he changed my heart, I feel like my life has looked completely different.
[time=913] He's changed my desires and that I no longer have a desire to drink and party and to get drunk.
[time=920] I no longer seek approval of people, but instead I seek the approval of Jesus.
[time=926] And I know that my identity is found in him and that I'm a new person and I have eternal life with him.
[time=935] And so it's been so sweet just having a relationship with him and just being made new.
[time=942] All right, all right.
[time=944] Those stories, I hope you heard them.
[time=947] I hope it made sense.
[time=948] And if you're new, if you're not around church, maybe you come around during Christmas and Easter and things like that.
[time=954] We're so glad you're here, but this is what the church is all about.
[time=958] It's about proclaiming Christ and seeing him change lives.
[time=962] That's what it is.
[time=963] That's the gospel.
[time=964] And maybe you've had a bad experience with church.
[time=966] Maybe you've bumped into things you didn't like, but I tell you what, if you try Jesus, you just focus on Christ.
[time=973] It will change your life.
[time=974] It will.
[time=975] And you've seen it in these stories and there's many other stories in this room.
[time=978] I'm so thankful for what you just shared and what Lee shared.
[time=981] It's just powerful what he does.
[time=983] Isn't that true?
[time=984] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[time=985] Do you believe that Jesus Christ is your Lord and Savior?
[time=988] Yes.
[time=989] You just got married, isn't that right?
[time=990] Yeah, I did.
[time=991] Oh, congratulations.
[time=992] Thank you.
[time=993] Do you want to live for him the rest of your life?
[time=994] Yes, I do.
[time=995] Then it is my privilege and honor to baptize any of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
