[time=707] [APPLAUSE]
[time=713] After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem and asked.
[time=724] Where is the one who has been born the king of the Jews?
[time=728] We saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.
[time=734] When King Herod heard this, he was disturbed and all Jerusalem with him.
[time=740] When he had called together all the people's chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Messiah was to be born.
[time=749] In Bethlehem in Judea, they replied, "For this is what the prophet has written.
[time=755] But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah are by no means least among the rulers of Judah.
[time=762] Out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel."
[time=769] Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.
[time=777] He sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search carefully for the child.
[time=784] As soon as you find him, report to me that I too may go and worship him."
[time=790] After they had heard the king, they went on their way.
[time=793] And the star they had seen when it rose went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.
[time=801] When they saw the star, they were overjoyed.
[time=806] On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary and bowed down and worshiped him.
[time=814] Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and frankincense and mer.
[time=822] And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another root.
[time=829] "When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream." "Get up," he said.
[time=835] "Take the child, his mother, and escape to Egypt.
[time=839] Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
[time=846] So he got up, he took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt where he stayed until the death of Herod.
[time=854] And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet.
[time=858] "Out of Egypt, I called my son." When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the magi, he was furious and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem
[time=871] and in its vicinity who were two years old and under in accordance with the time that he had learned from the magi.
[time=880] Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled.
[time=885] A voice is heard in Rama weeping and great morning.
[time=890] Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted because they are no more.
[time=897] After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt and said, "Get up.
[time=904] Take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel.
[time=908] For those who were trying to take the child's life are dead." So he got up, he took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.
[time=920] Good morning, my name is Rick Raber, I'm one of the elders here and I am really thankful for the privilege to get to bring the word of God to you again.
[time=931] It's an opportunity that we get to focus on him and worshiping him together this morning.
[time=939] We also want to welcome those that are watching on the live stream or the Bible hour, wherever you might be joining us from.
[time=945] We're really thankful that you would be here with us as well.
[time=949] I don't know if you caught it, but we just sang the word worship a whole bunch of times, a whole lot of times.
[time=961] And this morning we're going to talk about what worship is and where its foundation is and the magi and those components.
[time=970] But I want to give you a little bit of an understanding of why there is a need for us to be reminded as we kick off this morning
[time=978] with the passage that Penny just read.
[time=981] You heard several times in there so that it might be fulfilled what the prophet said, right?
[time=990] Said that a whole bunch of times.
[time=994] It is the biblical record that she just read.
[time=997] It is the account of events surrounding Jesus' birth and his early life and we believe that.
[time=1003] It contains those prophecies that were described that were foretold centuries, 400, 500, 600, 700 years before Jesus ever came
[time=1016] to be born in the manger the prophecies were foretold as well as these facts.
[time=1023] So this morning I want to remind us that the first slide that we have is Christmas facts are rooted in the Word of God.
[time=1030] They are rooted in the Word of God. It is the source for an accurate account of the events of Jesus' birth, not hallmark cards, not the night before Christmas.
[time=1041] TV commercials are even old Christmas carols.
[time=1046] As Tiberius noted last week with the away in a manger, even some of our favorite Christmas carols and hymns are not biblically accurate.
[time=1057] We are going to find that out today. Some of your favorite hymns may be we three kings of Orient are and it is none of the above from a biblical perspective.
[time=1072] Our western Christmas has really been filled with just plain inaccuracies.
[time=1078] The little Lord Jesus no crying he makes, Mary writing on a donkey. Maybe you didn't even notice during the reading of Penny doing the passage that there's nothing indicates that there were three kings
[time=1092] or that they weren't even at the manger scene.
[time=1097] We talked about this recently with our boys and we came home and our boys moved the wise men away from the manger scene and put them over by the
[time=1106] men table by the east window. You'll find out why by the time we're done here today.
[time=1112] There are many significant things within the Christmas account which are extremely vital to our faith and if they are not real and the Bible is not real, everything else is up for grabs.
[time=1130] If there is no virgin birth, Jesus is not God.
[time=1136] The truth is that even though the most common biological science says that it takes one man and one woman to make a baby, the Bible says it was a virgin birth.
[time=1150] What are you going to believe? It was a virgin birth. If he's not a virgin birth, he's not God.
[time=1163] When we consider there are more than 300 things that the Old Testament prophets predicted about the coming Messiah, it should build great confidence and hope for us that all of them were filled in one man, Jesus Christ.
[time=1175] It wasn't that he randomly went to Egypt so that the prophecy could be fulfilled that he came out of Egypt. Obviously he couldn't pick that.
[time=1185] So one of the foundations of biblical understanding that I've taken right straight from our Blackhawk statement of faith is the following.
[time=1192] We believe that the Bible is the authoritative word of God, that it was inspired in an era in its original form, that is to be trusted, that it is to be trusted, that it is to be believed literally and obeyed fully.
[time=1212] We believe that. 2 Timothy 3, 16 says all scripture is God breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training and righteousness so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.
[time=1229] God breathed means that it has God as its source, as its origin. It is from him.
[time=1241] 2 Peter 1, 20 and 21 says above all you must understand that no prophecy of scripture came about by the prophets own interpretation. They didn't just make these things up.
[time=1254] For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. You see the picture of a sailboat, that picture is literally a sailing term carried along.
[time=1270] And the sails are full and you get carried exactly to the destination where those sails are full and the rudder is let go, you land exactly where you want it.
[time=1281] They were under God's breathing being carried along by the Holy Spirit. Why does it matter? Because the fulfillment of prophecy serves as a foundation and evidence for Jesus being Messiah.
[time=1296] Being the Son of God and the Savior and Him being the one to whom we and the whole world must look for salvation and meaning in life.
[time=1309] So today we're going to talk about a passage of scripture that we believe is God inspired, God breathed. Let's pray before we step into that.
[time=1326] Father we know that your word is living in power for what sharper than any two-edged sword able to divide joints and moral to judge the thoughts and intentions of our hearts.
[time=1337] We believe God that that's what your word is. We believe it to be true. We believe that this account surrounding the birth of Jesus is real, that all the prophecies that are even mentioned in this short verse of 20 verses.
[time=1355] A short section God are from you. Please Holy Spirit, take the words of this blessed mass of a man and use them to glorify you this morning and inspire worship of us.
[time=1378] For you Jesus, there's no other name. It's in your name we pray. Amen.
[time=1388] In the world we live in today, we are all too familiar with the actions taken by those around us.
[time=1398] Some of those are acts or actions of terror in Paris or the World Trade Center.
[time=1408] Some of those are acts of violence where people destroy and steal and hurt.
[time=1417] There are however, other acts and actions worth noting, acts of valor. These are the three men that took down the guy in the train that was the gunman in the Paris incident.
[time=1435] Acts of kindness. Yeah. Acts of service. Acts of service. Those are our home people in both hands projects. We're going to be doing another one, those coming up, but acts of service.
[time=1452] Acts of service are focused outside of yourself. They're not for you. They're not for you.
[time=1464] Our first note in your outline today, letter A, is worship is an action that we engage in. Worship is an action.
[time=1475] The Magi made it clear that they came to worship, came to Jerusalem to worship. Let's look at verses 1 and 2 of Matthew chapter 2, Matthew chapter 2.
[time=1488] After Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea during the time of King Herod, Magi came from the east to Jerusalem and asked, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews?"
[time=1501] We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him. Right out of the gate, Luke, Matthew affirms Luke's account and makes it clear that Jesus was born in where?
[time=1517] Bethlehem. Yeah. In case it's not obvious, Bethlehem and Jerusalem are two different places. They exist about five, six, seven miles apart from each other.
[time=1531] Matthew makes it clear that the Magi came to Jerusalem. They came to Jerusalem and they came with a very clear purpose at the end of verse 2 to worship him.
[time=1546] That's what they came for. They came to worship him. In this case, it is written clearly and I want to make sure you understand this because I say it this way. Worship is a verb.
[time=1558] Those of you English majors are out here. Understand the difference between a noun and a verb. A verb is a what kind of word.
[time=1567] Thank you. You are awake. It is an action word and it's an action that the Magi took. They took. They left where they were and they came.
[time=1582] So a few questions that you might ask. Who were these guys? How did they know anyone had been born king of the Jews and why did a star? Why did a star show them the way?
[time=1597] It's interesting that in Luke's account, Luke never mentions Magi. He mentions shepherds. And the shepherds got to the manger by angelic announcement. Not about a star.
[time=1616] On the other hand, Matthew only mentions Magi and that they followed a star. So let's talk just a little bit about this word Magi because it is the word Magi. It's not kings.
[time=1633] It's not kings. They were scholarly men like our central in the book of Daniel. And if some of you remember, some of you may not know the biblical account of the book of Daniel. And Daniel's account of going in front of King Nebuchadnezzar because Nebuchadnezzar had had a dream that disturbed him.
[time=1653] And he calls him out and he says, "Hey, all you wise people come." And Daniel, and he says a couple really critical things. The first was that he wanted interpretation, which was not an uncommon thing for these wise men, these wise guys from his area.
[time=1672] What was uncommon was that he told them that he needed to tell them what the dream was. Not only were they supposed to interpret it, but they were supposed to tell that King Nebuchadnezzar what the dream was.
[time=1691] That's not an easy thing. That's not an easy thing. Daniel did that. It was this spot, Daniel chapter 2 verses 46 through 48, verse 48, it says, "Then the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts on him.
[time=1708] He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and charged him and placed him in charge of all its wise men." Daniel, because of his God-given ability, was placed in charge of all the wise men in that area.
[time=1725] Those wise men that come here are from that direction, the east. They were from the Mediopersion Babylonian east of Herod's Roman Empire. Contrary to the Bible, contrary to tradition, the Bible doesn't say that there were three.
[time=1746] Actually, most would tell you that they believe it was probably more like an entourage of a military regiment coming because these three guys were representing a region that was pretty powerful. It was one of the regions, actually, that Herod had not been able to conquer.
[time=1764] So here you've got these guys coming right into town and they come telling us that Daniel, excuse me, they come telling them that they came to worship. Why did they come? They came to worship and they come to town and the Magi were masters of astronomy, of wisdom and a variety of other things.
[time=1792] Wherever where they got this knowledge, whether it's from Daniel or Shadrach or Meshach or Bendigo who Daniel had put in charge, they knew the prophecy that there was supposed to be a birth and it was to be connected with a star.
[time=1811] They were aware, prepared and expecting. As we've already noted, worship is an action that we like the Magi should engage and participate in.
[time=1824] The second point in the outline after worship is an action is letter B, the Magi were prepared and expecting the star. Why would they be expecting the star?
[time=1835] But they really were. They noticed they say in that first couple verses, the one who in its past tense has been born. It is past tense.
[time=1848] They knew it because of the appearance of the star. Bottom line is whether it was because of Daniel's 70 weeks prophecy, 70 times 7 in Daniel chapter 9.
[time=1860] Many believe that that's the case. I would say that the same, that there was 490-ish years from the time of the rebuilding of Jerusalem until the kingdom was fully established.
[time=1874] All the factors above, all of them, led them to a spot where they came together, wise men, how many ever there were, came together to plan to travel.
[time=1888] They prepared the things that they needed to travel because this wasn't a five mile journey.
[time=1896] The section that they're from, 700 miles, 700 miles from there to Jerusalem were talking about 4 B.C.
[time=1909] That didn't happen by bullet train. That didn't happen by car. 700 miles. And also you notice that it doesn't say that they came by camels.
[time=1922] No camels mentioned. You usually see them that way. Actually, many historians would say that during the Medio-Persian Empire, they would have come riding white horses.
[time=1932] They would have come riding on these horses that were symbols of their speed and their strength.
[time=1940] Whatever it was, they came riding into town. They came riding into town in.
[time=1949] They announced they want to know where this guy was, who had been born King of the Jews.
[time=1960] Third point in your outline is they expended great efforts and time.
[time=1968] They expended great efforts and time. It was not something that they just all of a sudden packed up and took off.
[time=1975] This was something that, depending on who you read, think that a minimum of six months, minimum of six months that it took them to get from the time Jesus was born until they arrived.
[time=1989] That's a project. I don't know if we have any project managers in the room, but that's something that matters, that it took them time, effort, and energy to get it done.
[time=2000] To get there and to show what they needed to do.
[time=2006] From an application standpoint, right now we have to ask ourselves, what are we willing to sacrifice time and travel and resources for?
[time=2023] What would it be? Understand that your time planning calendar or your app on your phone or your checkbook, they all, they all indicate who or what you worship.
[time=2043] Your calendar and your checkbook make it really clear who you worship.
[time=2052] It may be clear too. You worship something. You worship something.
[time=2064] We're just saying yours will be the only name that matters to me.
[time=2073] The only one whose favor I seek. We're saying the riches of your love will always be enough.
[time=2085] I confess to you this morning that the guy standing up here speaking to you this morning.
[time=2092] That's not. My flesh. My flesh takes me to things that Jesus isn't the only name.
[time=2102] That I'll spend time wasted on things that don't matter.
[time=2110] Matthew chapter six says, for where your treasure is, there will your what? Heart be also.
[time=2121] Your heart follows your treasure. And we're going to get to that with these magi and when they open their gifts.
[time=2131] We've had the wise men said a great templates for us for understanding what engaged, prepared, expectant, moved to action worship looks like.
[time=2146] It has to involve you. We've already said it. It's a verb.
[time=2150] Jonathan, the people up here, Beth with this beautiful visual things that she does. It's incredible.
[time=2161] The musicians, me even speaking this morning, are only things that point you to the king.
[time=2171] You have to go there yourself. It is your own personal action that you are called to. Worship is not a spectator sport.
[time=2183] And if you are sitting in the pews this morning not engaged in a manner that you take it personally and step into it,
[time=2192] then the object of your worship isn't the name that we proclaim this morning and that's Jesus.
[time=2203] Worship is yours to give and worship like your faith as only as good as the object in which it's placed.
[time=2213] Your worship is yours to give. It's not something that you set in the pew as a pew potato and absorb it in and take it.
[time=2225] Yes, that's Rick's term. I've used it for a long time. It's a similar to a couch potato, but it's a pew potato because all you want is to come sit in the pew and say it's about me.
[time=2238] And that is not what church is, folks. We are here unashamedly to declare the name of Jesus Christ that is the name above all names,
[time=2249] that every knee will bow and confess, that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=2257] Thank you, Father. Let's look at verses 3 through 6 and get a feel for the impact of the magi type of worship.
[time=2267] Magi worship mess people up. Let me just be really clear about that. Verse 3, "When King Herod heard this, he was disturbed and all Jerusalem with him.
[time=2277] When he had called together all the chief priests, the peoples and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Christ was to be born.
[time=2284] In Bethlehem of Judea, they replied, "For this is what the prophet has written.
[time=2289] But you, Bethlehem and the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah, for out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people Israel."
[time=2300] The fourth point in your outline, letter D, is their actions disturbed the establishment.
[time=2309] Their actions disturbed the establishment, but Herod the king and the religious leaders of the day, they were disturbed.
[time=2318] It's upset, it's talking about being stirred to the core. They did not like what they were hearing.
[time=2326] Wording indicates that these magi were continually going around town and asking, so they went multiple places, it's most likely.
[time=2338] They went around town. Where is he who, again, past tense, has been born? Where is he?
[time=2345] And look at what, then you get to verse 3, and it gets to Herod's ears.
[time=2350] Herod says, "When he heard all this, he was disturbed."
[time=2357] The king being disturbed, I can get that, that makes sense.
[time=2361] You got guys riding into town from another territory and proclaiming that there's a new king in town.
[time=2372] Herod had been clear, self-proclaimed king of the Jews, don't get that wrong.
[time=2378] So now you have people riding into town with their scenario and saying, "Hey, there's a new king of the Jews."
[time=2388] I get Herod being screwed up. Also know this, Herod was already well established as a paranoid guy
[time=2398] for those who would usurp his authority. He was paranoid about it.
[time=2409] What about the rest of Jerusalem? Because it says that. And all Jerusalem with him was disturbed.
[time=2414] The Jewish religious leaders had no question in their mind of where Jesus was to be born.
[time=2423] They didn't have to say, "Hey, Herod, give us a few minutes, give us a couple of days.
[time=2428] We need to go check our books and find out where these prophecies are at." No, they knew it.
[time=2433] It was well established. Everybody knew that the Messiah was to be born in Bethlehem
[time=2439] and again it was another fulfillment of prophecy.
[time=2444] But they were certainly disturbed that somebody from another region would show up in town
[time=2452] and say, "The king's been born." And they didn't know it.
[time=2459] The religious leaders of the day knew the prophecy and didn't know that five miles away
[time=2467] the Messiah that they were looking for by their own agenda, by the way, had been born.
[time=2474] And now you got these guys from hundreds of miles away saying, "Yes."
[time=2480] By the way, they were pagan Gentiles. They weren't Jewish people that he chose to reveal through the star.
[time=2492] And again, it was past tense. I want you to notice the two words in that verse of the prophecy to describe Jesus.
[time=2501] Both ruler, both ruler and shepherd. The ruler part, they were expecting.
[time=2509] They wanted a ruler to come and kick some Roman tail.
[time=2517] But what they didn't expect was a Messiah that would shepherd His people Israel and take care of them.
[time=2527] That's what they weren't anticipating.
[time=2531] I personally wonder, this is just my own pondering, why in the world that the chief priests
[time=2539] and the religious leaders of the day, when they heard this, they didn't go.
[time=2547] They didn't follow the Magi five, six, seven miles. They weren't even curious.
[time=2556] MacArthur says it was because they didn't even have the faith to believe.
[time=2560] Others say that they lacked sincere interest to even accompany the Magi
[time=2566] to even investigate that there's a chance that the Messiah has been born. They were so stuck.
[time=2579] They ask you this, are you so entrenched in your Sunday activities
[time=2591] of religious religiosity that you missed Jesus?
[time=2599] You know, because you're not expectant, you haven't planned, you get up on Sunday morning
[time=2605] and you know it's eight thirty and you've got thirty minutes to get there, or maybe it's ten o'clock and you've got thirty minutes to get there. And the last thing on your mind, other than being on time and keeping the kids quiet, and maybe
[time=2619] did you turn on the oven to make sure that the roast will be done?
[time=2627] Are we coming in this room expected and looking for Jesus, not in the way that you want it to see him,
[time=2637] but in the way that he comes?
[time=2643] Then Herod called the Magi, verse seven. He called him secretly
[time=2649] and found out from them the exact time that the star had appeared. He sent them to Bethlehem and said,
[time=2655] "Go and make a careful search for this child as soon as you find him, report to me so that I may too go worship him." Let her eat in your outline. "Is Herod portrayed himself as a worshipper?"
[time=2675] Herod attempted to advance his own fleshly, worldly agenda
[time=2681] under the guise of worship.
[time=2685] I love what Matthew Henry says about Herod's plot.
[time=2689] Sometimes the greatest wickedness often conceals itself under a mask of piety.
[time=2701] Under the guise of spiritual, we pursue personal agendas and call it worship.
[time=2709] That's what Herod did.
[time=2713] Let's be reminded of this. "An encounter of the truth of the holy one will result in exposing false worshipers." John chapter four says, "God is spirit and those his worshipers must worship him in spirit and in truth." Truth is pure.
[time=2741] It's pretty clear that what is detailed back down in verse 16, Herod's agenda had nothing to do with worship. It had everything to do with him being king of the Jews and somebody else coming to take his throne. He was going to kill.
[time=2761] Again I ask you, do you have your own personal worship agenda?
[time=2769] Worship is about God. He is the object of our worship.
[time=2777] It's not about us.
[time=2781] Let's look at verse 9, 10 and 11.
[time=2789] After they heard the king tell them to go and they went on their way and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was. When they saw the star they were overjoyed. On coming to the house they saw the child with his mother Mary, they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and incense and of myrrh.
[time=2817] Letter F in your outline is upon seeing Jesus they fell down worshiped and gave gifts.
[time=2829] Literally it's written having fallen down having fallen down they worshipped and that word is literally meanings. Put your forehead on the ground.
[time=2849] That's a posture.
[time=2853] That's acknowledging who that king was.
[time=2857] One of the commentators made the comment that it's not noted that they did the same for Herod.
[time=2865] Don't know whether they did or not but we probably had a few issues if they didn't.
[time=2869] We don't know but somebody just commented that.
[time=2873] Here it says that they fell down.
[time=2877] Took a posture of worship, humility, and then opened their treasured things and took from them and gave them to Jesus.
[time=2889] As I was studying this week this lyric that we used to sing I don't think we sang it in a while came to me.
[time=2901] I lift you high and bow down low.
[time=2905] How high can you be?
[time=2909] How low can I go?
[time=2913] You must increase. I must decrease.
[time=2917] Lord I'll bow down and you will be adored. That's worship.
[time=2925] That's worship putting us in the right proper place before the king.
[time=2933] I want to make sure you catch this.
[time=2941] They opened their treasured things.
[time=2945] They opened their treasured things and took out some of it and gave it to Jesus.
[time=2953] Don't miss that. We'll come back to it in a minute.
[time=2961] Having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod verse 12 they returned to the country by another route.
[time=2965] When they had gone an angel the Lord appeared to Joseph get up and take his mother and his child and his mother and escaped to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.
[time=2981] He was a child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled again of prophecy what the Lord had said to the prophet out of Egypt I called my son.
[time=2997] I want to remind you that the power and sovereignty of God will always accomplish what even the best plots of evil men would advise to keep it from happening.
[time=3013] Tiberius said it the other day when God has a divine appointment with his people he's always on time.
[time=3021] There is nothing that was going to keep King Jesus from being who he needed to be. Not the best plot of Herod.
[time=3037] As with Joseph and Genesis it gets to this what others meant for evil God meant for good.
[time=3045] Just a reminder the birth of Jesus was revealed to shepherds
[time=3055] who weren't the high flute and CEOs of their day by the way.
[time=3061] They weren't on mahogany row. They were out dealing with this stinky sheep. One of my favorite books little book called Shepherds they smell like sheep.
[time=3077] You know why they smell like sheep? Because they get close enough they get close enough to know them.
[time=3085] Jesus was revealed to shepherds and Gentile wise men from another part of the world the ones who were the religious ones of that they missed the Messiah even after the magi had proclaimed it. They didn't even bother to go.
[time=3101] One they said where is he who has been born.
[time=3109] Foot back just one page maybe two in your Bible to Matthew chapter 1 verse 21.
[time=3117] Matthew chapter 1 verse 21 says the name Jesus and I just flip there we go.
[time=3125] She will give birth to a son and you are to give him the name Jesus that we sang this morning and look at the because. Because he will save his people from what?
[time=3141] They're what? Not the Romans.
[time=3145] It wasn't to save them from their culture.
[time=3149] It wasn't to save them from the Romans.
[time=3153] It wasn't to save them from a whacked out king Herod.
[time=3157] It was to save his people from their sin.
[time=3165] Before he was ever alive in a manger before he was ever alive in a manger his life was headed for the cross and for the resurrection.
[time=3177] Before he ever took his first breath as a human.
[time=3181] I stood here on Easter Sunday and talked about the empty manger the empty cross and the empty tomb.
[time=3193] They are all three empty.
[time=3197] Because of the power of the Holy Spirit and it matters. He didn't stay at either one of those.
[time=3205] I like what Lee Strobel says in his case for Christmas. As I was getting ready to complete my investigation of a child in the manger I kept returning to the fact that Christmas doesn't mean very much without Easter.
[time=3221] That's because Christians believe that Jesus wasn't born into the world merely to identify with us. To console us or even lead us. His assignment from the outset they claim was to die for us.
[time=3241] To actually lay down his life as a spiritual payment for the wrong doing that you and I have done.
[time=3253] So that we could be released from the penalty we owe it's his life for our life. With the result being and I love what he says. As the old Christmas Carol heart the Harold Angel sing said God and sinners.
[time=3273] What? God and sinners reconciled.
[time=3277] That's what he did. He came for that.
[time=3281] The account of the magized journey challenges us to consider the following.
[time=3289] Worship is to be actively engaged in.
[time=3293] It's not a spectator event they are called acts of worship and they're just as valid as acts of valor or terror or service or kindness.
[time=3309] Your worship occurs in your giving of your time your treasure your talents. Of your being in the word it's an act active it's a verb.
[time=3321] Please ask yourself what am I willing to travel along ways for?
[time=3333] What am I willing to travel along ways spend time and money to do?
[time=3341] Don't forget Jesus had and still has real enemies.
[time=3353] Don't want you to be ignorant my brothers we endure trials of various kinds we live in a world that does not like Jesus you understand that right? They don't agree that it's the one name that we proclaim is Jesus where you bow the knees of your heart to and then finally this one because I think this one gets hard. See we all have our treasure chest like the magi did and it calls it that they opened up their treasures they did another action and they took out something and put it at the foot of the cross.
[time=3409] Ask yourself today what things am I treasuring and may even be hesitant to open up and give to Jesus it takes action it takes us considering stuff that costs it's real I can tell you I had a blast this week studying about these magi guys they're not on camels there's nothing that tells us there's three of them they didn't show up at the manger by the way they showed up at a house verse 11 tells us our culture has not done a good job of recognizing that this doesn't end with the day after Christmas sales. This is about things that cost us. What are you treasuring because where your treasure is there will your heart be also pray with me.
[time=3481] Heavenly Father we thank you for the privilege the absolute privilege of your word what it means that it gives us light to live by that it is sharp God that it sharp and it pierces us and convicts us thank you for that God. Please today as we consider Jesus please let his name be the only name on our lips when it comes to worship and our response be one of bended me and bended heart thank you for our time together today bless us as we go on our way it is in your powerful name Jesus that we claim. Amen.
