[time=60] Today's Bible Hour is being sponsored by the family of Jan Van Till, who went home to be with the Lord on January 21st, 2014.
[time=81] Amazing grace, a sweet God of sound that saved a wretch like me.
[time=101] I once was lost, but now I've found what's blind, but now I see.
[time=112] Though I can see you now, though I can see the love in your eyes,
[time=125] Laying yourself down, raising up the broken to heart.
[time=140] [MUSIC]
[time=150] Take our failures, you take our weakness, you set your treasure in jars of fame.
[time=162] So take this hard more, I'll be your vessel, go well to see, go back with me.
[time=176] Amazing grace, a sweet God of sound that saved a wretch like me.
[time=188] I once was lost, but now I've found what's blind, but now I see.
[time=199] Though I can see you now, though I can see the love in your eyes,
[time=211] Laying yourself down, raising up the broken to heart.
[time=226] [MUSIC]
[time=250] Amazing grace, a sweet God of sound that saved a wretch like me.
[time=262] And once was lost, but now I've found what's blind, but now I see.
[time=274] Amazing grace, a sweet God of sound that saved a wretch like me.
[time=286] I once was lost, but now I've found what's blind, but now I see.
[time=297] I can see you now, I can see the love in your eyes, Laying yourself down,
[time=316] raising up the broken to heart.
[time=322] I can see you now, I can see the love in your eyes, Laying yourself down,
[time=341] raising up the broken to heart.

[time=381] The teenage boy in prison, before he's even grown, the illness I've allowed on,
[time=401] a widow no one calls, there is one solution, one answer for it all.
[time=416] There is power in the name of Jesus, there is hope, there is strength,
[time=430] and victory to play.
[time=434] There is healing in his holy presence, there is power in his name.
[time=452] The nation needing mercy, fighting for your life.
[time=460] The church that needs revival, a broken man and wife.
[time=469] In the name of Jesus, chains of bondage fall, praise our her in answer,
[time=483] when God's children fall.
[time=490] There is power in the name of Jesus, there is hope, there is strength,
[time=503] and victory to play.
[time=507] There is healing in his holy presence, there is power in his name.
[time=522] In his name, in the name of Jesus, there is hope,
[time=536] there is strength, and victory to play.
[time=549] In his holy presence, there is power in his name.
[time=563] There is power in the name of Jesus, there is love.
[time=591] On the first day of the third month, after the Israelites left Egypt,
[time=602] on that very day, they came to the desert of Sinai.
[time=607] After they set out from Raffidam, they entered the desert of Sinai in Israel,
[time=613] camped there in the desert in front of the mountain.
[time=616] Then Moses went up to God, and the Lord called to him from the mountain and said, "This is what you are to say to the descendants of Jacob and what you are to tell the people of Israel.
[time=627] You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt and how I carried you on eagles wings and brought you to myself.
[time=635] Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession.
[time=642] Although the whole earth is mine, you will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.
[time=649] These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites.
[time=653] In God spoke all of these words, "I am the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt and out of the land of slavery.
[time=662] You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below."
[time=671] You shall not bow down to them or worship them for I, the Lord your God and the jealous God.
[time=678] Punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and the fourth generations of those who hate me,
[time=685] but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.
[time=692] You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.
[time=699] Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.
[time=702] Six days you shall labor and do all of your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God.
[time=710] On it you shall not do any work, neither you nor your son or daughter nor your male or female servant nor your animals nor any foreigner residing in your towns.
[time=723] For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day.
[time=733] Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.
[time=738] Good morning.
[time=741] Please open your Bibles to Exodus chapter 19, or if you have your cell phones or devices you may turn there.
[time=749] You can download it for free the USB Bible.
[time=753] We are using the USB.
[time=757] Before I start this morning I want to point something out in the bulletin that this summer I'm taking a group of students and friends to Israel.
[time=772] This picture is actually taken from the top of Mount Sinai.
[time=777] I didn't take this one, but I know because I was there.
[time=781] January 1st, 2005 I was able to celebrate new years on top of Mount Sinai.
[time=788] I was able, you want to do that?
[time=791] Can't do it anymore.
[time=793] It's too dangerous, but we can go to Israel.
[time=797] Still see the Sea of Galilee, go to Jerusalem, go to Masala, go to Qumran where they discovered the census scrolls, and I'm glad to report it.
[time=810] There's at least four of you that already expressed interest.
[time=813] So if you want to come on a life-changing trip to Israel this summer, you have in the bulletin my email address, please email me.
[time=822] We still have a few spots left, not too many.
[time=826] But we would love to have you.
[time=829] This morning we want to talk about probably a part of Scripture that most people know, even if they are not believers.
[time=843] A lot of people look at the Ten Commandments, and they look at the Ten Commandments as a list of things that they need to do or a list of things to gain approval from God if they do those things.
[time=859] And a lot of people look at the Ten Commandments as something they cringe when they hear.
[time=866] But I would like for us to think about the Ten Commandments and everything really that God has for us.
[time=874] I would like for us to think about it as God's love letter to us.
[time=879] And I want us to see that, and we will see this as we go through this, that this was not written by God to reign on our parade.
[time=889] That's how some people think about it, oh God doesn't want me to have fun, so he gave me all these rules and regulations.
[time=897] Rather, I would like for us to think about it as a love letter where God wants to show who He is.
[time=906] We cannot understand the Ten Commandments apart from who God is and who we are.
[time=912] It's always based on a relationship, a love letter from a loving God.
[time=923] Contrast that with what Ted Turner said, Ted Turner, the founder of CNN.
[time=931] He called the Ten Commandments out data rules, he said nobody likes to be commanded.
[time=938] He actually came up with his own.
[time=942] He has a list of rules, and the last one is this.
[time=949] In the last commandment he calls him something else, he asks people to pledge loyalty to the United Nations.
[time=960] And I quote, Christianity is a religion for losers.
[time=969] That's one way to look at it.
[time=972] If you don't understand the Bible, it's perfectly fine to think about it like that.
[time=977] But for us who have the word of God, God's love letter to us, we know different, don't we?
[time=986] Look, please, in chapter 19, not only does God give us a love letter in the commandments, but he gives us a new identity.
[time=996] You see, the Bible was clear until now that Israel was God's people, God calls them my people, my people, my people.
[time=1003] But now God gives them a new identity.
[time=1007] Think about this, three months have passed since they left Egypt, three months through the wilderness, through the sea, through more wilderness.
[time=1016] And they come to Sinai, to Mount Sinai.
[time=1021] So the Bible says in chapter 19, verse 1, on the third day, on the third new moon after the people of Israel had gone out from the land of Egypt, on that day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.
[time=1033] They set out from refugee and came into the wilderness of Sinai, and they encamped in the wilderness.
[time=1038] There is really encamped before the mountain, while Moses went up to God.
[time=1043] The Lord God called the Lord, called to him out of the mountain, saying, "Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the people of Israel, you yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagle's wings, and brought you to myself."
[time=1059] Now therefore, this is verses 5 and 6 are crucial here.
[time=1064] If you will indeed obey my voice and keep my commandment and my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession.
[time=1074] And I have it in bold there.
[time=1076] So I don't know if you like to underline in your Bibles, if you do, this is the time to do it.
[time=1081] God gives His people a new identity, my treasured possession among all people.
[time=1088] For all the earth is mine, and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.
[time=1096] I don't see anything there that says a nation of losers.
[time=1100] Do you?
[time=1101] There's nothing like that.
[time=1103] When God looks at us and we are His, we are His treasured possession.
[time=1110] Not only that, the kingdom of priests, the priests were supposed to mediate between God and humanity.
[time=1116] And that's what Israel was supposed to do, is to mediate between God and the other nations.
[time=1122] Israel was supposed to take God's name to the other nations, and to be a lie to the other nations, and to be a holy nation, to be different, to be different than the other nations.
[time=1133] You see, the other nations were worshiping many gods, and were doing many abominations, and God says, "No, you are to be holy.
[time=1140] You are to be different than the other nations."
[time=1146] But notice, please, here in this text, the if clauses.
[time=1151] We are getting into a new covenant called the Mosaic Covenant or the Sinaitic Covenant.
[time=1158] We have the Abrahamic Covenant originating in Genesis chapter 12.
[time=1162] We know there was an unconditional covenant, God promising to His people a great name, a great nation, and a great land.
[time=1170] But now there's another covenant, the Mosaic Covenant, and this is not unconditional.
[time=1175] This is very, very conditional.
[time=1177] Look at the if clauses, please.
[time=1180] If, if, if, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession,
[time=1191] and you will see as we go through these 10 commandments and through the other commandments, and through the other laws and regulations, the if language pervades all throughout the Mosaic and the Sinaitic Covenant,
[time=1201] it is if you obey my commandments.
[time=1206] It is very, very conditional.
[time=1209] But Israel is identity.
[time=1211] He was not just as God's people.
[time=1213] Now he was supposed to be God's treasured position.
[time=1218] When we look at the 10 commandments, I want us to understand a few things before we move on.
[time=1222] First of all, the first four commandments have to do with our relationship to God, and the last six have to do our relationship with each other.
[time=1231] Today we will talk about the first four, and the next Sunday I'm going to attempt to talk about the next six.
[time=1239] But the first four have to do with our relationship to God, and the next six about our relationship with each other.
[time=1248] Two words that we need to remember when we talk about the 10 commandments is that the 10 commandments are both revelatory and the regulatory.
[time=1257] This is very important because some people say the 10 commandments are only revelatory.
[time=1262] They tell us who God is, but they're not for us today.
[time=1265] You don't worry about it. They're not regulatory anymore.
[time=1270] But I want to show through Scripture both the Old and the New Testaments that the 10 commandments are supposed to be both revelatory.
[time=1281] They're going to tell us who God is, and they're going to tell us how to live our lives every day.
[time=1288] They're both revelatory and the regulatory. They're not either/or.
[time=1293] They are both, and they teach us about who God is, they're revelatory.
[time=1298] He's the holy God, he's the righteous God, and if we don't obey his commandments, he's just God who will punish sin.
[time=1309] This is still a love letter that's supposed to tell us who God is.
[time=1316] My wife and I will celebrate 19 years of marriage this coming May.
[time=1322] And when we courted, I was here and she was in Romania.
[time=1330] This was before Facebook, Skype, FaceTime, text messages, and all of those things.
[time=1342] So the way we built our relationship was phone calls and letters.
[time=1349] And she still keeps the letters. I still have them. They're in a sacred place. I couldn't get them this morning.
[time=1357] But I still have them. And you know what? Those are love letters that were supposed to make us know who we are.
[time=1367] And I was writing, she was supposed to learn who I am.
[time=1372] And I was supposed to learn who she is. Those letters can only be understood in the context of our relationship.
[time=1381] Do you know that there are people today who say this?
[time=1384] If only America could come back to the Ten Commandments, everything will be fine and dandy.
[time=1390] Really? No! The Ten Commandments are only for the people of God.
[time=1397] They are in the context of a relationship. You cannot make, ungenerate, unsaved people obey the Ten Commandments.
[time=1405] And they think everything will be fine. No! There are people like that.
[time=1412] In order to keep the Ten Commandments, first you have to be part of the family of God and then you're going to obey these regulations and these commandments.
[time=1421] There are always on the basis of a relationship, but they are revelatory and they are regulatory.
[time=1428] They teach us how to live our lives every day.
[time=1432] And lastly, I want us to understand that the Ten Commandments are not a stairway to heaven.
[time=1439] You can keep all the Ten Commandments that will not earn you salvation.
[time=1448] You can, well, let me put it this way.
[time=1452] You can try to keep all the commandments and still you won't get to heaven.
[time=1459] Do you know people like that? There are still people like that who think, "If I just do this, this, this, and this, I'm going to earn enough favor with God that I will be saved."
[time=1472] Paul says in Galatians 2.20, "I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness were through the law, then Christ died in vain."
[time=1485] No, Christ didn't, we cannot be saved by keeping the commandments.
[time=1492] The Ten Commandments are not a stairway to heaven.
[time=1496] No one was saved by keeping the Ten Commandments.
[time=1502] For by faith you have been saved through grace. For by grace you have been saved through faith.
[time=1510] Also, we need to understand the author of the Ten Commandments.
[time=1515] God spoke all these words saying, "I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt out of the house of slavery."
[time=1524] Again, please, please notice.
[time=1527] This is not a group of people getting together and say, "Okay, let's vote on these commandments and see how what we can do to lead our people."
[time=1536] No, these are God-given commandments.
[time=1540] And by the way, after these Ten Commandments, if we read through Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Autonomy, we see that there are other laws and regulations.
[time=1550] They add up to about 613 of them.
[time=1556] But all of these need to be understanding context of a relationship.
[time=1561] Notice, please, it says, "I am the Lord." What does it say?
[time=1565] You're God.
[time=1567] It has to be in context of the relationship between God and his people.
[time=1573] These are not for the pagans who don't believe in God.
[time=1576] These are not for atheists like Ted Turner.
[time=1581] Unless he wants to surrender his life to Christ, then they are for him and for anybody else who wants to obey them.
[time=1590] We need to understand these commandments in context of relationship.
[time=1596] For Israel, it was further than that, for Israel, not for us today, but for Israel, all these little laws and regulations were supposed to serve as Israel's Constitution.
[time=1607] Because God made him a nation and he gave him a set of laws, a Constitution.
[time=1613] Obviously, we are not Israel from that perspective, so this is not to serve as our Constitution, but it does need to serve as us understanding who God is and what we need to do.
[time=1626] So let's look at the first four commandments.
[time=1629] First of all, you shall have no other gods before me.
[time=1636] In each commandment, I'm going to put two things up on the screen. One is the letter of the law and the second is the spirit of the law.
[time=1645] In the New Testament, Paul says the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.
[time=1650] And this is important because some people say, okay, in fact, can just keep the letter of the law. Everything will be fine.
[time=1656] Is that true?
[time=1658] No, Jesus actually says to the Pharisees and the Sadducees who were trying to keep the letter of the law.
[time=1663] Yeah, you try to keep all the letter of the law, but your heart is far away from me.
[time=1668] It's more than just keeping the letter of the law.
[time=1672] We need to go a step further to understanding why was the law given?
[time=1677] You shall have no other gods before me.
[time=1681] The spirit of the law is to worship God alone.
[time=1685] A better translation would be, you shall have no other gods besides me because this translation could imply that
[time=1692] it's okay to have God as the main God, the first God, and then you can have others after him, right?
[time=1700] That's not what it says.
[time=1702] God already established that he's the only one true God and they shouldn't worship anybody else but the true God.
[time=1709] That's what this says.
[time=1711] You shall have no other gods before me or besides me, worship God alone.
[time=1718] It is revelatory in that it teaches us that there's no other God than Yahweh, the true God who brought them out of Egypt.
[time=1726] That's revelatory, right?
[time=1728] But it's also regulatory because it teaches them how to live their lives every day.
[time=1733] And we need to show in every day in life, in our everyday life, that God is our only God.
[time=1740] Now, if you think about Israel's history, what do you know about their history?
[time=1747] What did they do over and over again with this commandment?
[time=1752] They broke it, didn't they?
[time=1754] Over and over again, they went after other gods and they worshipped other idols.
[time=1762] And as they did that, we need to ask ourselves today, we who say that we worship God alone.
[time=1768] Do we worship other gods?
[time=1770] Do we have other idols, an idol by definition?
[time=1775] Is a man-made image or representation worshipped as deity?
[time=1780] Or anything or anyone receiving worship other than the one through God?
[time=1793] My dear brothers and sisters, do we have idols in our lives today?
[time=1799] Do we worship other things or people other than God?
[time=1808] I like what Tim Keller asks, all of us.
[time=1814] He asks, is anything more important to you than God?
[time=1823] Anything that absorbs your heart and imagination more than God?
[time=1829] Anything you seek to give you what only God can give?
[time=1834] A counterfeit God is anything so central and essential to your life that should you lose it,
[time=1842] your life would feel hardly worth living.
[time=1846] An idol has such a controlling position in your heart that you can spend most of your passion and energy,
[time=1853] your emotional and financial resources on it without a second thought.
[time=1859] It can be family and children, or career or making money, or achievement and critical acclaim.
[time=1868] It can be a romantic relationship, your beauty, your brains, or even success in the Christian ministry.
[time=1877] When you're meaning in life is to fix someone else's life, we call it codependency, but in reality it's idolatry.
[time=1888] Wow, do we worship other gods?
[time=1895] Is anything more important to us than God?
[time=1898] And what we do with our time shows that, what we do with our money shows that.
[time=1905] That's what what brings our what elevates our blood pressure shows that.
[time=1916] Football is on tonight.
[time=1918] Two matches, two games.
[time=1921] And I hear there are people in this world that they watch football with their kids.
[time=1928] And if their favorite team loses the game, the kids cry.
[time=1936] If that is you, I want to, as a friendly suggestion, in my humble but correct opinion,
[time=1955] ask you that as you sit down and watch the game today with your kids.
[time=1959] I want you to before the game starts tell them what's going to about to happen on TV.
[time=1965] It's not as important that it's just happened this morning in church.
[time=1973] Just a suggestion, just a recommendation.
[time=1977] As you sit down to read scripture with them and pray with them, I want you to tell them when we pray, when we pray together and when we read the scripture together, that's more important.
[time=1986] That's what's about to happen here on TV.
[time=1991] If you don't teach them that, who's going to teach them that?
[time=1999] Not only are we to worship the true God, but the second commandment tells us that we need to worship God the right way.
[time=2009] The first commandment is about true worship.
[time=2014] It prohibits false worship, false gods, the second commandment prohibits false worship.
[time=2023] You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above,
[time=2030] or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
[time=2035] You shall not bow down to them, verse 5, or serve them for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God.
[time=2042] Remember I told you this is revelatory?
[time=2045] It tells us who God is. God is a jealous God.
[time=2049] Oh, I thought God is only love.
[time=2051] No, read the entire Bible.
[time=2055] God is loving and merciful, but he's also holy, righteous and just, and he must punish sin.
[time=2061] And no, he doesn't share his worship with anybody else.
[time=2066] I am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation
[time=2074] of those who hate me, but showing steadfast love, chesed, to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.
[time=2085] Where would the children of Israel get an idea about carved images?
[time=2090] Well, I told you about some of these couple of weeks ago.
[time=2094] Here's just three more examples of deities that the Egyptians were worshiping,
[time=2101] and remember that God brought them out of the land of Egypt.
[time=2106] The Israelites saw the Egyptians worshiping these gods and goddesses.
[time=2112] The one on the left is Anubis.
[time=2115] Notice, please, the body of a man and then the head of a jackal or some type of mythical animal.
[time=2125] I'm pretty sure there's a football team named after him.
[time=2130] I kid, no, but hey, maybe you can make one.
[time=2135] The second one.
[time=2137] Hey, what is that?
[time=2139] Does that look like a bull to you?
[time=2141] Where did they get the idea to worship a golden calf?
[time=2145] Oh, back in Egypt, didn't they?
[time=2147] We'll talk about the golden calf in a couple of weeks.
[time=2150] But that is the Egyptian god Ta, P.T., sorry, Apis.
[time=2158] Here's the representation of Ta, but Apis was the god in form of a bull.
[time=2164] And on the right, body of a woman, the head of a cat or a lioness.
[time=2173] That's the original cat woman.
[time=2177] Her name was Bastet.
[time=2182] And God comes and says to his people, "You shall not do that."
[time=2190] As I look at our church, I don't see Jesus on the cross.
[time=2197] And that's a good thing, because Jesus is not on the cross anymore.
[time=2202] And the Bible says you shall not make a carved image of your god.
[time=2207] But you know what?
[time=2210] Even if you construct in your head an image of who God is, and he's not that, that's still idolatry.
[time=2219] Let me rephrase that.
[time=2222] Or let me repeat that.
[time=2224] If you construct in your head an image of God, that's not the true God, that's still idolatry.
[time=2233] If you go to Christian stores and you see portraits of Jesus, how does he look like?
[time=2241] Usually, blond and blue-eyed.
[time=2244] I have some news for you.
[time=2246] Jesus wasn't blond and blue-eyed.
[time=2248] Jesus was a semite.
[time=2250] He was darker-skinned.
[time=2251] He was in black.
[time=2252] He was in white.
[time=2253] He was a semite.
[time=2254] But even so, I have no right to go and try to imagine how Jesus was like when I am told
[time=2261] that you shall have no carved image of your god.
[time=2266] God is spirit, infinite and perfect.
[time=2268] And God had wanted it like that.
[time=2271] He wanted us to represent him on the earth.
[time=2274] He created us in his image.
[time=2277] We were supposed to be his representatives on the earth, not any carved image, statues
[time=2283] or anything like that.
[time=2288] Not only that, not only are we to worship God alone and are we to worship him the right
[time=2294] way, but we are not to take God's name in vain.
[time=2298] In other words, use God's name in ways that honor him.
[time=2303] Verse 7, "You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will
[time=2309] not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain."
[time=2316] In the Old Testament, there were three ways in which the people took God's name in vain.
[time=2320] Three ways, sorcery, false prophecy and in taking of false oaths.
[time=2330] For example, false teachers would come and say, "Thus says the Lord when God didn't
[time=2336] say anything." But they use God's name, right?
[time=2341] That is taking God's name in vain.
[time=2344] When you say that God says something and he didn't, that's a lie.
[time=2347] You're taking God's name in vain.
[time=2350] They did that.
[time=2353] They did that in sorcery and they did that in taking false oaths.
[time=2358] They would use God's name until you take an oath and say, "Oh, as the Lord lives, I'm going to do this and this and this." And then they would go ahead and not do that.
[time=2368] That is taking God's name in vain.
[time=2369] That was in the Old Testament.
[time=2371] But I want to ask us, my dear brothers and sisters, do we take God's name in vain?
[time=2381] How about these four ways, four modern ways of breaking the third commandment?
[time=2388] False teachers still use this one, "Thus says the Lord."
[time=2395] And they proceed to teach something unbiblical but they say the Lord said it.
[time=2399] That's still used today.
[time=2401] We need the Holy Spirit to discern truth from falsehood.
[time=2406] We need the Holy Spirit to know when indeed that's exactly what God says, but it's what
[time=2412] this person says.
[time=2416] But you see as a Bible teacher, as a Bible professor, as a pastor, my job is not just
[time=2422] to know the difference between right and wrong, but right and almost right.
[time=2429] Because a lot of things sound very almost right, but they're not right.
[time=2435] Another one that we use is you want to do something and you do it and then you say to
[time=2442] the people, "Oh yeah, it is God's will that I do this." Well, really it's your desire to do it.
[time=2449] And you just want to bring God into it because you want to sound more spiritual.
[time=2454] Don't do that.
[time=2457] If you want to go and eat at Olive Garden today for lunch, go ahead and do it.
[time=2465] But don't make it spiritual, say, "Oh, it is God's will for me to eat at Olive Garden today." You are diminishing the name of God.
[time=2474] You are taking God's name in vain.
[time=2476] Just say, "I want to eat at Olive Garden today." There's nothing wrong with that.
[time=2480] I mean, no, there might be something wrong with that, but I don't have time to elaborate on that.
[time=2487] Now if you go to Chipotle, that's another thing, meaning that's even worse.
[time=2499] Here's my favorite one that I hear a lot people.
[time=2502] God gave me a cross to carry.
[time=2504] Here's the scenario.
[time=2508] A young man grew up in the church, godly parents, decides to marry an unbeliever, even though
[time=2520] his parents told him not to do that.
[time=2523] He goes ahead, so based on parents, marries an unbeliever and then lives hell on earth.
[time=2530] And then comes and says, "Oh, everybody has got a cross to carry.
[time=2534] God gave me a cross to carry." That is taking God's name in vain.
[time=2540] That is not a God-given cross, it's a cross you took up.
[time=2547] Don't bring God into your disobedience.
[time=2551] That is taking God's name in vain.
[time=2554] You may say, "I am living out the consequences of my sin and my disobedience, but don't make
[time=2561] it, don't put it on God." God does give us a cross to carry.
[time=2569] Actually he says, "Jesus, if anybody wants to follow me, needs to take up his cross daily
[time=2575] and follow me, but that's a God-given cross.
[time=2578] It's not a man-made cross."
[time=2584] And in the New Testament we have an example of people using in the name of Jesus, Acts
[time=2592] chapter 19, starting in verse 13, "Then some of the itinerary Jewish exorcists undertook
[time=2600] to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits saying, "I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul proclaims.
[time=2608] Seven sons of Jewish, of a Jewish high priest named Cevah were doing this, but the evil spirit answered them, 'Jesus, I know, and Paul, I recognize, but who are you?'"
[time=2620] And the man in whom was the evil spirit, leaped on them, mastered all of them and overpowered them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
[time=2630] The bottom line is this, "Use God's name in ways that honor him."
[time=2636] And lastly, the fourth commandment, "Take a day to rest and worship."
[time=2642] You're the Sabbath day to keep it holy, six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath to the Lord, your God.
[time=2652] And where did God get this idea of six days?
[time=2655] It goes back to the idea of creation, looking in verse 11, "For in six days the Lord made
[time=2662] heaven and earth," notice it doesn't say for it's 6,000 years.
[time=2666] It doesn't say it's 6 million years.
[time=2669] It says, "In six days the Lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that is in them and rested on the seventh day, therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy."
[time=2680] Where did God get an idea of six days?
[time=2684] From creation, he's using the creation week for a representation for what we are to use
[time=2690] as a work week.
[time=2692] Did you know that over the centuries people have tried to change that?
[time=2700] Early in the 20th century the Russians tried a five-day week, say, "We don't know what
[time=2706] God has for us.
[time=2708] We are atheists.
[time=2709] We want to make our own week five days." Did it work?
[time=2716] No.
[time=2717] In the French Revolution the French said, "We don't want six days.
[time=2721] We're atheists.
[time=2722] We want 10 day week." Would you like that?
[time=2726] I don't think you'd like that.
[time=2728] Maybe you're boss would like that, but you shouldn't like it.
[time=2731] Did it work?
[time=2733] It didn't work.
[time=2734] See, people try to rearrange the numbers and rewrite history, but God says, "I created
[time=2740] in six days six days you shall work." The seventh is the Sabbath.
[time=2747] For you, by the way, this is the only commandment not reiterated or repeated in the New Testament.
[time=2756] Why?
[time=2757] Because we are here, not on the Sabbath.
[time=2760] Yesterday was the Sabbath.
[time=2763] We are here on the first day of the week because according to Psalm 118, 22, and according
[time=2769] to the New Testament, we are to worship on the day Jesus rose from the dead.
[time=2775] We are worshiping on the Lord's day, not on the Sabbath.
[time=2780] I don't have time to deal with all that, but as I approach my, "Oh, I got 25 seconds."
[time=2789] Here's what I want to show you, and I encourage you to read these maybe before the football game tonight.
[time=2796] I encourage you to read these with your kids before you watch the game tonight.
[time=2801] What I want to show you here is that when God gives the Ten Commandments, the people were not like, "Wow, really?
[time=2808] This is a new thing.
[time=2810] I never knew these things." No, they knew all these things.
[time=2816] The fact that there should be no other gods go all the way back to Genesis, to Genesis.
[time=2822] The fact that we are not to worship other gods today goes to the New Testament.
[time=2828] Paul writes, "For they themselves report concerning us the kind of reception we had among you
[time=2834] how you turned to God from idols."
[time=2841] Same thing with no graven image using God's name and how Paul uses the Sabbath day.
[time=2847] He actually says, "Therefore, let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath." You know what?
[time=2857] Sunday is not my day of rest.
[time=2859] It is my worship day, but it's not my day of rest, so I have to take rest another day.
[time=2867] For me, it could be half a day on Saturday, half a day on Monday, or whatever it is, but I got to take off another day.
[time=2875] I assume it's the same thing for Darren and the other pastors.
[time=2879] I still keep the principle and the spirit of the law to worship God and to take a day
[time=2885] of rest, but those two might not be the same ones, because trust me, today is not my day
[time=2893] of rest.
[time=2895] How do we apply the truth?
[time=2897] Three ways.
[time=2898] First of all, let's eliminate anything from our lives that prohibits us to worship God alone, and some of us are very good about using God's name in vain, even in everyday
[time=2912] language.
[time=2913] We use the name of Jesus as a swear word, or we say other things.
[time=2922] Let's purge our vocabulary from words of expressions or expressions that take God's name in vain.
[time=2929] And if you have a spouse, give them the right to correct you.
[time=2936] Not to nag you, but to correct you.
[time=2940] Or maybe you have children who need to correct you.
[time=2945] Have an accountability partner that says, "Hey, how am I doing with using God's name in ways that honor Him?" How am I doing with me honoring God alone and I'm making a God out of view?
[time=2958] Maybe some of us may God's out of family members, children, spouses.
[time=2965] And lastly, the idea of rest is ever present in the New Testament.
[time=2972] Jesus has come to me, all who you labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
[time=2980] See, if you think, you just keep the commandments to enter into heaven and to get into the right relationship with God, you must be very tired today.
[time=2992] But I rest in the fact that Jesus died for me, and I'm not saved because of what I do,
[time=2998] but I'm saved because of what Jesus Christ died for me.
[time=3003] So when I put my head on the pillow tonight, I sleep like a baby.
[time=3009] The drugs also help.
[time=3016] Have you not noticed?
[time=3017] I don't cough as much.
[time=3018] I'm on new antibiotics, bigger and stronger.
[time=3026] Peter Forsyth said this, "The first duty of every soul is to find not its freedom, but
[time=3035] its master." My prayer is that Jesus Christ will become your Lord and Savior, and you'll be able to rest, and you'll be able to worship in the right way.
[time=3047] Let's pray.
[time=3049] Dear Father, we thank You so much for Your love for us and Your love letter to us.
[time=3057] Forgive us for the many times when we looked at it as a list that we cringed at, where
[time=3064] we scoffed at, and we did other things to it.
[time=3069] May we take Your Word and read it, love it, saturate our lives to it, and most of it,
[time=3077] live it.
[time=3079] I pray that we will teach us what it means to worship You alone and to worship You in the right way, destroy all the idols in our lives, and teach us what it means to worship
[time=3089] You alone.
[time=3091] It teaches us what it means to rest, to rest in You, and today to take days off to rest.
[time=3102] Thank You.
[time=3103] Not just that You're the Creator, but thank You that You're the provider, and You are the law giver.
[time=3109] In Christ name I pray, amen.
[time=3121] As morning dawns and evening fates, You inspire songs of praise that rise from earth
[time=3144] to touch Your heart and glorify Your name, Your name is a strong and mighty tower, Your
[time=3160] name is a shelter like no other, Your name, let the nation sing in louder, because nothing
[time=3174] has the power to sing but Your name.
[time=3181] Can you stand with us and sing this, Your name?
[time=3191] Jesus, in Your name we pray, come and fill our hearts today.
[time=3203] And give a strength to it for You, and glorify Your name, Your name is a strong and mighty
[time=3223] tower, Your name is a shelter like no other, Your name, let the nation sing in louder,
[time=3238] because nothing has the power to sing, but Your name is a strong and mighty tower, Your
[time=3251] name is a shelter like no other, Your name, let the nation sing in louder, because nothing
[time=3263] has the power to sing but Your name.
[time=3272] Your love never fails, and never gives up, never runs out on me, Your love never fails,
[time=3282] and never gives up, never runs out on me, Your love never fails, and never gives up,
[time=3290] never runs out on me, Your love, and it's higher than the mountains that I face, and
[time=3305] it's stronger than the power of the great, and it's constant in the child in the change,
[time=3320] this one thing, three ways, and it's higher than the mountains that I face, and it's
[time=3331] stronger than the power of the great, and it's constant in the child in the change, this
[time=3343] one thing, three ways, this one thing, three ways, Your love never fails, and never gives
[time=3358] up, never runs out on me, Your love never fails, and never gives up, never runs out on me,
[time=3370] Your love never fails, and never gives up, never runs out on me, Your love, and it's
[time=3389] just fine, it's like so, and I never, ever have to be afraid, just one thing, three ways,
[time=3406] this one thing, three ways, Your love never fails, and never gives up, never runs out
[time=3417] on me, Your love never fails, and never gives up, never runs out on me, Your love never
[time=3465] never gives up, never runs out on me, Your love never fails, and never gives up, never
[time=3480] runs out on me, Your love never fails, and never gives up, never runs out on me, Your
[time=3495] love never fails, and never gives up, never runs out on me, Your love never fails, and
[time=3505] never runs out on me, Your love, and it's higher than the mountain that I face, and
[time=3528] it's stronger than the power of the grave, and it's constant in the trial and the change,
[time=3545] remains, this one thing, remains, Your love.
