[time=936] Be kind.
[time=946] Reading from God's Word Exodus 20, 12 through 17.
[time=952] Honor your father and your mother that your days may be long in the land that the Lord your God has given you.
[time=961] You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery.
[time=965] You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. You shall not covet your neighbor's house.
[time=975] You shall not covet your neighbor's wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that is your neighbor's.
[time=989] Good morning. If you have your Bibles please open to Exodus chapter 20
[time=995] or if you want to turn on your phones or devices that's okay too. Last Sunday we started the Ten Commandments
[time=1007] and we established that it should be seen by us not as a list of rules from an unloving despot but we should see it as a loving God writing a loving letter to us. See the Ten Commandments as a love letter from a loving God to those with whom he wants to have a relationship. For the Israelites this was
[time=1036] not just a love letter but it was the beginning of their constitution as a nation and it started with the Ten Commandments and then if you read through Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, the astronomy again we see that these laws start with the Ten Commandments but they continue with about 613 other little laws and regulations and in a subsequent
[time=1061] Sunday I'm going to talk about why we don't keep certain of those regulations anymore such as for example why do we actually work or why do we stream today and it's okay.
[time=1075] But that's not the purpose for today. For today I want us to talk about the last six commandments. Last Sunday we looked at the first four. Now the New Testament comes and summarizes
[time=1090] the Ten Commandments into two and you have this in your bulletins as the main passage from Romans 13.
[time=1102] I'm going to close with that and I'm going to open with that as well.
[time=1106] Paul writes to the church in Rome, oh no one anything except to love each other
[time=1112] for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law.
[time=1117] For the commandments you shall not commit adultery you shall not murder you shall not steal you shall not covet and any other commandment are summed up in this word you shall love your neighbor as yourself. Love does no wrong to a neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law. Love God the first
[time=1140] four commandments and love one another or love others the next or the last six.
[time=1149] So we have a challenge ahead of us so let's begin. First of all the fifth
[time=1157] commandment is obey and respect your parents.
[time=1165] Notice again I'm going to have the letter of the law and then I'm going to have the spirit of the law on the same slide and then I'm going to have the New Testament correlation.
[time=1176] Scripture interprets itself with Scripture and remember what I said last time is that the law is both revelatory and regulatory. It reveals who God is and it tells us how
[time=1189] to act what to do or what not to do so that the letter of the law is
[time=1195] honor your father and your mother that your days may be long in the land that the Lord is your God is giving you. So the spirit of the law is
[time=1206] what does it mean to honor it means to obey and respect your parents.
[time=1211] Now a lot of times when we read this commandment we think about children young children obeying their parents right but this is actually for everybody who still has parents they are living and that's this very important concept to remember
[time=1229] and the apostle Paul actually quotes from Exodus when he says in Ephesians 6 children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right honor your father and mother this is the first commandment with a promise and this is the promise that he may go well with you in the land that you may live long in the land. But what does Jesus have to say about this?
[time=1257] I want to go to a text that a lot of us don't go to when we talk about honoring our parents and it is in the gospel of Mark chapter 7 and I have to warn you that Jesus has some really harsh words to say
[time=1272] here. In Mark chapter 7 Jesus is in a conversation
[time=1279] with the religious leaders of the day and he has some harsh words and he calls them hypocrites and Jesus says you hypocrites elevate your traditions
[time=1290] above the Word of God. The Word of God is here and you elevate your
[time=1296] traditions above the Word of God and he refers even to the idea of obeying your parents and respecting and honoring your parents.
[time=1304] Listen to the words of Jesus in Mark chapter 7 starting in verse 7
[time=1310] this is Jesus he says in vain do they worship me teaching as doctrines the commandments of men you leave the commandment of God and hold to the tradition of men and he said to them you have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to establish your tradition. For Moses said honor your father and
[time=1334] your mother and whoever reviles father or mother must surely die but you say if a man tells his father or his
[time=1344] mother whatever you would have gained from me is Corbonne or given to God then you no longer permit him to do
[time=1353] anything for his father or mother thus making void the Word of God by your
[time=1359] tradition that you have handed down and many such things you do. Notice what Jesus says you
[time=1369] leave the commandment of God and whenever we leave the commandment of God we have to replace it with something else right that's always the case if we reject the Word of God we're going to replace it with a lie or something human that is a lie and Jesus says you don't reject it and you don't come and say hey that's the Word of God I'm just going to reject it I'm going to deny it no no Jesus says you have a fine way of rejecting the commandment
[time=1401] of God. Here's what was happening during Jesus's time imagine that the Pharisees and the Sadducees had parents they needed financial assistance or financial help the Pharisees would come and say sorry mom and dad I can't help you because I got to give my tithe to the temple it is given to God and Jesus says you missed the point
[time=1429] you missed the point you cannot do that in other words what Jesus is saying is
[time=1435] this and he's saying it to us today if you have parents who need your financial help or financial assistance you cannot say to them sorry mom and dad I wrote my check to Blackhawk or I wrote it to gives that go or I wrote it to the missionary in Africa or I wrote it to write to life or whatever and I don't have any more money to help you Jesus says you have missed the point not only are you not doing what I told you to do but you replaced it with your own fine way of rejecting my word in other words honoring your father and your
[time=1475] mother I'm talking about now for those of us who have who have jobs and have families parents that have the need our assistance
[time=1485] for us the first check I need to write when I get my paycheck
[time=1492] if my parents need financial assistance for assistance my first check is not to Blackhawk but should be to my parents
[time=1503] I never get a big amen on that one I get a big amen on other things but not on
[time=1509] that one why because we my dear brothers and sisters need to repent and we need to stop rejecting God's word
[time=1522] and replacing it with with our fine tradition we need to do what the Bible says but not do it only when whenever we like it what it says
[time=1541] honor and respect your parents the sixth commandment protect and respect human life
[time=1553] you shall not murder that's the letter of the law the the the spirit of the law is protect and respect
[time=1564] human life and then I want us to see what Jesus says but before I go there it is revelatory in that we are told that God is the creator of life and he's also the protector of life that's why we should not murder other versions say you shall not kill thou shall not kill thou shall I murder you shall I murder other translations here's the bottom line however you translate if you translate a murder or kill we need to understand that it refers to an unlawful killing of a human being it refers to the
[time=1603] unlawful killing of a human being you and I the Bible says are created in the image
[time=1614] of God and there is the first time actually Jesus says
[time=1620] that thou shall not murder it's established in Genesis chapter nine when God establishes the death penalty capital punishment
[time=1632] Genesis nine verse six says whoever sheds the blood of men by men shall his blood be shed for God made men in his own image so the reason we should not murder is because we should not murder other human being is because human beings are created in the image of God and whenever we murder we take away the image of God from that person and that's not ours to do
[time=1660] thou shall not unlawfully kill another human being but notice please what Jesus says in Matthew chapter five here's what I want us to understand is that the Ten Commandments are not these these laws and requirements that nobody can reach and nobody can can follow no I want us to understand that the Ten Commandments are the minimum minimum requirement when Jesus comes
[time=1687] he doesn't lower the bar Jesus raises the bar notice what Jesus because I hear a lot of people saying oh Tiberis we're not under the law anymore we are under grace so we can do whatever we want no Jesus doesn't lower the bar he raises the bar look what he says on the Sermon on the Mount you've heard that he was said to those of old you shall not murder and whoever murders will be liable to judgment but I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council and whoever says you fool or you crazy man or whatever you idiot whatever you want to put me there you will be liable to the hell of fire
[time=1734] notice please that the spirit of the law is much higher than the letter of the law
[time=1740] the letter of the law is the minimum minimum requirement but the letter kills the spirit gives life Paul says so we need to look at the spirit of the law it goes deeper than just okay I did not put the knife in my brothers back so I'm okay and Jesus says no Jesus says no you have to go deeper than that and you have
[time=1761] to go to the spirit of the law you got to protect and respect human life born and unborn
[time=1771] usually that one gets an amen like that yeah the honor your father and mother not so much we live in a culture of death
[time=1786] and I'm sure you're familiar with this statistic that in the United States this is an annual these are annual numbers you should shudder and you should cringe when you read these we kill 1.5 million babies a year through abortion
[time=1807] and yet God says you shall not murder you shall not kill
[time=1817] as a society we are guilty of not protecting and not respecting human life
[time=1825] in his book culture of death by Wesley Smith he writes a small but influential
[time=1833] group of philosophers and health care policy makers actively seek to persuade our culture that killing is beneficial suicide is
[time=1843] rational natural death is undignified and caring properly and compassionately for
[time=1850] people who are elderly prematurely born disabled despairing or dying is a burden that wastes emotional and financial resources
[time=1860] now just like with honoring our parents
[time=1869] if we are guilty by saying okay to abortion or baby even your guilty of
[time=1876] performing an abortion or your guilty of having had an abortion I'm here to tell you that this is not the unpardonable sin and you need to come with repentance before God and he will forgive you this is not the unpardonable sin God waits and expects you to come repentantly
[time=1895] and he will forgive you see the value of life is not given on how much you make
[time=1904] the value of your life is not what kind of grades you are getting isn't that parents what sometimes we instill in our children they're valuable only if they have straight A's and straight teeth huh that's why we instill in our children sometimes and yet we need to instill in them that they are valuable because they are created in the image of God that's what gives people value
[time=1929] born and unborn but unfortunately my dear brothers and sisters
[time=1936] a lot of us are only pro-birth and not pro-life because we disappeared the
[time=1942] minute the baby is born a lot of us do and yet listen to the spirit of the
[time=1949] law that says we are to respect and protect human life in other words it's not just the unborn or the baby but also what happens with
[time=1959] people when they are older that still has to do with respecting human life
[time=1965] so us as a church we need to stop just being pro-birth we need to be pro-life
[time=1972] if that baby is born and that baby needs help we need to help one of the worst things that the church has done over the centuries is give the poor to the government and yet Jesus says the poor will always be with you why to do what to care for them and to help them not to point them with
[time=1992] your finger or to say bad things about them but to help them we have done a great service to the poor by passing them on to the government
[time=2003] John writes in first John chapter three we know that we have passed out of death
[time=2009] into life because we love the brothers whoever does not love abides in death
[time=2015] everyone who hates his brother is the murderer and you know that no murderer has eternal life of binding in him by this we know we love that he laid down
[time=2026] his life life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers but if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need yet closes his heart against him how does God's love abide in him it's a rhetorical question the answer is he cannot if we say we love God we have to love people little people big people old people
[time=2052] gray hair blonde hair it doesn't matter what we need to protect and respect all human life
[time=2058] if we haven't done it let's repent let's ask God for forgiveness
[time=2068] and he will forgive us but we need to turn from our sins and be true to the word of God
[time=2078] not only are we to honor our fathers and mothers not only are we to protect and respect human life
[time=2084] but we need to be true to our spouses you shall not commit adultery
[time=2091] that is the letter of the law the spirit of the law is to be true to your spouse to your wife
[time=2099] and to your husband if the sixth commandment has to do with respect for human life the seventh
[time=2105] commandment has to do with respect for marital life marriage which is an institution created
[time=2113] by god you see god is holy this common this commandment is revelatory that it teaches us
[time=2120] that god is holy and it's regulatory because he tells us that he wants us to live in holy
[time=2126] relationships god is not just concerned with our happiness god is concerned with our holiness
[time=2135] for god those things go together again Jesus Jesus raises the bar you shall not commit adultery
[time=2146] is the minimum minimum requirement the spirit of the law is much higher you have heard that he
[time=2152] was said Jesus says you shall not commit adultery but i say to you that everyone who looks at a woman
[time=2159] with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart i say tiberias well it isn't
[time=2167] just this sin just just like other sins because a lot of people say that well why do we compare
[time=2173] sexual sin with other sins and they're all the same they're not all the same they are not all the same it's a difference if you commit a sin by saying something or by thinking
[time=2185] something or by doing something actually the bible speaks about that in first Corinthians
[time=2191] first Corinthians chapter six you see sexual sin dishonors the holy spirit the apostle paul
[time=2202] writes flee from sexual immorality all other sins the men commits are outside the body
[time=2210] but he who sin sexually sins against his own body do you not know that your body is the temple of the
[time=2216] holy spirit who is in you whom you have received from god you are not your own you are bought at a
[time=2223] price therefore honor god with your body our bodies were purchased scholar writes our bodies were
[time=2231] purchased for god when christ died on the cross now they are inhabited by god spirit this means that
[time=2237] whatever we do with our bodies is directly related to our fellowship with the triune god in addition to damaging ourselves and others committing adultery this honors the father the son
[time=2248] and the holy spirit is this the unpardonable sin no just like honoring our father and our mother
[time=2259] not murdering if we have committed this sin god can forgive god can forgive if you are here this
[time=2269] morning and you are living in this sin leave your life of sin repent of your sin and god who is
[time=2279] gracious can forgive you now you'll still have to make it right with your spouse i can't promise you what's going to happen over there but god can forgive how can we who are married who have kept
[time=2295] ourselves pure so far how can we build a hedge of protection about around our families to protect
[time=2303] us from this sexual sin here are four ways we can avoid affairs this is from our friends of answers
[time=2313] in not answers and genesis i'm sorry from focus on the family this is james lopsins focus on the
[time=2320] family in colorado springs colorado um that i'm sure there are books about this i'm sure maybe
[time=2327] you have read you've read articles about this but these are four that i found very useful and i'm going to share them with you today these are practical ways to avoid having an affair
[time=2341] the first one avoid spending time alone with people of the opposite sex if you are a man you should never be in car in a car alone with a woman that's not your spouse
[time=2354] and i this is i can't give you i know some of you are looking hey give me a bible verse for that one
[time=2366] i don't have a bible verse for that one i'm i'm telling you as a as a as a friend as a pastor as one who has seen the damages of adultery in other people
[time=2377] build a hedge of protection why would you put yourself in a situation that can lead to compromise
[time=2385] why you should never have lunch with a person of opposite sex that's not your spouse with other
[time=2393] people being there now understand if it's a working relationship and there are many guys and many gals and you gotta we go to lunch because it's the company that made you do it whatever but you and another woman going to lunch on a company whatever you shouldn't do that
[time=2409] you are opening yourself up for temptation and you're basically praying lord leave me
[time=2415] not into temptation because i go myself i know that's funny but i see a lot of people doing that
[time=2421] and then they fall into temptation and then commit adultery what has happened well what has happened is they lived unethically that's what happened they didn't follow very simple rules they are to
[time=2433] follow when i first moved to grace they put me in a dungeon i'm kidding it was a door without
[time=2443] a window and i said there's no way i can be in here and students come and see me we have to put a
[time=2450] window in this door that's for protection we have to learn how to live ethically you might say but
[time=2460] i wish i'm gonna lose my job you know what it is better for you to lose your job than to lose your marriage refuse to act or even reveal feelings of attraction to someone other than your spouse
[time=2476] this is goes against the same thing focus on the family rights don't share details of your marriage relationship particularly problems
[time=2487] with a member of the opposite sex avoid outside influences and environments
[time=2493] if you know that at your party or your business party your company party there will be drinking that encourages infidelity don't go there
[time=2505] make your spouse your top priority talk about problems and concerns and work through them together get joint counseling to help if necessary if your spouse is angry or won't go to counseling go by
[time=2519] yourself as she or she sees changes in your spouse might soften and lastly the fifth one
[time=2527] changing attitude about your marriage see it as a commitment that can't be broken
[time=2535] love flourishes in a relationship where there is a complete trust respect and acceptance have fun with your spouse date each other again how would you treat that person differently if
[time=2547] you're trying to win his or her affections for the first time again my dear brothers and sisters
[time=2554] i want to emphasize god doesn't want us to just to have happy families he wants us to have holy
[time=2562] families and again if you have committed the sin god is faithful and just to forgive if you've
[time=2572] confessed your sin if you repent of your sin there still be consequences for your sin
[time=2578] a lot of people tell me look what about david david david committed adultery yes david committed adultery i encourage you to go and read second samuel chapter 11 what happened
[time=2591] after david committed adultery let me ask you did david repent of his sin he had david we have a whole song song 51 that tells us how david really repented of his sin
[time=2603] but everything went downhill after that in his kingdom in his family everywhere david suffered
[time=2609] from daddy on the consequences of his sin if you want an example of purity david is not your
[time=2619] example joseph is huh let's take that as an example joseph who his his boss's wife came to him the
[time=2628] bible says day after day day after day and tried to sleep with him and he said no no no that's my
[time=2636] example that's the example for us young people it is not day it is not david it is david if you
[time=2643] committed that sin and you're willing to live without those consequences but for us as example
[time=2649] of purity is joseph god gave us families not only for our happiness but for our holiness
[time=2658] let's go to commandment number eight do not take what belongs to others that is
[time=2668] the spirit of the law the letter of the law verse 15 you shall not steal
[time=2675] regulatory it's very easy right dao shall not steal you shall not take what's not yours it's pretty
[time=2682] basic isn't it but what's revelatory about this what is it issues about god it teaches us that if
[time=2688] god is god that means he gave us enough what we need that's why you shall not steal it is revelatory
[time=2697] first god in his goodness gave us everything that we need that's why we shall not steal and yet statistics say that people steal from work from hospitals from hotels and even churches
[time=2712] now i know some of you don't like statistics i know 80% of you like statistics 40% of you don't
[time=2725] do you know he's a statistic that i found interesting 90% of christians claim they never
[time=2734] broke the eight commandment they probably write lied right there huh probably uh broke the ninth
[time=2744] commandment in the process i read about a hotel who just opened and they reported it in the first
[time=2759] year of their existence the hotel had to replace 38 000 spoons 355 coffee pots you ready for this
[time=2770] and a hundred bibles by the way this is a side note this is uh you can erase this from the memory of
[time=2780] human kind but i would encourage you to put bibles in your pews and encourage people to
[time=2786] take them when they leave if they don't have a bible this is just uh that's free of charge
[time=2795] the apostle paul look in the new testament passage the apostle paul commands repeats basically the
[time=2801] commandment and offers the solution let him who steal steal no longer but rather let him labor
[time=2810] performing with his own hands what is good in order that he may have something to share with him who has need in other words the implication here is that these people had to steal because they
[time=2823] were poor and paul says the problem if you're poor here again i'm talking about this example i'm not
[time=2829] talking about a general example this example here suggests that this person was poor and they needed to they wanted to they needed to steal to have something but paul says no that's not the
[time=2840] solution the solution is for you to get a job to work so you don't have to steal
[time=2846] again that's the the principle of the matter do not take what belongs to others
[time=2852] even as we think about tax season april 15 as we work on our taxes remember that
[time=2864] we shall not steal even from the government the government doesn't like competition
[time=2875] that's a joke that's a joke
[time=2883] but we should think maybe before you sit down to do that to taxes pray
[time=2894] read the word and say lord may may i be holy even in the way i do business with the government
[time=2901] or whoever you're dealing with the ninth commandment we're running out of time
[time=2908] but i want to thank there and for giving me five extra minutes there and we love you too
[time=2914] but uh Valentine's Day is like in two weeks
[time=2920] but i know you like to preempt okay uh ninth commandment do not lie about others the
[time=2928] letter of the law you shall not bear false witness against your neighbor again the the
[time=2935] setting here is in a court of law but we can apply it to our everyday lives
[time=2943] Jesus says i am the way the truth and the life so it is revelatory but it's also regulatory
[time=2950] that we cannot lie about others or we cannot lie to others notice again the words of Jesus
[time=2957] who raises the bar you shall not bear false witness against your neighbor is the minimum
[time=2963] requirement Jesus raises the bar in Matthew 5 starting in verse 33 again you have heard that
[time=2972] it was said of those of old you shall not swear falsely but shall perform to the lord what you
[time=2978] have sworn but i say to you do not take an oath at all either by heaven for it is the throne of god
[time=2985] or by the earth for it is his footstool or by Jerusalem for it is the city of the great king so the apostle Paul comes and continues this idea it's not just swearing falsely
[time=2999] but it's also telling the truth to one another he says in Ephesians chapter four verse 25
[time=3006] therefore having put away false hood let each one of you speak the truth to his neighbor
[time=3013] for we are members one of another we my dear brothers and sisters live in a culture of lies
[time=3026] we have lies all around i'm not asking you to watch the politics of the presidential election
[time=3036] but if there are so many people saying so many different things i have a feeling that someone's
[time=3043] lying i'm not pointing to anybody someone once said George Orwell said in a time of universal
[time=3057] deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act well let's say oh i like it because i think what
[time=3067] we need to be is revolutionaries in a time of universal deceit telling the truth
[time=3074] is a revolutionary act thus we are called to be revolutionaries tell the truth you might say if i tell the truth will that be easy will i make it easier for me you
[time=3087] know someone wise one said tell the truth and prepare to die tell the truth and prepare to die
[time=3095] don't prepare to be to people for people to tell you oh yeah yeah you're fine no tell the truth
[time=3101] and prepare to die be a revolutionary and lastly be satisfied with what you have
[time=3108] the last one you shall not covet your neighbor's house you shall not covet your neighbor's wife
[time=3115] or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that is your
[time=3121] neighbor's again that the revelatory aspect of this is that god in his generosity gave you
[time=3129] exactly what you need that's why you should not covet the things that are other people's
[time=3135] one of the most miscoated verses in the bible is philippians 4 13 i can do all things through him
[time=3143] who strengthens me that is not given in context of you going to the free throw line and saying i'm
[time=3149] gonna make 10 out of 10 why do i say that i've been in churches in their gyms philippians 4 13
[time=3157] was on the free throw line and i go there and i didn't make it and yet i can do all things to
[time=3166] crash to strengthens me that that is not the context the context the poll talks about here
[time=3174] is being content being satisfied with what you have look at the context please i know how to be brought
[time=3182] low and i know how to abound in any and every circumstance i have learned the circuit of facing
[time=3188] plenty and hunger abundance i need i can do all things through christ who strengthens me that's the
[time=3194] context it has nothing to do with your percentage at bat there's nothing to do with your percentage
[time=3203] when you hit the golf ball or the soccer ball my dear brothers and sisters the lie that we have
[time=3212] believed from satan all the time is that the grass is always greener on the other side what we don't
[time=3220] realize the lot of times the grass looks greener it's because it's synthetic it is false it is satan
[time=3228] planted that's why it is always greener Paul writes to the Colossians therefore consider the members of your earthly body as dead to
[time=3240] immorality impurity passion evil desire and greed which amounts to idolatry this by the way is
[time=3252] for all of us it doesn't matter what where we are in life listen to a confession of a pastor
[time=3259] one pastor confessed and i quote i belong to the cult of the next thing it's danger easy to get
[time=3267] enlisted it happens by default not by choosing the cult but by failing to resist it the cult of the
[time=3274] next thing is consumerism cast in religious terms it has its own litany of sacred words
[time=3281] more you deserve it new faster cleaner brighter it has its own deep rooted liturgy
[time=3287] charge it instant credit no down payment deferred payment no interest for three months
[time=3293] it has its own preachers evangelists prophets and apostles admin pitch my celebrity sponsors
[time=3301] it has of course its own shrines chapels temples meccas moles superstores club warehouses
[time=3308] it has its own sacraments credit and debit cards it has its own ecstatic experiences the spending
[time=3314] spree most of us spend more time with advertisements than with scripture the cult of the next thing
[time=3320] central message proclaims crave and spend for the kingdom of stuff is here
[time=3330] when we do that we need our love god nor our neighbors that's why paul has to come and say what
[time=3339] take all these 10 commandments and summarize them in these two oh no one anything except to
[time=3349] love each other for one who loves another has fulfilled the law for the commandments you shall not commit adultery you shall not murder you shall not steal you shall not covet and any other commandment are summed up in this word love your neighbor as yourself love does no wrong to
[time=3365] a neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law if we love our neighbors we're not going
[time=3374] to lie to them if we love our neighbors we're not going to covet what's theirs if we love our
[time=3381] neighbors we're not going to lie to them we're not commit adultery with their spouses we are going to be understanding that god is a holy god and wants me to live a holy life in loving him
[time=3393] and loving others if you cannot remember all the 10 commandments all you have to remember is these
[time=3401] two love god and love your neighbor if you do that you have fulfilled the law paul says
[time=3411] but i'm going to close by saying one more thing the law points us to christ when paul writes to
[time=3418] the Galatians he wants to make sure that nobody can be saved by doing the works of the law remember we said this last time just because you keep the commandments this is not a stairway to heaven that that's not what's happening here no actually paul says if anybody can be considered
[time=3435] righteous by the works of the law jesus died in vain but he didn't actually this is what paul writes
[time=3443] the law was our guardian until christ came in order that we might be justified by faith
[time=3450] but now that faith has come we are no longer under a guardian for in christ jesus you are all sons
[time=3456] of god through faith that word translated here guardian is the greek word pedagagos from where we
[time=3464] have the english word pedagogy the art of teaching and pedagog the one who teaches so what paul says
[time=3474] is the law is the teacher who took you by the hand to lead you to christ to show you that you cannot
[time=3481] be saved by the law hey there is one who can save and that person is jesus christ the law
[time=3487] points to the salvation that only comes to jesus in x4 12 we are told there is no salvation
[time=3494] in anybody else because there is no other name under heaven given among men which we must be saved except the name of jesus the application is simple we've had a roll throughout but the
[time=3507] bottom line is this love your neighbor as yourself let's pray your father we thank you for your
[time=3519] love letter to us thank you for the fact that you are the loving law giver who send us a love letter
[time=3527] i pray that you'll teach us what it means every day that we love you and love our neighbor as ourselves may we be going to jesus every morning asking for the fullness of the holy spirit to help
[time=3540] us live our lives in such a way that not just will be happy lives but there will be holy lives may we live in such a way that the people around us will will see you and they will give you praise
[time=3551] and glory may we be testimonies living letters that go to our neighborhoods and our jobs and our
[time=3558] schools and we proclaim that jesus alone is the way of salvation in his name we pray amen
