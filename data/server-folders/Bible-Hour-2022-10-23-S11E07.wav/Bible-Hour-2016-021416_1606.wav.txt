[time=67] Though I'm weak and poor, all I have is yours.
[time=74] Every single breath.
[time=80] I'll ring you more than a song, or a song in its mouth.
[time=86] It's not what you have required.
[time=93] You search twice deeper within, through the way things appear.
[time=100] You're looking into my heart.
[time=107] I'm coming back to the heart of worship, and it's all about you.
[time=116] It's all about you, Jesus.
[time=120] I'm sorry, Lord, for the being I've made, and it's all about you.
[time=129] It's all about you, Jesus.
[time=133] I'm coming back to the heart of worship, and it's all about you.
[time=142] It's all about you, Jesus.
[time=146] I'm sorry, Lord, for the being I've made, and it's all about you.
[time=156] It's all about you, Jesus.
[time=161] [MUSIC]
[time=191] Jesus, you're the god that won't run dry.
[time=198] Your presence is heaven to me.
[time=208] The treasure of my heart, and of my soul, and my will gives you a burst of hope.
[time=236] The teeter of my past, and present wrong, and over of my future days to come.
[time=251] Your presence is heaven to me.
[time=309] So all my days on earth I will await.
[time=316] The moment that I see and face to face.
[time=323] Nothing in this world will stand aside.
[time=329] Jesus, you're the god that won't run dry.
[time=344] Your presence is heaven to me.
[time=445] I hope it's built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[time=463] I did not trust the sweetest friend, but only trust in Jesus' name.
[time=480] My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[time=492] I did not trust the sweetest friend, but only trust in Jesus' name.
[time=510] Jesus, you're the god that won't run dry.
[time=533] When darkness seems to hide its face, I rest on His unchanging grace.
[time=548] In every high and stormy air, my anger holds in the air.
[time=561] Christ, our love, Lord, our God, our strong repaint strong in the sandals, love, through the storm.
[time=583] He is our Lord, Lord, our love.
[time=605] Christ, our love, our God, our strong repaint strong in the sandals, love, through the last flow.
[time=621] He is our Lord, Lord, our strong, Lord, our strong repaint strong in the sandals, love, through the storm.
[time=647] He is our Lord, Lord, our love.
[time=665] He shall come with trumpet sound, oh may I then in Him be found, dressed in His righteous nestle.
[time=686] God bless to stand before the Lord.
[time=696] In the morning when I rise,
[time=715] in the morning when I rise, in the morning when I rise, give me Jesus.
[time=740] Give me Jesus, give me Jesus, you can have all this world.
[time=761] Just give me Jesus.
[time=772] And when I am alone, and when I am alone, give me Jesus.
[time=797] Oh give me Jesus, give me Jesus, you can have all this world.
[time=818] Just give me Jesus.
[time=829] When I come to die, when I come to die, oh when I come to die, give me Jesus.
[time=858] Give me Jesus, give me Jesus, you can have all this world.
[time=879] Just give me Jesus, oh give me Jesus, give me Jesus, you can have all this world.
[time=905] You can have all this world, you can have all this.
[time=920] Just give me Jesus.
[time=946] When the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron and said to him, "Up, make us guides who shall go before us.
[time=957] As for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him."
[time=965] So Aaron said to them, "Take off the rings of gold that are in your ears of your wives, your sons and your daughters, and bring them to me." So all the people took off the rings of gold that were in their ears and brought them to Aaron.
[time=979] And he received the gold from their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool and made a golden calf.
[time=985] And they said, "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt."
[time=991] When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it.
[time=994] And Aaron made a proclamation and said, "Tomorrow shall be a feast to the Lord." And they rose early the next day and burnt offerings and brought peace offerings.
[time=1004] And the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.
[time=1009] And the Lord said to Moses, "Go down for your people whom you have brought up out of the land of Egypt have corrupted themselves."
[time=1017] They have turned aside quickly out of the way that I have commanded them.
[time=1021] They have made themselves a golden calf and have worshipped it and sacrificed to it.
[time=1026] And Aaron said, "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt."
[time=1034] And the Lord said to Moses, "I have seen this people and behold, it is a stiff neck to people."
[time=1041] Now therefore, let me alone that my wrath may not burn hot against them and I may consume them in order that I may make a great nation of you.
[time=1050] But Moses implored the Lord his God and said, "O Lord, why does your wrath burn hot against your people whom you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?"
[time=1061] Why did the Egyptians say with evil intent did he bring them out to kill them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth?
[time=1070] Turning from burning anger and relent from this disaster against your people.
[time=1075] Remember Abraham and Isaac and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self and said to them,
[time=1081] "I will multiply your offspring as the stars in the heaven, and this land I have promised I will give to your offspring and they shall inherit it forever."
[time=1092] And the Lord relented from the disaster that he had spoken of, bringing it on his people.
[time=1103] Good morning. Thank you, Laurel and Jonathan and Darren for leading us in worship through the Word and through singing.
[time=1113] We are continuing our worship through the teaching and preaching of the Word of God.
[time=1118] If you have your Bibles, please open to Exodus chapter 32, or you can turn on your phones or iPads.
[time=1126] Any devices you have, that is fine.
[time=1133] Let me start by asking you a question.
[time=1136] Have you ever been rejected?
[time=1149] Have you ever been faithful to someone for many, many years only for them to respond with unfaithfulness?
[time=1160] I see some heads nodding.
[time=1163] If you have, you can feel a little bit of what God felt.
[time=1170] When his own people, instead of worshiping him, worshiped a golden calf.
[time=1178] How bad was this sin?
[time=1186] Well, what's your name, young man?
[time=1190] Daniel?
[time=1192] Dane.
[time=1195] Dane, imagine that you go through life and you meet the girl of your dreams.
[time=1202] She's a believer just like you, and you fall in love, and you propose, and she says yes, and you look forward to the wedding day, and both of you say, "I do."
[time=1217] And you look forward to that, Dane, it's a wonderful day.
[time=1224] But on the wedding night, instead of you spending the wedding night together with your spouse, she says, "Dane, I kind of love you, but I think tonight I'm going to go spend the night with a prostitute."
[time=1245] That's how bad Israel's sin was.
[time=1250] Tabiri is exaggerating. No, I'm not. Look in the scripture, please.
[time=1255] In chapter 19, God selected Israel to be his bride. Remember that?
[time=1263] He says, "You will be my treasured possession." And God wrote a love letter to her.
[time=1271] And while we know the Ten Commandments, and remember the first commandments were very easy, right?
[time=1277] You shall have no other gods before me.
[time=1281] And you shall not make a graven image. You remember that?
[time=1286] Not only that, but look at me, please, in chapter 24.
[time=1291] Because in chapter 24, they actually say their "I do's." Moses comes down from the mountain, gives them the Ten Commandments.
[time=1300] And notice, please, that Israel says, "I do." Acts in this 24, verse 4.
[time=1307] Moses came down and told the people, all the words of the Lord and all the rules, and all the people answered it.
[time=1314] One voice said, "All the words that the Lord has spoken, we will, we will do."
[time=1320] I do, basically, Israel says.
[time=1326] And then in verse 7, they repeated.
[time=1329] Then he took the book of the covenant and threaded in the hearing of the people, and they said, "All the Lord has spoken, we will do, and we will be obedient."
[time=1340] Were they obedient? No.
[time=1344] Just a few chapters later, by the way, Moses goes up the mountain a few times.
[time=1348] This is not the first time Moses goes up and down from the mountain.
[time=1353] But at some point, apparently, he goes, and he lingers there for about 40 days and 40 nights.
[time=1361] Look in chapter 32, verse 1.
[time=1364] The first lesson we're learning today is that impatience leads to idolatry.
[time=1370] When the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron and said to him,
[time=1381] "Up, make us gods who shall go before us as for this Moses, the men who brought us up out of the land of Egypt,
[time=1389] we do not know what has become of him." Moses is gone for 40 days and 40 nights, and the people become impatient.
[time=1401] Notice, please, they're not just impatient, but I want us to understand that they are disrespectful.
[time=1409] Notice here it's underlined this Moses.
[time=1413] It's basically this bosomosis.
[time=1417] That's basically the idea, this bosomosis, do you notice how they are treating him?
[time=1425] We really don't really know him, really?
[time=1429] He's the guy God used to bring you out of Egypt, and all of a sudden, he's this Moses?
[time=1438] Not only are they impatient, they are disrespectful.
[time=1441] As for this Moses, this bosom, the men who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.
[time=1451] Impatience, my dear brothers and sisters, leads to idolatry, look in verses 2 to 4.
[time=1458] So Aaron said to them, "Take off the rings of gold that are in the years of your wives, your sons and your daughters,
[time=1465] and bring them to me, so all the people took off the rings of gold that were in their years and brought them to Aaron,
[time=1471] and he received the gold from their hands and fashioned it with a graving tool and made a golden calf."
[time=1478] And they said, "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you out, up out of the land of Egypt."
[time=1486] Now let me ask you, where did they get all that gold?
[time=1490] Do you remember? They got it out of Egypt.
[time=1494] In chapter 12, verses 35 and 36, we are told that the people of Israel had also done what Moses told them,
[time=1503] for they had asked the Egyptians for silver and gold, jewelry and for clothing, and the Lord had given the people favor in the eyes in the sight of the Egyptians,
[time=1514] so that they let them have what they asked, thus they plundered the Egyptians.
[time=1521] The gold and the silver, they were supposed to be a reminder of what God has done for them, now becomes what?
[time=1529] Part of their idolatry, spiritual adultery on one's wedding night, that's what this is.
[time=1540] This is how serious this is. Where did they get the idea of worshiping golden calves or bulls?
[time=1551] This is an archaeological discovery of an Egyptian king bowing down before Apis.
[time=1561] We talked about him earlier a couple of weeks ago, but it's basically one of the Egyptian gods,
[time=1568] Apis, in the form of a bull. Where did they get the idea to worship something in form of a bull?
[time=1576] Well, they were in Egypt, remember, for many, many years, and unfortunately you can take the Israelite out of Egypt,
[time=1584] but you cannot take Egypt out of the Israelite.
[time=1588] Just like in our cases, sometimes you can take us out of the world, but unfortunately you cannot take the world out of us.
[time=1596] And when someone looks at us, they cannot know if we are a Christian or not, and they should be able to.
[time=1603] They should be able to.
[time=1608] Idolatry, what is idolatry?
[time=1613] Idolatry is an evil exchange.
[time=1616] An evil exchange, actually in the book of Psalms, Psalm 106, we have the definition of idolatry.
[time=1625] Psalm 106 verses 19 and 20.
[time=1630] This is very, very important because the Psalmist, a couple of hundred years later, looks back at what happened here in Exodus 32 and explains what happened.
[time=1642] They made a calf in horrib and worshipped a metal image. They exchanged the glory of God for the image of an ox that eats grass.
[time=1655] So idolatry, my dear brothers and sisters, is an evil exchange when we take the glory of God and we exchange it for the glory of something or someone else.
[time=1671] The Psalmist explains what idolatry was and still is today.
[time=1680] You see, when we worship something or someone else, the biggest problem is that we're not giving God the glory.
[time=1686] That's the biggest problem.
[time=1688] We are taking away from the glory that's only his.
[time=1692] Arcy Sproul writes, the cow, the bull, whatever you want to call him, gave no law and demanded no obedience.
[time=1700] He had no wrath or justice or holiness to be feared.
[time=1704] He was death, dumb and impotent, but at least he could not intrude on their fun and call them to judgment.
[time=1712] This was a religion designed by men, practiced by men and ultimately useless for men.
[time=1722] So what happens when we commit idolatry?
[time=1727] Let's look and see what happens to them.
[time=1729] First of all, idolatry requires intercession.
[time=1733] When you see idolatry in someone else or around us, we need to intercede.
[time=1740] Look what God says and what God wants to do.
[time=1745] The Lord said to Moses, "Go down for your people whom you brought out of the land of Egypt."
[time=1751] Do you notice something here?
[time=1753] Remember until now, God says, "Hey, you're my people, right?
[time=1756] My treasured possession." And now God says, "No, they're your people, Moses." Don't you like it?
[time=1764] You're people.
[time=1767] They have turned the site quickly out of the way I commanded them.
[time=1772] They have made for themselves the golden calf and have worshipped it and sacrificed to it and said, "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you out, up out of the land of Egypt and the Lord said to Moses,
[time=1782] I have seen these people and behold, it is a stiff-necked people.
[time=1786] Now, therefore, let me alone that my wrath may burn against them, that I may consume them.
[time=1790] In order that I may make a great nation out of you." Basically, God says, "I'm going to start all over again, Moses.
[time=1798] I'm going to do away with them and I'm going to start all over."
[time=1804] Verse 11.
[time=1805] I want you to pay close attention to verses 11 through 14 because to this day, observant Jews read verses 11 through 14 because on the day of their fasting,
[time=1820] because they like it when Moses interceded for the people.
[time=1824] Verse 11, "But Moses implored the Lord, his God, and said, "O Lord, why does your wrath burn hot against your people,
[time=1833] whom you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?
[time=1839] Why should the Egyptians say, with evil intent did he bring them out to kill them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth?
[time=1847] Turn from your burning anger and your relent from his disaster against your people.
[time=1852] Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you saw by your own self and said to them,
[time=1858] "I will multiply your offspring as the stars of the heavens, and all this land that I have promised,
[time=1864] I will give to your offspring and they shall inherit it forever." And the Lord relented from the disaster that he had spoken of bringing on his people.
[time=1880] Moses, the leader, becomes Moses the intercessor, which teaches us another lesson.
[time=1887] The great leaders are always great intercessors.
[time=1892] Sure, the pastor needs to be a man who can teach and preach, but the pastor better learn how to get on on his knees and pray.
[time=1900] Because great leaders are not just great teachers, they're great intercessors.
[time=1907] The idolatry requires intercession, and that's what Moses does.
[time=1912] Moses, the leader, becomes the Moses the intercessor, but notice, please, there's consequences to sin.
[time=1918] Idolatry must be perched out.
[time=1923] Look what happens later.
[time=1927] Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony's hand.
[time=1933] Tablets, they were written on both sides on the front and on the back, they were written.
[time=1937] The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God engraved on the tablets.
[time=1941] When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, "There is a noise of war in the camp." But he said, "It is not the sound of shouting for victory, or the sound of cry or defeat, but the sound of singing that I hear."
[time=1955] And as soon as he came near the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, Moses' anger burnt hot.
[time=1961] And he threw the tablets out of his hand and broke them at the foot of the mountain.
[time=1965] He took the calf that they had made and burnt it with fire and grounded to powder and scattered it on the water and made the people of Israel drink it.
[time=1974] Have you ever thought about that?
[time=1977] What happened here?
[time=1979] Why did that happen?
[time=1981] It happened because idolatry must be purged out.
[time=1987] Someone once said, "Your idol is shattered in the dust to prove that God's dust is greater than your idol."
[time=2007] Idolatry must be purged out.
[time=2012] It looks starting in verse 21.
[time=2016] And Moses said to Aaron, "What did these people do to you that you have brought such a great sin upon them?"
[time=2025] And Aaron said, "Let not the anger of my learned burnt hot.
[time=2028] You know the people that they are set on evil.
[time=2030] For they said to me, "Make us God's, who shall go before us, as for this Moses, the man who has brought us up out of the land of Egypt.
[time=2038] We do not know what has become of him." So I said to them, "Let any of you who have gold take it off so they give it to me." And I threw it into the fire and out came this calf.
[time=2052] I think Pastor Jesse said that God has a sense of humor.
[time=2055] Oh yeah. Aaron is pretty funny.
[time=2058] Hey, I threw in the fire, I earned a bam, a calf, a golden calf.
[time=2064] Wow.
[time=2066] And when Moses saw that these people had broken loose, for Aaron had let them break loose to the derision of their enemies,
[time=2073] then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said, "Who is on the Lord's side come to me?" And all the sons of Levi gathered around him, and he said to them, "Thus says the Lord of God of Israel, put your sword on your side, each of you, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and each of you kill his brother and his companion and his neighbor." And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses, and that day about 3,000 men of the people fell.
[time=2102] Idolatry must be purged out.
[time=2106] Some of us think that the consequences of sin is death, is a new testament development.
[time=2113] No, no, no, no.
[time=2115] The consequences, the wages of sin is death, is not a new testament development.
[time=2121] It happened many, many years ago.
[time=2124] Dr. John Davis in his commentary, Moses and the Gods of Egypt, estimates that there were about 2 million Jews that came out of Egypt.
[time=2133] Think about that.
[time=2135] 2 million, sorry, 2 million coming out of Egypt.
[time=2140] And Moses intercedes that God will not destroy them, so God doesn't destroy 2 million of them, but 3,000 of them fall because of their sin.
[time=2150] Verse 6, actually, in chapter 33, explains that their sin was complex.
[time=2155] Notice what it says.
[time=2156] "They rose up early the next day and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings, and the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play." One commentator's writes this, "Air and play is no further role.
[time=2170] The rabble has taken over and has plunged into pagan or geastic rites."
[time=2176] Thus, the wages of sin becomes death.
[time=2181] Intercession is necessary.
[time=2188] Purging out is necessary, and this intercession leads to restoration.
[time=2194] Look in chapter 32, starting in verse 30.
[time=2201] The next day, Moses said to the people, "You have sinned a great sin, and now I will go up to the Lord.
[time=2210] Perhaps I can make atonement for your sin." So Moses returned to the Lord and said, "Alas, these people have sinned a great sin.
[time=2217] They have made for themselves gods of gold, but now if you will forgive their sins, but if not, please blot me out of your book that you have written.
[time=2226] But the Lord said to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me, I will blot out of my book, but now go lead the people to the place about which I have spoken to you.
[time=2234] Behold, my angel shall go before you." Nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.
[time=2241] Then the Lord sent a plague on the people because they made the calf the one that Aaron made.
[time=2249] The Lord said to Moses, "Depart, go up from here.
[time=2252] You and the people whom you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying, I will give it. I will send an angel before you and I will drive out the Canaanites, the emirides, the hetites, the parasites, the hevites and the Jebusites.
[time=2267] Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey, but I will not go up among you, lest I consume you on the way for you are a stiff-necked people." When the people heard this disastrous word they mourned and no one put on his ornaments for the Lord said to Moses, "Say to the people of Israel, you are a stiff-necked people.
[time=2286] If for a single moment I should go up among you, I would consume you." So now take off your ornaments that I may know what to do with you.
[time=2294] Therefore the people of Israel strip themselves of their ornaments from Mount Horeb on word.
[time=2303] There is sin, there is judgment, but there is also restoration.
[time=2310] There is sin, there is judgment, but God our God is also a God of restoration.
[time=2315] And God restores the relationship to the people because Moses intercedes.
[time=2322] So going back to the formula, I want us to see my dear brothers and sisters, because we want to make this as practical as possible.
[time=2330] If we are guilty of idolater this morning, we need to repent.
[time=2335] There is one who intercedes for us, the Bible says that Jesus is now interceding with us for us through the Holy Spirit.
[time=2344] But we need to repent because in our impatience many times we don't want to wait for God's will to be done.
[time=2352] And we exchange the glory of God for something made of an image of an animal, sometimes a job, sometimes a family member.
[time=2364] Again, they exchange the glory of God for an image of an ox that eats grass.
[time=2369] In Romans 1 Paul puts it like this, "For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking and their foolish hearts were darkened, claiming to be wise they became fools." Verse 23, "And exchanged the glory."
[time=2390] And they exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images, remembering mortal men and birds and animals and creeping things.
[time=2398] Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie.
[time=2412] And worshiped the creature and serve the creature rather than the creator who is blessed forever.
[time=2422] So we have to stop and ask, "What is our golden calf?" What is something that you exchange for the glory of God and you cannot do without?
[time=2434] Is it sex, money, food, career, sports?
[time=2444] What idol do you need to shatter today in the dust?
[time=2449] To show that the dust of God is greater than your idol.
[time=2454] I cannot do it for you and you cannot do it for me.
[time=2458] And please understand, I'm not against sports.
[time=2462] I played tennis in high school and soccer in college.
[time=2467] I came this close to worshiping table tennis.
[time=2472] I came to the United States and I played tournaments.
[time=2475] But what happened, those tournaments were on Sunday, so I had to make a choice.
[time=2479] Am I going to go to church or am I going to go play tournaments?
[time=2482] Am I going to go to church?
[time=2485] I still play.
[time=2487] It's a beautiful table in my basement, but I don't worship it.
[time=2492] Because I have to make a decision.
[time=2495] Am I going to worship the true God or am I going to exchange the glory?
[time=2498] Now if you still want to play table tennis with me, I'll play.
[time=2502] In 11 years I've been at grace, I only lost once.
[time=2506] The tennis player numero uno, Daniel Sanchez.
[time=2511] It is Spanish.
[time=2513] He was from Venezuela.
[time=2515] I want you to watch this video clip.
[time=2518] When I lived in Birmingham, Alabama, I passed through a small church called Brook Highland Community Church.
[time=2523] This church was literally in the shadow of a big church called Brook Hills.
[time=2529] The pastor of that church was a guy by the name of David Platt.
[time=2534] Some of you know their name.
[time=2536] Sometimes people would drive into a driveway and say, "Hey, you're not David Platt." And this is not Brook Hills, and I said, "No, I'm not." So they went back and they went to the next driveway where his church was.
[time=2548] It's a very humbling experience, but it was good for me.
[time=2551] David Platt was a pastor in Birmingham, and if you know anything about Alabama, you know about Alabama versus Auburn.
[time=2561] And while David Platt was still pastor at that church, he was giving his congregation an illustration about idolatry.
[time=2570] And it's about six minutes long, but I want you to watch it because it's very, very close to our heart, especially since today is Super Bowl Sunday.
[time=2589] Imagine for a moment that you live in another country, one completely foreign to this one, and you have an opportunity one fall to spend a week in Birmingham.
[time=2599] So you come on a Sunday morning and you observe many people, maybe even most, slowly rising to make their way to a building they call a church.
[time=2608] They groggily approach that building for some sort of ceremony.
[time=2612] Clearly, whatever happens at the beginning of that ceremony is not that important because most of the people don't come until after it has started.
[time=2619] I'm not looking at anybody.
[time=2622] I'm just saying.
[time=2627] And so you watch them file in and begin to mouth the words to songs.
[time=2632] Many of them almost expressionless, virtually emotionless,
[time=2638] after which they sit down and passively listen to someone talk to them for a period of time.
[time=2643] You notice people starting to get a bit fidgety, uneven at the time for the ceremony to end approaches.
[time=2648] When it's finally over, they quickly walk out.
[time=2651] But as you walk with them, you listen to them and you hear many of them talking with one another about something that had happened the previous day.
[time=2659] They smile and they laugh as they recount another ceremony they'd been to, apparently a bit more interesting than this one.
[time=2667] A ceremony that happens apparently on Saturdays.
[time=2671] In fact, the rest of the week, that's almost all you hear people talking about, the coming Saturday ceremony.
[time=2676] Even the people who were at the Sunday ceremony are strangely silent about what they heard and sang about there.
[time=2682] But very enthusiastic about the Saturday that can't seem to get here soon enough.
[time=2687] So as your curiosity is peaked, you begin to eagerly anticipate the coming Saturday ceremony with them.
[time=2692] That Saturday comes.
[time=2694] You see people wake up and leave their houses dressed in some sort of outfit that they love to wear for these types of days.
[time=2700] Many of them drive out of the city, some an hour west, others a couple of hours south,
[time=2708] where they gather together on what they call hallowed grounds for the Saturday ceremony.
[time=2715] They get there early for this ceremony, way early, where they eat and drink and laugh and play,
[time=2722] not just with their family or with their friends, but with complete strangers.
[time=2725] You've never seen community like this, and when the time comes, they all, tens of thousands of them enter a shrine together.
[time=2734] You can't think of another word for it, where they raise their voices with passion to applaud some sort of assembly of children
[time=2743] they don't know playing a game on a field.
[time=2745] As that game begins, they shout and chant and sing until they virtually lose their voices.
[time=2754] With far more passion than the previous Sunday ceremony for sure.
[time=2758] People don't look at their watches at this ceremony, they're so engulfed in what they're seeing and experiencing.
[time=2763] They actually get excited when it goes into what they call overtime because going like long like this is a sign of a really exciting game.
[time=2770] And the fun doesn't end after the ceremony is over anyway.
[time=2774] When the boys that everybody has been cheering for win the game, the celebration has only begun.
[time=2779] And the amazing thing is that it's not just the people who are at the ceremony who are celebrating.
[time=2783] You come to find out that back in Birmingham, thousands and thousands of others who couldn't get here
[time=2789] stayed there to watch this game on what they call a TV, though many of them are large enough to be virtual movie screens.
[time=2796] They're actually designed that way to make the most of watching ceremonies like this.
[time=2802] And back in Birmingham, scores of people have circled up together around their screens to be a part of the ceremony from a distance.
[time=2808] Day two in their homes are jumping up and down and high-fiving each other celebrating the ceremony when it's over.
[time=2814] And then when it's all over, late in the evening, almost as if there's nothing to be prepared for the next day, they go to bed.
[time=2823] So let me ask you a question.
[time=2832] If you were that visitor from another country and you came to this city on a week during the fall, be honest.
[time=2840] Which would you identify as the religion that is most important to this people?
[time=2846] As the religion that most excites this people.
[time=2862] We live in a land where sports war for our attention and our affections and our devotion, our time, our money.
[time=2873] And it's not just college football, that's the glittering example.
[time=2877] Particularly as we entered in this fall, that's the timing even for this.
[time=2880] But it's professional sports as well, it's children sports, it's playing sports and watching sports and running our children all over the city and the state for the sake of sports.
[time=2888] Whether it's football or golf, basketball or baseball, soccer or crossfit, running or biking or swimming, gymnastics or cheer linear.
[time=2897] Any number of other athletic activities to which we devote so much of our lives and our family's lives to.
[time=2904] To this church in Birmingham, we are not too far removed from the church at Corinth.
[time=2912] We in a land covered with church buildings and filled with professing Christians are tempted every single week to commune with Christ on Sunday only to dine with idols every other day, particularly Saturday.
[time=2926] And we must consider how to flee idolatry and live every single moment in Birmingham, eating, drinking and even playing to the glory of God.
[time=2943] [APPLAUSE]
[time=2948] You can tell then why he had 3000 people, I had 50.
[time=2953] Alright.
[time=2955] Here's the bad news and here's the good news.
[time=2958] First Corinthians 6 starting in verse 9.
[time=2964] The Apostle Paul writes these words.
[time=2970] First, the bad news.
[time=2973] Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God?
[time=2978] Do not be deceived.
[time=2980] Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who practice homosexuality nor thieves nor greeting or drunkards nor revilers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=2996] That's bad news.
[time=2999] Compare that with the good news.
[time=3001] We've got to keep going.
[time=3002] Verse 11.
[time=3004] And such were some of you.
[time=3007] In other words, we're not here, perfect people sitting down, worshiping the true God, we are sinners saved by grace.
[time=3017] All of us according to the Bible are former idolaters, former sexually immoral, former adulterers, former men who practice homosexuality, former thieves, former greedy, former drunkards, former revilers, former swindlers, we're ex of those.
[time=3038] We used to be that.
[time=3041] But the good news is that we were washed. Look in verse 11 again, and such were some of you.
[time=3047] But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.
[time=3054] Isn't that good news?
[time=3055] That's good news.
[time=3057] And if you're here this morning and you're still in sin, the good news is that you can move from verses 9 and 10 to 11.
[time=3065] All you have to experience is the washing of the blood of Jesus Christ.
[time=3069] And he still forgives sins, but you've got to repent and you have a choice to make.
[time=3074] That's why it's for application this morning, two things.
[time=3078] First of all, choose life, worship God, worship the only true God.
[time=3083] In Deuteronomy 39, right before they go into the promised land, God says to them to Joshua, choose life.
[time=3090] Choose life.
[time=3092] Therefore fear the Lord and serve him in sincerity and faithfulness, Joshua writes in chapter 24.
[time=3100] Put away the gods that your father served beyond the river in Egypt and serve the Lord.
[time=3105] And if it is evil in your eyes to serve the Lord, choose this day whom you will serve.
[time=3110] Whether the gods of your father served in the region beyond the river or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell.
[time=3116] But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.
[time=3121] Choose life, worship God alone.
[time=3125] Let's commit ourselves this morning that we will worship God alone.
[time=3129] And we will say like the Gator song says, I'll worship only at the feet of Jesus.
[time=3138] Also choose life if you are a believer and you worship in God, be an intercessor.
[time=3144] There are so many people around us that need the salvation that comes only through Christ alone.
[time=3149] Like Moses, we need to learn how to intercede for them and pray for them.
[time=3154] I know from a human perspective, you might say, they're never going to become believers.
[time=3159] And I know that from a human perspective that might be the case, but God can change lives.
[time=3164] Go again to the list of 1 Corinthians 6, 9, 3, 11, and you see who God can change.
[time=3171] He can change everybody.
[time=3173] Choose life, worship God.
[time=3176] And choose life, be an intercessor.
[time=3179] Let's pray.
[time=3181] Dear Father, we thank You for sending Your Son Jesus Christ into the world to die for sinners such as us.
[time=3188] Thank You that we are not like we used to be.
[time=3194] I pray that You will teach us this morning to look in our hearts and to repent of any idolatry in our hearts.
[time=3205] I pray that You will teach us to shatter those idols in the dust.
[time=3209] To realize that the God who made the dust is greater.
[time=3214] You are greater.
[time=3216] Help us to show that in the way we speak, in the way we act, in the way we rejoice, in the way even we watch sports
[time=3223] or we play sports.
[time=3225] May you be our Lord and Savior.
[time=3228] And I will show a lost world that You are the true joy and the true satisfaction.
[time=3235] I pray that You will teach us what it means to pray for loved ones, for friends, for neighbors, for unsaved people.
[time=3242] In such a way that they will surrender their lives to You and that they will become worshippers of the true and only God.
[time=3250] In Christ's name I pray. Amen.
[time=3266] I went to visit the shrine of plenty, but found its stories all filled with dust.
[time=3289] And I bowed with altars of gold and silver.
[time=3300] But as I knelt there, they turned to rust.
[time=3311] So my worship only at the feet of Jesus is cup below my holy grail.
[time=3335] There'll be no other gods before Him.
[time=3347] Just Jesus only will never fail.
[time=3359] A call of fortune made me a pilgrim to journey to things promised heights.
[time=3383] But as I climb, the promise made it.
[time=3394] And when the blue lonely all through the night.
[time=3406] Our worship only at the feet of Jesus is cup below my holy grail.
[time=3429] There'll be no other gods before Him.
[time=3440] Just Jesus only will never fail.
[time=3453] Just desert dust and empty shadows.
[time=3464] All promises that turn to last.
[time=3476] The gods of earth fell and betrayed me.
[time=3488] You alone are truth in life.
[time=3499] So my worship only at the feet of Jesus is cup below my holy grail.
[time=3523] There'll be no other gods before Him.
[time=3534] Just Jesus only will never fail.
