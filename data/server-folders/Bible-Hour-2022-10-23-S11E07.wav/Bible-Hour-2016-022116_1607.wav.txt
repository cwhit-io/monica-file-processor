[time=61] Alright, alright, alright, take your place, be it wrong, but our praise arise, King of Kings, Holy God, as we sing, alright.

[time=103] Isaiah 60 says, "Arise, shine, your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you.
[time=111] For behold, darkness shall cover the earth and thick darkness the peoples, but the Lord will rise upon you, and his glory will be seen upon you,
[time=119] and the nations shall come to your light."
[time=123] [MUSIC]
[time=142] Be it wrong, on our praise arise, King of Kings, Holy God, as we sing, arise, take your place, be it wrong,
[time=162] hold our praise arise, King of Kings, Holy God, as we sing, arise.
[time=179] Arise, arise, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.

[time=243] [MUSIC]
[time=260] Once I was lost, one dream darkness, no life inside, no hope inside, when he called my name, and he healed my blindness, sent me a place, now I'm alive with.
[time=285] The break of your heart and stone, the break to wake my bones, the rage to not save my soul, the man who will let me go.
[time=301] And now my heart, so full of worship, I can't hold back, I can't contain it, for all he's done, Jesus my same new, I am amazed, and full of things for.
[time=325] The break of your heart and stone, the break to wake my bones, the rage to not save my soul, the man who will let me go.
[time=378] The break of my bones, the rage to not save my soul, the man who will let me go, the man who will let me go, the man who will let me go.
[time=397] The break of your heart and stone, the break to wake my bones, the rage to not save my soul, the man who will let me go.
[time=408] The break of my bones, the rage to not save my soul, the man who will let me go, the man who will let me go, the man who will let me go.
[time=434] Exodus reads, "Thus all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting was finished, and the people of Israel did according to all that the Lord had commanded Moses, so they did.
[time=445] Then they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent in all its utensils, its hooks, its frames, its bars, its pillars, and its bases.
[time=455] The covering of tanned ram skins and goat skins, and the veil of the screen, the arc of the testimony with its poles and the mercy seat, the table with all two utensils and the bread of its presence.
[time=467] The lamp stand of pure gold in its lamps with the lamp set in all two utensils, and the oil for the light, the golden altar, the anointing oil, and the fragrant incense, and the screen for the entrance of the tent.
[time=481] The bronze altar and its grating of bronze, its poles and all its utensils, the basin and its stand.
[time=489] The hangings of the court, its pillars and its bases, and the screen for the gate of the court, its utensils and its pegs, and all the utensils for the service of the tabernacle for the tent of meeting.
[time=502] The finally worked garments for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron, the priest, and the garments of his sons for their service as priests.
[time=512] According to all that the Lord had commanded Moses, so the people of Israel had done all the work.
[time=518] And Moses saw all the work, and behold, they had done it as the Lord had commanded, so had they done it, then Moses blessed them.
[time=527] Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.
[time=532] And Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud settled on it, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.
[time=540] Throughout all their journeys, whenever the cloud was taken up over the tabernacle, the people of Israel would set out.
[time=547] But if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not set out till the day that it was taken up.
[time=553] For the cloud of the Lord was on the tabernacle by day, and fire was in it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel throughout all their journeys.
[time=566] Good morning. Thank you, Tim, for the podium. Thank you, Darren, for leading us in worship through music.
[time=580] Where is Darren? Oh, hey, leave the jokes to the professionals, please.
[time=589] Wow. I would like to congratulate the Carolina Panthers for winning the Super Bowl.
[time=604] You know how they make those T-shirts and the caps?
[time=608] So there are actually T-shirts and caps that say North Carolina Super Bowl champs.
[time=616] But usually what happens, World Vision takes those and sends them to a third world country.
[time=622] So somewhere in the heart of Africa, the Panthers have won.
[time=629] Darren, that's the professional way of doing a joke.
[time=635] I apologize. It is Valentine's Day, so Darren, I love you.
[time=644] And if we break up in a couple of months, I just want to say it's not you, it's me.
[time=651] All right.
[time=653] Let's talk about the tabernacle.
[time=660] It's very interesting when we look in the book of Exodus that the Ten Commandments basically gets, I don't know, half a chapter or so,
[time=671] or a few verses, the place gets a couple of chapters.
[time=676] But the instructions for the tabernacle and then the tabernacle building, we get 13 chapters about the tabernacle,
[time=688] which means that this is a very, very important topic.
[time=693] The tabernacle represented the symbol of God's presence with his people.
[time=699] I want you to imagine that these, let's say, 2 million Jews came out of Egypt
[time=705] and they're walking towards the Promised Land.
[time=708] And God tells them and gives them directions to build a movable tent, a portable tent.
[time=717] And God is going to guide them to a pillar of cloud during the day and a pillar of fire during the night.
[time=728] And then imagine these people taking this movable tent and carrying it with them for 40 years.
[time=735] And it sometimes God says, stay here.
[time=738] And then he's going to say, pick up and go.
[time=742] We don't know how many times this happened.
[time=745] But basically, God wanted to differentiate himself from the false gods of the nations.
[time=751] You see, the false gods of the nations were associated with a parcel of land or with the sea.
[time=759] There was the goddess of the sea or the God who was over that territory or the God who was over that territory.
[time=765] And God wants to show his people that, look, I am present to whatever my people go.
[time=771] I am not contained to a piece of land, to a piece of real estate.
[time=776] Remember, God promised to them his presence, I am who I am.
[time=781] I will always be with you, no matter where you go.
[time=784] But also God wanted to be worshipped.
[time=788] This was a movable place of worship and a movable place of fellowship.
[time=794] Remember, God could not be contained in this tabernacle.
[time=798] You have the tabernacle here and we'll talk about it today.
[time=802] God could not be contained in it. This was the symbol of God's presence with these people.
[time=810] God could not be contained in here.
[time=813] Now, this is the tabernacle proper and we'll talk more about it.
[time=819] But it was part of an enclosure of a courtyard.
[time=822] There was a courtyard.
[time=824] And imagine that the Israelites had to take this down and set it up.
[time=829] Each time God said, get up and go.
[time=834] It was a courtyard and starting next week we'll talk about the altar where they were going to be the sacrifices.
[time=841] So starting next week, Rich and I will talk two Sundays about the different sacrifices they had to bring on the altar that was in the courtyard.
[time=852] And then there's the labor, you see the priest there, because the sacrifices are a messy affair, they have to wash themselves.
[time=860] So there's the labor with water.
[time=862] But then today we're going to talk about what's going on in the tabernacle, also known as the tent of the meeting.
[time=871] Now, this is a blueprint. For those of you who are architects, you'll appreciate this.
[time=876] This actually will be the blueprint for the temple that Solomon will build later on.
[time=882] The difference will be that the temple will be a little bigger and it will be permanent.
[time=887] But God is using this tabernacle as the blueprint for how the temple will look like later on.
[time=896] Again, for 40 years, the Israelites took this movable tent and moved it along as they were going towards the promised land.
[time=909] As we were looking here in the middle with the tabernacle, you'll see that it's made up of two enclosures.
[time=916] This place is called the holy place and this is called the holy of holies.
[time=920] Now, notice it's divided by a veil. This veil is a very important piece in the tabernacle and later in the temple.
[time=930] In the holy place, here we have three things, the table of show bread with twelve laws of bread, and we're going to talk about that in a second.
[time=939] The menorah, which is the golden lamp stand, it's called the menorah, some of you have them in your homes.
[time=947] And then the incense altar that would be placed right before you go into the holy of holies.
[time=953] Now, the holy of holies is interesting because the Hebrews, the Hebrew language doesn't have a superlative in that they don't have the word best.
[time=963] In English, you have good, better, best. In Hebrew, you can say good and better, but if you want to say best, you have to take the same word and repeat it.
[time=976] In the plural. So the most beautiful song is the song of songs. We have a book in the Bible like that.
[time=986] If you want to talk about the most exalted Lord, you say the Lord of Lords.
[time=991] If you want to talk about the most powerful king, you say the king of kings.
[time=997] So they couldn't say the best or the most holy place, so they say the holy of holies.
[time=1003] So we translate that in some versions, it's translated the most holy place.
[time=1008] And there we have a very important piece. We have the ark of the covenant right there.
[time=1016] So this morning, what I want to do is talk about the individual things that we have in the tabernacle.
[time=1022] And I want us to see how they point to Christ.
[time=1027] Because I want to make sure that from the beginning, we understand that this is not the church.
[time=1034] The building of the church does not replace the tabernacle.
[time=1038] In other words, here at church, we don't have a holy of holies. Some of you think this is the holy of holies and this is the holy place.
[time=1045] Nothing can be further from the truth.
[time=1048] Also, I want you to see that in the tabernacle, there are no chairs.
[time=1053] Are there chairs in our church here in the church building? The answer is yes.
[time=1058] And by the way, there's good reason for that, and I will explain shortly.
[time=1063] So let's look at each individual piece in the tabernacle.
[time=1068] First of all, we have the table for the bread of presents.
[time=1072] This is in some versions called the showbread.
[time=1077] The King James, I think, causes the showbread, S-H-E-U bread. I don't know what that means.
[time=1084] But the idea is that God said to Moses that on this table, which by the way was three feet by one foot six inches and two feet three inches high.
[time=1099] So it was not a big table.
[time=1101] On this table, God says, you shall put twelve loaves of bread representing the twelve tribes of Israel.
[time=1108] The lesson was very simple.
[time=1111] God is not just present with you all the time, but God is the provider.
[time=1116] God will provide for you as you go through the wilderness. Think about that.
[time=1121] They didn't have time to sow seed and harvest grain, right?
[time=1125] And yet God always provided for them so they could have bread in the holy place.
[time=1131] The lesson was very simple. God says to them, I will provide for you.
[time=1136] Not only that, there are twelve loaves of bread, meaning what?
[time=1140] All are welcome.
[time=1142] All twelve tribes of Israel are welcome.
[time=1145] Remember that later, as we are going to partake of the Lord's Supper, the message is the same.
[time=1150] I provide for you not just bread, but eternal bread, bread of life.
[time=1157] And not only that, not just some of you are welcome, all of you are welcome.
[time=1163] This is for everybody.
[time=1165] The lesson was very, very important. God is providing and all have room at the table.
[time=1172] By the way, the priests would eat the bread in the holy place.
[time=1178] As you will see later in history, you will see that the Levites don't get a piece of land so that they can work.
[time=1185] They live off the offerings and the gifts that the people bring to the tabernacle and later to the temple.
[time=1194] That actually stands at the basis of why a church pays its pastors.
[time=1201] I know some of you like that verse better that says that do not muzzle the ox.
[time=1207] By the way, that has the same principle in it.
[time=1212] The reason the church pays its pastors is because God always provided for the workers in these places to be taken care of by those who would come and bring the offerings.
[time=1225] The other thing that was in the holy place was the monora, or the golden lamp stand.
[time=1233] Notice it says seven branches and it's very ornate, but it's very practical.
[time=1242] Just like with the bread, which is very practical for the feeding of those who work there, the monora is very practical.
[time=1250] See, the tent didn't have windows.
[time=1253] The tent was a dark place, so you needed light.
[time=1256] And God says you shall build a seven branch, golden lamp stand, a candlestick.
[time=1263] Again, it is very highly decorative, but the most important thing is that it played a role to provide light.
[time=1271] The priests could not see in the holy place if they didn't have light.
[time=1276] So again, not as just a symbolic, but this is very practical. Everything that we see here in the tabernacle is not just practical, but it's also theological.
[time=1290] But it's not either, or it's both.
[time=1294] It's made of pure gold.
[time=1298] And one interesting thing is that the Bible doesn't specify dimensions, dimensions.
[time=1304] We're not told how big this should be.
[time=1308] So if you go to stores, and if you wear a monora, you'll find them in all different types and sizes.
[time=1315] If you go to Israel in Jerusalem, they have a huge one in the old city in Jerusalem.
[time=1323] Very, very important piece, very practical.
[time=1329] So you have, again, in the tabernacle, you have the table of showbread.
[time=1334] You have the monora that provides light, and then you have the incense altar.
[time=1338] Now, this is important. Why is it there? And why is it in that place?
[time=1343] Because you might say, well, why do we need an incense altar?
[time=1350] Well, this has to do with what's happening in here, because we will see later that in the holy of holies,
[time=1358] the priest goes in once a year with blood for himself and for the people, and he takes blood and sprinkles it on the mercy seat, on the cover of the Ark of the Covenant.
[time=1369] Now, I don't know how many of you have experienced this, but how does dry blood smell?
[time=1375] It ain't pretty, right? It doesn't smell good.
[time=1379] So this altar incense that's right before the Ark, right before you go into the holy of holies,
[time=1386] is the very important and practical reason to provide a pleasant aroma.
[time=1395] This, by the way, was fairly small, one foot and a half by one foot and a half and three feet high.
[time=1401] Notice, please, a lot of these will have these poles because they have to be carried, right?
[time=1407] This is a movable worship tent, fellowship tent.
[time=1412] So they have to carry it and go, so it's very practical.
[time=1415] They have poles, the Ark of the Covenant will also have these poles.
[time=1420] Turn prolongment again explains the idea of the sweet aroma.
[time=1425] He explains the purpose for the altar, and I quote, "The altar of incense had one very practical purpose.
[time=1431] With all the slaughtering of sacrifices and manipulation of blood, the order would have been overpowering without incense."
[time=1441] Very, very practical. So then we go into the holy of holies where we have the Ark of the Covenant.
[time=1449] Here's a better view of it.
[time=1452] The word "arc" literally means "box." Even from, it seems like, from the original Akkadian.
[time=1461] And it's also known as the Ark of the Lord.
[time=1465] It's known as the Ark of God and the Ark of the testimony.
[time=1470] Three feet, nine inches by two feet, three inches, and two feet, three inches high.
[time=1476] And God tells Moses, "You're going to take this Ark.
[time=1480] There's going to be two cherubim.
[time=1482] Those are cherubim. They're from the angelic realm.
[time=1487] Two angels, two cherubim on top.
[time=1490] And then inside you shall put a copy of the Ten Commandments, a bowl of mana.
[time=1497] And then Aaron's staff, that's about it. This is later in the book of Numbers.
[time=1502] God told Moses to take that staff, which is miraculous because it produces almonds,
[time=1511] even after it's taken from the source.
[time=1515] So he represents a miracle.
[time=1517] And God will say to Moses, "You take these three things, a copy of the Ten Commandments, a bowl of mana to be reminded of what God has done for you in the wilderness, to be provided for you bread, and a miracle in Aaron's staff that butted."
[time=1535] But the most important thing that would happen here, in the Holy of Holies, right here, in the Holy of Holies,
[time=1546] what would happen there once a year would be when the High Priest would go in
[time=1552] and take blood and sprinkle it on that cover.
[time=1555] So you are that cherubim, that's called the cover. Very important element.
[time=1560] Later in Greek you'll be translated as something like Hela Stereon, and you have to remember that. It's also translated as Mercy Seat, because the priesthood sprinkled blood to show that the sin of the people would be atoned for or covered by these sacrifices, again, but Rich and I will talk about for the next two weeks.
[time=1583] Very, very important element.
[time=1587] Forgiveness of sin was provided temporarily by this act of the High Priest who goes in
[time=1594] once a year to provide for the sin of himself and the whole nation.
[time=1603] But here in the Holy of Holies, something else happened.
[time=1608] You have heard it read in chapter 40, starting in verse 34.
[time=1613] Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.
[time=1620] Oh, that's, wouldn't you like to have been there to see that?
[time=1626] The tabernacle, when he was finished, it says here the glory of the Lord
[time=1632] filled the tabernacle, and Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the clouds settled on it, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.
[time=1644] So the word for the tabernacle is mishkan.
[time=1648] The idea to tabernacle or to dwell is called shakan.
[time=1652] That's why the glory of the Lord was later basically coined as the shakana glory.
[time=1661] You've heard of that, right? The shakana glory.
[time=1664] It comes from the root shakan, which means to dwell.
[time=1667] It comes from this idea that the visible glory of the Lord came and dwelled in this place.
[time=1674] Again, God was not contained in there because God is spirit, infinite and perfect, right?
[time=1680] But this was the visible representation of God with his people, when the glory of the Lord filled the temple.
[time=1688] Imagine what would happen if the glory of the Lord filled the temple right now visibly.
[time=1694] Would you like that?
[time=1696] Actually, it's happening and it's true right now as we speak.
[time=1701] The problem is you don't see it like they saw it, but we have something actually that they didn't have.
[time=1710] They had the presence of the Lord with them, and we have the presence of the Lord in us.
[time=1716] See, they lived the period of God with us.
[time=1720] Those people who lived during the time of Jesus, they lived in the period of God with us,
[time=1727] God for us, and now we live the God in us.
[time=1731] Through the Holy Spirit, we have something much more than they did.
[time=1735] And sometimes we say, "Oh, if we only lived back then, no." The good old days, neither that old nor that good.
[time=1744] We, by the fact that the Holy Spirit lives in us, we actually have experienced something much, much better
[time=1752] than the people in the Old Testament times have.
[time=1757] Actually, the Bible is very clear about that when it talks about Jesus.
[time=1762] Jesus comes to earth, and John writes about it in his gospel.
[time=1769] And he wants to show how God sent his son to dwell among us.
[time=1775] And he doesn't have a word, a strong enough word, so John makes up a word.
[time=1782] You know, Bible writers can do that.
[time=1784] Paul did it, John did it.
[time=1787] So John makes up a word here that was not used before in the Greek.
[time=1792] He says, "And the word became flesh and tabernacle among us."
[time=1799] Oh, for a Jewish person listening to this, they immediately say, "Oh, oh wait.
[time=1806] God who told us to be a tabernacle, which was just a blueprint for the temple, which was temporary,
[time=1813] now is actually tabernacleing with us through the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1819] So whatever happened before was not a good old days." No, no, no, no.
[time=1824] Now we live the days with Jesus tabernacles with us.
[time=1830] And John knows this.
[time=1833] And he says at the beginning, in the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God.
[time=1838] But he gets here and says, "And the word Jesus became flesh and tabernacle among us, and we have seen his what?"
[time=1848] Oh, you mean, this is better than the Shekinah glory?
[time=1852] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[time=1854] Now we have seen the glory in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1858] So stop bewailing the good old days and you want to live during the time of Moses.
[time=1863] No, this is the time when it's even better because we have seen the glory, the glorious of the only son from the Father,
[time=1872] full of grace and truth.
[time=1876] So the tabernacle points to Jesus the Messiah.
[time=1880] All throughout his ministry, Jesus, basically what Jesus does, he takes apart the ministry of the tabernacle, he takes apart the ministry of the temple to say, "You don't need that anymore. I am the answer for what you need." And Jesus is very clear, and the New Testament writers are very clear about that.
[time=1901] Listen to what Paul writes to the Colossians talking about Jesus.
[time=1905] "For in Jesus in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell,
[time=1912] and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross." And then in Colossians 2 9 and 10, "For in him in Jesus the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily,
[time=1929] and you have been filled in him who is the head of all rule and authority."
[time=1935] Those are the days.
[time=1938] And what we need is not a physical place where we need to bring sacrifices.
[time=1944] What we need is Jesus.
[time=1946] And Jesus is enough, and he makes that clear when he tells the people,
[time=1953] "I am the bread of life." Remember the table of show bread, the bread that was in the tabernacle
[time=1962] was shown that God provided for his people.
[time=1966] And that all are welcome at the table.
[time=1970] And Jesus again takes apart the ministry of the tabernacle.
[time=1973] He takes apart the ministry of the temple when he says, "I am the bread of life.
[time=1978] Whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst.
[time=1983] I am the only bread you need." You've got to stop doing all this ritual and write thinking that if you do all these things, you will be saved.
[time=1992] Jesus says, "All you need is me.
[time=1995] I am the bread of life." If you are in me, you have eternal life.
[time=2001] It's interesting that when Jesus is born, he is born in Bethlehem, the house of bread.
[time=2009] The house of bread is born, the bread of life is born in the house of bread, to provide bread.
[time=2018] Not for a little bit, not just for the twelve tribes of Israel, but for all.
[time=2026] Again, when we sit, when we come to the table today, remember, all are welcome.
[time=2032] All who are in Jesus are welcome to partake of this because Jesus is the bread of life.
[time=2039] Not only that, but Jesus in his argument to the Pharisees.
[time=2043] And the Sadducees in John 8 says, "I am the light of the world."
[time=2050] See, the light you had in the tabernacle, and the light you had in the temple was temporary.
[time=2057] It was temporary, and you know, that light can be extinguished.
[time=2063] But if I am the light of the world, and if you have me, that's all you need.
[time=2070] Whoever follows me will not work in darkness, but will have the light of life.
[time=2076] So the point is not for us to take a diapernacle, build a replica, and come here and worship God.
[time=2082] No, no, no.
[time=2083] The point of this tabernacle, and later the temple is to show us that Jesus is the fulfillment of everything that happened in that tabernacle,
[time=2091] and we don't need to bring those sacrifices anymore because Jesus did it all for us, and all we need is Jesus.
[time=2101] But Jesus uses his disciples.
[time=2104] Jesus wants to use us too.
[time=2107] See, in the New Testament, the Bible doesn't say that Jesus is the pleasing aroma.
[time=2112] But here's what he says.
[time=2115] The Apostle Paul, speaking about the believers, says that we are the aroma of Christ, to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing.
[time=2130] Ah, Jesus saves us for a purpose, not just to be the light of the world and the salt of the world, but to be a pleasing aroma.
[time=2145] Just like I said, that dry blood stings, sin also stings.
[time=2155] And we are asked to live in a sinful world.
[time=2162] And if you think about it from a spiritual perspective, we live in a very stinky, stinky world.
[time=2171] And what God says is, when you accept Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, you become a sweet pleasing aroma to those around you.
[time=2181] And that's how we should be.
[time=2184] Not the type that blinds people or stings people in the eyes.
[time=2192] That's not the kind of followers Jesus wants.
[time=2195] He wants the sweet pleasing aroma that will attract people to himself.
[time=2204] But the most important thing that we have in that tabernacle is the Ark of the Covenant.
[time=2212] And in the Book of Hebrews, we are told clearly that the sacrifices they were brought, again they will talk about the next two Sundays.
[time=2222] And the sacrifice that the High Priest would go in during Yom Kippur, during the Devatonement, to sprinkle blood on the mercy seat on that cover.
[time=2232] That provided forgiveness for the people for one year.
[time=2236] Now let me ask you, if you sinned the day after the day of atonement, think about that.
[time=2244] You would have to live with your sin for another year.
[time=2248] Have you ever lived with sin, unconfessed sin on you?
[time=2252] It's a burden.
[time=2253] If Jesus Christ is not a Lord and Savior, you're living with it right now.
[time=2257] And it's a burden.
[time=2259] It weighs hard on you.
[time=2264] Jesus comes and becomes the sacrifice once and for all.
[time=2269] Listen to what the Book of Hebrews writes.
[time=2270] But when Christ appeared as the High Priest of the good things that have come, then entered, then through the greater and more perfect tent, not made with hands.
[time=2279] That is not of this creation.
[time=2281] He entered once for all into the holy places, not by means of the blood of goats and calves, but by means of his own blood, thus securing not salvation for one year, but eternal redemption.
[time=2296] Isn't that beautiful?
[time=2298] That's why you don't need to go bring sacrifices anymore, because Jesus became the sacrifice once and for all.
[time=2306] That's why you can sing, "Mary had a little..." What?
[time=2311] Lamb.
[time=2312] And that's why there's not a second verse, and Mary had to bring the Lamb to be sacrificed on Sunday morning.
[time=2319] Think about that next time you sing that song.
[time=2321] The reason there's no second verse for that is because Jesus became the sacrifice once and for all.
[time=2328] And you don't have to come Sunday morning with your Lamb, and you don't have to sacrifice it for your sin, because Jesus, the Lamb of God, will sacrifice once and for all.
[time=2338] Actually, the New Testament writers used that term about the mercy seat.
[time=2344] Remember, I told you, it's translated to Hila Esterion in Greek. That's how the Apostle Paul talks about that when he talks about Jesus.
[time=2354] In Romans chapter 3, he talks about how Jesus, how Jesus is the one who was mercy-seated, sacrificed for our atonement.
[time=2369] First John 4-10, John writes in his love. Not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and he sent his son to be propitiation for our sins.
[time=2382] That word "propitiation" comes from the Hila Esterion idea.
[time=2386] God made him mercy-seated for us. He sacrificed him for us.
[time=2393] There's a beautiful parable that Jesus tells in Luke chapter 18.
[time=2399] And there's a beautiful expression there when the tax collector prays, "God, be merciful to me a sinner." You know that story, right?
[time=2408] Jesus tells them this parable.
[time=2411] To some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and treated others with contempt.
[time=2418] Two men went up to the temple to pray. One a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
[time=2423] The Pharisee standing by himself prayed, "Does God, I thank you that I'm not like other men, extortioners, unjust adulterers, or even like this tax collector?"
[time=2434] I fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I get.
[time=2437] But the tax collector standing far off would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast saying, "God, have mercy on me a sinner.
[time=2447] God, be merciful to me a sinner." I tell you, Jesus says, "This man went down to his house justified rather than the other.
[time=2456] For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but one who humbles himself will be exalted."
[time=2463] That expression, "God, have mercy on me a sinner." That actually literally sounds something like this.
[time=2470] God, be mercy seated to me a sinner. God, treat me like you treated the mercy seat right there in the ark of the covenant.
[time=2481] That's how you should treat me. Have mercy on me a sinner. God, treat me on the basis of the blood sprinkled on the mercy seat.
[time=2490] And when we pray to God, that's how we need to be prayed. That's why we pray and we end our prayer with in Jesus' name.
[time=2497] What that means is that I pray not because of what I have done, but I appeal to what God has done in the person and work of Jesus Christ,
[time=2505] and that's why I can end the prayer within Jesus' name.
[time=2509] I don't pray, listen to me, God, hear me because I deserve it.
[time=2515] Hear me based on the mercy seat sacrifice of Jesus Christ.
[time=2524] I'm going to close. I just want to make one more point here.
[time=2530] After the author of Hebrews in chapter 10 writes, "By this and by that we have been sanctified through the offering of the blood of Jesus Christ once for all,
[time=2542] and every priest stands daily at his service offering repeatedly the same sacrifices which can never take away sins.
[time=2550] But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, what did he do? He sat down."
[time=2560] Oh, it's beautiful. Hebrews chapter 10 verse 12.
[time=2566] If you still think you can earn your salvation, if you can do enough good works to be saved, read Hebrews 10-12
[time=2573] when it says that after Jesus offered himself the sacrifice one of the same for all, he sat down.
[time=2581] That's why on the cross he says it is what? Finished.
[time=2585] The sacrifice of Jesus Christ brings salvation to an end.
[time=2590] The death and resurrection of Jesus Christ completed the sacrificial system, and after he became sacrifice and for all Jesus sits down.
[time=2599] Look in the tabernacle. There are no chairs in the tabernacle.
[time=2602] Why? Because they had to do work all the time, all the time, all the time.
[time=2607] But Jesus completes the sacrifice, completes our salvation, and then he sits down.
[time=2614] And unfortunately a lot of us are still walking around.
[time=2618] Are still trying to flex our spiritual muscles. Are still trying to work for our salvation.
[time=2624] If I can just do this, I'll become saved. If I can just do this, I'll become saved.
[time=2628] And Jesus comes and says, "No, it is finished." Not only that, I sat down.
[time=2634] And what you need to be is be in me, be in Christ, have Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior,
[time=2640] and stop working out for your salvation.
[time=2644] Your salvation has been completed in the working person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2648] Put your trust in Jesus. That's the application for today.
[time=2658] Sit down in Jesus Christ. Stop trying to earn your salvation.
[time=2666] Rest in his finished work, and practically for us who are now followers of Jesus Christ,
[time=2672] to put it in present day, quotidian English. Don't be a stinker.
[time=2680] Is that a word? Is that a word?
[time=2683] What I mean is be a sweet, pleasant aroma to a lost world around us.
[time=2689] We live in a stinky world, the stinks of sin and death.
[time=2694] And God is calling us to be the sweet, pleasing aroma to the people around us.
[time=2702] Which means that we have to speak the truth in love.
[time=2711] When you look at the tabernacle, it's a great picture of what Jesus would accomplish.
[time=2717] It is not for the purposes of us replicating it and trying to do what they did.
[time=2724] Jesus said it is finished.
[time=2728] So you can go home and relax and rest because the work of salvation has been done.
[time=2736] And while you do that, be a pleasing aroma to those around you.
[time=2741] As you go to eat at restaurants, whatever you do, don't create a scene.
[time=2749] Don't be the kind of smell that pokes you in the eye and makes you cry.
[time=2757] Be the pleasing aroma.
[time=2759] The people who look at you and say, "Man, those guys smell good." Not literally necessarily, although I'm not against those things.
[time=2769] But figuratively speaking, let's pray.
[time=2774] Dear Father, we thank You for sending Your Son Jesus Christ into the world to save sinners such as I.
[time=2782] We come before You thinking of that in Jesus Christ.
[time=2786] You have fulfilled all the work that was initiated in the tabernacle and later the temple.
[time=2792] Thank You for sending Jesus Christ into the world to be the sacrifice ones for all, to be the bread of life, to be the light of the world.
[time=2804] I pray that as believers, we will rest in that truth.
[time=2809] And as believers will go out here to be that pleasing sweet aroma,
[time=2815] they will bring some to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[time=2819] Forgive us for the many times when we were rude and obnoxious.
[time=2825] Forgive us for the times when we spoke the truth, but there was no love.
[time=2832] Teach us what it means to love like You loved and to speak the truth in love.
[time=2838] Fill us with Your Holy Spirit so we can indeed be the pleasing aroma to this death and dying world. In Christ name I pray. Amen.
