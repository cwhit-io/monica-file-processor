[time=2900] If it's unintentional, I didn't know it. Well, if you remember last week, Pastor Tiberius said, the Old Testament is God before us. When Jesus comes back, or when Jesus comes to earth, it's God with us. After the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit was given as a gift, that now becomes God in us. And that's the age that we live in. We have the Holy Spirit in us as Christians. And the Holy Spirit prompts us when we are confronted with
[time=2929] sin situation. You know this. He prompts us to make a decision of obedience. They didn't have the Holy Spirit in them, so they would commit sin. And they had to do a required to do a sin offering to appease or into pay the penalty for that sin. Let's take a look at the purpose. The method. The method, and this is really interesting. If it was the high priest, now remember it said mandatory.
[time=2957] That means everybody had to do it. Even the priests and the high priests, they had to do this. If it was a high priest, it had to be a bull without blemish. If it was a priest of the congregation, it had to be a bull without blemish. A ruler, a king, somebody in charge, I mean leadership, then it had to be a male goat without blemish. A commoner, that's me, commoner, that would be a female goat or a lamb without blemish, and then you've got your poverty cases.
[time=2984] Very specific, very specific. God's portion, he got all the fatty portions, all the good fat burned on the altar, the inner parts, the end trails. If you don't know what end trails are, that's kind of like intestines and that kind of stuff. Okay.
[time=3002] The priest, if it was atonement for the priest himself, or whether it was the high priest or another priest, if it was atonement, they got nothing. It doesn't make sense, right? The offer doesn't get anything there. Okay, but if it was offered for everybody else, for anyone else, then the priest got to have that food, all the remainder.
[time=3030] Once again, the offer, they get nothing, but the atonement for sin, and that's the big thing, but the atonement for sin.
[time=3039] The last offering we'll talk about today is the trespass offering. The trespass offering, we'll find that in Leviticus chapter 5. The purpose was once again mandatory atonement for unintentional sin requiring restitution.
[time=3052] There was a restitution piece attached to trespass offerings. Maybe you killed somebody's goat, or you stole something. There would be a restitution offering there.
[time=3063] And the method, and this is where it varies, not varies, but varies from the previous ones, this had to be a ram, which was a male sheep who had not been castrated. Since it had not been castrated, that sheep was valuable because it could reproduce.
[time=3081] Okay, very valuable animal. They had to sacrifice that. They would bring the ram to the tent. The priest would evaluate what the value of that ram was, and then they would add 20% to it, because that was the penalty for restitution.
[time=3098] And that's what the offer had to give. Same thing for offense against a person.
[time=3108] Once again, God's portion, he got the fatty portions of the ram. The priest got all the remainder of it and had to be inside the tabernacle. And the offer got nothing.
[time=3118] Those are our sacrifices that lead us in Leviticus. And what's really cool to me as I was studying for this was God starts out Leviticus.
[time=3131] He's setting up the plan for living for the nation of Israel. And the first thing he does is he gives them the plan for restitution, the plan for atoning sin, the plan for reestablishing that relationship between God and man.
[time=3148] That's the first thing, because God loves you. Sin separates. God doesn't like that. God hates that. If you are a parent and you have a child and that child is disobedient, there's that moment of time where there's that relational violation.
[time=3171] You're like, "Why did you disobey me?" And then there's some form of restitution, maybe some form of forgiveness, or you give forgiveness, or they ask for forgiveness, or they come up, I'm sorry.
[time=3184] And then that re-establishes that relationship. And that's a beautiful time, right? That's a beautiful time. You know, kids, you make mistakes. Parents know that.
[time=3196] But you know what parents love? When you come up voluntarily, the three voluntary offerings, you come up and say, "Dad, I messed up. I shouldn't have done that. I am so sorry. Would you please forgive me?"
[time=3211] There is a very little more warming than that between a parent and a child. You're like, "Man, you're good. You're good." Okay? And God wants that voluntary sacrifice on our part, every day.
[time=3228] Don't make it be a forced thing. I mean, really, we've all done this, right? You go someplace and a little kid's there and he kicks the other girl and say, "Now, you tell her you're sorry." Really?
[time=3242] There's no, there's no contrition there. That's a forced thing. God wants you to voluntarily come before him with your sacrifices.
[time=3252] Jesus Christ was our perfect sacrifice. I'm going to try to bridge a connection between these five offerings and Jesus Christ. First of all, for the burnt offering, Christ provided atonement for our sins.
[time=3267] The burnt offering was about atonement. Christ provided the atonement for our sins. The grain offering was about being devoted to God. Jesus Christ was completely devoted to God.
[time=3281] Jesus was God, God the Son. Jesus was devoted to God to the point of death on a cross. The night before Jesus was crucified in the Garden of Gethsemane, he was down, he was praying.
[time=3292] He says, "Father, if there is a way that this cup can pass me for me." I mean, if we can do this another way, I'm in.
[time=3300] But God said, "No, this is how it's going to happen." And Jesus' response was, "Nevertheless, not my will, but thy will be done."
[time=3308] That's how devoted Jesus Christ was. Peace offering. Jesus was always at peace and in perfect fellowship harmony with the Lord. Until He went on the cross.
[time=3319] Until we get to Matthew, chapter 27, verse 46, about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, "Ili, Ili, lama, sabaktani, my God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
[time=3331] Jesus had never experienced being forsaken by the Lord. Jesus had never experienced God turning His face because they were in perfect harmony at all times.
[time=3343] What caused that? Was it anything Jesus had done? No. Nothing Jesus had done.
[time=3353] You know what caused that? God forsaking Jesus on the cross was my sin and your sin. That's what caused it.
[time=3365] The sin offering, Jesus was a guilt substitute. When we were guilty of sin, we are the ones that committed the sin.
[time=3372] We are the ones that chose to be disobedient to the Lord. We chose that. I chose that. You chose that. We chose that.
[time=3382] Instead of us getting that penalty, instead of us being that animal that walks into the temple and is up on the altar, instead of that being us, Jesus said, "No, you stay back. I got this one."
[time=3395] That's just about breaks my heart. That just about breaks my heart. Trust pass offering. Jesus paid it all for our redemption and to heal the damage of our sin.
[time=3410] To heal the damage of our sin. That's the Jesus we serve. That's the Jesus Christ we commit our lives to.
[time=3422] That's why we are Christians. We are Christ-like. We are like Him. That's who we are. That's who He is.
[time=3432] And here's the thing. I don't have to bring a bowl to the temple. Put my hands on it and sacrifice them and go through all of that.
[time=3441] Because Jesus paid that penalty. First John 1-9 says this, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just. Forgive our sins. And it cleanses us from all our righteousness."
[time=3454] My act just confessed my sins. Proclaim Jesus Christ as Lord.
[time=3459] Lessons for life. You have a free will. I ask you voluntarily, purposefully and sacrificially choose obedience. God hates sin. God hates disobedience. God loves obedience.
[time=3479] Choose that voluntarily. I used to tell my children, either you humble yourself before the Lord or He'll do it for you.
[time=3490] Voluntarily choose obedience. With your freedom, choose to turn away from the works of the flesh in Galatians 5-19.
[time=3504] Works of flesh are adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envy, murder, drunkenness, revelries and the like.
[time=3523] Voluntarily turn away from that. And voluntarily with freedom, number 3 with freedom, choose to embrace the fruit of the Spirit.
[time=3535] Fruit of the Spirit's love, joy, peace, long suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control, against such there is no law.
[time=3545] Voluntarily embrace the fruit of the Spirit. Today we've been all about redemption. I really appreciated the song you guys sang earlier, Flawless.
[time=3560] But matter what it is, God makes you flawless through the cross of Christ.
