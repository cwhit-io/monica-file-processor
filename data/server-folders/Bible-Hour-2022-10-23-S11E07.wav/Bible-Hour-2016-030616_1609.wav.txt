[time=598] The Lord spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron when they drew near before the Lord and died. And the Lord said to Moses, "Tell Aaron your brother not to come at any time into the holy place inside the veil before the mercy seat that is on the ark so that he may not die."
[time=617] For I will appear in the cloud over the mercy seat. Aaron shall offer the bull as a sin offering for himself and make full atonement for himself and for his house. Then he shall take the two goats and set them before the Lord at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
[time=640] And Aaron shall cast lots over the two goats, one lot for the Lord and the other lot for Azazel. And Aaron shall present the goat on which the lot fell for the Lord and use it as a sin offering. But the goat on which the lot fell for Azazel shall be presented alive before the Lord to make atonement over it, that it may be sent away into the wilderness to Azazel.
[time=669] And when he has made an end of atoning for the holy place and the tent of meeting and the altar, he shall present the live goat.
[time=681] And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the iniquities of the people of Israel and all their transgressions and all of their sins.
[time=696] And he shall put them on the head of the goat and send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man who is in readiness.
[time=705] The goat shall bear all their iniquities on itself to a remote area and he shall let the goat go free in the wilderness.
[time=717] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. Do not be led away by diverse and strange teachings, for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by foods which have not benefited those devoted to them.
[time=734] We have an altar from which those who serve the tent have no right to eat. For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned outside the camp.
[time=749] So Jesus also suffered outside the gate in order to sanctify the people through his own blood. Therefore let us go to him outside the camp and bear the reproach he endured.
[time=763] For here we have no lasting city but we seek the city that is to come. Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God.
[time=776] That is the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name. Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have for such sacrifices are pleasing to God.
[time=792] Good morning. Please open your Bibles to the Book of Leviticus. Thank you all for allowing us to worship this morning through word and through music.
[time=809] The Book of Leviticus is a difficult book, isn't it? If you're like me and you start in January with your Bible reading plan, you're like a sailboat with wind in the sails that everything is great, right?
[time=826] And you get to Leviticus and your ship is dashed against the rocks of Leviticus. I'm hoping to change that this morning.
[time=840] And to see what the Bible says, that all Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction and for training in righteousness. Amen? That means even the Book of Leviticus.
[time=859] One of my favorite movies of all time is Forrest Gump. And he says in that movie all of a sudden, one day for no particular reason, I decided to go for a little run. Remember that? So I ran to the end of the road.
[time=878] And when I got there, I thought maybe I ran to the end of the town. And when I got there, I thought I'd just run across Greenbow County. And since I ran this far, maybe I'll just run across the great state of Alabama.
[time=895] And that's what I did. And he continues and the movie says that he ran for, remember how long? For over three years. He just ran. And all of a sudden, one time, he just stops and says, "I'm tired. I think I'll go home now."
[time=913] I want to suggest that sometimes in our Bible reading plans, we are sometimes like Forrest Gump and we run, and all of a sudden we stop. And we have no idea why.
[time=927] And again, sometimes it's because of passages like this, or it's because of passages like I've been pointing out this morning, both Kevin and there, and are very happy this morning that they are in the Bible.
[time=939] Leviticus 13, verse 40, apparently it's their life verse. When a man, if a man's hair falls out from his head, he is bald. He is clean.
[time=957] So those of you who are bald this morning, there's a verse in the Bible for you.
[time=966] Last week, Rich introduced the book of Leviticus, and he did a wonderful job. He covered five chapters. I never could do that, by the way. So thank you for being so good at synthesizing the data.
[time=981] But this morning I want to give you a big picture of the book, continue what Rich started, and then show how the book of Leviticus points to the person and work of Jesus Christ.
[time=993] Because if we read Leviticus and we do not jump and see the importance of the New Testament teaching, we have failed in our endeavor.
[time=1003] First of all, I want us to see that the Old Testament now teaches doctrine.
[time=1009] Then the first thing we learn about the Old Testament, God, is that God is holy, and he wants his people to be holy.
[time=1018] For I am the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God, you shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.
[time=1027] By the way, that's also true in the New Testament. Because you can say, "Oh, that's the Old Testament, Tiberius." No, no, no, that exact verse is repeated in the Old Testament in 1 Peter.
[time=1038] Peter actually quotes from Leviticus and quotes the same thing.
[time=1043] Jesus actually said, "Be holy, be therefore perfect, for I am perfect." How can that be?
[time=1050] We need to understand what holiness is. First of all, there are two words that describe God's holiness.
[time=1056] God's holiness is transcendental, and God's holiness is ethical.
[time=1062] There are no lines to fill in your outline for this, but if you want to write them down, there's God's holiness is transcendental, and God's holiness is ethical.
[time=1073] God's holiness is transcendental in the sense that God is different than us. He is beyond us.
[time=1080] He transcends time and space. God is not bound by time and space like we are.
[time=1087] So from that perspective, He is beyond us. Now, we can never be that, right?
[time=1094] But we get the idea of being set apart from that idea, that God wanted not just Him to... He was holy, but He wanted His people to be holy as well, meaning to be different, to be set apart than the other nations.
[time=1110] You see, the other nations were pagan nations that did all types of things.
[time=1117] And God says you should not be like that, you should be different. You should be set apart.
[time=1124] But also God's holiness is ethical. God is sinless. God cannot sin.
[time=1130] And when He wants us to be like that, He also says you are to be holy from that perspective, set apart, but how can we be set apart?
[time=1138] How can we be holy when we know we still have the sin nature? How can we do that?
[time=1144] And the answer, again, is in the person and work of Jesus Christ, and I'll explain as I go through the message.
[time=1151] But I want you to imagine the nation of Israel coming out of Egypt, a pagan nation.
[time=1158] Remember, they learned a lot of bad things from them, even how to worship a golden calf.
[time=1163] And they're going to enter the land of Canaan, another pagan nation. And God says when you get there, don't be like them.
[time=1170] And this is what you should do, you should be holy.
[time=1174] For example, the other nations practice child sacrifice. And God says you should not do that.
[time=1181] The other nations practice carving things on their skin for different reasons.
[time=1189] To mourn for the dead, they would tattoo stuff on their skin to remember and to mourn for the dead.
[time=1195] Actually, some thought that if you cut yourself, your blood will be transferred to the blood of the dead, so they can live in the afterlife.
[time=1204] And God says you should not do that. Be different, don't be like the nations.
[time=1212] The other nations practice homosexuality, incest and bestiality, having sex with animals.
[time=1221] And God in the law says you shall not do that.
[time=1225] You shall be different than the other nations. I want you to be holy just like I am holy.
[time=1232] God is holy and he wants his people to be holy. The Old Testament law teaches doctrine.
[time=1241] Not just that God is holy, but God is personal and wants a personal relationship with his people.
[time=1247] From the beginning God wanted to have a relationship with Adam and Eve and to live in a perfect fellowship with them, right?
[time=1254] But they decided to go against that. But God from the beginning wanted to have a relationship with us.
[time=1259] "I will walk among you and will be your God and you shall be my people."
[time=1265] This is actually called the covenant formula. It appears in God's covenant with Abraham, in God's covenant with Moses.
[time=1272] And later, even in the new covenant, we are under the new covenant.
[time=1277] And in the promise of the new covenant, God promises the same thing.
[time=1280] A relationship with us because that's what he wanted from the beginning.
[time=1284] All these little laws and regulations have to do with a relationship.
[time=1289] Some people say, "Don't give me any rules or regulations, just give me a relationship with Jesus."
[time=1295] Really? There is no such thing. It's like being married and saying to your wife, "Yeah, we just want to love each other, be married, but don't give me any rules."
[time=1304] There's no such thing. Part of a relationship is that you do have rules that you have to abide by.
[time=1311] It's called this thing of being in a relationship. You have to have certain boundaries.
[time=1317] And God wants to be in a relationship with his people, but he says, "You have to abide by these rules that I am giving you."
[time=1326] God is personal, and he wants to be in a personal relationship with us.
[time=1332] Not only that, but God is gracious and forgives sin.
[time=1337] And again, last week, Rich explains so beautifully about how the sin offering was mandatory.
[time=1342] You didn't have an option if you sinned, "Ah, I'm not going to go this time. I'm not going to do this sacrifice." No, no, no, no. The sinned sacrifice was mandatory.
[time=1350] You sinned, you had to bring a reparation offering, a sin offering for your sin.
[time=1358] Notice all the verses I put there. And by the way, that's not a comprehensive list from Leviticus.
[time=1363] But the priests shall make atonement for the sin, and they shall be forgiven.
[time=1370] See, when people think about Leviticus, they only think about, "Oh, God is the law giver. I'm just going to skip Leviticus."
[time=1377] We can't do that. Because in Leviticus, God is not just holy. He's also gracious.
[time=1384] And we need to understand that who this God is, and that the God of the Old Testament is not different than the God of the New Testament.
[time=1392] Jesus Christ is the same. Yesterday, today, and forever.
[time=1399] The Old Testament teaches doctrine.
[time=1403] Some people are afraid of this word, and they don't even use it in teaching and preaching.
[time=1410] One of my favorite evangelical writers is J.I. Packer, and he writes this, "Doctoral preaching certainly bores the hypocrites.
[time=1420] But it is only doctrinal preaching that will save Christ's sheep.
[time=1424] The preacher's job is to proclaim the faith not to provide entertainment for unbelievers.
[time=1429] In other words, to feed the sheep rather than amuse the goats."
[time=1436] My prayer is that Black Hawk will always have doctrinal preaching here.
[time=1444] Don't bring an entertainer, bring a preacher of God's word. Ask not how many jokes he knows, or how many Forrest Gump movies like he watched.
[time=1458] But ease he when he's needs in prayer for you and for this community.
[time=1465] If you enter to tainment, watch Brian Regan, watch Jim Gaffigan, or other comedians.
[time=1472] But if you're on the word of God preached, bring a man who will preach doctrinally.
[time=1477] And who will not avoid books like Leviticus and Zephaniah and Nahum?
[time=1484] Yes, those are books in the Bible.
[time=1487] But it is probably very likely you never heard a sermon on Zephaniah, or Nahum, or Obadiah.
[time=1495] But that's why I love this gospel project, because it takes us through the whole Bible.
[time=1502] It takes us through the whole Bible, and it teaches us who God is.
[time=1506] And the Bible teaches us that God is holy, and he wants us to be holy.
[time=1513] God is a personal God, and he wants to be in a personal relationship with us, and God is gracious and forgives our sin.
[time=1519] But the Old Testament also instructs in righteousness. It is very practical.
[time=1524] Love your neighbor, Leviticus 1918, you shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against the sons of your own people,
[time=1531] but you shall love your neighbor as yourself.
[time=1533] I am the Lord.
[time=1535] Remember what I said, the law of God is both revelatory and regulatory.
[time=1541] The law is revelatory in that it teaches us who God is, holy, righteous, just, gracious, personal, right?
[time=1550] But he also teaches us what to do every day, and he teaches us to love our neighbor.
[time=1554] This is not a New Testament teaching.
[time=1558] Some people will say, "Well, that's in the New Testament." No, no, no.
[time=1561] It's in the Old Testament.
[time=1562] You shall love your neighbor as yourself, and notice, please, the motivation.
[time=1566] I am the Lord. It doesn't say, "Love your neighbor," because it makes you feel good.
[time=1572] It doesn't say, "Love your neighbor," because it's somewhat people recommend, "Love your neighbor," because of who God is.
[time=1578] I am Yahweh.
[time=1580] I am the Lord.
[time=1581] That's why this motivation to love our neighbors goes on forever and ever, because of who God is, and he's forever.
[time=1588] And he's the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[time=1594] That should be our motivation.
[time=1597] Now, in my state, Tiberius, it's still complicated.
[time=1602] And I can tell you, like Forrest Gump, that I am a simple man.
[time=1606] I am not a smart man.
[time=1609] I practice my Southern accent, and I wanted to tell you in Alabama accent, I am not a smart man.
[time=1616] But I practiced it in the car, and my family said, "Don't do it."
[time=1622] So I'm not even going to attempt it, but I'm going to quote and say that I am not a smart man.
[time=1629] And in order to understand the law, I propose this division of the law.
[time=1636] The law can be divided into three parts.
[time=1638] By the way, these are not three equal parts.
[time=1640] I'm just giving you this to kind of prove a point.
[time=1644] The best way to understand the Old Testament law, and how it relates to us as Christians today, is to understand that the law is made up of ceremonial, civil, and moral laws.
[time=1656] By the way, I didn't come up with this division.
[time=1659] The 4th century African theologian Augustine said it.
[time=1664] Thomas Aquinas, the 13th century Catholic theologian, picked it up.
[time=1669] And even John Calvin, the reformer, says in his institutes and I quote,
[time=1675] "We must attend to the well division which distributes the whole law of God as promulgated by Moses into the moral, ceremonial, and judicial or civil law."
[time=1689] I did not come up with this, but I really think that in order to understand the law, the Old Testament law and how it pertains to us today, we need to understand this division.
[time=1698] And I want to show how Jesus fulfilled these laws.
[time=1704] First of all, I want us to understand that Jesus fulfilled and did away with the ceremonial law, as we have read in the book of Hebrews.
[time=1717] See, it says in the book of Hebrews that Jesus appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
[time=1728] Hebrews 10 and by that will we have sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for all.
[time=1736] That's why when you come to church Sunday morning, you don't have to bring your little lamb to sacrifice.
[time=1742] Because Jesus is the sacrifice once and for all, and when we say that Jesus fulfilled this ceremonial law, he fulfilled it and did away with it.
[time=1752] You don't have to bring those sacrifices anymore or to even count what's the sin offering, what's the reparation offering, what is the peace offering.
[time=1760] You don't even have to worry about those things because in Jesus, those were fulfilled.
[time=1766] And now if you are in Jesus, then you are okay.
[time=1771] But that's why you have to be in Christ.
[time=1774] And that's why the Apostle Paul says it over and over again.
[time=1777] You are in Christ.
[time=1781] Look back to Leviticus 16.
[time=1783] Leviticus 16 was the most holy day for the Jewish people because he was the day of atonement, Yom Kippur.
[time=1791] The day of atonement, when the priest, the high priesthood entered the holy of holies once, as we have read this morning.
[time=1805] In the day of atonement, there were two goats involved in the sacrifice.
[time=1810] Look at with me in verse 6.
[time=1812] Aaron shall offer the bull as a sin offering for himself and shall make atonement for himself or his house.
[time=1818] Then he shall take two goats, and this is very important right here.
[time=1823] And set them before the Lord at the entrance of the 10th of meeting.
[time=1826] And Aaron shall cast lots over the two goats, one lot for the Lord and the other lot for Azazel.
[time=1832] Now that translation Azazel in the NIV in the New American Standard is a scapegoat, which I think is the better translation in this case.
[time=1844] One of the few times when the NIV is better than the ESV.
[time=1848] But I think it's here.
[time=1850] Very important.
[time=1852] Remember, there's two goats.
[time=1853] One will be sacrificed and one will be the scapegoat.
[time=1856] And Aaron shall cast lots over the two goats, and Aaron shall present the goat on which the lot fell for the Lord and use it as a sin offering.
[time=1863] So one goat was sacrificed.
[time=1865] Remember that.
[time=1866] And that was the sacrifice for sin of the people.
[time=1869] And on the other goat was supposed to be a scapegoat.
[time=1875] So the Bible says here that the high priest would take blood and sprinkle it on the scapegoat and send the goat into the wilderness to represent that the sin left the camp.
[time=1888] Makes sense, right?
[time=1890] So one goat for the sacrifice and one goat as a scapegoat to symbolize the exiting of the sin from the camp.
[time=1899] Now imagine that you're in the wilderness, right?
[time=1901] You're walking along and you're sending the goat out of the camp.
[time=1908] What do you think the goat would do?
[time=1911] Come back right in the camp.
[time=1913] So they have to take the goat again.
[time=1916] The goat would come back again.
[time=1918] Now when they got to Jerusalem, they solved the problem.
[time=1921] When they got to Jerusalem, Jerusalem is on hills, on little mountains.
[time=1927] So what they would do with the goat, when they got to Jerusalem, they would take it outside the city gate and throw it off the cliff.
[time=1935] And the goat never came back again.
[time=1939] Now before you called Peter on me, I want you to remember that when we talk about the New Testament.
[time=1946] I want you to think about that.
[time=1949] Keep that in mind when we talk about Jesus later on.
[time=1953] But in this day of atonement, sacrifices would be brought for not just himself, the high priest, but for the entire nation.
[time=1963] And they would celebrate the day of atonement, when their sin would be atoned for, covered for a period of time.
[time=1974] Jesus fulfilled and did away with this law.
[time=1978] That's why we don't have to bring these sacrifices over and over again because Jesus became the sacrifice for us and for all.
[time=1985] And he is the sacrifice through which we have atonement and forgiveness of sin.
[time=1993] Jesus fulfilled and did away with the ceremonial law also when he has to do with foods.
[time=2000] Because in the Old Testament it said, you shall not eat pork because the pork was unclean, an unclean animal.
[time=2009] You shall not eat shrimp because it was unclean.
[time=2017] Then how come we eat these foods?
[time=2021] We as Christians can eat these foods.
[time=2023] The answer is in what Jesus says in the Gospel and how later it is described throughout the New Testament.
[time=2031] You see, Jesus is in conversation with the religious leaders of the day.
[time=2037] And the Pharisees and the Sadducees cared about the Mosaic law.
[time=2041] And they were asking, "How come you are not keeping all these dietary laws?" And Jesus is telling them, "Look guys, you are worshiping God with your lips, but your heart is far away from me.
[time=2052] You have missed the point." Mark 7, I'm going to start in verse 14.
[time=2059] And he called the people to him again and said to them, "Hear me all of you and understand there is nothing outside the person that by going into him can defile him,
[time=2067] but the things that come out of the person are not what defile him." And when he entered the house and left the people, his disciples asked him about the parable and he said to them,
[time=2078] "Then are you also without understanding?
[time=2081] Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him, since he enters not his heart but his stomach and is expelled?"
[time=2090] Then he declared all foods clean.
[time=2094] And he said, "What comes out of a person is what defiles him.
[time=2099] From within out of the heart of man come evil talks, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, covering, wickedness, deceit, sensuality,
[time=2110] envy, slander, pride, foolishness, and all evil things come from within and defile a person."
[time=2118] So what we as New Testament Christians need to worry about is not if you need shrimp and bacon,
[time=2124] but how are we doing with our thoughts and our wickedness and our sensuality?
[time=2130] What are we doing with those things?
[time=2133] Because if all we do is keep all these external laws, we're nothing but Pharisees and Sadducees.
[time=2138] And Jesus says, "If your righteousness does not exceed the righteousness of the Pharisees and Sadducees, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven."
[time=2148] So if you go out today, you have my permission to have shrimp and bacon.
[time=2155] Isn't that beautiful?
[time=2157] Bacon.
[time=2158] Nature's candy.
[time=2160] That's why we don't keep the ceremonial law.
[time=2169] Being under the new covenant means that we don't keep the ceremonial law, the sacrifices or the food laws,
[time=2176] because Jesus took away all those once and for all through His sacrifice.
[time=2181] The second law was the civil or the judicial law.
[time=2186] These laws had to do with how to run your nation.
[time=2190] Remember Israel, last week, Israel lived in slavery for 400 years.
[time=2197] They didn't know how to run a country, and God gives them laws to how to run a country.
[time=2203] And part of that gives them even this law, for example, for those of you who are into agriculture.
[time=2210] For six years you shall sow your field, and for six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in its fruits.
[time=2216] But in the seventh year, there shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for the land and a Sabbath to the Lord.
[time=2223] You shall not sow your field or prune your vineyard.
[time=2226] Do you follow that, Rick?
[time=2229] No, see, some of you are farmers and you don't follow that.
[time=2234] Why? Because that is part of the civil, part of the judicial law, and it doesn't count for you today, or for me today.
[time=2244] Jesus fulfilled the law in being the sacrifice once and for all.
[time=2250] So when you think about those things and how they run their country, it is very important, but listen to what Jesus says.
[time=2258] Jesus teaches, rendered to Caesar, the things that are Caesar's, and to God, the things that are God's.
[time=2266] In other words, by the time Jesus comes, there's a Roman government in place.
[time=2271] It's a pagan government.
[time=2273] It actually will kill Jesus.
[time=2277] It will kill Christians, and Jesus says, "Give Caesar what is Caesar's?"
[time=2286] The apostle Paul says, "Let every person be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except from God.
[time=2296] And those that exist have been instituted by God, therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who will resist will incur judgment."
[time=2308] Wow.
[time=2310] See, I came from a country where the government was corrupt.
[time=2317] I came from a country where the government told us there is no God, but enough about the United States of America.
[time=2327] Oh, yes, I'm far away from the truth, right?
[time=2331] No, I came from Romania where that's what we were taught in schools, and yet these verses were for me too in Romania.
[time=2339] I had to be submissive to the authority of a communist government.
[time=2348] Wow.
[time=2349] That law is still in place.
[time=2354] But the most important law that we need to talk about is the moral law.
[time=2359] Jesus fulfilled the moral law, but notice I didn't say Jesus fulfilled and did away with the moral law.
[time=2366] Because when we say that Jesus fulfilled the moral law, we mean that he is the only one who kept its righteous demands.
[time=2374] Jesus is the only sinless person that lived a holy life and kept all the commandments.
[time=2382] For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are yet without sin.
[time=2394] And we need to listen to the words of Jesus on the Sermon on the Mount that says very clearly, "Do nothing that I came to abolish the law or the prophets." I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them.
[time=2409] And that's exactly what he did.
[time=2412] He fulfilled the prophecies.
[time=2415] He fulfilled the law, and he kept the law, yet without sin.
[time=2423] You see, since we have a sin nature, the moral law is still needed to suppress unrighteousness and ungodly behavior.
[time=2433] Here's the most important thing we need to learn this morning.
[time=2436] Freedom from the Mosaic law doesn't mean freedom from righteous living.
[time=2441] Because that's how some people say it.
[time=2443] "Oh, we're not under the law anymore. We're under grace so we can do whatever we want." That is not biblical.
[time=2450] To be under grace, remember Jesus raises the bar.
[time=2454] You heard that he was said, "Thou shalt not commit adultery," right?
[time=2457] That was the minimum requirement.
[time=2459] But I tell you, even if you look lustfully at a woman, you committed sin in your heart.
[time=2465] Jesus doesn't know where the bar, he raises the bar.
[time=2469] Take a look at this chart. This is a very important chart.
[time=2473] I want you to see that the 10 Commandments, which are part of this moral law,
[time=2480] these 10 Commandments are referred to in Exodus chapter 21st and then later in the astronomy chapter 5.
[time=2487] But notice, please, that the people of Israel knew that those, they were supposed to do those things before the law was given, seeing the column called pre-Mosaic evidence.
[time=2497] And all the 10 Commandments are referred to before the law was given, and all the 10 Commandments are referred to in the New Testament.
[time=2506] In other words, when Jesus says what he says, he doesn't say, "Okay, now you can do whatever you want."
[time=2514] No, no. Jesus raises the bar.
[time=2519] In other words, if you look at the second commandment, for example, they knew they were not supposed to build a graven image, right?
[time=2529] Exodus 32, remember, they built the golden calf.
[time=2533] They knew that before the law was given, and they knew that even before, even before that, in Genesis 31.
[time=2541] And that's repeated in 1 John 5, 21.
[time=2544] Little children, keep yourselves from idols. That's it.
[time=2548] That's how John finishes his letter. Little children, keep yourselves from idols.
[time=2553] What are you talking about?
[time=2554] There's still that danger of idolatry in the first century after Jesus dies on the cross for our sins, and the answer is yes.
[time=2563] Okay, how about the fifth commandment?
[time=2567] Okay, obeying your parents is only in the law, but in the New Testament it's okay not to obey and honor your parents, right?
[time=2573] No, no, no, no, no.
[time=2576] In other words, if your parents are asking you to do something and it is not against the will of God, the law of God, the word of God, you shall do that.
[time=2595] You shall obey your parents, and it's the same with murder, adultery, theft, full sweetness, covering.
[time=2601] It doesn't say that, okay, adultery was wrong or in the Old Testament, you know, now in the New Testament it's okay.
[time=2607] Is that true? No, no, no, no, no. Jesus raises the bar.
[time=2612] It goes with the same four things like incest and homosexuality.
[time=2617] This is one that liberal scholars like to point to all the time.
[time=2622] And they say, oh yeah, the commandment against homosexuality in Leviticus, it's on the same page that talks about that you shall not mix things in your clothing.
[time=2630] You know, cotton and polyester or whatever.
[time=2635] Okay, but what do you do then with Romans chapter one?
[time=2639] In Romans chapter one it is very clear that this law, that's part of the moral law, is still around.
[time=2648] So please make sure when you talk to these people to read everything in context, and this is in Romans chapter one.
[time=2657] For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and righteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.
[time=2665] For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.
[time=2670] For his invisible attributes, namely his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived ever since the creation of the world in the things that have been made.
[time=2679] So they are without excuse, for although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking.
[time=2689] Their foolish hearts were darkened, claiming to be wise they became fools, and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal men and birds and animals and reptiles.
[time=2700] Therefore God gave them up in the loss of their hearts to impurity and to dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped the creature rather than the creator who is blessed forever, amen.
[time=2716] For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions.
[time=2722] For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature, and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing a shameless act with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.
[time=2738] But listen to the list, it doesn't stop there.
[time=2741] And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to debase mine to do what are not to be done.
[time=2748] They were filled with all evil, all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice.
[time=2754] They are full of envy, murders, strife, deceit, maliciousness.
[time=2758] They are gossips, slanders, haters of God, insolent, hearty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.
[time=2768] So if we go through the list, we got to go through the whole list, right?
[time=2773] We got to go through the whole list.
[time=2776] So Jesus tells us very clearly that he did away with a ceremonial civic or judicial law, but the moral law is still around.
[time=2788] What God wanted to teach them and who God wants to teach us is obedience and knowledge of him.
[time=2794] Look in 1 Samuel, after Saul sins.
[time=2799] Samuel said, "Has the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices in obeying the voice of the Lord?
[time=2806] Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice and to listen than the ram of fat, than the fat of rams."
[time=2816] Think about that.
[time=2818] Those people who don't believe that you can break the law into moral, ceremonial, or civil, God says here, through Samuel,
[time=2829] by the time that Samuel is alive, which is about 400 years after Moses, that even God differentiates between the moral and the ceremonial law.
[time=2841] In other words, you can bring all the sacrifices you want, but if you don't know God,
[time=2847] and if you don't obey him, it equals to nothing.
[time=2854] It equals to nothing.
[time=2856] What God wants is obedience and knowledge of him.
[time=2861] For I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice.
[time=2864] This is God speaking through Hosea, the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.
[time=2871] As we sing this morning about God, you are a good, good Father, and I am loved by you.
[time=2880] But that means what?
[time=2882] We need to know this Father, and we need to know who he is, and that's why we need to read even the book of Leviticus.
[time=2890] That teaches us that he's a holy God and wants us to be in a relationship with him.
[time=2896] Okay, I have 15 seconds for the last four slides, so here we go.
[time=2903] My dear brothers and sisters, our day of atonement is good Friday.
[time=2911] Anybody know how many days till good Friday?
[time=2914] Does anybody keep track?
[time=2916] You know how we keep track of how many days till Christmas?
[time=2919] We should keep track of how many days till good Friday, 25 days.
[time=2924] Till we celebrate what Jesus Christ has done for us.
[time=2928] That he died on the cross for my sin and for yours, and that's our day of atonement.
[time=2935] And if you are in Christ, you are free and you are holy because when God looks at you, he doesn't see your sin.
[time=2943] He sees you because Jesus Christ took away your sin.
[time=2946] This is how I can explain it.
[time=2949] Suppose that this book represents, in this book, again, don't think that it's a Bible,
[time=2955] but let's say it's a book that contains all the sins you've ever committed in your life.
[time=2959] I know it's kind of thin, but let's just assume.
[time=2962] Assume that all your sins are recording in this book right here.
[time=2966] I want you to imagine that my right hand represents you.
[time=2969] The Bible says that our sin puts a wall of partition between us and God.
[time=2976] There is a division between us and God because of our sin.
[time=2979] So when God looks at us, he sees our sin, right?
[time=2982] But let my left hand represent Jesus Christ.
[time=2985] And I say it says, "All we like sheep have gone astray, but God laid on him, the iniquity of us all."
[time=2993] So what's between us and God now?
[time=2997] Nothing.
[time=2998] So we can be holy because of when God looks at me, he doesn't see my sin because my sin is upon Jesus Christ.
[time=3005] That's why the Bible says he became sin for me and for you.
[time=3010] So now we can indeed be holy for he is holy.
[time=3014] And we are holy not because of what we do, but we are holy because of what Jesus Christ has done for us.
[time=3021] That's good news.
[time=3025] And the Lamb of God who took away the sin of the world is none other than Jesus Christ.
[time=3030] So basically how Jesus fulfills Yom Kippur, or the Deol Matonement, in that he is the sacrifice, both that sacrificed on Yom Kippur.
[time=3039] Remember on Yom Kippur, there were two sacrifices, remember that?
[time=3042] The sacrifice, the goat that was sacrificed, and the goat that was sent into the wilderness, remember?
[time=3048] And when they got to Jerusalem, they threw it off the cliff.
[time=3052] Here's what the Bible says about when Jesus was crucified.
[time=3057] He suffered where?
[time=3059] Downtown?
[time=3060] No.
[time=3061] Outside the city?
[time=3063] Gate!
[time=3064] That's a direct reference to the day of atonement to Yom Kippur, to make sure that the Jews understood that Jesus is the fulfillment of Yom Kippur of the day of atonement.
[time=3075] And Jesus is not just the sacrifice.
[time=3077] Jesus is the scapegoat that takes away the sin of the world.
[time=3082] Outside the city gate.
[time=3085] It's very important, very important detail, because Jesus is our sacrifice.
[time=3094] Jesus fulfills Yom Kippur.
[time=3098] Jesus is all we need.
[time=3100] So as we apply the truth, if Jesus Christ is now your Lord and Savior,
[time=3108] all I can say is to ask you to accept the forgiveness that comes to Christ alone.
[time=3114] You cannot save yourself.
[time=3116] Even if you try to keep all the laws and the commandments, you cannot save yourself.
[time=3120] The only person who can save you is Jesus Christ.
[time=3125] Like Forrest Gump said, "I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is."
[time=3134] "I'm not a smart man, but I know that's love." When Jesus dies on the cross for my sin, that's love.
[time=3144] And God loves you so much that He sent His only Son.
[time=3149] That whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.
[time=3156] And for those of us who are believers, seek to live a holy life pointing others to Christ.
[time=3162] Purge your life of anything unholy.
[time=3165] It might be thoughts, it might be words, it might be actions.
[time=3169] Enough with the excuses, enough with the finger pointing.
[time=3173] Choose to live a holy life.
[time=3175] The Holy Spirit lives in you, and He's going to help you do that.
[time=3181] The Holy Spirit who lives in you helps you do that.
[time=3186] We sang this morning and made this be our prayer.
[time=3189] So what can I say, what can I do, but offer my life completely to you?
[time=3199] Let's pray.
[time=3200] Dear Father, we thank you for revealing yourself to us in your word.
[time=3207] In Genesis, in Exodus, in Leviticus, in Zephaniah, in Matthew, in Romans, in Hebrews.
[time=3218] I pray for this church that it will be a church that will love you, love your people, live
[time=3228] the people of this community, and will always be a Bible believing Bible preaching church.
[time=3235] Pray they will make them and keep them to be a light in this dark world.
[time=3240] Many people come to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ as a result of their ministry.
[time=3245] And as we go out from here, give us wisdom, fill us with your Holy Spirit to say no to sin,
[time=3251] and to live holy lives pleasing to you, thanking you that that's only possible because of what Jesus Christ has done.
[time=3258] In His name I pray.
[time=3260] [AMEN]
