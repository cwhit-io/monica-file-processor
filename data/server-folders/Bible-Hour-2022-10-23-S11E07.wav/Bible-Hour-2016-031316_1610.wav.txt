[time=0] You
[time=30] [MUSIC - 1837 seconds]
[time=1871] or the second maybe more accurately said the retelling of the law. But it is very simply broken into three parts. The past
[time=1881] the future and the present. And then it ends with Moses's death which is probably recorded by Joshua. But we start through the past.
[time=1893] And the first lesson is that Yahweh has been faithful even when his people have been unfaithful and rebellious.
[time=1901] The history of Israel has been a history of rebellion.
[time=1905] And God reminds them of his faithfulness
[time=1911] despite of their unfaithfulness.
[time=1915] From the day you came out of the land of Egypt until you came to this place
[time=1921] you have been rebellious against the Lord God tells them.
[time=1925] Even though you have been unfaithful God says I have been faithful to you.
[time=1931] Remember the promise given to Abraham in Genesis 22.
[time=1935] I will surely bless you and I will surely multiply Ralph Spring as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore.
[time=1943] And now in Dutronomy 110 we see that God kept his promise.
[time=1947] The Lord your God Yahweh your God has multiplied you and behold you are today as numerous as the stars of heaven.
[time=1957] We see what God has done in the past should serve as a motivation and what we are doing for him in the present and in the future.
[time=1965] What God has done for us should serve as motivation.
[time=1969] And God who has and has always been faithful.
[time=1974] God was faithful in keeping his promises and God was faithful in providing for them.
[time=1981] The Lord your God Yahweh your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands.
[time=1987] He knows you are going through this great wilderness.
[time=1991] These 40 years the Lord your God has been with you you have lacked nothing.
[time=1996] Can you say that?
[time=1999] Can you look back at your life and say Tiberius I look back at my life and I can tell you from a spiritual perspective from all perspectives God has always been with me.
[time=2010] I can.
[time=2014] Can you say that God has always been faithful even when I was unfaithful?
[time=2018] Can you say that?
[time=2020] I can and we should.
[time=2023] There is a time when we need to sit down and remember what God has done for us in the past.
[time=2028] We need to do that but we cannot live in the past.
[time=2032] Some of us think about the good old days right?
[time=2036] Which are neither that good nor that old.
[time=2041] But sometimes we live like that and we cannot live like that.
[time=2046] But we need to learn from the past.
[time=2049] The people who don't learn from history are doomed to what?
[time=2053] To repeat it.
[time=2056] I'm not talking about the U.S. as a nation.
[time=2060] I'm talking about us as a church.
[time=2063] We need to learn from the past and we to think thank God for his faithfulness for us over the years.
[time=2070] But we cannot live in the past.
[time=2074] But we need to stop and think and thank God for what he has done.
[time=2079] There is an old song that I hope you know that I want us to sing together that talks about this.
[time=2086] It's called, "When upon life's billows you are tempted, tossed.
[time=2091] When you are discouraged thinking all is lost, count your many blessings.
[time=2099] Name them one by one and it will surprise you what the Lord has done." Really, we should not be surprised.
[time=2108] But if we are, it's okay.
[time=2115] Let's sing together.
[time=2118] "When upon life's billows we are tempted, tossed.
[time=2123] When you are discouraged thinking all is lost, count your many blessings.
[time=2130] Name them one by one and it will surprise you what the Lord has done.
[time=2138] Count your many blessings and one by one, count your blessings.
[time=2144] See what God has done, count your blessings.
[time=2150] Name them one by one, count your many blessings.
[time=2155] See what God has done.
[time=2159] When you look at others with their lands and gold, think that Christ has promised you his wealth and talk.
[time=2169] Count your many blessings, money cannot buy.
[time=2174] You're rewarding heaven in your world, own high.
[time=2179] Count your blessings, name them one by one, count your blessings.
[time=2185] See what God has done, count your blessings, name them one by one.
[time=2193] Count your many blessings, see what God has done.
[time=2200] So amid the conflict, whether great or small, do not be discouraged.
[time=2207] God is over all.
[time=2210] Count your many blessings angels will attend.
[time=2215] Help and comfort give you to the journeys then.
[time=2220] Count your blessings, name them one by one.
[time=2225] Count your blessings, see what God has done.
[time=2230] Count your blessings, name them one by one.
[time=2236] Count your many blessings, see what God has done.
[time=2244] [AMEN]
[time=2251] Thank you, thank you very much.
[time=2255] The past should lead us to serve God in the future.
[time=2262] The next lesson that we learn is that Yahweh extends the covenant promises and obligations to the new generation.
[time=2271] The new generation doesn't get a new God, a new set of laws.
[time=2276] It's the same God that reveals himself and that asks his people to follow him.
[time=2282] That's why in Deuteronomy 5 you actually have the Ten Commandments repeated.
[time=2288] Some people are asking why the Ten Commandments again?
[time=2291] Again, the reason is because this is for the new generation.
[time=2295] They weren't there when Exodus 20 was given.
[time=2298] The law was given in Exodus 20. This is a new generation.
[time=2301] And if you look in Deuteronomy 5, you have the Ten Commandments again.
[time=2306] Starting in verse 6, "I am the Lord your God.
[time=2308] You shall have no other gods before me.
[time=2310] You shall not make for yourself a current image." So forth and so on.
[time=2315] And we get to verses 32 and 33.
[time=2322] "You shall be careful therefore to do as the Lord your God has commanded you.
[time=2326] You shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
[time=2330] You shall walk in all the way that the Lord your God has commanded you.
[time=2334] Then you may live.
[time=2336] Then you may go well with you and then you may live long in the land that you possess.
[time=2342] And then we have in chapter 6, really the heart of the whole book.
[time=2347] You know this as the Shama.
[time=2350] See those two words, "Hero Israel" in Hebrew is "Shama Israel" is the Shama.
[time=2357] That you hear the Jews saying all the time.
[time=2360] "Hero Israel the Lord our God the Lord is one." They almost say that like an incantation.
[time=2367] But we have here the heart or the essence of the law.
[time=2372] This is the commandment, the statues and the rules that the Lord your God has commanded me to teach you.
[time=2379] Then you may do them in the land to which you are going over to possess it.
[time=2384] Then you may fear the Lord your God, you and your son and your son son, by keeping all his statues and his commandments, which I commend you all the days of your life and that your days may be long.
[time=2395] And now, "Hero Israel the Lord our God the Lord is one." You shall love the Lord your God who told your heart, with all your soul, with all your might.
[time=2406] And these are the words that I commend you today that shall be on your heart.
[time=2410] So what's the essence of the law was God after?
[time=2414] The heart.
[time=2417] From the beginning, please understand God was after their heart.
[time=2422] God wanted to teach them obedience.
[time=2426] And the essence of the law is a changed heart.
[time=2432] A changed heart.
[time=2435] You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart.
[time=2440] For them it was more than the center of emotion.
[time=2445] The heart for the Jews was the center of their life.
[time=2449] The mind and the soul and the intellectual ability and the emotions, everything evolved in the heart.
[time=2457] That's their center.
[time=2460] And God says that's the essence.
[time=2463] You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind.
[time=2472] The past is the motivator to hear and to listen and to obey God in the future.
[time=2478] But what about today? What about the present?
[time=2480] See, the new generation has to make a decision.
[time=2484] The new generation must choose, this is verse chapter 29 through 32, but we'll focus on chapter 30.
[time=2492] Notice, please, the key choices here.
[time=2496] Life or death, there is no middle ground.
[time=2500] You can't say, yeah, I'm going to follow God sometimes and sometimes I won't know.
[time=2505] The choices between life and death, there is no middle ground.
[time=2509] Starting in verse 15 in chapter 30, God says, I have said before you today, life and good, death and evil.
[time=2519] If you obey the commandments of the Lord your God that I commend you today by loving the Lord your God, by walking in his ways and by keeping his commandments and his statues and his rules, then you shall live and multiply and the Lord your God will bless you in the land that you are entering to take possession of it.
[time=2535] But if your heart turns away and you will not hear but are drawn away to worship other gods and serve them,
[time=2545] I declare to you today that you shall surely perish.
[time=2549] You shall not live long in the land that you are going over the Jordan to enter and possess.
[time=2554] I call heaven and earth. This is the verse on the screen.
[time=2558] I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that I have said before you life and death, blessing and curse.
[time=2565] Therefore choose life.
[time=2568] That you and your offspring may live, loving the Lord your God, obeying his voice and holding fast to him
[time=2575] for he is your life and length of days that you may dwell in the land that the Lord sought to your fathers to Abraham,
[time=2582] to Isaac and to Jacob to give them.
[time=2588] If you forget everything I say today, remember those two words, choose life.
[time=2595] Most of the people in this world will choose death.
[time=2599] Most of the people in this world will choose to disobey God and live a life apart from him.
[time=2606] You have a choice. Choose life. Follow God, obey him.
[time=2613] And again the essence of the law is a changed heart.
[time=2618] Again starting in verse 16 of chapter 10.
[time=2622] Circumcised therefore the foreskin of your heart.
[time=2627] See they are used to circumcise their flesh but God says I am after your heart.
[time=2636] The circumcision of the flesh was just a step to get to your heart.
[time=2643] Starting in verse 12 of the economy 10.
[time=2647] Now Israel what does the Lord your God require of you but to fear the Lord your God and to walk in all his ways to love him,
[time=2654] to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and to keep the commandments and the statues of the Lord which I am commanding you today for your good.
[time=2663] Behold to the Lord your God belong heaven and the heaven of heavens and earth with all that is in it.
[time=2669] Yet the Lord said he sought in love on your fathers and chose their offspring after them.
[time=2675] You above all peoples as you are this day circumcised therefore the foreskin of your heart.
[time=2681] This is in verse 16.
[time=2683] And be no longer stubborn for the Lord your God is the God of gods and Lord of lords, the great the mighty and the awesome God who is not partial and takes no bribe.
[time=2694] He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow and loves the sojourner giving him food and clothing.
[time=2700] Therefore you love the sojourner therefore for you because why you were sojourners in the land of Egypt.
[time=2708] You shall fear the Lord your God, you shall serve him and hold fast to him and by his name you shall swear.
[time=2716] He is your praise, he is your God who has done for you these great and terrifying things that your eyes have seen.
[time=2725] So let's ask this morning my dear brothers and sisters as a matter of application how is our heart?
[time=2733] Are we stubborn or has our heart been circumcised?
[time=2741] See the apostle Paul writes in Romans to those who were putting their faith in their fleshly circumcision.
[time=2747] He says for circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law.
[time=2752] But if you break the law your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.
[time=2756] So if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision,
[time=2764] then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law.
[time=2773] For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly nor is circumcision outward and physical but a Jew is one inwardly and circumcision is a matter of the heart.
[time=2786] By the spirit not by the letter his praise is not from man but from God.
[time=2793] See when you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior he gives you the Holy Spirit and it is because of this Holy Spirit that we can now keep his laws and commandments.
[time=2802] Apart from the Holy Spirit we cannot do that and apart from the Holy Spirit nobody is part of the new covenant community.
[time=2809] That's why God speaks to Ezekiel and tells him and tells all of us that God's specialty is cardiology.
[time=2819] He specializes in matters of the heart and he says in Ezekiel 36 starting in verse 26 I will give you a new heart and a new spirit I will put within you and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.
[time=2836] And I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statues and be careful to obey my rules.
[time=2844] You shall dwell in the land that I gave your forefathers and you shall be my people and I will be your God.
[time=2851] Again as a matter of application as we look on these verses how stubborn are we?
[time=2858] Do we need a heart transplant? God says I can give you a new heart.
[time=2864] How are we doing with loving the souljourner in our midst?
[time=2870] I am a souljourner, came to the United States when I was 15 from communist Romania and America has welcomed me and I am grateful.
[time=2882] And because of that I want to do the same with the souljourner in the land today.
[time=2889] How are we doing with the souljourner in the land today?
[time=2895] How are we doing with fearing the Lord and how are we doing with serving him?
[time=2901] Statistics show that in a church 20% of the people do 80% of the work.
[time=2909] Have you heard that before?
[time=2912] Let me tell you again, these are statistics, it doesn't mean it's true for this church but they say that 20% of the people do 80% of the work.
[time=2926] That should not be.
[time=2928] The goal for Blackhawk should be 100% of the people should do 100% of the work.
[time=2937] So let me ask you, how are you involved in ministries here at Blackhawk?
[time=2944] Or is your ministry just to come here, sit for an hour and then go home?
[time=2948] That's not ministry.
[time=2951] While we meet here, there are men and women who serve our children from nursery to whatever age.
[time=2964] Do you think you can do something like that?
[time=2967] You might say, I don't have the gift of teaching, preaching, singing, none of that.
[time=2972] Hey, can you hold a baby?
[time=2977] If I can do it, you can.
[time=2979] By the way, I'm not going to serve in the ministry of nursery.
[time=2983] I have a ministry Wednesday nights in my church where I'm a co-leader of high school kids.
[time=2989] For those of you who don't believe in purgatory, there is a purgatory.
[time=2996] High school, small group.
[time=3001] I'm kidding, you high school student.
[time=3005] Kind of.
[time=3008] But I'm very serious.
[time=3009] I'm being very serious.
[time=3010] I want you to stop and think, how am I serving God?
[time=3014] How am I serving this church body?
[time=3017] See, we're very good about singing stuff, and even standing up and raising our hands, and we just did that.
[time=3022] Take my hands and make them clean, keep my heart in purity that I may walk in all you have for me.
[time=3028] And we sing, my whole life is yours, I give it all.
[time=3033] And when it comes to serving, I don't have time.
[time=3037] But we're very good about singing, I give it all, right?
[time=3041] Whatever we sing needs to be practiced in our hearts, in our lives, because if not, we're just hypocrites,
[time=3049] who say things with our lips, but don't practice it with our lives.
[time=3053] We have to practice what we preach, we have to practice what we sing.
[time=3058] Even this, and I love these words.
[time=3061] But I want these words to be a reality.
[time=3065] For our lives, my whole life is yours, I give it all.
[time=3070] Have your way, have your way, and you know what?
[time=3073] His way is the way of servanthood.
[time=3076] Jesus says, "I came not to be served but to serve, and to give my life as a ransom for many."
[time=3085] It just happened that this morning we got this man's ministry invites you to serve it up,
[time=3092] and I'm pretty sure they're not talking about tennis, although he can't be interpreted like that.
[time=3098] But it starts like this, do you have a heart to serve, and the answer should be what?
[time=3103] Yes, and this is not just for a man's ministry, it should be for a woman's ministry, for children's ministry,
[time=3109] for evangelism, for choir, for whatever, we have to get involved and serve.
[time=3114] That's what it says, you should serve him and hold fast to him.
[time=3118] These are not just words, in the Bible these are words to be practiced and to be lived out.
[time=3128] But you can only do that if your heart is changed.
[time=3132] If Jesus Christ is not your personal Lord and Savior, don't come and serve.
[time=3138] Serving comes after your saved.
[time=3142] Elders will be here to pray with you if you want to surrender your life to Jesus Christ.
[time=3148] And maybe you've been here for many years, but you have not served.
[time=3151] You like to be served, but you have not served.
[time=3155] Maybe today is the day we're going to say, "Okay, today I'm going to serve." Tim, he serves every Sunday by putting this thing up here.
[time=3167] Thanks, Tim. Have you ever thanked Tim for this?
[time=3173] You know what happens without it?
[time=3179] Little things, right?
[time=3184] Little things.
[time=3186] The people who clean the bathrooms and hold your babies.
[time=3190] Did you ever think that someone has to do that?
[time=3194] Someone has to do that.
[time=3196] Why not you? Why not you?
[time=3199] For the Son of God did not come to be served, but to serve.
[time=3205] Let's pray.
[time=3207] Dear Father, we thank You for sending Your Son, Jesus Christ, into the world to die for sinners such as I.
[time=3214] Thank You that in the past You have been faithful to us.
[time=3218] Thank You that in the future You know You will be with us.
[time=3222] Help us in the present to choose life.
[time=3226] And help us in the present to choose the life of a ministry and of servanthood.
[time=3232] To serve You here at church.
[time=3235] To serve You when we get to the restaurant.
[time=3240] To serve You when we get home.
[time=3243] To be servants.
[time=3246] Forgive us for the many times when we just expected to be served.
[time=3251] I pray they will fill us with Your Holy Spirit and give us a new heart.
[time=3256] A heart that will love You and will love others.
[time=3261] A heart that will love the soul-journer in our land.
[time=3265] A heart that will fear You.
[time=3268] And as we walk through this life, people will know that we are different.
[time=3273] People will know that we are holy.
[time=3276] People will know that we are set apart for You.
[time=3280] May we be lights in this dark world and sold in this world.
[time=3286] In such a way that people will see us and will give you praise and will surrender their lives to You.
[time=3293] May what we sing, what we say, be the reality of our life.
[time=3298] In Christ name I pray. Amen.
[time=3304] Can we stand again and sing Arms Open Wide one more time and it may have a little different meaning this time.
[time=3315] From the beginning take my hands and take my life.
[time=3324] I lay it down at the cross where I am found.
[time=3333] All I have I give to You my God.
[time=3341] Take my hands and make them clean.
[time=3350] Keep my heart impurity.
[time=3356] Then I may walk in all You have for me.
[time=3364] Here I stand, Arms Open Wide.
[time=3375] I am yours and You are mine.
[time=3388] Take my moments and my days.
[time=3396] Let each breath that I take me ever only for You, Oh God.
[time=3409] Oh, here I stand, Arms Open Wide.
[time=3422] Oh, I am yours and You are mine.
[time=3433] Oh, here I stand, Arms Open Wide.
[time=3442] Oh, I am yours and You are mine.
[time=3455] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[time=3477] My whole life is yours.
[time=3488] And forever I will pray.
[time=3493] Have your way, have your way.
[time=3499] My whole life is yours.
[time=3509] And forever I will pray.
[time=3515] Have your way, have your way.
[time=3530] Oh, here I stand, Arms Open Wide.
[time=3540] Oh, I am yours and You are mine.
[time=3551] Oh, here I stand, Arms Open Wide.
