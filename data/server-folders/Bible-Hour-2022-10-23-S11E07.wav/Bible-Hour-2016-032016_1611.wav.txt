[time=1071] The Lord spoke to Moses saying Send men to spy out the land of Canaan Which I am giving to the people of Israel From each tribe of their fathers You shall send a man Everyone achieved among them So Moses sent them from the wilderness of Peron According to the command of the Lord All of them men who are heads of the people of Israel Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan And said to them Go up into the niggib and go up into the hill country And see what the land is And whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak Whether they are few or many And whether the land that they dwell in is good or bad And whether the cities that they dwell in Are camps or strongholds And whether the land is rich or poor And whether there are trees in it or not Be of good courage and bring some of the fruit of the land Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes At the end of 40 days they returned from spying out the land And they came to Moses and Aaron And to all the congregation of the people of Israel In the wilderness of Peron at Kadesh They brought back word to them And to all the congregation And showed them the fruit of the land And they told them We came to the land to which you sent us It flows with milk and honey And this is its fruit However the people who dwell in the land are strong And the cities are fortified and very large And besides we saw the descendants of Anak there The Amalekites dwell in the land in the Degeb The Hittites, the Jebusites And the Amorites dwell in the hill country And the Canaanites dwell by the sea And along the Jordan But Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said Let's go up at once and occupy it For we are well able to overcome it Then the men who had gone up with him said We are not able to go up against the people For they are stronger than we are So they brought to the people of Israel A bad report of the land that they had spied out saying The land through which we have gone to spy it out Is a land that devours its inhabitants And all the people that we saw in it Are of great height And there we saw the Nepthalim The sons of Anak, who come from the Nepthalim And we seem to ourselves like grasshoppers And so we seem to them Good morning Please open your Bibles to Numbers chapter 13 And this morning I want us to Answer this question Are we living by faith Or by sight According to the Bible there are only two types of people in this world Those who live by faith And those who live by sight And we will see in these two chapters How clear the delineation is We've been in the first five books of Moses The Pentateuch and I'm happy to report that this is the last Sunday in the Pentateuch That should be good news Because we're moving to more narrative things Actually next Sunday we will Look at Palm Sunday Jesus' entry into Jerusalem And then in two weeks the resurrection And after that we'll be into the book of Joshua But remember that from the beginning God promised his people That he will take him through these 400 years of slavery But then he will bring him out And then he will take him into the land of promise Again the term "promised land" never occurs in the Bible But we know it's the land of promise That's why we call it the Promised Land And the children of Israel could have made that trip in 40 days
[time=1326] They actually could have made it in 40 months But it took them 40 years to get there because of their rebellion and disobedience
[time=1336] That's very important to remember It's about 38 years into the trip and they have two more years together
[time=1347] They don't know this at this point, right?
[time=1349] They're at the edge of the Promised Land
[time=1355] And Moses gets clear directions from God
[time=1361] Numbers 13 verse 2 The land man to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the people of Israel
[time=1370] From each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man everyone achieve among them
[time=1376] By the way, this picture, the background picture of the slides
[time=1382] Is actually taken from Mount Nebo, which is in present day Jordan It's basically what God showed Moses, hey, look at the Promised Land You're not going to enter it, but you can see it Not even Moses doesn't make it into the Promised Land
[time=1401] I'm not sure who took this picture but I'm grateful that they found this picture When I was there, I took a picture but it was a very hazy day, you couldn't see much But on a clear day from Mount Nebo, you can actually see Jerusalem on a clear day
[time=1417] And they're almost, this is by the way from the Jordan side
[time=1423] Where they came from, it's from the Egypt side So they're in the southern part, they're almost ready to enter the Promised Land
[time=1432] And God says to Moses, "Send spies into the land" And Moses obeys And he gives spies very clear directions Moses sent them to spy out the land starting in verse 17 And he said to them, "Go up into the Negev and go up into the hill country" The Negev is in the southern part of present day Israel, that's the southern part So go into the land, you start to the south and then you keep going into the hill country
[time=1463] And see what the land is and whether the people who dwell there are strong or weak Whether there are few or many, whether the land that they dwell in is good or bad And whether the cities that they dwell in are camps or strongholds And whether the land is rich or poor And whether there are trees in it or not Be of good courage and bring some of the fruit of the land Now the time was the reason of the first ripe grapes So artists for many, many centuries have tried to picture that scene
[time=1494] Because it says the grapes were so big they had to put it on a pole and carry it
[time=1500] So I can't tell you how accurate this depiction is But it is a depiction that the artists are trying to come up with What we know for sure is that these 12 spies Wacked for about 500 miles over a period of 40 days So we assume that all of them were in good shape I think the picture even gets this one right They're in good shape to walk 500 miles for 40 days
[time=1533] And then they bring the report Verse 27, the first part of the report is good We came to the land to which you send us It flows with milk and honey As the great theologians, the vegetals say Sounds pretty sticky Milk and honey, have you tried that before?
[time=1554] It is pretty sticky And this is its fruit But the second part of the report shows that most of the spies, 10 out of 12
[time=1567] Are not men of faith, they are men who live by sight And here we learn some very important principles When we live by faith and not by sight we doubt God's word Notice please, the second part of the report However, that word can be translated But the people who dwell in the land are strong
[time=1595] And the cities are fortified and very large And besides, we saw the descendants of Anak there The Amalekites dwell in the land of Negev The Hittites, the Jebusites, the Amorites Dwell in the hill country and the Canaanites Dwell by the sea and along the Jordan Have you ever seen people pray like that to God?
[time=1613] They give a report to God?
[time=1615] Have you ever seen that?
[time=1616] God, you know what happened this week in such and such a land?
[time=1620] God doesn't need our news report Actually, God told them when you go there This is who we will find in the land God already told them, these people will be in the land But what did they miss?
[time=1634] We read it at the beginning of chapter 13, verse 2 Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am what?
[time=1643] Giving!
[time=1645] They missed that very important part God is not saying, go and see, maybe I'm going to give you victory Go and see, maybe I'm going to give the land to you That's not what God is saying You have to do your part and I'm going to do my part I'm going to give this land to you But 10 out of the 12 spies are men who live by sight
[time=1672] They're faithless That's why you don't know their names, do you?
[time=1678] The only two names that you remember from the 12 spies are Joshua and You know those names, don't you?
[time=1684] Because those are the men of faith The other 10 don't count in biblical history Because they're faithless men One poem goes like this Doubt sees the obstacles Faith sees the way Doubt sees the darkness night Faith sees the day Doubt dreads to take a step Faith sores on high Doubt questions who believes?
[time=1713] Faith answers I My dear brothers and sisters, this morning we have to answer this question How do we live our lives?
[time=1723] Do we live by sight or do we live by faith?
[time=1726] Because if we live by sight, we will always doubt God's word And that's only the first step, the second step The people who live by sight and not by faith will first doubt God's word And then they will defy God's word and his will
[time=1744] Verse 32 and on So they brought the people a bad report of the land That they had spied out saying The land through which we have gone to spied out is the land that devours its inhabitants
[time=1758] What did God say about this land?
[time=1761] It's a good land It's a good land that I am giving you They defy God's word and his will The land through which we have gone to spied out is the land that devours its inhabitants And all the people that we saw in it are of great height And we saw there the Nephilim, these are the Nephilim that appear in Genesis chapter 6 verse 4 We don't know exactly what that means, there could be maybe bigger stature than others You know, some column giants, there's no way we can know that What we know is that there are men of renown that have a bad reputation And these people say we saw them there and the sons of Anak, same thing People come from the Nephilim and we seem to ourselves like grasshoppers So we seemed to them Dear brothers and sisters, when we live by sight and not by faith Not only do we doubt God's word, we will defy God's will God's will was for them to go into the land and they say we can't go into the land You might say, well, this living by sight and by faith is just theoretical No, it's not theoretical at all When you open the Word of God, do you believe what it says or you don't?
[time=1831] Do you doubt it or do you believe it?
[time=1834] Do you defy God's will or do you do God's will?
[time=1838] Notice, please what they say We seem to ourselves like grasshoppers Someone wise once said fear is unbelief parading in the skies
[time=1854] Fear of these so-called giant people, huge men of renown, whatever they were
[time=1861] That's fear, fear is unbelief parading in the skies
[time=1867] We sang this morning how great is our God, how great is our God, let's live as such
[time=1877] Sometimes we live with grasshopper faith and ignore the great God that we sing about
[time=1884] When we say we have a great God, we believe his word and we live it out We can't say how great is our God and then we don't believe what it says We can't say how great is our God and then we don't obey what he says Those things go together but when we live by sight and not by faith we will doubt God's word
[time=1906] We will defy God's word and in the process we will discourage God's people
[time=1912] Notice, please the reaction of the people Then all the congregation raised the loud cry and the people wept that night
[time=1927] Have you ever seen anybody who doesn't believe the word of God doubts it, defies it and then encourages people? No No, because if you doubt God's word, if you defy God's will You will discourage God's people, you will not encourage them Because what encourages God's people is his word and his will
[time=1951] So you can imagine ten versus two Ten are faithless men who live by sight and two Joshua and Caleb are men of faith
[time=1963] Can you imagine the ten getting together in a committee?
[time=1967] It's okay, let's get together and make sure we get this story straight together And they agreed on it, according to the Bible they agreed on it A committee, someone said, is a group of people who individually can do nothing
[time=1981] and collectively decide that nothing can be done
[time=1987] We laugh, but people who don't believe in God's word and defy God's will will always discourage God's people You never go to a church and say, "Well, I was really discouraged today, I'm going back next Sunday
[time=2004] But I hear people say I'm encouraged that black hockey preached the word of God, I'm coming back
[time=2010] I read a story that was advertised that the devil was going to put his tools up for sale
[time=2018] It's obviously a fictional story But on the date of the sale, the tools were placed for public inspection and each tool being marked with its sale price And the devil was selling its tools, hatred, envy, jealousy, deceit, lying, pride
[time=2037] And somewhere on the side was a harmless looking tool It was well worn and priced very high What is the name of this tool, asked one of the shoppers?
[time=2050] And the devil said, "That is discouragement" Why have you priced it so high?
[time=2056] Well, because it is more useful to me than the others I can try open and get inside a man's heart with that when I cannot get near him with the other tools Once I get inside, I can make him do what I choose It is badly worn because I use it on almost everyone since very few people know that it belongs to me discouragement is the tool of the devil And people who deny and defy God's word and his will will always discourage God's people And when we live by faith, when we live by sight and not by faith we will be such people that doubt God's word, defy it and then discourage God's people And I say, well, that's okay, it's not that bad Well, it is bad because discouragement turns into grumbling And all the people of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron The whole congregation said to them, "Oh, that we had died in the land of Egypt or that we had died in this wilderness" Why is the Lord bringing us into this land to fall by the sword?
[time=2129] Our wives and our little ones will become a prey Would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt?
[time=2136] And they said to one another, "Let us choose a leader and go back to Egypt" My dear brothers and sisters, grumbling, complaining is not a spiritual gift
[time=2147] It is not a spiritual gift Wears be said, "A complaining spirit is a sign of an ungrateful heart"
[time=2158] A complaining spirit is a sign of an ungrateful heart And this is what these people had Not only were they discouraged But they became grumblers and complaining And they were rebelling against God and his leaders And when we live by sight and not by faith, we will incur God's judgment Notice please what God says This is, by the way, very similar to what happened after they worshipped the golden calf Remember that in Exodus 32?
[time=2189] Very similar words from God Starting in verse 11 of chapter 14 God wants to destroy these people And the Lord said to Moses, "How long will these people despise me?" And how long will they not believe in me?
[time=2206] In spite of all the signs that I have done among them, I will strike them with patience and disinherit them And I will make you a great nation, a greater nation, and my dear than they
[time=2218] But Moses again, Moses the leader becomes Moses the intercessor
[time=2224] And says Moses says to the Lord, "Then the Egyptians will hear of it For you brought up these people in your might from among them And they will tell the inhabitants of all the land They have heard that you, O Lord, are in the midst of his people For you, O Lord, are seen face to face and your cloud stands over them
[time=2244] You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night Now, if you kill these people as one man Then the nations who have heard your fame will say, "It is because the Lord was not able
[time=2258] To bring these people into the land that he sought to give them That he has killed them in the wilderness" Notice what Moses does, Moses appeals to God's character And now, please let the power of the Lord be great as you have promising The Lord is slow to anger and abounding his steadfast love Forgiving iniquity and transgression But he will by no means clear the guilty Visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation
[time=2287] Please pardon the iniquity of these people according to the greatness of your steadfast love Just as you have forgiven these people from Egypt until now Then the Lord said, "I have pardoned according to your word" Does prayer have power? Does prayer have power? Oh yeah!
[time=2306] There's power in prayer and Moses prays to God and God relents This is the second time God relents from killing his own people God relents to not destroy them, but they will incur his judgment
[time=2323] These are the verses that you have on the screen None of the men who have seen my glory, God says And my signs that I didn't Egypt in the wilderness And yet have put me to the test these ten times have not obeyed my voice Shall see the land that I sought to give their fathers And none of those who despised me shall see it There's only two exceptions, can you guess who?
[time=2348] Joshua and Caleb, verse 30 No one shall come into the land where I saw that I would make you dwell except Caleb The son of Jafuna and Joshua the son of none Remember what the Israelites said? Oh, that we had died where? In the wilderness
[time=2368] Be careful what you wish for Because God is giving them what they are wishing for That whole generation will die in the wilderness Because of the rebellion and disobedience When we live by sight and not by faith, we will incur God's judgment What happened to the ten spies who are faithless and lived by sight and not by faith?
[time=2395] Look what happened The men who Moses sent to spy out the land who returned and made all the congregation grumble against him By bringing up a bad report about the land The men who brought up a bad report died by plague before the Lord
[time=2413] While your brothers and sisters and dear friends, we need to learn a very important lesson We have to take God seriously If God says something, not only do we have to believe it We have to do it And not only do we have to do that, but we cannot be discouraging God's people We have to encourage them to obey Where when we say Moses led the world's largest funeral march And Joshua and Caleb Witnessed their generation die
[time=2450] This morning we had baby dedications This is that cute But as parents, all of us have a responsibility to our children
[time=2462] Do you know that when the Generation that entered the promised land entered the promised land They entered without their fathers and their mothers?
[time=2473] The question for all of us who are parents here Not just for the parents this morning, but for of us who are parents What kind of legacy are we living, our children?
[time=2482] Are we leaving them a legacy of this is God's word And you can believe it and trust it every day of your life Or do we teach them this is only true until you go to high school This is only true until you get to college After that you can change your views We cannot do that Because the moment we do that We will not just doubt and defy God's word We will raise up a generation that will doubt and defy God's word And God's will What kind of legacy are we leaving our children?
[time=2519] Faithless or faithful?
[time=2524] The two men that stand out in these two chapters are men of faith
[time=2531] When we live by faith we believe God's word Notice what Caleb says Notice these are the minority, this is the minority report They stand in contrast with the faithless spies
[time=2548] But Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said Let us go up at once and occupy it for we are well able to overcome it
[time=2557] Now you can't see it in English, but in Hebrew This expression is emphatic And in Hebrew in order to make something emphatic With verbs is to take two verbs from the same root And one is a finite verb and wasn't an infinitive absolute And it's hard to translate So even here the ESV has a problem translating it Because Caleb says we will overcome But he wants to make an emphatic, how do you make that emphatic?
[time=2589] In English, it's very hard So I looked at the other translations and what they do The new American standard is a little better Says for we shall surely overcome it You've got to employ the adverb surely to make it emphatic So here you can imagine whatever adverb you like That ends with a "li" and put it in this text to show emphasis
[time=2616] We shall surely overcome it, we shall certainly overcome it We shall whatever "li" overcome it You fill in the blank The NIV, I like, in this case
[time=2631] For we can certainly do it, certainly
[time=2637] Notice please that there are two groups of people The ten faithless spies who say we are not able And the two faithful spies who say we can do it, we can overcome And that basically is the difference And we can say there's the ones who say we are not able But we can say, but God is able Our God is able When we live by faith, we believe God's Word And God's Word said what?
[time=2669] I will be giving it to you It doesn't even say I'm going to give it to you if you are good Were they good?
[time=2679] No No, they were disobedient They were rebellious over and over and over again Actually, this text says God says to them To Moses, they were rebellious ten times I'm sure God was not exaggerating when he said that But when we live by faith, we believe God's Word And when we live by faith We benefit from the fulfillment of God's promises Starting in verse 28 of chapter 14 As I live, declares the Lord While you have said in my hearing I will do to you Your dead body shall fall in the wilderness And all of your number listed in the census from 20 years old and upward Who have grumbled against me Not one shall come into the land where I saw that I would make you dwell Except Caleb, the son of Jifune And Joshua, the son of none Notice, please, not everybody benefits from the fulfillment of God's promises Only the faithful do A very nice verse that we like to abuse is Romans 8, 28 For all things work together, right? For good No, it doesn't say that It says for all things work together for those who love God That is not a card branch for you to do whatever you want And then to say, "Yeah, but God will work it out for good." No, no, no, no That's only for the people who are faithful The same thing with these promises will come to fruition for the faithful You see, when we live by sight and not by faith We miss out God's blessings And again, think about that picture To be able to see the promised land but not enter into it What tragedy?
[time=2783] What tragedy?
[time=2785] To be at the border of it and not to get in What tragedy?
[time=2789] Because of doubt and unbelief Nancy Spielberg and Dorothy Purdy wrote the following poem
[time=2799] It's titled "If I Had Known You" Because that's the problem, these spies didn't know God Didn't know his greatness and his goodness And they write, "Lord, I crawled across the bareness to you With my empty cup Uncertain in asking any small drop of refreshment If only I had known you better I'd come running with a bucket And we come to God with our little cups
[time=2833] And a lot of times they're not even empty We fill him with our doubt and unbelief And then we ask, "Oh God, put something in here" And that's not how God operates God wants to come with our buckets empty And he can fill them, but we have to believe We have to believe his word when he says, "I am giving you this land"
[time=2855] When we live by faith Not only do we believe in God's word and we see the fulfillment of God's promises But we are blessed with life Notice, please, verse 38 "Of those men who went to spy out the land only Joshua the son of none And Caleb the son of Jefuneh remained alive"
[time=2878] Couple of weeks ago I said that even last Sunday I said that God says very clearly
[time=2884] Choose what? Life Choose life These ten spies and the old generation chose death
[time=2899] Joshua and Caleb chose life They remained alive I don't know what problems you will face this week But I can tell you one certain thing from God's word That the God who is in you through the Holy Spirit is bigger than the problem ahead of you
[time=2923] And if you don't believe that, you are living by sight and not by faith
[time=2929] But if you live by faith and you know that God is the God who says he is Then you can walk no matter how difficult the road is And you know that the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob is bigger than the grasshoppers that are in front of you
[time=2948] So how do we apply this for our lives?
[time=2954] 2 Corinthians 5, 6 and 7 The Apostle Paul writes "So we are always of good courage We know that while we are at home in the body We are away from the Lord for we walk by faith not by sight" That's the choice If until today you have lived by sight and not by faith
[time=2976] I implore you to repent of your sin If you doubted or defied God's word and his will Today can be the day of salvation and God allows you to repent of your sin
[time=2990] We will have elders here in front if you want to come and pray with them And we want to confess your sin, to repent means to be sorry and to turn from your sin And God allows you turns So if you have disobeyed, denied, defied God's word, repent
[time=3010] And put your trust in God alone, in other words Have faith, believe Pull your trust in God alone for what he is going to do And that's very practical for those of us who are believers Like in the text be an encourager and be an intercessor There are enough people who grumble and discourage God's people You be an encourager Look around what's happening at Blackhawk and say "God is working" Be encouraged And he is, be encouraged Be an encourager and be an intercessor We have these prayer walls, right?
[time=3046] You can go there and write a prayer request You don't have a prayer request Maybe you can pray for someone who put their names there And put a prayer request there Be a man and a woman of prayer Intercede for your brothers and sisters Intercede for those who are not yet believers Maybe your friends, your family, pray for them That's what it means to put your trust in God It's not just a theoretical thing, it's a very practical thing Where you believe God's word and then you become an encourager And you become an intercessor and you pray for others Piety is no substitute for preparation But preparation is no substitute for piety either You need both piety and preparation If you are to take the promised land Without faith
[time=3099] It's your key verse in the bulletin If you're following the notes in the bulletin Without faith it is impossible to please God For whoever would draw near to God must believe that He exists And that He rewards those who seek Him I want to close with this quote by one of my favorite writers A.W. Tozer If you have not read A.W. Tozer I encourage you to get At least one book By Him The knowledge of the Holy
[time=3138] Listen to what A.W. Tozer says about faith in conjunction to who God is
[time=3145] And I'm going to close with this When man loses his confidence in the character of God He begins his downward plunge When that happens You get all mixed up about what God is like And the only way back is to have a restored confidence in God We need to get to know God The God who has revealed Himself in the Word of God If we are not aware of what kind of God our God is Or what He is like We simply cannot have faith And so we struggle Wait and hope for faith Faith does not come Because we do not know the character of God Faith, trust and hope are an automatic thing If we put our faith and hope and trust in the character of God It will come naturally It will flow as naturally as a stream down the mountain On the other hand Ignorance and unbelief Drag faith down And we can see the results of this all around us Even in the church A restored knowledge of God Will counter this and bring faith up to where it belongs
[time=3226] Isn't that wonderful?
[time=3228] But we cannot separate those two A restored knowledge of God Will counter this and bring faith up to where it belongs
[time=3241] Let's pray Dear Father, we come before You this morning asking for forgiveness For the many times when we lived by sight and not by faith Forgive us for the times when we doubted You and Your Word
[time=3259] Forgive us for the time when we defied You and Your will Forgive us for the times when we discouraged Your people Not encourage them through Your Word and by magnifying You and Your character
[time=3275] Forgive us I pray that today will be the day of salvation And many people put their trust in You and in Christ alone for their salvation
[time=3288] And for the believers here I pray that we indeed will live by faith and not by sight And we will be encouragers and we will be intercessors Men and women of prayer Fasting of encouragement In such a way that the church will be edified The name will be glorified and many people will come to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ
[time=3322] In a stand with us and sing the desert song
[time=3339] This is my prayer in the desert When all that's within me feels dry This is my prayer in my hunger and need My God is the God who provides And this is my prayer in the fire In weakness or trial of pain There is a faith proved more worth in gold So refine your Lord through the flame I will bring grace I will bring grace No weapon formed against the shall remain I will rejoice I will declare God is my victory and He is here
[time=3393] This is my prayer in the battle
[time=3403] In triumph is still on its way I am a conquer and co-er with Christ So firm on His promise of sin I will bring grace I will bring grace No weapon formed against the shall remain I will rejoice I will declare God is my victory and He is here All of my life In every season You are still God I have a reason to sing I have a reason to worship
[time=3452] All of my life In every season You are still God I have a reason to sing I have a reason to worship All of my life In every season You are still God I have a reason to sing I have a reason to worship
[time=3487] All of my life In every season You are still God I have a reason to sing I have a reason to worship I will bring grace I will bring grace No weapon formed against the shall remain I will rejoice I will declare God is my victory and He is here
[time=3538] This is my prayer in the harvest When favor and providence flow I know I'm filled to be emptied again The seed I've received I'm so
[time=3568] God is my victory and He is here I will pray for you God is my victory and He is here
