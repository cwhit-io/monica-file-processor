[time=800] If you had known, even you, especially in this your day, the things that make you for your peace, but now are hidden from your eyes. For days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment around you, surround you and close in on you on every side and level you and your children within you to the ground. And they will not leave you and leave in you one stone upon another because you did not know the time of your life.
[time=829] You did not know the time of your visitation. And when he had come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved saying, who is this? So the multitude said, this is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee and Jesus went into Jerusalem and into the temple.
[time=847] Then the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and healed them, but when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did and the children crying out in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the son of David, they were indignant and said to him, do you hear what these are saying? And Jesus said to them, yes, have you never read out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants? You have perfected praise.
[time=875] So when he had looked around at all things, he left them and went out of the city to Bethany as the hour was already late and he lodged there with the 12.
[time=889] It's an interesting few verses that he just read, actually it's a lot of verses, but this morning we're celebrating something that looks totally different than much of what the world wants to celebrate.
[time=911] I didn't greet you this morning. I'm Rick Raber, by the way, for some of you that don't know who in the world I am, I'm one of the elders here.
[time=919] And if you're new to Blackhawk or if you're joining us via the Bible hour or the livestream, we're really glad that you're here with us today.
[time=928] And our goal is to lift up the person of Jesus Christ and point to him as the one true Savior of the world, the source of forgiveness and salvation.
[time=942] Around the world today, people are celebrating their celebrating historical account, something that really happened.
[time=950] The Bible says it, but it really did happen. It is what is known as Palm Sunday. We just had kids come through here with their branches and everything else.
[time=960] What does that look like?
[time=962] It's the day earlier in the week of Passover week before Jesus is crucified. It's the day that he actually enters into Jerusalem.
[time=974] It's the beginning of what's called Passion Week, and there's so many events that happen this week that Jesus and his life looks totally different.
[time=985] The life is culminating.
[time=988] With his sacrificial death on the cross on Good Friday, we're going to be back here to celebrate that.
[time=994] But ultimately, it's to his demonstration of power over sin, death, and hell through the resurrection from the grave that happens one week from today that we celebrate on Easter Sunday.
[time=1010] So, the title today is Jesus coming as a king, a triumphal entry.
[time=1020] You actually won't find it in your scriptures while you might find it in some of your sections of your Bible in the verses that Gary read.
[time=1030] It's not actually in the text. It's a man-made edition that calls it the triumphal entry.
[time=1036] And I did that with purpose, put a question mark up there, because there's many that would say triumphant is maybe not quite as fitting here.
[time=1047] John MacArthur actually calls it a coronation.
[time=1051] But Jesus coming was a purpose that goes all the way back that we celebrated a few months ago on Christmas.
[time=1059] And a message that was delivered to his father Joseph from Matthew chapter 1, when Joseph has delivered the message and he's told she will give birth to a son and you're to call his name Jesus.
[time=1076] Because he will save his people from their sin.
[time=1082] So, it started way back before he ever took his first human breath.
[time=1087] Joseph was told because he will save his people from their sin.
[time=1093] From his birth he was headed to Jerusalem for the Passover.
[time=1098] It was a long journey.
[time=1102] One perfect life is what Gary read from.
[time=1104] If you haven't seen that, John MacArthur takes and he melds together the passages from the scriptures from all four gospel accounts.
[time=1115] There's actually very few events in Jesus' life that are recorded by all four gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.
[time=1126] The truth is, is the triumphal entry left me asking this week?
[time=1131] I don't get it.
[time=1133] Triumph by definition actually looked it up.
[time=1136] Triumphal made or carried out or used in celebration of a great victory.
[time=1142] I had the victory over sin and death yet.
[time=1146] Triumphant, a feeling or expressing jubilation after having won a victory or mastered a difficulty.
[time=1153] So, I'm confused.
[time=1154] Maybe some of you have asked that question before.
[time=1157] Why triumphant at the beginning of the week?
[time=1159] Well, he was clearly coming into Jerusalem and he was coming as a king.
[time=1165] But remember, the truth is triumphal entry is a man-made term added outside of the scriptures.
[time=1172] Jesus coming to Jerusalem this last time is the midst of thousands of people migrating to Jerusalem for Passover.
[time=1181] This was something that happened every year.
[time=1184] They were doing it for a lot of reasons.
[time=1187] Forgiveness of sin, they came because their culture required it.
[time=1191] It was the law.
[time=1193] Historically, Josephus even talks about in 66 AD, actually after Jesus had passed, that there were more than 256,500 lambs sacrificed on Passover Day in Jerusalem.
[time=1211] You think, wow, that's a pretty big number.
[time=1214] The reason I give you that is because when you start building that up, if there's 256,000 lambs, Josephus goes on to say,
[time=1221] there's little fraternities that gather around each sacrifice of not fewer than 10 people, 10 persons.
[time=1231] So now all of a sudden, you start getting the scope of the number of people that are converging on Jerusalem.
[time=1239] There's a lot of people there.
[time=1241] There are a lot of people everywhere.
[time=1244] They're converging, and so is Jesus.
[time=1248] Luke 951 points out to us that his time approach for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.
[time=1258] He was on a mission, and his mission was to get there so that he could be crucified for you and I.
[time=1264] And this is part of that message.
[time=1268] It's interesting what happens on the way.
[time=1271] On his way from Jericho, the gospels note that he healed the blind man Bartimaeus.
[time=1276] He stopped in Jericho and met a little short guy named Zacchaeus and went to his house in 8.
[time=1286] He was called to Bethany by Mary and Martha because Lazarus had died.
[time=1293] And you remember, Mary and Martha weren't very happy because he actually stayed a little bit longer before he came.
[time=1301] There were many Jews that came to comfort Mary and Martha and to try to do that because Lazarus has died,
[time=1308] but what happens is Jesus shows up and Lazarus comes back to life.
[time=1316] It is an event that's very defining. It's a spot that all of a sudden the Jews and the people around became really aware of the power of Jesus because Lazarus becomes raised from the dead.
[time=1332] And the testimony of his power over those things made it really clear, and John says it caused many to believe and put their faith in him.
[time=1344] That's what we're talking about. This is what happens.
[time=1348] John 12-1 tells us that six days before the Passover, he came to Bethany where Lazarus lived.
[time=1357] He's back living again. This is after he had died. John details that.
[time=1362] But listen to this, John 12-9 and 10.
[time=1366] A large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came not only because of him, but also to see Lazarus, the guy that was raised from the dead.
[time=1377] They wanted to come see Lazarus, so the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well.
[time=1387] They made plans not only to kill Jesus, but Lazarus as well because he was a living testimony of the power of Jesus.
[time=1395] And he had drawn so many people, so they said not only do we got to take care of Jesus, but we got to take care of the guy that was raised from the dead because he's living evidence of his power.
[time=1406] That's who he is.
[time=1411] And what it says, it goes on to say they wanted to kill Lazarus as well for on account of him.
[time=1417] Many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and putting their faith in him again.
[time=1424] So we got hundreds of thousands of people. Some people say the numbers, actually the estimates are interesting.
[time=1431] Some people are as low as 500,000, which I think that's probably wacked, especially when you start hearing hundreds of thousands of lambs being killed.
[time=1439] And some are as high as 12 million. That's pretty broad scope.
[time=1443] Here's where I'll land. There's a lot of people in Jerusalem.
[time=1448] There's a lot of people in Jerusalem, and they came to see that.
[time=1453] And in that space, imagine putting a couple million people between here and Walmart.
[time=1460] From Bethany to Jerusalem was only two miles.
[time=1465] You think the word of mouth would have spread very quick?
[time=1469] Hey, there's a guy that was raised from the dead and he's over there in Bethany.
[time=1476] It spread quickly.
[time=1480] But it's really clear as well, there was intent, very specific intent by the leaders of the church.
[time=1490] The people of that day, they were going to kill him and they were going to kill Lazarus. That was their plan.
[time=1497] So it's into this setting and timeline.
[time=1502] It's into this setting and timeline that Jesus is entering into Jerusalem and make no mistakes.
[time=1509] The threat was evident enough that when Jesus said they were going to Bethany near Jerusalem,
[time=1515] Thomas, one of the disciples says, whoa, he says it in John 11, 16.
[time=1520] He says, Thomas said, let us go die with him.
[time=1528] They knew where they were going. They knew what it meant for him to get to Jerusalem and what was going to happen. And it did not happen by accident.
[time=1537] It did not happen by accident. It happened with very specific person.
[time=1542] So we get to this spot and we have the accounts.
[time=1547] It does occur. It does occur in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.
[time=1551] It's all there. Gary read it.
[time=1555] But I want to talk about what probably is a little bit early on the triumphal part of it.
[time=1562] Because the truth is, is the things that we're going to celebrate this week and the things that Jesus went through were willing places that he chose to go.
[time=1573] He chose to go for you. He chose to go for me into a week between now and the resurrection
[time=1582] that wasn't very victorious at that point in time.
[time=1586] It was humble. It was humiliating. Think about what he gets spit on this week, folks.
[time=1594] He gets spit on. He gets nailed to a cross. It is not very victorious.
[time=1603] But yet he comes and there's a real clear purpose.
[time=1607] So let's step into what it means for us to look at him coming into Jerusalem.
[time=1612] If you have your Bibles, you can probably the best one for you to look at is going to be Luke, Luke and Matthew. If you want to tuck it in between those two spots,
[time=1622] we're going to jump all over the place because it is a gospel that spreads that all out.
[time=1627] It's Luke chapter 19.
[time=1635] And then Matthew chapter 21, if you kind of want to tuck your fingers or something in there, it'll help you as we jump back and forth between it.
[time=1648] I'm going to read actually from the synopsis that he had, the melding of it together.
[time=1653] But the next day, Jesus sent two disciples saying to them, "Go into the village opposite you, and as soon as you've entered it, you will find a donkey tied, and he caught with her, on which no one is set.
[time=1667] Loose them and bring them to me." It's interesting what he says.
[time=1672] Loose them and bring them to me, and immediately he will send them here.
[time=1676] And so they went, and they did that.
[time=1679] The first point in your outline is this is evidence of Jesus coming,
[time=1686] demonstrating his deity.
[time=1689] And so you look at it and think, why in the world does two disciples, going and grabbing a donkey in the middle of Beth Faget,
[time=1700] why in the world is that a resemblance or an exhibition or a demonstration of his deity?
[time=1708] Well, let me ask you this.
[time=1710] When's the last time somebody told you to go somewhere, and the event that happened was exactly the way that it was told to be, they said what you said, they did what you did, and it exactly happened that way.
[time=1726] This is a way that Jesus had done this before.
[time=1729] Jesus had done this before with the woman who was at the well, and he said, "Go," and she said, "Well, I don't have a husband." And she said, "Well, actually you do. You had five husbands." There are several examples of Jesus deity in the scriptures that are by his foreknowledge.
[time=1748] He talks about meeting a guy that's that, "Well, how did you know my name?" he asked Jesus, and Jesus said, "I saw you under the fig tree." Well, he wasn't anywhere near the fig tree when the guy was sitting there.
[time=1758] It's all part of that that makes it really clear.
[time=1764] He had several miracles that had happened.
[time=1767] Yeah, his power over death, Lazarus, blindness, all of those things have been really evident, but the fact that he knew the details about where the donkey was going to be.
[time=1781] Mark even says real specifically, he says, "Go to the village up ahead," which was Beth Fage.
[time=1786] He said, "Go to the village, and as soon as you enter it, you're going to find the donkey." It clearly represents the all-knowing nature of God.
[time=1798] He knows that. He knows everything about it.
[time=1803] I want to suggest that there's another picture.
[time=1807] John MacArthur actually commented about it.
[time=1810] He said, "I'm not quite sure.
[time=1812] I'm not quite sure why in the world that five times in this short section of these things that they would describe, that the donkey, the colt, needed to be loosed.
[time=1824] Needed to be loosed or untied, you'll actually see it as you go through it."
[time=1830] The interesting thing is, is I actually think it has nothing to do with it being a really tight knot.
[time=1837] I don't think it was a really tight knot that they had to loose this donkey.
[time=1841] I'd submit to you that it's part of the power over even nature.
[time=1847] You think what?
[time=1849] Well, it is a colt.
[time=1853] It's a young colt with its mother.
[time=1856] And remember, there's ridiculous amounts of people all over the place.
[time=1861] Ridiculous amounts of people all over the place.
[time=1864] And all of a sudden, you've got a colt that's never been ridden before
[time=1871] that's going to get led by two men that they've never seen before.
[time=1877] And I don't know about you, but I've been around farm animals enough to tell you.
[time=1885] You're not going to get very close to a colt by its mother, especially to sit on it.
[time=1894] When's the last time you saw anybody break any animal, a colt of any kind, a horse?
[time=1901] Does that go smoothly?
[time=1904] No, usually there's a lot of activity for the guy that's trying to hang on for dear life.
[time=1910] But yet here, we have Jesus that tells two guys to go get him.
[time=1914] They go get him.
[time=1915] They bring him back and they put their coats on the donkey, the colt, specifically.
[time=1923] And Jesus has a smooth ride to Jerusalem.
[time=1927] I'm telling you, that's not normal.
[time=1930] Something that on whom nobody had ever sat.
[time=1936] Just a simple thing.
[time=1939] It's not normal.
[time=1940] Go all the way back to Balaam and the donkey and today's world, any part of it.
[time=1946] The donkey is not the one that typically has the best temperament for being anything other than stubborn.
[time=1956] We get to there.
[time=1959] Do you understand something?
[time=1961] This wasn't a donkey that came because Jesus just didn't want to walk.
[time=1967] It's not what this was.
[time=1969] This wasn't about Jesus just not needing to walk the couple miles from Bethany to Jerusalem.
[time=1974] This was all about prophecy.
[time=1979] They brought the donkey and the colt to Jesus, laid their clothes on him, and they set Jesus on the colt.
[time=1984] Matthew says this, "All this was done that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the prophet Zechariah."
[time=1993] And it's Zechariah 9-9.
[time=1995] And he says, "Rejoice greatly, your daughter of Zion.
[time=1999] Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem.
[time=2001] Behold, your king.
[time=2004] Your king is coming.
[time=2006] He's coming to you righteous and having salvation.
[time=2010] Is he humble and mounted on a donkey?
[time=2013] On a colt, the full of a donkey.
[time=2016] I will cough the chariot of Ephraim and the war horse of Jerusalem and the battle bow shall be cut off.
[time=2022] And he shall speak peace to the nations.
[time=2026] His rule will be from sea to sea and from the river to the ends of the earth."
[time=2034] See, this was about Jesus coming as a king.
[time=2040] He was coming as a king that was really something different than what the people were expecting, though.
[time=2047] That's really the fundamental thing.
[time=2050] The second bullet in the outline, letter B, is he comes in a manner of humility and he comes in peace.
[time=2060] Remember, these Jews did not like the big strong-armed big thumb of the Romans.
[time=2068] They didn't. They wanted out from underneath of it.
[time=2071] But they were expecting a king to come to rule Rome.
[time=2076] Instead, he comes on a donkey.
[time=2080] And actually, it's a very specific reason he rides a donkey.
[time=2085] In those times, if the king came riding on a horse, it was a symbol of preparation for war.
[time=2093] It was a symbol of them coming for a very specific purpose.
[time=2097] However, if he rode on a donkey, it was absolutely a representation of peace.
[time=2104] And this wasn't new to them.
[time=2106] It wasn't new.
[time=2107] Solomon had ridden a donkey. David, it's all over.
[time=2110] It's several places in the Old Testament.
[time=2115] This was about a king's entrance. Don't miss that.
[time=2120] However, if you think about the way kings are introduced today, or all the pomp and circumstance that we get to see out of England when something happens in the royal family, this wasn't that.
[time=2133] It wasn't that at all.
[time=2137] Much like the humble circumstances surrounding a birth and a stable and a manger, Jesus coming into Jerusalem on a donkey isn't one of social or political power either one.
[time=2148] It's not. He comes with a purpose.
[time=2151] They were looking for a king to come break the grips of the Romans.
[time=2157] But he wasn't that.
[time=2159] They longed for the prophecy, but the prophecy was clear.
[time=2163] He came in peace, and he was righteous, and he was coming with salvation.
[time=2170] Their longing for a Savior from Rome leads them to follow Jesus in huge numbers.
[time=2177] And this causes a problem. Let her see in your outline.
[time=2180] His coming creates problems for the religious leaders.
[time=2186] It did. It created big problems.
[time=2190] They saw the great multitudes. Matthew says in a very great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him.
[time=2202] Somebody asked me this morning, "Tell me why they're going to throw their cloaks on the ground and why the palm branches are there." It's because that was a symbol of humility.
[time=2211] It was a symbol of humility. It was a symbol of announcing the king.
[time=2217] That king, they put their clothes on. They put their clothes on the ground.
[time=2221] The palm branches, it was to announce a kingdom.
[time=2226] And his kingdom was not what they expected.
[time=2232] John says this, "Therefore, the people who were with him, when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, those people and raised him from the dead, they bore witness." That means they started telling people about it, and it spread.
[time=2245] And for this reason, the people also met him because they heard that Jesus had done this sign,
[time=2251] and the Pharisees didn't get very excited. Well, they got real excited about it.
[time=2256] They got real excited about it.
[time=2258] Jesus followers were bearing witness of the power of Jesus over death.
[time=2265] And more and more of a multitude gathered, and they got to the spot where we sang already this morning.
[time=2270] Hosanna to the son of David.
[time=2274] Son of David is a very, very specific title for the Messiah.
[time=2280] It is very much that.
[time=2282] Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord. Peace in heaven and glory in the highest.
[time=2288] Blessed is the kingdom of our Father David that comes in the name of the Lord.
[time=2292] Hosanna in the highest.
[time=2294] This was not the first time these people had heard this.
[time=2297] This is not the first time a bunch of people in Jerusalem had even yelled it over a guy coming into town.
[time=2303] Two centuries before, there was a guy by the name of Judas Macchabees.
[time=2309] He led a group to defeat the Syrians.
[time=2313] I'm like, okay.
[time=2315] Guess what? He came riding into town on a war horse 200 years earlier.
[time=2321] And they sang the same song from Psalm 118.
[time=2327] Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[time=2330] The difference is Macchabees died and stayed in the grave.
[time=2336] He died and stayed in the grave.
[time=2338] That's not what Jesus does.
[time=2340] But it's not the first time.
[time=2342] Psalm 118 is a song of Thanksgiving.
[time=2344] It's part of the process around the Passover that they regularly sing it.
[time=2349] They regularly sing it.
[time=2350] Psalm 118 is from that section and the Jewish people would have been very used to doing that.
[time=2356] It was part of the meal.
[time=2358] Often it was saying at the end of the meal.
[time=2360] It contained some very familiar phrases.
[time=2363] Psalm 118.
[time=2366] The first four verses all end with this phrase.
[time=2370] "For his steadfast love endures forever."
[time=2376] "For his steadfast love endures forever." "Give praise to the king of..." "For his steadfast love endures forever." Verse 24.
[time=2386] Verse 24 is another very familiar verse to you.
[time=2390] This is the day the Lord has made.
[time=2394] Let us rejoice and be glad in it.
[time=2399] That's the verse right before they say, "Save us.
[time=2403] We pray, O Lord, O Lord, we pray.
[time=2405] Give us success.
[time=2406] Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." So it was very familiar.
[time=2414] It was very familiar to them.
[time=2416] Don't be confused.
[time=2420] They were singing it with their purpose.
[time=2423] Because these same people who were saying, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord in a few days are singing, not singing.
[time=2432] They're yelling, "Crucify him." He was not coming on their method, their way, or their timeline.
[time=2448] As a king over an eternal kingdom, not an earthly one, he does come.
[time=2460] But it's not eventually he does.
[time=2463] Eventually he does come with war on his mind.
[time=2466] And he comes on a white horse, but it's in Revelation 19.
[time=2472] He comes on a white horse and he's saddled for judgment.
[time=2476] Be clear.
[time=2477] That's a second coming.
[time=2479] That's not this one.
[time=2481] This one is the purpose.
[time=2483] It's for salvation and peace and covering our sins.
[time=2488] Let her die in your outline.
[time=2490] He comes over an eternal kingdom, not an earthly human one.
[time=2499] He was despised and rejected.
[time=2501] The Pharisees called from the crowd and they told him, rebuke your disciples.
[time=2507] Tell them to be quiet.
[time=2508] And you understand why?
[time=2512] Because what they were saying was reserved for God.
[time=2520] They told Jesus, tell them to stop.
[time=2524] And it's the first time.
[time=2526] It is the first time that he tells them not to.
[time=2530] There were times where he healed people and he told them to go away and be quiet.
[time=2535] That did not happen on this day.
[time=2545] They were celebrating Jesus but it was from their own fleshly, eternal, internal perspective.
[time=2554] This time he comes as Lord.
[time=2558] He comes as King and Savior.
[time=2562] Let her eat in the outline is he comes as Lord.
[time=2566] He comes as Savior.
[time=2567] He comes as King.
[time=2569] Don't miss those.
[time=2571] We read in Zechariah about him coming, his rule.
[time=2574] And he comes with authority.
[time=2577] He has a kingdom.
[time=2579] He has a kingdom but it doesn't have borders.
[time=2583] He has a kingdom that's not man-made.
[time=2586] His kingdom is in your heart, in mind.
[time=2590] That's the kingdom that he came to conquer.
[time=2593] The kingdom that he came to change.
[time=2599] Just even in these passages, the disciples were told, tell the owners of the donkey, the Lord needs them.
[time=2609] The Lord needs them.
[time=2610] They didn't say Jesus, they said the Lord needs them.
[time=2614] Zechariah's prophecy proclaimed him as a coming king, righteous and having salvation.
[time=2621] But instead of Jesus responding to their call to rebuke the disciples, he says, I tell you that if these should keep silent, even the rocks are going to cry out.
[time=2639] If these would keep silent, then the rocks are going to start screaming.
[time=2644] But here's an interesting thing that happens, the very next phrase in the dialogue says, now as he drew near, he saw the city and he wept over it.
[time=2664] He wasn't there yet.
[time=2666] The last time we're told that Jesus wept was over Lazarus, the man that he loved.
[time=2673] He wept over Lazarus.
[time=2676] But now, here he is, he's coming from Bethany.
[time=2679] And I just about did this, this would have been kind of cool.
[time=2681] Google Earth's really cool, but I actually, you can do like a flyover kind of thing from Bethany up to Beth Fage and down the mountain of Olives and come in, but I didn't think it would fit very well.
[time=2693] Instead, we get a picture like this.
[time=2696] Jesus is overlooking the city and he weeps.
[time=2700] And it says Jesus wept over the city.
[time=2703] I want you to be really clear.
[time=2705] This word, this word that's used for Jesus weeping, isn't one of a tear dribbling down his eyes on a cheek.
[time=2715] It's one that means sobbing.
[time=2718] He sobbed over what was happening that week because again, remember, he's omniscient.
[time=2724] He knows everything.
[time=2725] He knows what's coming.
[time=2727] He knows they're going to spit on him.
[time=2730] He knows he's going to be, he knows what's going to happen in the garden.
[time=2735] And he stops overlooking the city and he cries.
[time=2740] He cries.
[time=2742] He's fully human people.
[time=2744] He is fully human.
[time=2749] He cries over them missing him who comes to redeem them.
[time=2759] He cries over them missing their time of visitation of one who brings peace.
[time=2771] I submit to you today that actually the best triumph was actually his entry, his re-entry, after rising from the dead.
[time=2783] He's coming back to the people because he is the king and he will receive praise.
[time=2790] Let her eff.
[time=2791] He will receive praise even if from stones or children.
[time=2798] To understand this people, there is a time when every knee will bow and every tongue will confess to the glory of Jesus Christ that he is the king, the chosen one, the one who forgives sin.
[time=2813] That's who he is.
[time=2814] There is a time.
[time=2818] And if you're here this morning, you need to understand that today is the time for you to choose that.
[time=2825] Because it's your own choosing from your heart.
[time=2829] We want you to do that because you're aware that he came.
[time=2836] Remember, his father was told before he was ever born.
[time=2841] Name him Jesus because he will save his people from what?
[time=2848] I have to tell you, when we put that up there, Beth and the team, that fire thing this morning, those things that were listed on the TV, actually I'll submit to you this.
[time=2863] As you watched that this morning, there were different figures.
[time=2869] There were different things in that list that stick out to you.
[time=2877] Maybe it was the bill with idolatry on it.
[time=2880] Maybe it was the credit card with greed on it.
[time=2885] Maybe it was pride.
[time=2888] All of them, every one of them, laziness with the TV, guilty, especially this weekend.
[time=2900] Guilty.
[time=2903] He came to forgive sin.
[time=2906] And there's not one sitting in this room that is not guilty.
[time=2910] Not one.
[time=2911] Not the guy preaching.
[time=2912] Not anybody sitting in the pews.
[time=2914] We are all guilty.
[time=2916] And he came as king to wipe it away.
[time=2921] He came as king not to conquer Rome.
[time=2924] He came as king to rule and have authority over sin and death.
[time=2928] That's who Jesus is.
[time=2930] And that's how he came.
[time=2935] He did.
[time=2936] He came as lord, king, messiah, saviour.
[time=2942] This week we have a chance.
[time=2946] This week we have a chance to be reminded of the details of all of this stuff.
[time=2951] All of these things surrounding him going to the upper room of him being seen.
[time=2959] Of him being raised from the dead.
[time=2962] All of those things.
[time=2965] Please, I ask you to take him in.
[time=2969] And seriously consider, seriously consider, please, the same answer to the question that he asked Peter.
[time=2980] Who do you say that I am?
[time=2983] Who do you say that Jesus is?
[time=2986] Were you like the guys and the people along the streets that were clapping and waving branches?
[time=2994] And a few days later totally changed their temperature and said crucify him.
[time=3001] Those are fans.
[time=3003] Those are people that are just like the people that got free tickets to go to a mad ants game.
[time=3010] They don't care.
[time=3011] They just went to the mad ants game.
[time=3015] Don't be a fan.
[time=3020] There's going to be things, lots of things that you're going to want to do this week.
[time=3024] It's going to be do it with family.
[time=3025] It's going to be go to this, do that.
[time=3028] You're going to, hopefully you can prepare sometime this week, multiple times this week to encounter Jesus.
[time=3038] Prepare to encounter Jesus because he is God.
[time=3044] He came, demonstrated his duty.
[time=3046] He is God.
[time=3048] He came in humility and peace.
[time=3051] He came as Lord and Savior and King.
[time=3055] And be confident of this.
[time=3057] He will receive praise, people.
[time=3062] Glory and honor that is do the King of kings and the Lord of lords.
[time=3066] The question is, is will he receive it from you or not from a heart that's been changed and been redeemed by the blood of Christ?
[time=3073] That's what you get to choose.
[time=3075] He's going to get it.
[time=3077] The only question is whether he gets it from Rick Raber or anybody else in this room at Blackhawk.
[time=3081] He's going to get it.
[time=3084] Because even the stones will cry out.
[time=3090] Will it be yours?
[time=3093] Will the praise be yours from an authentic, changed heart?
[time=3100] He's the King.
[time=3102] He deserves it.
[time=3103] And he's going to show you how much he deserves it this week.
[time=3107] Please, please stay close.
[time=3110] Don't be so busy.
[time=3112] Don't get so busy that you miss Jesus coming in all the ways that he did.
[time=3119] And next week we get to really celebrate his triumph over death, sin and the grave.
[time=3127] Because he is that.
[time=3129] And please celebrate.
[time=3131] But I will tell you this.
[time=3136] Please don't celebrate if it's not real.
[time=3141] If he hasn't changed your heart from a heart of stone to a heart of flesh, then don't pretend that he hasn't changed it.
[time=3148] Don't pretend that he has.
[time=3151] Don't come and sit in a pew next Sunday and act like Jesus has changed your heart and it's still hard.
[time=3160] That's called being a hypocrite.
[time=3164] Please, please give him worship from a changed heart as the foundation.
[time=3174] Pray with me.
[time=3176] Heavenly Father, we thank you for the privilege that we have.
[time=3181] Well, the privilege that we have are the Word of God speaking so clearly to you coming as a king, coming in full authority, coming as one, coming as one who takes a heart of stone and replaces it with a heart of flesh and puts a new spirit within us.
[time=3205] Please God, we all know, we all know this week and every week how much we need your forgiveness from the big pile of things that was up there.
[time=3219] Please Lord, please Holy Spirit, bring to our mind.
[time=3225] Keep us regularly understanding how much of a mess we are.
[time=3231] How much of a mess we are apart from you Jesus, but I'm so thankful that Romans 8 is really clear.
[time=3237] There is therefore now no condemnation for those that are in Christ Jesus, for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set us free from the law of sin and death.
[time=3249] Please God, please do that in the hearts of everyone sitting in this room today.
[time=3257] In Jesus name, amen.
[time=3287] I say, "Love and mercy." I say, "Love and mercy." I say, "Love and mercy." I say, "Love and mercy."
[time=3307] I say, "Love and mercy." I say, "Love and mercy." I say, "Love and mercy." I say, "Love and mercy." I say, "Love and mercy." I say, "Love and mercy." I say, "Love and mercy." Hosanna.
[time=3339] Hosanna.
[time=3343] Hosanna in the high end.
[time=3351] I see a generation rising up to take their place.
[time=3363] I say, "Love and mercy." I say, "Love and mercy." I say, "Love and mercy." I say, "Love and mercy." I say, "Love and mercy." I say, "Love and mercy." I say, "Love and mercy." Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[time=3399] Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[time=3549] [AMEN]
[time=3555] Thank you, Church, for worshiping with us today.
[time=3558] This week, prepare to encounter Jesus.
