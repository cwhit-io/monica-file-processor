[time=511] Down in the valley, when water's rise, I'm still believing, hope is alive.
[time=524] All through the struggle, and our mistake, I'll remember, down in the valley, when water's rise, I'm still believing, hope is alive.
[time=547] All through the struggle, and our mistake, I'll remember, the empty grave, the empty grave.
[time=568] I'll remember, yes, I'll remember, the empty grave.

[time=588] [APPLAUSE]
[time=598] Now, on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away.
[time=607] Had been taken away from the tomb.
[time=610] So she ran, and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved and said to them,
[time=618] "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they've laid him."
[time=624] So Peter went with the other disciple, and they were going toward the tomb.
[time=628] Both of them were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.
[time=635] And stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in.
[time=642] Then Simon Peter came following him, and he went into the tomb.
[time=647] He saw the linen cloths lying there, and the face cloth, which had been on Jesus' head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in a place by itself.
[time=662] Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed.
[time=671] For as yet, they did not understand the scripture that he must rise from the dead.
[time=678] Then the disciples went back to their homes.
[time=684] But Mary stood weeping outside of the tomb, and as she wept, she stooped to look into the tomb.
[time=692] And she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet.
[time=702] They said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She said to them, "They have taken away my Lord. I do not know where they've laid him."
[time=713] Having said this, she turned around and she saw Jesus standing there, but she didn't know that it was him.
[time=721] Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you seeking?"
[time=728] Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away."
[time=739] Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned to him and said in Aramaic, "Roboni," which means teacher.
[time=749] Jesus said to her, "Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to my Father, but go to my brothers and say to them, I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God."
[time=765] Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, "I have seen the Lord, and that he has said all of these things to her."
[time=777] He is risen.
[time=779] [AMEN] Yes.
[time=781] This morning, I want to talk about the prophecy, the proof, and the power of the resurrection.
[time=793] First of all, the prophecy of the resurrection.
[time=797] We have to understand that the resurrection of Jesus was not late breaking news in heaven.
[time=805] The prophecy that Jesus would rise from the dead comes much, much before even the time of Jesus.
[time=813] About a thousand years before Jesus was born, died, and rose again.
[time=819] We read in Psalm 16, "Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices, my body also will rest secure because you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your holy one see decay."
[time=837] David, Israel's second king, writes that, and some would say, "Well, he's writing about himself."
[time=845] But if you fast forward to the first century, the Apostle Paul explains in Acts chapter 13, when he explains about that time, he says this,
[time=855] "We bring you the good news that God promised to the fathers.
[time=859] This year has also fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus.
[time=863] As he also is written in the second Psalm, "You are my son, today I have begotten you.
[time=869] And as for the fact that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has spoken in this way, and now he calls from Psalm 16.
[time=879] I will give you to the holy one and sure blessing of David.
[time=883] Therefore he says also in another Psalm, "You will not let your holy one see corruption."
[time=889] For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep.
[time=895] Means he died and was laid with his fathers and saw corruption, but he whom God raised up did not seek corruption.
[time=904] Let it be known to you, therefore brothers and sisters, that through this man, forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything.
[time=916] So the fact that Jesus rose from the dead was prophesied about a thousand years before by King David.
[time=924] The fact that Jesus will raise from the dead was also prophesied by Isaiah about 700 years before.
[time=932] We like Isaiah 53 because he talks about Jesus, right?
[time=936] How he took his sin, our sin upon himself, and we like that verse.
[time=941] All we like sheep have gone astray.
[time=944] Each of us has gone to his own way, but God laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[time=949] And we like those verses.
[time=951] But chapter 53 ends with prophesying about Jesus' resurrection.
[time=957] Look, please, in verses 10 and 11 of Isaiah 53.
[time=962] Yet he was the will of the Lord to crush him.
[time=965] He has put him to grief when his soul makes an offering for sin.
[time=969] He shall see his offspring.
[time=971] He shall prolong his days. The will of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.
[time=976] Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied.
[time=980] By his knowledge shall the righteous one my servant make many to be accounted righteous,
[time=986] and he shall bear their iniquities.
[time=989] So it's okay to read Isaiah 53, and we have to read verses like he was despised and rejected by men.
[time=996] A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.
[time=1000] But we have to read to the end of the chapter when Isaiah prophesies not just about his death,
[time=1006] but also about his resurrection that he will raise from the dead.
[time=1012] When Jesus was here on earth and he walks with his disciples.
[time=1017] He told them over and over again not just about his death, but also about his resurrection.
[time=1024] I'm giving you an example from the Gospel of Mark.
[time=1027] In the Gospel of Mark, as Jesus and his disciples walk towards Jerusalem, Jesus tells him three separate times that he will die and the third day he will rise again.
[time=1038] Three times.
[time=1041] And I find it fascinating that after Jesus raises from the dead they still don't get it.
[time=1047] See, all day here when Jesus is speaking to them is about his death.
[time=1051] And they say, "No, that's not kind of Messiah we want or we need." And Jesus tells them not just about his death.
[time=1057] He tells them about his resurrection.
[time=1060] In Mark chapter 9 verses 30 to 32 they went on from there and passed through Galilee
[time=1068] and he did not want anyone to know for he was teaching his disciples saying the son of men is going to be delivered into the hands of men and they will kill him.
[time=1078] And when he is killed after three days he will rise.
[time=1083] He will rise. But notice what it follows after that.
[time=1087] But they did not understand the saying and were afraid to ask him.
[time=1094] When we read the Bible, my dear brothers and sisters, we have to read the whole Bible.
[time=1099] And not only do we have to read the whole Bible, we have to believe the whole Bible.
[time=1102] Not just the things we like to hear or we like to read.
[time=1107] And when Jesus speaks about his death, we also have to read about his resurrection.
[time=1112] And there is prophecy about Jesus' resurrection.
[time=1117] As I said before, this is not late breaking news in heaven.
[time=1121] Heaven wasn't surprised. Oh, what happened? Jesus was from the dead. No, no, no, no.
[time=1126] This was prophesied a thousand years before, 700 years before.
[time=1131] Jesus prophesied about his resurrection during his lifetime.
[time=1136] But do we have any proof about the resurrection?
[time=1139] And the answer is yes, it's not just about the prophecy, but it's about the proof of the resurrection.
[time=1145] There's first of all the testimonies of women. It's the passage that Jonathan and Penny have read from John chapter 20.
[time=1153] The testimony of women is one crucial proof about the historicity of the resurrection.
[time=1163] Here's how Gary Habermas puts it, and I quote, "If someone in the first century concocted a story in an attempt to deceive others,
[time=1173] we presume that they will not knowingly invent data that could hurt the credibility of the story.
[time=1181] When we come to the account of the empty tomb, women are listed as the primary witnesses.
[time=1189] They are not only the first witnesses mentioned, they are also mentioned in all four gospels,
[time=1195] whereas male witnesses appear only later and only in two gospels.
[time=1201] This would be another invention, since in both Jewish and Roman cultures, women were lowly esteemed and their testimony was regarded as questionable, questionable, certainly not as credible as a man's.
[time=1216] And yet when Jesus appears, he doesn't go to Jerusalem to appear to the high priest.
[time=1222] He doesn't even go to the male disciples. He first appears to Mary Magdalene.
[time=1227] That is a proof of the historicity of the resurrection.
[time=1231] If the disciples wanted to make up a story, they would have made it with a male character, not a female character.
[time=1237] There is proof about the resurrection. There's the proof of the women testifying about it again.
[time=1245] If you read here, what happens?
[time=1248] "Sir," Mary says, "if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away." Jesus said to her, "Mary, did Jesus preach to her some five-point sermon?"
[time=1263] What did Jesus do? Just call her by name.
[time=1267] We sing sometimes their song, "He Knows My Name." Someone wise one says, "Satan knows our name, but calls us by our sin."
[time=1280] Jesus knows our sin and calls us by our name.
[time=1285] "Mary, Mary," that's all he says.
[time=1290] She turned and said to him in our Maker, "Aboni," which means teacher, "Jesus said to her, 'Do not cling to me, for I have not ascended yet to the Father, but go to my brothers and say to them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, and your Father to my God.'" And you're God.
[time=1304] Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, "I have seen the Lord." Mary also becomes not just the first to testify about Jesus' resurrection.
[time=1313] She's not just the first witness, but she's the first evangelist.
[time=1317] "I have seen the Lord." That's all she says.
[time=1321] Again, when we share the Gospel with others, we don't have to go in through all these little fine points of theology.
[time=1327] All you have to say, "I have the risen Christ in my life.
[time=1332] I have seen the Lord." The proof of the resurrection is the testimony of women, and the proof of the resurrection is in the testimony of other eyewitnesses, also in John chapter 20.
[time=1348] Not only does Jesus appear to Mary, but he appears to the other disciples who were assembled behind closed doors, starting in verse 19.
[time=1358] On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being locked toward the disciples were for fear of the Jews.
[time=1364] Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, "Peace be with you." When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side.
[time=1372] Then the disciples were glad and they saw the Lord.
[time=1375] When they saw the Lord, Jesus said to them again, "Peace be with you." As the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you.
[time=1386] Not only do we have the proof of the testimony of women, we have the proof of the testimony of the disciples, and then we have the testimony of the personal testimony of the Apostle Paul.
[time=1399] In 1 Corinthians chapter 15, this is what he writes, starting in verse 3.
[time=1406] "For I deliver to you as the first importance what I have received, that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to see us," which is Peter, "then to the twelve.
[time=1423] Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep.
[time=1430] But I like this last part of the verse best.
[time=1435] Then he appeared to James, then to all the Apostles, last of all.
[time=1441] As to one untimely born, he appeared also to me."
[time=1447] We call this the testimony of the power and the proof of the personal testimony.
[time=1453] We can talk about the testimony of women, we can talk about the testimony of the others, of the disciples, or the five hundred, or Peter and James, but there's nothing like saying to people, "I have experienced the power of the resurrection in my own life.
[time=1469] Jesus has appeared to me, through the Holy Spirit he lives inside of me."
[time=1477] Many years ago, all him was written.
[time=1482] It's about a question.
[time=1484] You ask me how I know he lives.
[time=1487] What's the answer?
[time=1488] He lives within my heart.
[time=1491] You ask me how I know he lives.
[time=1494] That's one of the strongest proofs he lives within my heart.
[time=1499] That's why our lives need to look different than those of the world.
[time=1504] It is not enough to say Jesus is alive.
[time=1507] I have to show that in the way I live my life every day.
[time=1512] There is the proof of God Jesus appearing to women.
[time=1517] There is the proof of Jesus appearing to the disciples and the five hundred and to Paul.
[time=1522] But we also have that personal testimony where we have to say he has appeared to me.
[time=1528] He lives within my heart.
[time=1533] There is proof of the resurrection.
[time=1536] If you say, "I don't believe because there is no proof," you don't believe not because there is no proof, you don't believe because you choose not to believe.
[time=1548] To believe or not to believe is a choice.
[time=1552] But there is prophecy and there is proof.
[time=1555] But the most important thing I think about this is the power of the resurrection.
[time=1561] And this is where Paul writes in Philippians chapter 3.
[time=1565] If you have your Bibles, please open to Philippians chapter 3, if not you have this part of this text in your bulletin.
[time=1572] The power of the resurrection is seen in a life radically changed.
[time=1579] And that's what I say.
[time=1581] If we say we are saved, if we say that we have experienced Jesus' death and resurrection in our lives, we have to show it in the way we speak, in the way we think, in the way we act.
[time=1593] It's got to be different than the world.
[time=1596] The power of the resurrection is seen in our life radically changed by first recognizing our spiritual bankruptcy.
[time=1604] Listen to what Paul writes in Philippians 3 starting in verse 7.
[time=1610] But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ.
[time=1616] Indeed, I count everything as loss, I'm bankrupt, he said.
[time=1622] Because of the surpassing worth of knowing Jesus Christ, Christ Jesus, my Lord.
[time=1629] For his sake, I have suffered the loss of all things, and I count them as rubbish,
[time=1635] dung other translations say garbage in order that I may gain Christ.
[time=1644] So if you want to experience the power of the resurrection first, you need to experience this loss.
[time=1650] You need to go through bankruptcy, not financial, but spiritual.
[time=1655] And Paul says, notice in these two verses, he says three times the word loss.
[time=1661] Whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ.
[time=1666] Indeed, I counted everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus, my Lord.
[time=1672] For his sake, I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as garbage.
[time=1678] My dear brothers and sisters, if we say that we have experienced the power of the resurrection,
[time=1684] we need to identify the garbage in our lives, and we need to get rid of it.
[time=1689] When we experience the power of the resurrection, our value system changes.
[time=1696] How we treat our spouses changes, how we treat our children changes, how we respond to our neighbors changes,
[time=1703] what we do with our money changes, everything changes.
[time=1708] But I first need to change my value system.
[time=1711] I need to realize what is loss, what is garbage, and what I need to get rid of, and I need to understand what I gain when I gain Christ.
[time=1723] Recognizing our spiritual bankruptcy.
[time=1729] Paul had a change, by the way, in his life.
[time=1733] He wasn't born as a disciple of Jesus Christ.
[time=1737] He actually testifies how he has grown, and he became a Pharisee.
[time=1744] A Pharisee of Pharisees, he says, but then Christ meets him on the road to Damascus.
[time=1750] You see, Paul was so against the followers of Jesus Christ that he wanted to kill them.
[time=1756] Starting in Acts chapter 9, we read, "But souls still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord
[time=1763] went to the high priest and asked him for letters to synagogues in Damascus so that if he found any belonging to the way,
[time=1771] men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem." Now, as he went on his way, he approached Damascus and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him
[time=1781] and falling to the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, "Soul, soul, why are you persecuting me?"
[time=1787] And he said, "Who are you, Lord?" And he said, "I am Jesus whom you are persecuting, but rise and enter the city
[time=1795] and you will be told what you are to do." Talk about your life radically changed.
[time=1802] That's a big change from death to life.
[time=1805] That's a big change, right?
[time=1807] From being a persecutor of the church to being its leader, that's a change.
[time=1811] Some argue that Paul is the greatest, one of the greatest theologians who ever lived.
[time=1817] From the persecutor of the church, he becomes its leader.
[time=1821] Only God can do that.
[time=1823] And only the power of the resurrection does that, and he can do that in your life.
[time=1828] Maybe you're not persecuting believers, but maybe you're living in sin, in addiction, in other sins.
[time=1835] Then only you know Jesus can't change that.
[time=1839] There's power in the resurrection.
[time=1841] In another letter, Paul says, "The same power that raised Jesus from the dead lives in you right now."
[time=1848] That's power.
[time=1850] Then why are we sometimes living as though it's still good Friday?
[time=1854] Sometimes we still live like it's still Friday.
[time=1857] But we need to live like there's resurrection Sunday.
[time=1861] The apostle Paul is an example of a life radically changed, but he first had to realize that without Jesus,
[time=1869] he is bankrupt and he needs to lose everything.
[time=1876] The power of the resurrection is still seen in three things.
[time=1880] First of all, recognizing not just our spiritual bankruptcy, but recognizing our spiritual wealth.
[time=1887] You see, you have to lose certain things, but when you come to Jesus Christ, when you accept Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, you gain things.
[time=1896] Not only do you gain forgiveness of sin and eternal life, but these are three words that I want us to focus on this morning.
[time=1904] Salvation, sanctification and glorification, they all come from Philippians chapter 3 verses 9-3-11.
[time=1915] This shows our spiritual wealth.
[time=1918] What do we gain when we accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior?
[time=1922] How does the power of the resurrection change us?
[time=1925] First of all, salvation.
[time=1928] We're going to talk about the three tenses of being saved.
[time=1931] Salvation talks about the past tense.
[time=1934] When you accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, you are saved from the penalty of sin.
[time=1941] That happened in the past.
[time=1943] When you gave your life to Jesus Christ, you are saved from the penalty of sin.
[time=1947] That's past tense.
[time=1950] Paul says that in verse 9.
[time=1955] Not only does he say that I may gain Christ, but be found in him not having righteousness of my own that comes from the law,
[time=1963] but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith.
[time=1969] When you give your life to Jesus Christ, when you believe in him, you are saved from the penalty of sin.
[time=1975] That has happened already in the past, when you give your life to Christ.
[time=1979] For me, it happened on October 2, 1983.
[time=1982] I remember like it was yesterday.
[time=1984] When I raised my hand and I said, I want to give my life to Christ.
[time=1987] I'm done living in sin.
[time=1990] But also there's a second word, sanctification.
[time=1995] That's in the present.
[time=1996] We are being saved from the power of sin.
[time=2004] None of us are completely holy.
[time=2007] We still make mistakes, right?
[time=2009] All you have to do is look inside your heart.
[time=2012] All you have to do is look inside your life, what you did from yesterday to today.
[time=2017] Or in my case, what I taught this morning.
[time=2021] You see, the past ends in salvation.
[time=2024] Christ has died.
[time=2025] You have accepted.
[time=2026] That's the past.
[time=2028] Christ saved us from the penalty of sin.
[time=2032] But I am being saved.
[time=2034] That's in the present from the power of sin.
[time=2037] That's called sanctification.
[time=2039] And this is a painful process.
[time=2041] Verse 10, that I may know him and the power of resurrection and may share his what?
[time=2049] Does anybody know?
[time=2050] Suffering.
[time=2051] Oh, we don't like that.
[time=2054] We like the power of the resurrection, don't we?
[time=2057] But notice that in the same text it talks about that we are being saved from the power
[time=2064] of sin.
[time=2065] Christ, God is sanctifying us through the Holy Spirit to look more like Christ.
[time=2070] In order to do that, we have to share in his sufferings becoming like him and his death.
[time=2076] Oh man, that's tough.
[time=2079] And you know what?
[time=2080] God uses people to sanctify us.
[time=2085] God uses circumstances to sanctify us.
[time=2091] Maybe it's a boss you work for.
[time=2095] Maybe it's an unfaithful spouse.
[time=2098] Maybe it's a rebellious child.
[time=2101] And God is shaping us and molding us in the image of his son Jesus Christ.
[time=2108] And that's called sanctification.
[time=2112] We don't like that, right?
[time=2114] We don't like that part of to be, to share in his sufferings.
[time=2119] But it's right there in the text.
[time=2121] It's right there.
[time=2122] I want to know the power of his resurrection, but I have to share in his sufferings
[time=2131] that I may know him and the power of his resurrection.
[time=2134] That's in the same verse where we have that I may share in his sufferings becoming like him in his death.
[time=2141] But there's the last one, glorification.
[time=2143] When we get to heaven, we will be free from the presence of sin.
[time=2148] No more sin.
[time=2150] No more tears.
[time=2152] No more cancer.
[time=2153] No more being laid off from your work.
[time=2155] No more bad news.
[time=2157] No more like that because we will be glorified.
[time=2160] But until then, we're in the middle.
[time=2164] But in order to get to the glorification, you've got to go through salvation except Christ as your Lord and Savior.
[time=2170] And you have to go through this process of sanctification that takes from the moment you are saved, until the moment you enter the promised land.
[time=2179] And when we get there, that's when we'll be glorified.
[time=2184] Why didn't Jesus just take us from salvation to glorification right away?
[time=2192] Because he has a work to do with us here in Fort Wayne, Indiana, for such a time as this.
[time=2199] And we have to go through this process, but I know that in the end, verse 11 will happen that I by my enemy is possible.
[time=2206] I may attain the resurrection from the dead.
[time=2212] Chuck Swindol put it like this and I love it.
[time=2214] He said, "We are not in the land of the living going to the land of the dying."
[time=2220] No, no, no.
[time=2221] We are in the land of the dying going into the land of the living.
[time=2226] Because only when we're going to be glorified with our glorified bodies, only that is going to be true, true life.
[time=2234] But in order to get there, you have to accept Jesus Christ as your personal order and Savior.
[time=2239] You have to surrender your life to him and you have to go from salvation to the glorification through this plus process called sanctification.
[time=2247] And it's hard because I have to share in his sufferings.
[time=2254] We sang this morning the same power that crushed the enemy, the same power lives in me.
[time=2263] Jesus has given us the power that comes from the presence of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2269] Do you have that?
[time=2271] Do you have power every day?
[time=2273] If Jesus Christ is your Lord and Savior, you have power.
[time=2276] You have the Holy Spirit and the same power that raised Jesus from the dead is with you day by day.
[time=2284] Everything changes.
[time=2287] Life radically changed.
[time=2291] Let me close with an illustration.
[time=2294] It's a little long illustration and I promise my family I will not cry so I'm going to try that this morning.
[time=2302] This is the closing illustration that talks about the life radically changed, how your thought process changes,
[time=2311] what you do with your money changes, everything changes.
[time=2314] It's an illustration from a family that lived in the 1940s.
[time=2320] And I'm going to read it, so please, please bear with me.
[time=2324] I'll never forget Easter of 1946.
[time=2328] I was 14.
[time=2330] My little sister, O.C., was 12 and my older sister, Darlene, 16.
[time=2335] We lived at home with our mother and the four of us knew what it was like to do without many things.
[time=2340] My dad had died five years before, leaving mom with seven school kids to raise their no money.
[time=2347] By 1946, my older sisters were married and my brothers had left home.
[time=2352] A month before Easter, the pastor of our church announced a special Easter offering would be taken to help a poor family.
[time=2359] He asked everyone to save and give sacrificially.
[time=2362] When we got home, we talked about what we could do.
[time=2366] We decided to buy 50 pounds of potatoes and live on them for a month.
[time=2371] This would allow us to save $20 of our grocery money for an offering.
[time=2376] Then we thought if we kept our electric lights turned as out as much as possible and didn't listen to the radio, we'd save money on that month's electric bill.
[time=2385] Darlene got as many house and cleaning yard cleaning jobs as possible, and both of us babysat for everyone we could.
[time=2392] For 50 cents, we could buy enough cotton loops to make three potholders to sell for a dollar.
[time=2397] We made $20 on potholders.
[time=2400] That month was the best of our lives.
[time=2403] Every day, we counted the money to see how much we had saved.
[time=2406] At night, we'd sit in the dark and talk about how the poor family was going to enjoy having the money the church would give them.
[time=2413] We had 80 people in our church, so we figured that whatever amount of money we gave,
[time=2419] the offering would be 20 times as much.
[time=2422] After all, every Sunday, the pastor had reminded everyone to save for the sacrificial offering.
[time=2428] The day before Easter, OC and I walked to the grocery store and I got the manager to give us three crisp $20 bills
[time=2436] and one $10 bill for our change.
[time=2439] We ran all the way home to show Mom and Darlene.
[time=2441] We had never had so much money before.
[time=2444] Down at night, we were so excited we could hardly sleep.
[time=2447] We didn't care that we couldn't have new clothes for Easter.
[time=2450] We had $70 for the sacrificial offering.
[time=2454] We could hardly wait to go to church on Sunday morning.
[time=2457] It rained, it was pouring.
[time=2459] We didn't own an umbrella and the church was over a mile from our home, but it didn't seem to matter how we got wet.
[time=2465] Darlene had cardboard in her shoes to fill the holes.
[time=2468] The cardboard came apart and her feet got wet, but we sat in church proudly.
[time=2474] Despite how we looked, I heard some teenagers talking about the Smith girls having own their old dresses.
[time=2480] I looked at them in their new clothes and I felt so rich.
[time=2484] When the sacrificial offering was taken, we were sitting on the second row from the front.
[time=2489] Mom put in the $10 bill and each of us girls put a $20.
[time=2492] As we walked home after church, we sang all the way.
[time=2495] A lunch Mom had surprised us.
[time=2498] She had bought a dozen eggs and we had boiled Easter eggs with our fried potatoes.
[time=2504] Late that afternoon the minister drove up in his car.
[time=2508] Mom went to the door, talked to him for a moment.
[time=2513] And then he came back with an envelope in her hand.
[time=2517] We asked what it was, but she didn't say a word.
[time=2522] She opened the envelope and out fell a bunch of money.
[time=2525] There were three crisp $20 bills, one $10 bill, and 17 $1 bills.
[time=2535] Mom put the money back in the envelope, we didn't talk, but instead just stared at the floor.
[time=2542] We had gone from feeling like millionaires to feeling like poor white trash.
[time=2551] We kids had such a happy life that we felt sorry for anyone who didn't have our Mom and Dad for parents.
[time=2559] And a house full of brothers and sisters and our kids visiting constantly.
[time=2563] We thought it was fun to share silverware and see whether we got a fork or the spoon that night.
[time=2570] We had two knives, which we passed around to whoever needed them.
[time=2575] I knew we didn't have a lot, but I never thought we were poor.
[time=2582] That Easter day I found out we were poor.
[time=2586] The minister had brought us the money for the poor family, so we must be poor.
[time=2591] We didn't want to go to church next Sunday, but Mom said we had to.
[time=2594] Although it was a sunny day, we didn't talk on the way.
[time=2597] Mom started to sing, but no one joined in, and she only sang one verse.
[time=2601] At church we had a missionary speaker.
[time=2604] He talked about churches in Africa and how they made buildings out of sun, dried bricks, how they needed money to buy roofs.
[time=2612] He said, $100 would put a roof on a church.
[time=2617] Can't we all sacrifice to help these poor people?
[time=2622] We looked at each other and smiled for the first time in a week.
[time=2626] Mom reached into her purse and pulled out the envelope.
[time=2630] She passed it to Darlene. Darlene gave it to me and I handed it out to Ose.
[time=2634] Ose put her in the offering plate when the offering was counted.
[time=2638] The minister announced that it was a little over $100.
[time=2643] The missionary was excited.
[time=2646] He hadn't expressed such a large offering from our small church.
[time=2651] He said, "You must have some rich people in this church."
[time=2658] Suddenly he struck us.
[time=2661] We gave $87 out of the 100.
[time=2668] We were the rich family of the church.
[time=2672] Hadn't the missionary said so? Deep down I knew that we actually were a rich family.
[time=2682] That, my dear brothers and sisters, can only happen through the power of the resurrection.
[time=2687] The changes the way we look at things, the changes the way we look at people, the changes the way we look at our clothes, the changes that we look at our money, the changes everything have you experienced the power of the resurrection.
[time=2702] If you haven't, if you're sick and tired of living with your sin and living in sin,
[time=2709] I'm going to ask that this morning you make that the day of salvation.
[time=2713] Give your life to Jesus Christ today.
[time=2716] He's going to give you forgiveness of sin and eternal life.
[time=2720] He will take you from salvation to glorification, but you'll have to go through sanctification.
[time=2726] I'm not telling you that all your problems will be solved.
[time=2728] Your bank account will now be full.
[time=2730] You have become the vice president of your company.
[time=2732] That's not what I'm telling you.
[time=2733] The only thing I can tell you is what God has promised.
[time=2736] For gain rest of sin, salvation, a place in heaven, glorification, and in the middle, suffering with Him until you get there.
[time=2747] That's all I can offer you because that's what God offers you.
[time=2750] We're going to close by singing together.
[time=2754] But if you want to come and kneel down here and give your life to Christ or maybe read, dedicate your life, come to business with God as we sing.
[time=2761] There will be elders here that will want to pray with you.
[time=2765] But again, don't live without the power of the resurrection.
[time=2772] The power of the resurrection can be seen in a radically changed life.
[time=2777] And I hope you'll experience that this morning.
[time=2780] Let us pray.
[time=2782] Dear father, we thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ into the world to die for sinners such as I.
[time=2790] But thank you for the power of the Holy Spirit, for the power of the resurrection, that we can have a radically changed life because of your salvation, because of the glorification that's waiting for us.
[time=2802] But we even thank you for the sanctification that's happening today.
[time=2807] We thank you for the difficult people you have put in our lives that you are allowing us to suffer like you have.
[time=2814] Forgive us for the times when we complain and gripe about that.
[time=2818] I pray that today will be the day of salvation for those who have not yet received Christ as the Lord and Savior.
[time=2824] I pray that today will be the day of salvation and they will experience the power of the resurrection, the power that raised Christ from the dead lives in us.
[time=2833] We thank you for that.
[time=2835] Forgive us for the times when we live like it's still Friday.
[time=2840] Help us to live in the power of the resurrection Sunday, not just today but every day.
[time=2844] And to go and tell the lost world that we have seen the Lord.
[time=2849] We have seen the risen Lord.
[time=2851] And may that be evident in the way we speak, in the way we act, in the way we think.
[time=2859] In Christ's name I pray. Amen.
