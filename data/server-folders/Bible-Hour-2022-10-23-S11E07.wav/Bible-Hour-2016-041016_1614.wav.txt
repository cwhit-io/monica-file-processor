[time=1416] great is thy faithfulness, Lord unto thee.
[time=1431] It's praise.
[time=1435] Thank you, Lord.
[time=1438] From Mount Hore, they set out by the way to the Red Sea to go around the land of
[time=1445] Edom and the people became impatient on the way and the people spoke against God
[time=1452] and against Moses saying why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no food and no water and we loath this worthless food.
[time=1463] Then the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people so that many people of Israel died and the people came to Moses and said we've sinned but we have spoken against the Lord and against you.
[time=1476] Pray to the Lord that he take away the serpents from us so Moses prayed for the people and the Lord said to Moses make a fiery serpent
[time=1487] and set it on a pole and everyone who is bitten when he sees it shall live so Moses made a bronze serpent
[time=1495] and set it on a pole and if a serpent bit anyone he would look at that broad serpent and live.
[time=1504] Good morning.
[time=1509] If you have your Bibles, please open to the Book of Numbers chapter 21.
[time=1514] If you don't have your Bibles, there are Bibles in the pews in front of you.
[time=1518] This is a new development, new and welcome development and it's on page 74 of your pew Bibles.
[time=1528] For those of you who are new, we are in a series called the Gospel project that started back in September.
[time=1537] It's actually a children's curriculum.
[time=1542] Our children are doing that in their classes and leadership decided it's a good idea for us to follow the same curriculum which is great. We're going through the Bible, 18 months in the Old Testament and 18 months in the New Testament and we started in September and we are in the Book of Numbers and starting next Sunday we'll be in the Book of Joshua. But this morning I'm going to start with Numbers when I'm going to end up in the Book of John and you might ask how can you do that and it's a thing called biblical theology
[time=1577] that we have learned here to do here at Black Hawk over the years. I did not come up with it by the way. It's been around for many, many years.
[time=1586] But it originates with what Jesus says after he rises from the dead.
[time=1592] In Luke chapter 24, since we just celebrated a resurrection last Sunday, you know on the road to Emma, you see encounters to disciples that are very, very sad and he said to them, "Why is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?" And they're puzzled that he's the only one who hasn't heard. And then Jesus actually rebukes them and says, "Oh foolish ones and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken was not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory." And beginning with Moses, that's where we are in the Book of Numbers,
[time=1632] beginning with Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy,
[time=1638] and all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. In other words, Jesus is rebuking the disciples that if they
[time=1648] reveal a testament, not understanding that he points to himself to Jesus, we have missed the point. And in today's passage, it's actually very beautiful, makes it very easy for me that the author of the gospel of John, John, actually quotes from Numbers 21. So we're starting in the Old Testament,
[time=1671] but we're going to end up in the New Testament. But the story starts, as Kirsten has read in Numbers chapter 21, and he starts,
[time=1682] unfortunately, with the people sinning. The people sin, and as we see here,
[time=1690] their sin is a compounded sin, impatience leads to anger, which leads to grumbling and complaining, and all of these things are rooted in ungratfulness. Ungratfulness. People became impatient on the way,
[time=1707] and the people spoke against God and against Moses. Why have you brought us out
[time=1713] of Egypt to die in the wilderness for there's no food and no water, and we loathe this worthless food. Instead of saying thank you, Lord,
[time=1722] for providing for us mana from heaven for 40 years, they call what God gives them worthless.
[time=1730] Have you ever done that? Have I ever done that?
[time=1737] God is giving us the word of God, and we go home and we say that was
[time=1745] a waste of time. Or God is giving us worship leaders, and they lead us in worship through music, and they say I didn't like that song because I didn't know it. And everything becomes about us, rather than about
[time=1760] God. Have you ever called worthless something God gave you?
[time=1765] God is giving you a precious wife, and you call her worthless.
[time=1772] Maybe it's time I dear brothers and sisters to repent this morning.
[time=1777] Whatever God is giving us is a gift from God to call that worthless is a sin against God Himself. And it's all rooted in ungratfulness.
[time=1789] The ungratfulness, which is actually rooted in pride because you know what?
[time=1792] We deserve better, right? That's all it is. I don't deserve this. I deserve something better, and it's all rooted in that, and the people sin, and what happens here, that people suffer the consequences of sin. The fact that the wages of sin is death is not a new testament development. Oh no.
[time=1811] The wages of sin is death. We see back in Genesis chapter 3, and we see it in Exodus, and we see Leviticus, and numbers, and astronomy. We see it in each book of the Bible.
[time=1823] The wages of sin is death, but what's interesting here, there is no warning. God doesn't say, "Hey, be careful." There is no call to repentance. The Bible is just simply that God is judging the people, and they suffer the consequence of their sin. Then the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they beat the people so that many people of Israel died. Later, the apostle will write this, "Do not be deceived." God is not
[time=1853] mocked. "Whatever a man shall sow, so shall he reap." Don't think you can play with God. That's what I've been saying all along.
[time=1861] Take God seriously. Take God at his word.
[time=1866] Hear the people suffer the consequence of sin, and the consequence is death. The wages of sin
[time=1878] is death. Is this the first time they're sinning in the wilderness? Is this the first time they die because of their sin?
[time=1884] No, actually it's been happening for 40 years, but apparently they don't learn. They don't learn from their mistakes, and they don't learn from the previous generation mistakes, but the people come to their senses, and they confess their sins, and Moses intercedes for them, verse 7.
[time=1901] And the people came to Moses and said, "We have sinned." That's a great place to start. We have sinned. For we have spoken against the Lord and against you.
[time=1911] Pray to the Lord that he take away the serpents from us, so Moses prayed for the people. Again, Moses the leader becomes Moses the intercessor, which tells us that a leader is always an intercessor. The person who leads, the pastor who leads, needs to be a person, a pastor who prays for his people. And a pastor who leads needs to be a pastor who knows the name of his flock.
[time=1936] The Israelites have complained and rebelled many times.
[time=1944] But notice, please, what confession entails. Notice, please, this is not easy believerism. Confession must be addressed to the wrong party. Notice, please, here. Verse 15 again says, "We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord and against you." Notice, there's a very specific confession of sin.
[time=1967] And sometimes when we go to God with our confessions, we say, "Oh, Lord, forgive me because, you know, I might have made a mistake." You know what? The Holy Spirit tells you exactly what throne you have done, and you have to confess specifically to the sin you have you have sinned. Confession must be specific.
[time=1985] Don't say, "Please forgive our sin." No. Please forgive me the sin of ungratfulness. Please forgive me the sin of rebellion.
[time=1992] Please forgive me the sin of whatever it is I have sinned. I have to be very specific in my confession. The people have done this correctly here.
[time=2000] And also, I want to point out something very important in confession.
[time=2005] Confession must be as public or as private as the sin itself.
[time=2010] Let me say that again. Confession must be as public or private as the sin itself. The people have sinned publicly, right? So they have to confess they're sinned publicly.
[time=2024] But if you've seen privately, please don't come up here and confess your sin.
[time=2028] That's not biblical. I attended a chapel service many, many years ago when I went to seminary my first year.
[time=2036] And it took place there, so one thing that was very interesting was called the revival. And I have no doubt that the revival was sincere and many people came to repent of their sins.
[time=2050] But I wasn't something that I thought it was very strange. A guy got up on the stage and said, "I committed adultery with that guy's wife." What did he do? Not only did he confess his
[time=2064] sin, but he confessed that guy, that guy's wife's a sin.
[time=2071] But you know what, everybody's celebrating. So, oh, so beautiful they confessing their sin. That is not biblical.
[time=2078] Confession of sin must be as public or as private as the sin itself.
[time=2082] They sinned publicly and they are confessing their sin publicly.
[time=2089] They pray for the serpents to be taken away from them, but God has another solution. Notice, please how God provides solution. It comes from the sermon title, comes from this verse.
[time=2100] Look up and live. That's how verse 9 ends. That's the idea.
[time=2107] Look up and live. The people say, "Take the serpents away, but God has another solution. God provides salvation and says to Moses, "Make a fiery serpent and set it on a pole, and everyone who is bitten when he sees it shall live." So Moses made a bronze serpent. In some of your versions it says copper. Some people say because that's why it looks fiery.
[time=2132] "Set it on a pole and if a serpent bit anyone he would look at the bronze serpent and live." The message is very clear.
[time=2139] Look up and live. Look up and live. Was that a good thing
[time=2148] God did for them to provide salvation? Yes.
[time=2151] But do you know what they did with that serpent?
[time=2155] Can you imagine? What would you have done with that serpent?
[time=2158] The bronze serpent, the one day God basically used to bring salvation to them.
[time=2165] In 2 Kings chapter 18 tells us that actually these people,
[time=2171] do you know what they took that serpent?
[time=2173] And they actually worshiped that serpent.
[time=2177] The bronze serpent. Think about that. This is 700 years later we read when King Hoshaya comes to the throne and makes reforms.
[time=2187] This is what we're told that he removed the high places and broke the pillars and cut down the ashira which is another pole that used to worship.
[time=2198] And he broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made for until those days the people of Israel had made offerings to it.
[time=2209] What did you catch that? The serpent that God used to bring them salvation instead of worshiping God they worshiped the actual serpent.
[time=2220] Will these people ever learn? Will God give salvation to these people who never never learn? What will they ever learn?
[time=2230] If your Bible is turned to John chapter 3 and I have good news that God does provide salvation for not just for those people then but for us today.
[time=2242] And before we have the beautiful golden verse for God's soul of the world.
[time=2248] That he gave his only son there whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. We have verses 14 and 15 which John quotes and tells us that God still provides salvation.
[time=2263] But not through a serpent but still to someone being exalted
[time=2269] on a pole in this case on a cross. So when John comes along he presents the cross which we have central here as the place of exaltation. Notice please that the language John uses as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness
[time=2290] so must the son of men be lifted up that whoever believes in him may have eternal life and then we have for God so loved the world.
[time=2300] That is the context here. Just as God provided salvation when he told Moses to put up this serpent on a pole God says now I'm going to provide salvation by lifting up my son onto the cross. If you read the gospel of John
[time=2318] we just commemorated good Friday. If you read the gospel of John it's so different than Matthew Mark and Luke. Matthew Mark and Luke focus on the horror of Jesus's death. The cross is the instrument of torture.
[time=2335] Jesus suffers in the hand of those he came to save.
[time=2339] It's horrific but if you read in the gospel of John he focuses on something totally different. In the gospel of John calm is is consistent is constant all the time
[time=2355] calm pervades throughout. John doesn't mention the shocking details of darkness covering the earth.
[time=2362] He doesn't cover the mocking crowd. All John does he focuses on Jesus and the
[time=2368] cross and the cross is not an instrument of torture but a place where Jesus will be lifted up. You see that verb the son of men must
[time=2378] be lifted up four times in the gospel of John.
[time=2382] John uses that term to refer to Jesus.
[time=2386] John 3 14 as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so must the son of men be lifted up. John 8 28 Jesus said to them when you lift it up the son of man then you will know that I am he. John 12 32 and I when I am lifted up from
[time=2404] the earth will draw all people to myself.
[time=2408] The cross for John is not an instrument of torture but a place of exaltation where the son of men is lifted up for the salvation of all who believe. It's beautiful
[time=2422] it's beautiful and Jesus is is the king.
[time=2427] He by the way don't you think that the other gospel writers knew that when Jesus was crucified they had the inscription Jesus the Nazarene
[time=2440] king of the Jews don't you think the other gospel writers knew that but for some reason John alone states that the inscription was in Hebrew Latin and Greek because for John the cross is not just the place of exaltation the cross is a place of coronation Jesus is king.
[time=2461] Yeah John uses the Old Testament in a beautiful way and says as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so much the son of men be lifted up but the cross is the place of exaltation and the cross is the place of coronation and Jesus is king.
[time=2478] Now not everybody will accept that but that is the truth that is the truth. One scholar put it like this the cross is not a sign of Jesus's defeat it is a part of God's plan a plan with which Jesus is in full agreement on over which he is in full control. Jesus is not a powerless victim Jesus did not die as a martyr he went to the cross voluntarily Octavius Winslow puts it like this who delivers up who delivered up Jesus to die not Judas for money nor pilot for fear nor the Jews for envy but the father for love. For God so loved the world
[time=2524] that he gave and for John the cross is the place of exaltation the cross is the place of coronation Jesus is not a victim Jesus is the king and it's written in Hebrew Latin and Greek
[time=2540] because he's a universal king for all who believe
[time=2546] Jesus made it clear in his teaching I am the good shepherd the good shepherd lays down his life. I lay down my life for my sheep
[time=2557] John 10 15 John 10 17 and 18 Jesus said for this reason the father loves me because I lay down my life that I may take it up again no one takes it from me but I lay down on my own accord I have authority to lay down and I have authority to take it up again discharge I have received from my father this is how this sign could have looked like we know that those are the Hebrew
[time=2587] Aramaic Aramaic and Hebrew are sister languages and then you have the Latin and then you have the Greek. Once upon a tree there was a king
[time=2604] Calvin Miller writes he died under the trilingual sign that proclaimed in rex basileos melech king. My friend and mentor Dr.
[time=2614] Homer Kent writes in his John commentary by this inscription pilot was getting back at the Jewish leaders who had harassed him throughout the trial he said in effect this unfortunate victim is the only kind of king you Jews will ever have and he's the kind you deserve how tragic they neither pilot nor the nation realized that those words written so unwittingly were actually the truth. The charge becomes a worldwide proclamation of Christ's entromment the king who is mocked as king is actually the king and John makes it clear as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so much the son of God be lifted up and the cross is the place of exaltation and the cross is the place of coronation and Jesus is the king but Jesus is not just the king Jesus is the Passover lamb who takes away the sin of the world when when John introduces Jesus in chapter 1 verse 29 he says behold the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the of the world. Anus they we sing that mostly at Christmas
[time=2685] but it's actually a Easter message. Anus they he told his peccata Mundi behold the lamb who takes away the the sin of the world and yet we sing it at Christmas and not at Easter that's an interesting thing I don't know why maybe we should sing it about both times but the reason we know that John focuses here on Jesus as the Passover lamb is because he's the only one in the gospel dimensions the word hissop. See the Bible says here that when they crucified Jesus they put a sponge full of the sour wine upon a
[time=2722] branch of hissop and brought it up to his mouth.
[time=2727] Again let me ask you didn't the other gospel writers knew that?
[time=2731] They knew that but John wants to focus on that because it's a very important thing that he wants to connect it with another episode in the Old Testament and that episode is the Exodus event. Remember in the in the Exodus event God says if you want to live you will put blood on the doorpost. Do you remember that? And the angel of that will pass over you.
[time=2755] That's why they're celebrating the Passover right?
[time=2757] Well in Exodus we are told that what they use
[time=2764] to put blood on to dip in blood and put on the doorpost is actually a branch of hissop. It's in the text. It's in Exodus
[time=2775] chapter 12 verse 22. Hissop was used to dip in blood and sprinkle on the doorpost and John correlates that event
[time=2786] with the crucifixion when he says Jesus as he was dying on the cross
[time=2793] they put sour wine on a branch of hissop because this is no ordinary man this is the lamb of God the Passover lamb who takes away the sin of the world he connects it with Exodus. My dear brothers and sisters we cannot understand the New Testament if we don't know the Old Testament and we don't understand the Old Testament if we don't know the New Testament there are two Testaments but one Bible. John presents Jesus here
[time=2824] as the Passover lamb who takes away the sin of the world so Paul comes and says in 1 Corinthians 5-7 Christ our Passover lamb has been sacrificed. So what does John do?
[time=2838] Oh I love this. For John the cross is not just the place of exaltation
[time=2844] the cross is not just the place of coronation and Jesus is king but for John he transforms the cross into an altar on which the Passover lamb is sacrificed for us oh that's beautiful. So if you have a cross if you wear a cross
[time=2861] I don't know why you do the cross but use that as a conversation starter and tell people you know what some people might think of this as an instrument of torture but I think of it that reminds me of the lamb of God who took away my sin.
[time=2876] For me the cross is the place of exaltation.
[time=2880] For me the cross is the place of coronation and Jesus is my king and for me the cross is an altar on which the peace of glory died.
[time=2892] The question is is Jesus your savior? You see Jesus is the savior.
[time=2902] The question is is he your savior? If Jesus Christ is now your lord and savior
[time=2909] maybe today is the day when you can look up and live.
[time=2913] Look up and live. Look at the cross that's empty because Jesus rose again from the dead and that's why we celebrated last Sunday we celebrated the resurrection.
[time=2926] I know some of you are asking anything can anything come good from Russia?
[time=2931] I know some of you are asking that question every day but I'm going to tell you one thing I'm going to teach you one word that actually there's something good that comes from Russia is a word for the word Sunday. In Russian the word for Sunday is the
[time=2948] word Vaschresenia. You appear after me Vaschresenia.
[time=2955] Do you know what it means? It means resurrection.
[time=2961] For them every Sunday is resurrection Sunday and that should be that true for us too.
[time=2968] So next time you think about the KGB think about Vaschresenia that every Sunday is resurrection Sunday and we should live not as though it's good Friday but we should live every day as though it's resurrection Sunday and Jesus transforms that. Look up and live. Well when I say that I don't mean
[time=2992] yeah I get a cross and maybe get a picture of Jesus and look at Jesus make this an optic exercise that's not what it means.
[time=2999] To look up to Jesus means to put your trust in Jesus.
[time=3003] To put your trust alone for your salvation.
[time=3007] That's what salvation is and that's what Jesus does.
[time=3010] Jesus died a purpose driven death so you can live a purpose driven life.
[time=3016] For those of us who are believers the text is also clear.
[time=3020] The Apostle Paul says I have been crucified with Christ.
[time=3023] It is no longer I who live but Christ who lives in me.
[time=3027] In other words we have to show every day that we have died with Christ and then we arose again. Calvin Miller writes I daily gaze upon his cross and I'm rebuked at my own pursuit of ease.
[time=3041] I cannot place good Friday in the distant past.
[time=3044] Good Friday is last Friday next Friday every Friday I must day I must daily lie I must daily die to self and live for him.
[time=3054] I must count on its continuing glory I must repeatedly reckon with its demand and Jesus himself says again for those of us who are believers if anyone would come after me let him deny himself take up his cross daily and follow me. We sang this morning bear your cross and wait for the crown.
[time=3077] Tell the world of the treasure you found.
[time=3082] Are we living like that? By their brothers and sisters we are called to live like Jesus did. We are not going to die
[time=3095] for our sin. Jesus already died for our sin. He took our sin upon himself but we asked now to live in the power of his resurrection and being obedient denying ourselves and following him.
[time=3109] The fourth century among Thomas our campus writes Jesus today has many who love his heavenly kingdom but few who carry his cross many who yearn for comfort few who long for distress plenty of people he finds to share his banquet few to share his fast everyone desires to take part of him in his rejoicing but few are willing to suffer anything for his sake.
[time=3133] There are many that follow Jesus as far as the breaking of bread few as far as drinking the cup of suffering many that revere his miracles few that follow him in the indignity of his cross.
[time=3149] Then Thomas our campus writes this he makes this claim for Jesus follow me I am the way the truth and the life without the way there is no going without the truth there is no knowing and without the life there is no living is Jesus your Lord and Savior if he is he's also
[time=3174] the way the truth and the and the life Jesus Christ is now your Lord and Savior maybe you want to come and kneel down here and kneel at the cross so to speak
[time=3190] look up and live pull your trust alone in Christ for your salvation
[time=3196] and if you are a believer ask yourself am I living for him am I living like Paul says I've been crucified with Christ and I live am I denying myself daily of taking up my cross and following Jesus we'll have elders here to pray for if you want to do that we'll stand and sing this beautiful hymn together the old rugged cross as we do this so let's stand together and close this way
[time=3241] on a hill far away through an old rugged cross
[time=3249] the emblem of suffering and share
[time=3256] and I love that will cross where the dearest and best
[time=3264] for a world of us in ours was
[time=3278] till my trophies at last I lay down
[time=3286] I will come to the old rugged cross
[time=3293] and exchange it some day for a crown
[time=3300] oh the old rugged cross so despised by the world
[time=3308] as a wondrous attraction for me
[time=3315] for the heel and love God left his glory above
[time=3323] to bear in good art and glory
[time=3329] so I'll cherish the old rugged cross
[time=3337] till my trophies at last I lay down
[time=3344] I will come to the old rugged cross
[time=3351] and exchange it some day for a crown
[time=3359] in the old rugged cross stay with blood so divine
[time=3366] a wondrous beauty I see
[time=3373] for it was owned and all cross Jesus suffered and died
[time=3381] to learn and sanctify me
[time=3388] so I'll cherish the old rugged cross
[time=3395] till my trophies at last I lay down
[time=3402] I will come to the old rugged cross
[time=3410] and exchange it some day for a crown
[time=3417] to the old rugged cross I will ever be to
[time=3425] be shame and reproach gladly bear
[time=3432] thank you call me some day to my home far away
[time=3440] where his glory forever I'll share
[time=3447] so I'll cherish the old rugged cross
[time=3455] till my trophies at last I lay down
[time=3462] I will come to the old rugged cross
[time=3469] and exchange it some day for a crown
[time=3486] let's pray dear father thank you that you always provide a way for salvation
[time=3493] you provided a serpent on a wooden pole back in the time of Moses
[time=3501] thank you for providing Jesus Christ as a sacrifice for our sin
[time=3508] thank you there he was lifted up on a roman cross for our sin
[time=3514] thank you that the cross was not just an instrument of torture but it was a place of exaltation where the son of man was lifted up
[time=3526] thank you that a lot of us here we looked up and we're living pray they will teach us what I mean is to live for you every day but I pray for those who don't know Jesus Christ as their personal lord and saviour that today will be of day of salvation that the day to day will be the day where they will look up and live thank you for Jesus was not just
[time=3548] the Passover lamb who takes away our sin but he's the the king of kings and the lord of lords teaches what I mean is to to follow him and to take our daily cross and follow him every day
[time=3561] we pray all these things in Christ's name amen
[time=3571] you
