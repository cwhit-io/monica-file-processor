[time=703] Now Jericho was shut up inside and outside because of the people of Israel.
[time=710] None went out and none came in.
[time=713] And the Lord said to Joshua, see, I have given Jericho into your hand.
[time=720] With its king, he and its mighty men of valor.
[time=725] You shall march around the city, all the men of war going around the city once.
[time=731] Thus you shall do for six days.
[time=734] Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of ram's horns before the ark.
[time=740] On the seventh day, you shall march around the city seven times.
[time=745] And the priests shall blow the trumpets.
[time=748] And when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, when you hear the sound of the trumpet,
[time=754] then all the people shall shout with a great shout, and the wall of the city will fall down flat.
[time=761] And the people shall go up, everyone straight before him.
[time=766] So Joshua, the son of none, called the priests and said to them, take up the ark of the covenant
[time=773] and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of ram's horns before the ark of the Lord.
[time=777] And he said to the people, go forward, march around the city and let the armed men pass on before the ark of the Lord.
[time=786] On the seventh day, they rose early at the dawn of the day and marched around the city in the same manner seven times.
[time=796] It was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times.
[time=801] And at the seventh time, when the priest had blown the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, shout,
[time=809] for the Lord has given you this city and the city and all that is within it shall be devoted to the Lord for destruction.
[time=817] Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall live because she hid the messengers whom we sent.
[time=826] But you keep yourselves from the things devoted to destruction.
[time=831] Lest when you have devoted them, you take any of the devoted things and make the camp of Israel a thing of destruction and bring trouble upon it.
[time=841] But all the silver and gold and every vessel of bronze and iron are holy to the Lord.
[time=847] They shall go into the treasury of the Lord.
[time=850] So the people shouted and the trumpets were blown and as the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the people shouted a great shout
[time=859] and the wall fell down flat so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him and they captured the city.
[time=869] Then they devoted all in the city to destruction both men and women, young and old, oxen, sheep and donkeys with the edge of the sword.
[time=881] But to the two men who had spied out the land, Joshua said, go into the prostitute's house and bring out from there the woman and all who belonged to her as you swore to her.
[time=895] Good morning. Please open your Bibles to Joshua. We will start in chapter 1.
[time=902] If you don't have a Bible with you, there are Bibles in the pews and it's page 102 in the Pew Bible.
[time=909] If you don't have a Bible period, not at home, not anywhere, feel free to take that Bible with you when you leave today.
[time=918] It is a gift from Blackhawk Ministries to you.
[time=923] This morning I want to talk about the problem, the promise and the provider. Really, there are three problems, three promises and one provider.
[time=934] But we're going to take this one by one. We're going to start in chapter 1 and then go to chapter 3 and then chapter 6.
[time=942] This morning we sang that God is the promise maker and the promise keeper. You remember those words?
[time=951] We sang that God is the promise maker and he is the promise keeper.
[time=958] The promise that God is fulfilling here in Joshua is a promise that God made to Abraham at least 600 years before.
[time=970] If you remember when we were in Genesis chapter 12, God promised three things to Abraham, a great name,
[time=979] a great nation and a great land, a great name, a reputation, a great nation.
[time=987] Those were fulfilled by Exodus chapter 1.
[time=991] The Israelites were feared so much by Pharaoh that Pharaoh was afraid of the people of Israel and decided to enslave them and oppress them even further.
[time=1008] So it's more than 600 years later, God is fulfilling the promises of the great land.
[time=1015] They've been in the wilderness for 40 years, not because of God but because of their disobedience.
[time=1021] So they're finally at the border of the promised land.
[time=1027] But the first problem they encounter is the death of a leader.
[time=1033] Look how Joshua chapter 1 starts. After the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord,
[time=1039] the Lord said to Joshua, the son of none, Moses is assistant, Moses my servant is dead.
[time=1046] Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, you and all these people into the land that I am giving to them to the people of Israel.
[time=1054] My dear brothers and sisters, sometimes we don't see it, but we learn very quickly in the book of Joshua that God's timing is perfect.
[time=1064] He brings Joshua a word of encouragement exactly when he needed it.
[time=1070] In this case, his friend, his mentor, his leader Joshua is dead.
[time=1078] And at that time, God is giving Joshua a word of encouragement.
[time=1083] Another thing that we have to learn very quickly in scripture is that sometimes God's plans are best accomplished by removal of men who have been useful for a time.
[time=1095] Let me say that again, because this is one that we don't get.
[time=1099] Sometimes God accomplishes his plans best by removal of men who have been useful for a time but called to lead only for a time.
[time=1112] Joshua is chosen over Moses who is now that Moses was great for a while.
[time=1121] Moses was great in Egypt, Moses was great in the wilderness, but now God leads a leader like Joshua who will lead and fight against wild cities.
[time=1134] There's a different strategy needed, there's a different leader needed.
[time=1138] And sometimes we say, oh that leader's gone, I'm done, I'm going to another church.
[time=1144] When we do that, we have missed the point.
[time=1148] God always says leaders, the heal, he raises, and sometimes he dismisses.
[time=1155] Think about Moses, 40 years as a leader, and God is saying to Moses, that's enough.
[time=1161] You are actually not even going to enter the promised land.
[time=1166] What kind of God is that?
[time=1168] That's the kind of God who's in control of history, that's the kind of God he is.
[time=1172] And sometimes his plans are best accomplished by the removal of men who have been useful for a while, but God has something better in place for them.
[time=1186] God chose Moses, God used Moses, but Moses's time has ended, and now Joshua is the answer to their problem.
[time=1197] Listen to what the Bible says about Joshua in the Autonomy chapter 34 verse 9.
[time=1202] Joshua the son of none was full of the spirit of wisdom.
[time=1205] For Moses had laid his hands on him, so the people of Israel obeyed him and did as the Lord had commanded Moses.
[time=1214] See we have a problem, a leader is dead, but we also have a promise.
[time=1220] Notice please the promise of God back in the Autonomy chapter 18 verse 18.
[time=1228] God says to Moses, "I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers, and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I commanded him."
[time=1241] Imagine that some people have said, "Oh, Moses is dead, it's all over, let's pack up and go back to Egypt."
[time=1249] Some people think like that, but that's not what God says.
[time=1253] You see, God gave a promise to Moses that he will raise another leader.
[time=1260] There is a problem, but there's also a promise.
[time=1263] And in every generation, my dear brothers and sisters, God raises up men and women to lead.
[time=1271] He always does it.
[time=1273] This church is a testament to that.
[time=1276] Someone wise once said this, leadership is one of the great indicators that God is moving.
[time=1282] Leadership is one of the greatest measures of a spiritually healthy church.
[time=1287] Leadership happens when God speaks.
[time=1292] And if the leadership of Israel was in doubt, it was in doubt only until God spoke to Joshua.
[time=1300] God hand chose the next leader for Israel.
[time=1305] Deuteronomy 32 verse 23, 31-23.
[time=1310] And the Lord commissioned Joshua the son of London and said, "Be strong and courageous for you shall bring the people of Israel into the land that I sought to give to them."
[time=1319] I will be with you.
[time=1320] By the way, this is before Moses dies.
[time=1323] Even before Moses dies, God says to Joshua, "I have selected you.
[time=1328] You are the new leader." My dear brothers and sisters, my prayer for Blackhawk is that God will raise God in leadership.
[time=1340] Your leaders need to be biblical leaders.
[time=1345] You've got to pick people that God chooses according to Scripture.
[time=1350] Don't choose them based on their golf handicap.
[time=1356] I don't know if any church does that.
[time=1358] I'm just saying, that's probably not a good way to do it.
[time=1362] Pick elders that are biblical elders as the Bible says, Scripture.
[time=1366] Those who can teach Scripture.
[time=1368] Those who know what the Bible says.
[time=1370] You see, there's a problem, the death of a leader.
[time=1372] That's a problem.
[time=1373] The living of a leader.
[time=1375] That's a problem.
[time=1377] The movie of a leader, that's a problem.
[time=1379] But God is the promise that in every generation he will raise up a leader and he will hand choose the leader for you.
[time=1385] Do you believe that?
[time=1387] But in order to do that, you have to pray about this.
[time=1391] I will come to that later.
[time=1393] God provides and raises up Joshua.
[time=1397] First of all, we're meeting Joshua.
[time=1399] Not here in the drama, not even in Joshua, not in the drama.
[time=1403] The first time we encounter Joshua is in Exodus chapter 17.
[time=1409] Joshua is introduced as Moses' right hand man.
[time=1412] Moses said to Joshua, this is Exodus 17 starting in verse 9.
[time=1416] Choose for us men and go out and fight with Amalek.
[time=1419] Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.
[time=1424] So Joshua did as Moses told them and fought with Amalek while Moses, Aaron and her went up to the hill.
[time=1430] Whenever Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed and whenever he lowered his hand, Amalek prevailed.
[time=1436] This is a classic example of a teamwork.
[time=1439] Moses is up on the mountain, he's praying, and Joshua is fighting.
[time=1444] That's a key teamwork approach.
[time=1448] Notice Moses doesn't say to Joshua, you know what, right now, we're all going to go on seven days of fasting and prayer.
[time=1456] By the way, there's time for that.
[time=1458] But no, no, no, right now, okay, I'll pray you fight.
[time=1462] Use the gifts God has given you.
[time=1466] By the way, sometimes when you choose a pastor, I know some of you want that he has all the gifts.
[time=1473] But the Bible only says that God gives everybody to the Holy Spirit at least one gift.
[time=1478] Why do we then expect the pastor to have four, five, six, seven gifts?
[time=1484] Don't expect the pastor to have the gifts.
[time=1486] Now you have to decide what gifts you want him to have so he can lead.
[time=1491] But don't expect him to have all the gifts.
[time=1493] You're just setting him up for disaster and for failure.
[time=1497] You don't have all the gifts.
[time=1499] No, God says everybody has at least one talent.
[time=1502] Now some blesses, some maybe would too.
[time=1505] Maybe three, but generally everybody has one gifting.
[time=1510] And the pastor is no different.
[time=1513] That's why I like this because it shows teamwork, someone prays, someone goes, someone fights.
[time=1520] We learn very quickly, my dear brothers and sisters, that piety is no substitute for preparation.
[time=1530] And preparation is no substitute for piety.
[time=1534] You need both.
[time=1536] You need to get on your knees and pray, but there is a time when you need to get off of your knees and do something.
[time=1543] Piety is no substitute for preparation.
[time=1546] But in this preparation, substitute for piety, we need both.
[time=1552] And Joshua uses, God uses Joshua not just to lead militarily, but God uses Joshua to write the whole book that bears his name.
[time=1562] How do we know that?
[time=1563] We know that because if you read the book of Joshua, it is clear that someone who was an eyewitness to all these things wrote them.
[time=1571] And we know because Joshua 24, 26 says this.
[time=1575] Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God.
[time=1580] It doesn't get any clearer than that.
[time=1583] And then you read some liberal scholars who say no, Joshua didn't write it.
[time=1587] What are you talking about?
[time=1588] It just says here, he did.
[time=1591] You laugh, but I know a lot of people like that.
[time=1595] And yes, they have finished these in other degrees.
[time=1597] But if they don't believe the Bible, they don't believe in the leadership of the church.
[time=1601] They don't belong in the leadership of the church.
[time=1604] Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and he took a large stone and set it up.
[time=1609] And then the terrible thing was by the sanctuary of the Lord.
[time=1615] I don't know what problems lie ahead of you this week, but I know that God has promises for you.
[time=1621] And God can be the provider who will fulfill those promises for you.
[time=1628] There's a second problem.
[time=1630] If the first problem is the death of a leader, the second problem is a physical problem, the Jordan River.
[time=1637] So they're encamped at Gilgal.
[time=1641] It's about 10 miles from the Jordan River.
[time=1647] And then chapter three verse one says, "Then Joshua rose early in the morning and they set out from Chitim," which is again close to Gilgal.
[time=1655] "And they came to the Jordan and he and all the people of Israel and lodged there before they passed over."
[time=1663] Here's the map of the...
[time=1667] By the way, this is not a mistake, you know, the red line.
[time=1671] That's their itinerary.
[time=1674] I know some of you say the GPS was broken or something.
[time=1679] No, the GPS was not broken.
[time=1682] So they come from here in Egypt somewhere, they come from here, they go south, and then they go north.
[time=1689] And instead of going straight into the promised land, they're actually going up the King's Highway.
[time=1694] This is actually called the King's Highway to this day.
[time=1696] There's a King's Highway in present-day Jordan.
[time=1699] They go up King's Highway and the reason they're not going straight in is because, remember, they're disobedience and they're rebellion.
[time=1709] That's why they're not actually taking the short route.
[time=1712] They're taking the longer route.
[time=1714] Eventually, they make it here to Gilgal, which is opposite Jericho.
[time=1718] Jericho is right here.
[time=1720] You have the Dead Sea, you have the Sea of Galilee, and in between you have the Jordan River.
[time=1727] The Jordan River originates here in the north of Mount Hermon by Tel Dan, and then it flows into the Dead Sea eventually.
[time=1736] But they're here at Gilgal, and she team right here, and they're ready to cross over, but the problem is the Jordan River.
[time=1745] And once they get in, this is the southern campaign, the central campaign, and the northern campaign.
[time=1750] This is a conquest.
[time=1751] They will have to fight for their land, and we'll see more of that.
[time=1755] But there, at the border, with the promised land, and there's a problem.
[time=1760] Because you have Joshua and the people ready to cross over, but how are they going to cross over?
[time=1766] That's a problem.
[time=1767] But we have to also look at the promise.
[time=1769] This is back in chapter 1.
[time=1771] God gave Joshua and the people a very important promise.
[time=1776] You are to pass over this Jordan.
[time=1779] Look in Joshua 1.11, prepare your provisions for within three days.
[time=1783] You are to pass over this Jordan to go in to take possession of the land that the Lord your God is giving you to possess.
[time=1791] Notice it doesn't say if the weather is okay, you will pass over the Jordan.
[time=1797] It doesn't say that, does it?
[time=1799] No.
[time=1800] It doesn't say if the wind blows just in the right way, you will pass over the Jordan.
[time=1806] It simply says you will pass over the Jordan.
[time=1810] The reason I say that, because you have liberal scholars who say that all this happened naturalistically.
[time=1816] You know, the wind blew just right, and it stopped the waters on one side, and the water flowed, and the children of Israel passed as unto the right ground.
[time=1827] Naturalistically, they tried to explain everything naturalistically.
[time=1830] There's no miracle in the Bible, and their God is obviously too small.
[time=1835] But what we see here, we have the problem in the river Jordan, but the promise is you are to pass over this Jordan.
[time=1842] God tells them it's going to happen, and the provider is God.
[time=1847] Notice God parted the waters of the Jordan.
[time=1851] Chapter 3 verse 17.
[time=1853] Now the priest bearing the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord stood firmly on the ground in the midst of the Jordan, and all Israel was passing over on dry ground.
[time=1863] Until all the nation finished passing over the Jordan.
[time=1868] Back to our principle.
[time=1871] Piety is no substitute for preparation, and neither is preparation substitute for piety.
[time=1877] We need both.
[time=1880] In Joshua 3.5, Joshua said to the people, consecrate yourselves.
[time=1884] This is where the piety aspect comes in.
[time=1887] For tomorrow, the Lord will do wonders among you.
[time=1891] You see, our God can still do miracles, but he requires us to consecrate ourselves for the task.
[time=1899] consecrate yourselves.
[time=1901] Chapter 3 verse 5.
[time=1903] In English, this comes from the Latin consecrata, which means to make holy.
[time=1909] Separate yourself.
[time=1911] Make yourself holy.
[time=1913] Big different than the other nations.
[time=1916] Leviticus 9.2.
[time=1918] Speak to all the congregation of the people of Israel and say to them, "You shall be holy for I, the Lord your God is holy." This is not a new thing.
[time=1926] The children of Israel didn't hear this, "Oh, I need to be holy." That's a new thing.
[time=1931] No.
[time=1932] No, the fact that they needed to be holy and separate and different than the other nations appeared,
[time=1938] they were told before.
[time=1940] It appeared in Joshua 3, but it appeared three times before that in Leviticus.
[time=1944] In Leviticus 11, 44, in Leviticus 20 verse 7 and Numbers 11, 18.
[time=1952] Consecrate yourselves.
[time=1954] Was the message about 20, 3,400 years ago when the message is still true today?
[time=1963] The message consecrate yourselves.
[time=1965] It was 2,000 years ago when 1 Peter writes it to the church, and it's still true today.
[time=1972] As Peter writes, he quotes from Leviticus 19 and he says, "As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance.
[time=1983] But as he who calls you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct,
[time=1989] since it is written, "You shall be holy for I am holy."
[time=1995] God still does miracles, but we have to consecrate ourselves.
[time=2000] We have our part to do.
[time=2002] God will do his part, but we have to do ours.
[time=2007] There's a problem, the death of a leader, but there's a promise.
[time=2011] God says, "I'm going to raise a leader for you." And God provides by hand-picking Joshua.
[time=2019] There's a problem, the Jordan River.
[time=2023] How do you cross a river when you have old people, children?
[time=2030] How do you do that?
[time=2032] You have cards.
[time=2034] How do you do that?
[time=2035] You can only do that if God intervenes, and God does intervene.
[time=2042] There's a third problem, Jericho.
[time=2048] The first problem, the death of a leader, the second problem, the Jordan River, the third problem, a wild city.
[time=2056] Something they have not encountered yet in their 40 years in the wilderness.
[time=2062] But notice what happens here with Jericho.
[time=2064] Jericho was shut up inside and outside because of the people of Israel.
[time=2068] None went out and none came in.
[time=2074] Now, this wild city was something unique for that time and place.
[time=2083] They had the walls in place, their physical security in place, but the Bible says in
[time=2089] their hearts there was fear.
[time=2092] Oh, it's Jericho was shut up inside and outside because of the people of Israel.
[time=2097] Remember when God says, "I'm going to give you a great name"?
[time=2101] That means a great reputation, people will fear you, people feared Israel.
[time=2106] They heard what God was doing to them and through them in the wilderness.
[time=2110] And now the people of Jericho are in a self-imposed lockdown because they were paralyzed with fear.
[time=2118] In Joshua chapter 2, Rahab, the prostitute summarizes how things stood.
[time=2126] When they sent spies and Rahab hides the spies, Rahab tells them how the situation is.
[time=2135] I know that the Lord has given you the land and that the fear of you has fallen upon us
[time=2141] and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.
[time=2145] For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea.
[time=2149] Did you catch that?
[time=2151] Rahab, a pagan prostitute knows a lot more about a lot of Ph.D.s I know.
[time=2158] Nothing naturalistic here.
[time=2160] The Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who are beyond the Jordan to see on an og, to see on an og, whom you devoted to destruction.
[time=2173] And as soon as we heard it, our hearts melted.
[time=2177] And there was no spirit left in any man because of you for the Lord your God.
[time=2182] Yahweh, your God, he is God in the heavens above and on earth beneath.
[time=2190] But still, we have a problem, the wild city.
[time=2195] Here's a reconstruction of how the walls looked like.
[time=2200] Indeed, for that time, Jericho was a unique city.
[time=2205] The Bible tells us and archeological discovery tell us that indeed there were two walls.
[time=2215] And then there was a space in between where you would have homes.
[time=2220] I'll show you another rendering in a second.
[time=2224] But what you have here, first you have a stone retaining wall and here are people.
[time=2229] You see, these are people just to see how small people are in this context.
[time=2234] So you have a retaining wall and on top of retaining wall, you had another 15 by 6 feet mud brick wall.
[time=2242] And then you'd actually have homes attached to this wall.
[time=2248] Remember, because it says when Rahab let the spies out, she let them out through the wall.
[time=2255] Because in this wall, you would have actually windows.
[time=2259] Again, no glass windows, just empty places, just a hole in the wall.
[time=2264] Basically, they would serve as a window.
[time=2266] And that's how Rahab was able to let out the spies through the wall.
[time=2272] So you have houses here and then you would conquer this wall.
[time=2277] You still encounter another secondary wall.
[time=2281] That's military, that's brilliant, by the way.
[time=2284] That's brilliant military strategy.
[time=2288] So think about, if they're thinking militaristically, even if we go across or through or above this wall,
[time=2297] we have another wall to go through.
[time=2300] So militaristically, they have no chance.
[time=2305] They have no chance.
[time=2306] But what do they have?
[time=2308] They have the promise of God.
[time=2311] Notice what God says.
[time=2313] The Lord said to Joshua, "See, I have given Jericho into your hand with its king and mighty man of valor."
[time=2319] Oh, I love that verse.
[time=2321] Notice it doesn't say, "I will give you." When I learned English, that's how I learned.
[time=2327] I learned the present, the past, and the perfect.
[time=2332] So I had to learn verbs, you know, like verb to give.
[time=2336] Go gave given.
[time=2340] That's how I have to learn all the verbs.
[time=2342] In the present, in the past, and in the perfect.
[time=2345] Go gave given.
[time=2349] Now if we want to make it future, you add the auxiliary verb will.
[time=2355] I will give.
[time=2357] Is this in the future?
[time=2360] No, this is, I have given you.
[time=2362] This is in the perfect, which for me is in the past tense, a completed action.
[time=2368] This is my dear brothers and sisters, it's called in exegesis, the prophetic perfect.
[time=2375] Where God put something in the past, although it didn't happen yet.
[time=2383] For unto us, the child was born Isaiah.
[time=2387] Was the child born?
[time=2388] No, it's going to be actually 750 more years.
[time=2391] It's called the prophetic perfect.
[time=2393] God puts it in the past as though it already happened, although it didn't happen yet.
[time=2399] It's called the prophetic perfect.
[time=2401] It says that God basically says, this is so sure that it's going to happen.
[time=2405] I'm even going to change the grammar to it so you get it.
[time=2410] That's why we have to actually like grammar.
[time=2413] So we can understand what the Bible says.
[time=2417] God gives them a promise.
[time=2419] But notice, please, in order for them to experience the victory, they need to do some work.
[time=2425] Oh, oh, remember what I said?
[time=2427] Pilate is no substitute for preparation.
[time=2430] No, look in chapter 6 verses 3 to 5, they have to do something.
[time=2435] You shall march around the city.
[time=2437] All the men of war going around the city once, thus you shall do for six days.
[time=2442] Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets.
[time=2445] And when you make the long blast with the Rams horn, when you hear the sound of the trumpets, then all the people shall shout to the great shout and the wall of the city will fall flat
[time=2456] and the people shall go up every one straight before him.
[time=2459] So what did they have to do?
[time=2461] Look what they had to do.
[time=2462] They had to work by marching.
[time=2464] That's work.
[time=2465] Some of you work out, right?
[time=2468] You just march around for nothing, kind of, right?
[time=2472] And if you have a treadmill that goes nowhere, or the nice one, the stairmaster, that really goes nowhere.
[time=2484] But they had to march and they had to wait.
[time=2487] They had to wait six days before they see God's victory.
[time=2491] But notice, God is not instructing them in military tactics.
[time=2498] God is not asking them to scale the walls.
[time=2502] He's just asking them to walk around the walls.
[time=2506] He's not asking them to make holes in the walls.
[time=2509] Just wait, march and wait.
[time=2514] My dear brothers and sisters, we need to learn something very important here, very practical.
[time=2519] We need to obey God's command even when they don't make sense from a human perspective.
[time=2525] Think about the people of Jericho watching the Israelites walking around, just marching around.
[time=2533] It didn't make any sense, right?
[time=2535] But we have to obey God's word even when it doesn't make sense from a human perspective.
[time=2540] And we need to be faithful in the little things.
[time=2544] Marching around the walls, it's not a big deal.
[time=2547] But we have to do it.
[time=2549] We have to be faithful in the little things.
[time=2552] I think the hardest thing here was what the Bible says here is that
[time=2558] Joshua commanded the people, "You shall not shout or make your voice heard.
[time=2563] Neither shall any word go out of your mouth until the day I tell you to shout." They had to be quiet for six days.
[time=2571] I think that's the hardest thing.
[time=2576] I think the command to be silent for six days was a challenging one.
[time=2580] But they obeyed because we need to learn how to obey the little things.
[time=2587] And the provider says, "The Lord has given you the city." The victory is described starting in verse 15.
[time=2596] On the seventh day they rose early.
[time=2598] At the dawn of day they marched around the city in the same manner seven times.
[time=2602] It was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times.
[time=2606] And at the time when the priest had blown the trumpet, Joshua said to the people, "Shout!
[time=2610] For the Lord has given you the city.
[time=2613] And the city and all that is within it shall be devoted to the Lord for destruction."
[time=2620] Verse 20.
[time=2621] So the people shouted and the trumpets were blown.
[time=2624] And as soon as the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the people shouted.
[time=2627] A great shout and the wall fell down flat.
[time=2631] So that the people went up to the city every man straight before him and they captured the city.
[time=2637] How is that possible?
[time=2641] Well, it was possible because God made a promise.
[time=2644] And the people obeyed what they had to do.
[time=2647] But also there was the element of faith.
[time=2650] Hebrews 11-30 tells us, "By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days."
[time=2658] In other words, these people who marched, they could have marched a thousand times if they didn't believe nothing would have happened.
[time=2667] They had to believe in order for something to happen.
[time=2671] And Hebrews 11-30 tells us, "By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days."
[time=2682] My dear brothers and sisters, Victory requires work.
[time=2687] Victory requires waiting.
[time=2689] Victory requires obedience.
[time=2693] Victory requires faith.
[time=2699] "By faith the walls came down."
[time=2708] Who survived Rahab.
[time=2711] A pagan prostitute.
[time=2715] Joshua 622.
[time=2717] But to the man who had spied out the land, Joshua said, "Go into the prostitute's house and bring her out from there the woman, all who belong to her as you soar to her."
[time=2727] Some people call Rahab a trophy of God's grace.
[time=2734] So the young men who had been spied, went in and brought out Rahab and her father and mother and brothers and all who belong to her.
[time=2741] And they brought all her relatives and put them outside the camp of Israel.
[time=2746] They couldn't put them inside the camp because the camp was, remember holy to the Lord.
[time=2753] They were pagans that had to have some type of ritual quarantine and they burned the city with fire and everything in it.
[time=2766] But Rahab the prostitute and her father's household and all who belong to her, Joshua saved alive.
[time=2773] And she has lived in Israel to this day because she hid the messengers from Joshua's scent to spied out Jericho.
[time=2783] Not only was Rahab saved in the Book of Hebrews, her name appears.
[time=2790] In the Hall of Faith, Rahab's name is there.
[time=2795] And what's even more remarkable, she appears in the genealogy of Jesus himself.
[time=2802] If you read the genealogy of Jesus, Rahab is there.
[time=2807] I like how Max Lucero puts it.
[time=2810] Even the genealogy of Jesus is salted with a dubious character or two.
[time=2816] Tamar the adulterous Rahab the harlot and Batchiba, who tended to take bats in questionable locations.
[time=2826] I don't agree with that, but anyway.
[time=2832] It's Max Lucero, how do you disagree with Max Lucero?
[time=2836] The reassuring lesson is clear.
[time=2839] God used and uses people to change the world, people.
[time=2844] Not saints or superhumans or geniuses, but people.
[time=2849] Crooks, creeps, lovers and liars.
[time=2853] He uses them all and what they may lack in perfection, God makes up for in love.
[time=2862] Jericho was much smaller than Fort Wayne.
[time=2867] You ready for this?
[time=2869] This is how big Jericho was.
[time=2871] 1,200 people.
[time=2876] This is a rendering of how the city looked like.
[time=2880] This is based on archaeological discovery.
[time=2882] And archaeological discovery shows that indeed, as I said to you, the wall was doubled wall.
[time=2889] The retaining wall, mud brick wall, homes, mud brick wall, more homes.
[time=2896] So when the wall came down, this is what came down.
[time=2900] Not the retaining wall came down, this wall came down, and this wall came down.
[time=2907] So think about what happens to the brick when it falls here.
[time=2911] It falls a natural ramp on which the people can walk up and go into the city.
[time=2919] Isn't that beautiful?
[time=2921] God knows what he's talking about.
[time=2924] When the wall comes down, the people go up.
[time=2927] Read the text, it's right there.
[time=2929] The wall falls down and the people walk up into the city, it's right there.
[time=2935] Again, this is a rendition of based on archaeological discoveries.
[time=2942] Some years ago, I had the chance to go to Jericho, and here is the actual picture of those walls.
[time=2949] You might say, "There's evidence of that?
[time=2952] There's evidence all around us.
[time=2955] If you choose not to believe, you choose not to believe.
[time=2959] It's not because you don't have evidence." I said that before, I'm going to say it again.
[time=2965] You have evidence, not just scriptural evidence.
[time=2968] You have nature, you have the sky, you have everything around us tells us that there is a God.
[time=2975] So there are two sets of walls here.
[time=2980] This is one and then you have some space in between on a second wall and then you have the city of Jericho proper.
[time=2991] 1,200 people.
[time=2993] You know how big the city of Jericho was?
[time=2996] I am not exaggerating when I tell you that probably if you take Blackhawk Ministries land,
[time=3004] Blackhawk is bigger than Jericho.
[time=3011] You guys are rich.
[time=3013] You guys are bigger than a city.
[time=3015] By the way, most cities were like that.
[time=3017] Most cities were like that.
[time=3020] We think Nineveh and 612 BC were destroyed.
[time=3026] Maybe that was bigger, but that was the capital of the Assyrian Empire.
[time=3031] Jericho was a fairly small city, but not for those days' standards.
[time=3037] So how do we apply the truth?
[time=3039] Four things.
[time=3040] First of all, arise and go.
[time=3042] Listen to the word given to Joshua.
[time=3045] Therefore, arise and go.
[time=3048] Go over this Jordan, you and all these people into the land that I am giving you to the people of Israel.
[time=3056] Start on your knees, start asking God what he wants you to do, but then arise and go do something.
[time=3063] Remember that piety is no substitute for preparation, but neither is preparation substitute for piety.
[time=3071] Be strong and courageous.
[time=3073] For you shall cause these people to inherit the land.
[time=3076] I don't know what God is calling you to do, but be strong and courageous.
[time=3080] We have enough whims in the kingdom of God.
[time=3083] We need people who are strong and courageous.
[time=3085] People, men and women of integrity, who will stand up and say, "Thus saith the Lord."
[time=3092] But before "Thus saith the Lord," we need to learn what saith the Lord.
[time=3096] So make sure we learn what the Bible says and then get up and go.
[time=3101] Be strong and courageous.
[time=3103] Trust in the power of God and depend on the power of God.
[time=3109] This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on a day and night.
[time=3114] God says to Joshua so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it.
[time=3120] For then you will make your way prosperous and then you will have good success.
[time=3126] Have I not commanded you?
[time=3128] Be strong and courageous.
[time=3129] Do not be frightened and do not be dismayed.
[time=3131] For the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.
[time=3134] Oh, I love that one.
[time=3136] Joshua 1-9.
[time=3137] I don't know if you like to underline in your Bible, but the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.
[time=3143] I don't know what lies before you, but if you take that promise with you and rely on the power of God
[time=3151] that he is with you wherever you go, you can do whatever you want.
[time=3160] Let's bow our heads and pray.
[time=3163] If I thank you for faithful men like Joshua who obeyed your commands even when human speaking, they didn't make sense.
[time=3177] I pray that you forgive us for that many times when we just looked at our problems and we never looked at your promises.
[time=3186] And worse, we didn't even look at the provider. Thank you that you are the great provider.
[time=3194] Help us to trust you and to trust in you not just for our salvation, but for our daily walk.
[time=3203] I pray that Black Hawk will be a place where God leadership will emerge every day.
[time=3211] This church will continue to be a light in this dark world and many people will come to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ in this church.
[time=3220] I pray they will make them holy, set them apart for you, bring them the leader to them that you have prepared for them.
[time=3227] And in the meantime, may we wait and may we believe.
[time=3233] Thank you, Christ, may I pray?
[time=3259] Everyone needs compassion, love that's never failing, let mercy follow me.
[time=3271] Everyone needs deliverance, kindness of Savior, the whole formation.
[time=3286] Oh, Savior, Savior, He can move the mountains.
[time=3292] My God is mighty to sing.
[time=3295] He is mighty to sing forever.
[time=3301] Author of salvation.
[time=3304] He rose and conquered the grave.
[time=3308] Jesus conquered the grave.
[time=3316] [MUSIC]
[time=3325] So take me as you find me, all my fears and failures.
[time=3333] Feel my life again.
[time=3337] I give my life to follow everything I believe in.
[time=3345] Now I surrender.
[time=3354] Savior, He can move the mountains.
[time=3359] My God is mighty to sing.
[time=3362] He is mighty to sing forever.
[time=3368] Author of salvation.
[time=3371] He rose and conquered the grave.
[time=3375] Jesus conquered the grave.
[time=3378] Savior, He can move the mountains.
[time=3383] My God is mighty to sing.
[time=3387] He is mighty to sing forever.
[time=3392] Author of salvation.
[time=3395] He rose and conquered the grave.
[time=3399] Jesus conquered the grave.
[time=3406] [MUSIC]
[time=3414] Shine your light and let the whole world see.
[time=3419] We sing it for the glory of the risen king.
[time=3425] Jesus, shine your light and let the whole world see.
[time=3431] We sing it for the glory of the risen king.
[time=3436] Savior, Savior, He can move the mountains.
[time=3442] Yeah, my God is mighty to sing.
[time=3446] He is mighty to sing forever.
[time=3451] Author of salvation.
[time=3455] He rose and conquered the grave.
[time=3458] Jesus conquered the grave.
[time=3461] For Savior, He can move the mountains.
[time=3467] My God is mighty to sing.
[time=3470] He is mighty to sing forever.
[time=3476] Author of salvation.
[time=3479] He rose and conquered the grave.
[time=3482] Jesus conquered the grave.
[time=3485] Shine your light and let the whole world see.
[time=3491] We sing it for the glory of the risen king.
[time=3497] Jesus, shine your light and let the whole world see.
[time=3502] We sing it for the glory of the risen king.
[time=3508] Jesus, shine your light and let the whole world see.
[time=3514] We sing it for the glory of the risen king.
[time=3520] Jesus, shine your light and let the whole world see.
[time=3526] We sing it for the glory of the risen king.
[time=3532] Jesus, shine your light and let the whole world see.
[time=3538] We sing it for the glory of the risen king.
[time=3544] Jesus, shine your light and let the whole world see.
[time=3549] He rose again for the glory of the risen king.
