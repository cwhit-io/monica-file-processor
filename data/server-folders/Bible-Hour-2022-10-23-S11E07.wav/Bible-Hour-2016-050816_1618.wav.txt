(x2) Their roles were spokespersons for God, and they were more military and civic and political leaders than anything else.
[time=1683] Some of them were solvers of legal disputes, but most of them were not.
[time=1690] So when you think about the judges in the book of Judges, you think about leaders and especially military and political leaders.
[time=1701] And God raised these men up and women to lead his people.
[time=1708] Actually, their rise was prophesied in the book of Deuteronomy.
[time=1716] In the book of Deuteronomy, Moses prophesied in chapter 16, 17, and 19 that this judge was to stand side by side with a high priest
[time=1730] and act as the supreme judge or leader in Israel.
[time=1735] Give you one example, Deuteronomy 16, 18.
[time=1738] You shall appoint judges and officers in all your towns that the Lord your God is giving you according to your tribes,
[time=1746] and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.
[time=1751] Some people don't know exactly how many there were.
[time=1755] We can identify for certain twelve of them.
[time=1759] And they ruled in Israel for about 200 years, so from about 1375 BC for about 200 years.
[time=1768] Now, as you look at these names, you recognize some, don't you? From Sunday school.
[time=1775] But some you have never heard about.
[time=1778] Some of them actually, as you can see, only get about two verses.
[time=1783] Shamgar gets only one. They don't get a lot of press.
[time=1788] So there's really hard to teach or preach from that one verse.
[time=1792] But we know people like Deborah, which we will hear about next Sunday, Gideon.
[time=1798] And then after that, and then we're going to hear about Samson.
[time=1802] But God raises them up to deliver his people.
[time=1808] Again, we are in the series called the Gospel Project.
[time=1812] And in this outline, we are only given a few Sundays to talk about these judges,
[time=1818] so we cannot get into detail.
[time=1820] But you at home, with your children, can do that.
[time=1823] You can read throughout the entire book of Judges.
[time=1826] And I'm reminded to say that it is not the job of the pastor.
[time=1831] It is not the job of the youth pastor.
[time=1834] It is not the job of the Sunday school teacher for your kids to teach your kids the Bible.
[time=1840] It is your job to teach them the Bible.
[time=1843] When they come to church, they should just be reinforced what they have learned at home.
[time=1849] So I'm hoping that's what's happening.
[time=1851] And if it's not happening, I'm hoping that today will be the day when you will change that with your children.
[time=1858] And what we have here in the book of Judges, unfortunately, we have what I titled again the cycle of apostasy,
[time=1866] or as Chuck Sundall calls it recycled misery.
[time=1870] And for those of you who maybe don't like cycles, maybe like spirals, this is also a good idea.
[time=1876] Think about it as a spiral, because Israel keeps going down.
[time=1881] And this spiral or cycle of apostasy, which you have also in your bulletins,
[time=1887] this repeats itself seven times in the book of Judges.
[time=1893] So it starts with the fact that Israel sins.
[time=1897] That's nothing new.
[time=1899] It's happened before.
[time=1902] If you have your Bibles turned to Judges, look in chapter 2 with me, please.
[time=1906] Basically, starting in verse 11 and on, you have described the cycle of apostasy, this recycled misery.
[time=1915] A revolving door turning on the axis of corruption and depravity.
[time=1924] And the children of Israel go through this revolving door seven times, and you'd ask, when would they ever learn?
[time=1932] Well, he may ask us, when do we ever learn?
[time=1935] Why do we ever go through this recycled misery?
[time=1939] Why do we go through this revolving door?
[time=1944] That's turning on its corruption, axis and depravity, axis.
[time=1950] Why do we?
[time=1956] Looking verses 11 through 13.
[time=1960] And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and served the bales.
[time=1966] And they abandoned the Lord, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt.
[time=1971] They went after other gods from among the gods of the peoples who were around them and bowed down to them,
[time=1977] and they provoked the Lord to anger, and they abandoned the Lord and they served the bales and the ashtarot.
[time=1986] Do you know what's very sad about these verses?
[time=1989] As I mentioned before, look in verse 10, B. This happened only one generation removed from Joshua.
[time=2001] Judges 2, 10, the second part, and there arose another generation after them who did not know the Lord or the work that he had done for Israel.
[time=2012] Let me ask you, who failed?
[time=2017] And let me ask all of us, what kind of legacy are we leaving our children?
[time=2022] Are the children that are coming after us? Do they know the Lord?
[time=2026] Do they know what God has done?
[time=2030] We are singing, you are worthy, you are worthy, you are worthy, because he is worthy.
[time=2035] Do our children know that he is worthy?
[time=2039] Or do they just hear that on Sunday morning, and then Monday through Saturday, they don't hear anything about God,
[time=2045] about who he is or what he is doing, and then we are surprised that after high school, they are gone.
[time=2054] What kind of legacy are we leaving our children?
[time=2059] What do you want your children to know?
[time=2062] For some of us, I want my children to go to all the NFL stadiums in America and to see the history of NFL.
[time=2072] For some of us, I want all of them to see all the major league baseball stadiums.
[time=2080] That's what they call them, stadiums, I've been to one of them, always enough.
[time=2088] Please, please understand me, it's not wrong, it's not wrong.
[time=2092] But what kind of legacy am I leaving them?
[time=2095] The importance of a football or baseball, or am I going to teach him more about who Jesus is and what he has done for me?
[time=2101] Maybe take him on a trip to Israel, I'm just saying.
[time=2107] One scholar puts it like this and I quote, "This text is a witness to the apparent failure of the community to keep alive its memory of Yahweh's gracious saving acts,
[time=2117] the priests that failed in their instructional duties, and their elaborate system of festivals, memorials and other customs designed to pass on the rich spiritual tradition.
[time=2129] Had either elapsed, lapsed or been reduced to formality.
[time=2134] What kind of legacy are we leaving our children?
[time=2140] Israel has sinned, and this is a generation later than the duration of Joshua.
[time=2148] And because they have sinned, God sends an oppressor.
[time=2154] Looking verses 14 and 15. So the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel,
[time=2160] and he gave them over to plunderers who plundered them.
[time=2163] Wait a second, I thought God was loving and merciful.
[time=2168] Yes he is. God is loving and merciful, but he's also holy, righteous and just, and he must punish sin.
[time=2176] It's in the New Testament, it's in the Old Testament.
[time=2179] And he sold them into the hand of their surrounding enemies so that they could no longer withstand their enemies.
[time=2184] Whenever they marched out the hand of the Lord was against them for harm as the Lord had learned,
[time=2191] and as the Lord had sworn to them, and they were in terrible distress.
[time=2199] We sang, "You're a good, good, what? Father." Now, I don't know about you, but a good father disciplines his children.
[time=2210] God is a good, good father.
[time=2213] And when it says here that God judges his children, it's because he's a good, good father.
[time=2220] So if I sing and God judges, I should still call him good.
[time=2229] But God in his loving, loving, loving kindness and grace, he hears Israel crying out because they cry out to God eventually.
[time=2242] Notice again, notice the cycle of apostasy, this revolving door, the children of Israel cry out to God.
[time=2250] In chapters 3, 4, 6 and 10, I'll just give you one example.
[time=2254] In chapter 3, God sends them as so potamians to oppress them, and in Judges 3, 9 we read,
[time=2260] "But when the people of Israel cried out to the Lord, the Lord raised up a deliverer for the people of Israel who saved them."
[time=2267] In this case, Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger, brother.
[time=2273] And Israel cries out, God sends a deliverer in the person of a judge.
[time=2280] And because of that, peace then will reign again.
[time=2286] When we read in the book of Judges, we have peace, excuse me, from about 20 to 80 years on an average.
[time=2294] And then after this, the children of Israel go back to air, to their sinning.
[time=2300] And then God sends an oppressor again, and then they cry out to the Lord again, does God hear again?
[time=2307] Yeah, sends another deliverer in the person of a judge, and Israel does what?
[time=2312] Is grateful forever? No, they sin again.
[time=2316] Seven times in the book of Judges, the cycle of apostasy, or if you wanted the spiral of apostasy,
[time=2324] or if you wanted the revolving door of apostasy, but it is always revolving on the axis of corruption and the privacy.
[time=2336] I don't know what you did yesterday.
[time=2339] Maybe yesterday you went through this revolving door.
[time=2344] You woke up in a place where you should not have been sleeping, or you did something you should not have been doing.
[time=2356] If God judges you and punishes you, it is because He loves you, and He wants you to turn back.
[time=2366] Now, you might say, well, Tiberius, I've been on this cycle of apostasy on this revolving door more than seven times.
[time=2372] Does God still forgive me? And the answer is yes.
[time=2377] Tiberius, is there a time when God will say no more?
[time=2383] No. Only when Jesus comes back, or you die.
[time=2391] My concern is not that God will not forgive you, but my concern is that you will go through this revolving door so many times that you won't want to come back to Him.
[time=2400] That's my problem. That's my concern.
[time=2404] I'm not concerned about God not being able to forgive. I'm concerned about you not wanting to come back to Him.
[time=2410] That's my concern. So if you've gone through this revolving door of sin and corruption, and you feel nothing anymore, your conscious is seared, you need even more time to repent and come to Jesus, and He will forgive you.
[time=2428] But if you go through sinning and sinning and your heart is hardened, and you don't feel anymore, maybe you need to ask someone to really pray and fast for you.
[time=2439] But my dear brothers and sisters, God can still forgive no matter how big the sin is.
[time=2447] No matter how many times you've been through that revolving door, God in His grace and mercy always sends a deliverer.
[time=2459] What was their sin? Let's look at a couple of them. Israel's sin, first of all, was the sin of disobedience.
[time=2467] Now the specific act of disobedience here is called incomplete obedience.
[time=2474] Now if you are parents, and you are telling your children to do something, and they only do part of that, would you say that's okay?
[time=2482] No. Incomplete obedience is disobedience.
[time=2486] And what happens here, God told the Israelites to drive out the pagan nations, and over and over again we read that the tribes did not do that.
[time=2496] Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants, Ephim did not do it, Asher didn't do it, Naftali didn't do it.
[time=2504] There are 12 tribes of Israel, and about half of them obeyed, and half of them did not obey.
[time=2510] Incomplete obedience is disobedience.
[time=2514] God says, "I'm actually going to drive out the people from before you, but you have to obey." And they did not, and because they did not, God judged them. Look in chapter 2 starting in verse 1.
[time=2526] God's judgment of thorns and snares starting in verse 1.
[time=2532] Now the angel of the Lord went up from Gilgal to Bokeem, and he said, "I brought you up from Egypt and brought you into the land that I sought to give you to your fathers.
[time=2540] I said that I will never break my covenant with you, and you shall make no covenant to the inhabitants of this land.
[time=2546] You shall break down their altars, but you have not obeyed my voice. What is this you have done?"
[time=2552] So now I say, "I will not drive them out before you, but they shall become thorns in your sides, and their God shall be a snare to you."
[time=2564] As soon as the angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the people of Israel, the people lifted up their voices and wept,
[time=2571] and they called the name of that place Bokeem from the verb "bakah to weep," and they sacrificed there to the Lord.
[time=2583] You're a good, good father.
[time=2587] If God judges you, disciplines you, is because He loves you, and He wants you to come back to Him.
[time=2595] And that's what's happening here. Their sin was not just incomplete obedience, it was also the sin of idolatry that we have seen even last time in verses 11 and 12.
[time=2606] The people of Israel do what was evil in the sight of the Lord and serve the bales, and they abandoned the Lord, the God of their fathers who had brought them out of the land of Egypt.
[time=2615] They went after other gods from among the gods of the peoples who were around them and bowed down to them, and they provoked the Lord to anger.
[time=2624] Archaeological discoveries have uncovered what a bale looked like. On the left here we have bale.
[time=2632] He was the storm God. He made rain to fall according to the Canaanites.
[time=2639] And on the right you have an ashira pole. This is the ashira. In a scripture, I think you have the plural at some point, the ashteroth.
[time=2651] That's the plural form of the singular ashira, because there were many poles like this around.
[time=2660] Not only did they intermarry with the pagan nations, but they adopted their practices.
[time=2667] I want you to imagine that you were a man, a Jewish man, an Israelite, and you have married a Canaanite woman.
[time=2679] Well, it's not really funny. We might be. Let's see if it's a comedy or a tragedy.
[time=2687] You marry a Canaanite. You come home after a hard day of work.
[time=2695] And on the nightstand, she has a little ashira pole statuette. And you say, "Honey, we worship Yahweh."
[time=2709] And she says to you whispering in your ear, "But honey, if you love me, you'll allow me to have a little statuette of my own gods, wouldn't you?"
[time=2719] If you love me. By the way, is there anywhere in the book of Judges?
[time=2727] You will hear that when you get to Samson. That's what you hear. If you love me.
[time=2735] And how many people don't fall into sin because they listen to that voice of the Lila and others if you love me?
[time=2745] Well, my question is, do you love God first? If you love God first, then you would say no to intermering with pagas and you would say no to worshipping these gods and goddesses.
[time=2762] Imagine that you're an Israelite and your crops are now going well. Your harvest is not as good as it's been.
[time=2770] But your neighbor has a bale in the backyard or an ashira pole in the backyard and his grass is green.
[time=2780] Yours is not so much green. Your grass is probably like my backyard. It's like the border between Israel and Jordan. Not pretty.
[time=2792] Would you be tempted to say, "Well, if that guy's grass is green, maybe I should put an ashira pole in my backyard and pray to that God."
[time=2800] Actually, Ashira was also the goddess of fertility. If you wanted your wife to give birth to children, you better worship her.
[time=2811] And that's how cultic prostitution came to be. The worship of Ashira became sexual immorality.
[time=2818] But is in order for your wife to give birth to children you had to commit sexual adultery with pagan prostitute at their temples.
[time=2831] And that's what Israel did. So when God told them you shall not intermerize these people and you shall not worship these gods, God knew what he was talking about.
[time=2841] God knew that his children are fickle and that they will go after other gods.
[time=2845] And the fact that they didn't obey God did not drive them out, these gods became part of their everyday life.
[time=2858] And that's the sin, not just about idolatry, but that was the sin of intermarrying with pagans.
[time=2865] God knew that his people are fickle.
[time=2868] So the people of Israel lived among the canonites, the hetites, the amorites, the parasites, the hevites and the jebi sites, and their daughters, they took to themselves for wives.
[time=2879] And their own daughters, they gave to their sons and they served their gods.
[time=2887] Do you see what happens here? This is because they disobeyed God to begin with. They did not drive them out.
[time=2895] It's because they disobeyed God, they worshiped idols and then they intermarried with pagans.
[time=2903] Sin, my dear brothers and sisters, it's always rationalized. This is called moral relativism.
[time=2911] Imagine what was going on there, right? Hey, it's not really practical for us to drive all these people out of here.
[time=2918] Actually, if you read carefully in the book of Judges, what did the Israelites do? They actually forced some into labor, forced labor.
[time=2927] This is practical for us. We're not going to drive them out, we're going to make them work for us.
[time=2933] We're going to make them our slaves and in the process they became slaves to sin.
[time=2939] It's exactly what God did not want, but God and his love and mercy sent judgments and he sent oppressors.
[time=2948] Some of them are named here, Mesopotamians, Molobites, Philistines, Canaanites, Medianites.
[time=2954] Notice how long the oppression lasts. Eight years, 1840, 2020. So here's my question for us, my dear brothers and sisters.
[time=2963] Can God use pagan nations to punish his own people? It's right here on the slide. The answer is yes.
[time=2975] Yes, it's actually, if you read the whole Bible, God always uses and can use pagan instruments to carry his judgments.
[time=2991] Let me ask you this way. Can God today use unbelievers to punish and discipline believers?
[time=3004] Can God or has God in the past use evil rulers to oppress his children for disobedience?
[time=3019] Let me make it closer to home. Can God today during this presidential cycle raise up evil leaders to punish his people?
[time=3034] Don't answer that, don't answer that. Don't raise your hand. Just think in your heart. Can God do that? Can God do that?
[time=3046] And I have to ask myself that all the time. I grew up in a country like that where the dictator, Nikolai Choshescu, came out and said, "There is no God."
[time=3059] You do what I say. If you do go to church, then you cannot get a promotion in your job. Your kids cannot go to university.
[time=3071] I grew up in that. I came to the United States because I thought this was the promised land. I'm not so sure anymore.
[time=3081] Actually, America looks more like Romania of 30 years ago than I would like it to.
[time=3089] But we're not here to do politics. We're here to talk about the Bible.
[time=3094] So what does Israel do? Israel cries out to the Lord. Wouldn't that be a good thing for America to do?
[time=3102] The people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. Judges chapter 6. I'll give you one example.
[time=3109] And you'll hear more about this when we talk about Gideon.
[time=3114] The people of Israel sinned. This was in Judges 6 starting in verse 6.
[time=3120] They did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and served the bales and the ashtarot. Again, that's the plural of ashira.
[time=3127] The gods of Syria, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the Ammonites and the gods of the Philistines.
[time=3133] And they forsook the Lord and did not serve him. So the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel.
[time=3138] He sold them into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the Ammonites.
[time=3142] And they crushed and oppressed the people of Israel that year.
[time=3145] For 18 years they oppressed all the people of Israel who were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.
[time=3152] And the Ammonites crossed the Jordan to fight also against Judah and against Benjamin and against the house of Ephraim.
[time=3158] So the Israel was severely distressed.
[time=3161] And the people of Israel cried out to the Lord saying, "We have sinned against you because we have forsaken our God and have served the bales."
[time=3171] And God in his love and mercy listens and sends leaders.
[time=3176] He raises up leaders, the summaries in verse 16 of chapter 2.
[time=3181] Then the Lord raised up judges who saved them out of the hand of those who plundered them.
[time=3187] My dear brothers and sisters, this was true yesterday. It's true today, it will be true tomorrow.
[time=3192] God always raises up leaders to carry to accomplish his purposes.
[time=3197] And God will raise up a leader to be your senior pastor.
[time=3201] I don't doubt that for one second, but we have to pray about it.
[time=3205] We have to be united in this.
[time=3208] And we have to make sure we obey what the Bible says about these leaders.
[time=3213] And God raises up Othniel, Ehud Shamgar, Deborah Gideon, Tola, Jair, Jephthah, Ibsan, Elon, Abdon, and Samson.
[time=3222] And if you know anything about these people, they were not perfect people.
[time=3225] Were they? No, they were not.
[time=3228] But God used them anyway.
[time=3232] They are not necessarily examples of devotion to God.
[time=3237] Remember, Biblical characters are not portraits of morality.
[time=3242] They are mirrors for identity. Remember that? Remember that.
[time=3247] Biblical characters are not portraits of morality.
[time=3250] They are mirrors of identity. We can see ourselves in them.
[time=3256] God raised up leaders in the past, and he will do that in the future.
[time=3261] And ultimately, he raised up the ultimately during the person of Jesus Christ,
[time=3267] who defeated not just the Philistines or the Romans or the Greeks.
[time=3271] He defeated sin.
[time=3274] He defeated sin, and that's what we needed.
[time=3277] So the question is, do you have that leader on your side?
[time=3281] Do you belong to Jesus Christ? Is Jesus Christ your Lord and your Savior?
[time=3287] How do we apply the truth today? First of all, obey God fully.
[time=3291] Remember that incomplete obedience is disobedience.
[time=3296] Incomplete obedience is disobedience.
[time=3300] We sang this morning, I loved the choir. Can the choir do that again today, this morning? Can you do it again? No.
[time=3308] No cowbell, no encore. What's up?
[time=3317] We've got to have a talk there.
[time=3322] The choir sang beautifully. You are worthy to be praised.
[time=3327] Amen? Is that good? But before we sing, you are worthy to be praised.
[time=3331] We have to know that he's worthy to be obeyed.
[time=3334] We can't just show up here and sing, you are worthy to be praised.
[time=3337] And then Monday to Saturday, we sing all types of sins.
[time=3340] And then we say here, you are worthy to be praised. No.
[time=3343] You are worthy to be praised, but first he's worthy to be obeyed.
[time=3347] Are we obeying him? That's the question.
[time=3352] It's very easy to shop on Sunday morning and sing, you are worthy to be praised, but we need to obey him every day.
[time=3360] And then we can come and sing all we want, even encores.
[time=3369] Second, cry out to God passionately.
[time=3372] If you are doing the revolving door of sinning, repent of your sin.
[time=3381] Cry out to God and he will forgive you.
[time=3384] And maybe you are in some type of addiction, either alcohol, pornography or other types of addictions.
[time=3393] Ask for help.
[time=3395] There are people who have been through that before and they are recovering from those addictions.
[time=3400] Ask for help.
[time=3401] Call the office, meet with another, meet with someone and say, I need help.
[time=3407] Don't go through this alone.
[time=3409] There are people who have been through that before, but cry out to God passionately and return to him.
[time=3416] Maybe you say, I don't know how to pray.
[time=3418] Open to Psalm 51 and David will teach you how to pray.
[time=3422] Have mercy on your God.
[time=3425] Just read that.
[time=3427] Ask for help.
[time=3429] God has blessed others with wisdom.
[time=3431] How to help people with addictions and then return to God quickly.
[time=3437] Zechariah 1, 3, God says, return to me, says the Lord of hosts and I will return to you.
[time=3445] There needs to be that turning and that repentance.
[time=3447] As Leo Tolstoy, the great Russian writer said, the antagonism between life and conscience may be removed in two ways.
[time=3455] By a change of life or by a change of conscience.
[time=3460] And I implore you to change your life, not to have your conscience steered.
[time=3466] As Darren will lead us in the final song, I implore you to make a decision about whether or not you are going to obey God fully or not.
[time=3480] And I know some of you are shy, you don't want to come in front.
[time=3483] We will have elders here at the end.
[time=3486] After the service is over, we will have elders here, we will have elders in the back and I am going to be in the prayer room.
[time=3492] If you go through those doors and to the right there is a prayer room, I will be there waiting if you want to talk.
[time=3498] If you want to surrender your life to Jesus Christ, we are here for you.
[time=3503] If you need help in any way, shape or form, we are here for you.
[time=3508] Let's pray.
[time=3510] Dear Father, thank you for your love and mercy.
[time=3514] Thank you that you are indeed a good, good Father.
[time=3517] And your goodness and your allow us to return to you, to repent of sin.
[time=3523] Thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ into the world to save sinners such as I.
[time=3531] I pray that today will be a day of repentance.
[time=3533] We will stop going through a revolving door of sin and idolatry and disobedience and other addictions or other things like that.
[time=3543] We will find salvation and freedom through the person and the work of Jesus Christ.
[time=3549] I pray that that will be the case for all those who are here this morning.
[time=3553] Thank you for Jesus.
[time=3555] I pray that you will teach us what it means to obey you every day.
[time=3559] And after that to praise you because indeed you are worthy.
[time=3563] In Christ name I pray. Amen.
