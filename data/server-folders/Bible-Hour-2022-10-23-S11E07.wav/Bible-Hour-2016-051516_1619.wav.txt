[time=30] [MUSIC - 1040 seconds]
[time=1080] >> Happy Mother's Day to everybody, or if you're from Spanish-speaking country, Feliz Dia de la Madre.
[time=1085] [MUSIC]
[time=1089] >> That's all I know.
[time=1092] >> Yeah, happy Mother's Day, yeah, so if they're in a set, I have to say it to my wife, to my mother,
[time=1099] sometimes watches through the internet because she lives in California.
[time=1103] But I noticed that there and forgot to mention his mother-in-law.
[time=1107] >> [LAUGH]
[time=1115] >> I have a guest bedroom if you want to use it.
[time=1118] >> [LAUGH] >> So happy Mother's Day to all the mothers-in-law too, my mind who lives in Romania.
[time=1128] I read about two children who told their mom to stay in bed on Mother's Day.
[time=1136] And as she lay there looking forward to being served breakfast in bed, she smelled bacon.
[time=1144] And she finally went down to the kitchen to find her children eating by themselves bacon and eggs.
[time=1155] And they said, as a surprise for Mother's Day, they explained, we decided to cook our own breakfast today.
[time=1164] >> [LAUGH] >> I think they missed the point, I think.
[time=1170] >> [LAUGH] >> But I love John Stiles Paul, and that says this.
[time=1177] I have worshipped in churches and chapels.
[time=1180] I have prayed in the busy street.
[time=1182] I have sought my God and found him in the waves of his ocean beat.
[time=1187] I have knelt in the silent forest in the shade of some ancient tree.
[time=1192] But the dearest of all my altars was at my mother's knee.
[time=1198] God make me the man of her vision and purge me of selfishness.
[time=1205] God keep me true to her standards and help me to live to bless.
[time=1211] God hallowed the holy impress of the days they used to be.
[time=1216] And keep me a pilgrim forever to the shrine that my mother's knee.
[time=1224] Maybe you are here today and you cannot celebrate Mother's Day.
[time=1228] Maybe you always wanted to be a mom and you couldn't.
[time=1232] I'm here to tell you that you are not a second-class citizen.
[time=1237] Maybe society tries to make you feel that way.
[time=1241] But I want to tell you that you are precious because you are created in the image of God.
[time=1246] And what gives you value, it's not the number of your children.
[time=1251] But the fact that you are created in the image of God.
[time=1256] You are valuable.
[time=1258] And I know some of you hurt today because this year might be the first year you celebrate Mother's Day without your mom.
[time=1266] Maybe she is celebrating in heaven.
[time=1269] So we have to think about that too as we celebrate.
[time=1275] We have to think about those who maybe today more.
[time=1279] I didn't plan it that way. This is the Gospel project and today we are supposed to talk about Deborah.
[time=1286] And Deborah in the book of Judges describes herself as a mother in Israel.
[time=1293] So it's very appropriate that we study about her today.
[time=1296] If you have your Bibles, turn to Judges chapter 4 please.
[time=1299] If you don't have a Bible, there are Bibles in your pews page 116 in the pew Bibles.
[time=1306] I'll be reading from the English standard version.
[time=1318] Judges chapter 4.
[time=1324] Starting in verse 1.
[time=1328] The people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord after a hood died.
[time=1333] And the Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan who reigned in Khatsor.
[time=1340] The commander of his army was Cicera who lived in Haroshit Ha'Goim.
[time=1346] Then the people of Israel cried out to the Lord for help.
[time=1349] For he had 900 chariots of iron and he oppressed the people of Israel cruelly for 20 years.
[time=1356] Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth was judging Israel at that time.
[time=1364] She used to sit under a palm, under the palm of Deborah between Rama and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim.
[time=1371] And the people of Israel came up to her for judgment.
[time=1375] She sent and summoned Barak the son of Abimwam from Kedesh, Naftali, and said to him,
[time=1381] "Has not the Lord the God of Israel command you go?
[time=1385] Gather your men at Mount Tabor, taking 10,000 from the people of Naftali and people of Zebulun.
[time=1392] And I will draw out Cicera, the general of Jabin's army, to meet you by the river Kishon with his chariots
[time=1399] and his troops, and I will give him into your hand." Barak said to her, "If you will go with me, I will go, but if you will not go with me, I will not go."
[time=1410] And she said, "I will surely go with you.
[time=1413] Nevertheless, the road on which you are going will not lead to your glory.
[time=1417] For the Lord will sell Cicera into the hand of a woman."
[time=1423] Then Deborah rose and went to Barak to Kedesh, and Barak called out Zebulun and Aftali to Kedesh,
[time=1430] and 10,000 men went up at his heels, and Deborah went up with him.
[time=1436] The first thing that we learned right away is what we studied about last week, is that Israel is going again to the cycle of apostasy.
[time=1446] Remember, for those of you who are last week, we saw that Israel will go seven times to the cycle of apostasy,
[time=1453] something that Chuck Swindol called recycled misery.
[time=1458] And again, here, by the way, this is the, let me show you how I get it wrong.
[time=1463] This is the third such cycle in the book of Judges, and in today's passage we have, again, Israel sinning again.
[time=1474] In this case, God sends an oppressor, and in this case, the oppressor are the Canaanites.
[time=1483] Israel cries out to God.
[time=1487] They've been suffering other Canaanites for 20 years, and then God raises up the bar.
[time=1492] Remember, he always raises up a leader, a judge.
[time=1496] And after that, there's peace in the land.
[time=1499] And after that, after the period of peace, usually when the judge dies, they go back to their sinning ways.
[time=1508] So verse one introduces us again to how the cycle starts.
[time=1513] It starts with Israel sinning again.
[time=1517] And the people of Israel, again, did what was evil in the sight of the Lord after Ahud died.
[time=1524] Now, Ahud is dealt with in chapter three, and we know he had a very successful reign
[time=1532] because the land had peace for 80 years, 80 years of peace, that's a long time.
[time=1539] And God blesses his leadership, but now again, the Israelites are returning to their miserable sinning ways.
[time=1549] Now, this chapter does not describe what the sin was, but chapter two, remember, does describe.
[time=1555] Remember the three sins of Israel.
[time=1559] First of all, there was incomplete obedience.
[time=1562] They did not drive out all the foreign people from, all the pagans from the land.
[time=1568] That was the first sin, incomplete obedience.
[time=1571] Second sin was idolatry.
[time=1574] Not only did they not drive them out, but they borrowed their gods and goddesses, and they became syncretistic.
[time=1581] They basically worshiped their gods and goddesses, Baal, the storm god, and Asherah, the goddess of fertility.
[time=1590] And the third sin which is connected to these two is the sin of intermarriage, or the intermarriage with pagans.
[time=1599] So because they're sinning again, God sends an oppressor.
[time=1603] What is interesting about this oppressor is that this is not an oppressor from outside of the borders of Israel.
[time=1610] This is an oppressor from inside the land.
[time=1615] Which, by the way, I would argue that the greatest threat many times doesn't come from without comes from within.
[time=1625] And this is true not just in the family, not just in churches, but it was definitely true in Israel.
[time=1632] The Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan who reigned in Khatsor. The commander of his army was Cicera.
[time=1641] We love that song, you're a good, good father, right?
[time=1645] I like it. I like it. We should sing it as much as we can.
[time=1650] But because he's a good, good father, God needs to punish his children when they sin.
[time=1656] And that's exactly what he does now.
[time=1660] Now, remember the oppressor's God sends.
[time=1664] We talked about them last time.
[time=1666] From the outside, he sends Mesopotamians, he sends mobites, Medianites, Ammonites, or even the Philistines.
[time=1673] But the Canaanites are not from outside of the borders of Israel, they're from within.
[time=1678] These are the very people they were supposed to drive out, and now they become exactly what God said.
[time=1685] They become a snare to them.
[time=1689] And the Canaanites oppress the children of Israel because they did not obey God.
[time=1699] Our dear brothers and sisters, again, we have to learn that sometimes the greatest threat doesn't come from the outside, but comes from within.
[time=1708] We have to be very, very careful.
[time=1711] It's just enough family and church. It can happen in a business world, it can happen, and it just happens here in history.
[time=1720] What is interesting here in Judges chapter 2, chapter 4 verse 2 is that the language employed here about Japin, king of Canaanites, is the same language used in Exodus about Pharaoh and his armies.
[time=1738] And I quote, "Both accounts emphasize the strength of the enemy's horses. Both accounts deal with the body of water as the instruments of the Lord's destruction.
[time=1749] In both accounts God confuses or routes the enemy, and in both instances the enemy is totally destroyed."
[time=1759] God sends an oppressor, and because God sends an oppressor, the children of Israel are forced again to go to God.
[time=1767] Verse 3, "Then the people of Israel cried out to the Lord for help, for he had 900 chariots of iron, and he oppressed the people of Israel cruelly for 20 years."
[time=1779] 20 years is enough. I don't know about you, but when I am judged or punished for sin, I usually don't wait for 20 years.
[time=1790] The children of Israel for some reason said, "Hey, we can live with this." So let's ask ourselves for how long can we live with sin before we cry out to God.
[time=1801] Remembering that again the greatest threat might not be from the outside, but it might be from the inside.
[time=1809] "Then the people of Israel cried out to the Lord." By the way, it is the same expression that appears in Exodus 14, verse 10, when Pharaoh's army was closing in.
[time=1821] Again, there are clear parallels between what Pharaoh did and how God delivered the children of Israel from Pharaoh's hand
[time=1830] and how God will deliver the children of Israel from Jabbin's hand.
[time=1835] And in his grace and mercy, God hears their prayer and appoints a leader.
[time=1842] In this case, in the form of Deborah, and she is first introduced as a prophetess.
[time=1850] Now, Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidot was judging Israel at that time, so what do we know about her?
[time=1858] We don't know much about her.
[time=1861] Again, in chapter 5 she will introduce herself as a mother in Israel.
[time=1866] Is she talking figuratively?
[time=1872] Probably.
[time=1873] Is she an actual mother?
[time=1875] Probably.
[time=1876] But what we know for sure from what the text says is that she is a prophetess and that she is a wife, the wife of Lapidot.
[time=1885] But what happens here, she is set in stark contrast with Cicera.
[time=1891] Cicera is the general of the enemy's army, of the Canaanites.
[time=1897] And here the text wants to basically pose Deborah in contrast with Cicera.
[time=1904] Deborah the prophetess raised by God, and Cicera the pagan general who came to oppress the people of Israel.
[time=1915] Look please, in verse 2.
[time=1918] Cicera was the captain of Jabbin's army. In verse 4, Deborah was a prophetess.
[time=1924] A prophetess is an intermediary between God and people.
[time=1929] Cicera is a military general. Deborah is one who communicates God's word in a time of crisis.
[time=1938] Clear contrast.
[time=1940] Contrast number 2.
[time=1942] Cicera lived in Haroshit Hagoim, which is again a part of the promised land.
[time=1952] Deborah sat in the hill country of Ephraim, a part that God gave specifically to the tribe of Ephraim.
[time=1958] Verse 3. Cicera oppressed Israel for 20 years.
[time=1962] Deborah provided leadership for Israel.
[time=1967] We see here my dear brothers and sisters a very, very important concept and principle for all of us,
[time=1974] especially for our church this morning.
[time=1977] God's hands are not tied by a leadership crisis.
[time=1983] Let me say that again. God's hands are not tied by a leadership crisis.
[time=1989] Whether that happens in the nation or it happens in the family or in the church, God always raises up leaders to accomplish his purposes.
[time=1999] Always.
[time=2002] And in this case, he raises Deborah.
[time=2005] Again, a prophetess.
[time=2007] By the way, there are only seven prophetesses mentioned in the whole Bible.
[time=2012] Seven.
[time=2014] Miriam, Moses's sister, Deborah, Hilda, who's mentioned in the book of Nehemiah,
[time=2023] Isaiah's unnamed wife, and Anna in the New Testament are good prophetesses.
[time=2029] So five out of seven are good.
[time=2034] Two are false prophetesses.
[time=2037] Noah Diah, also in the book of Nehemiah, and the unnamed prophetess in the book of Revelation.
[time=2044] The book of Ezekiel also mentioned an unknown number of false prophetesses during his ministry,
[time=2050] but we don't have their names, so we don't know how many we would have.
[time=2054] But it seems that if you do the math and if you add the prophetesses from Ezekiel's time,
[time=2060] most of them were false prophetesses, not true prophetesses.
[time=2066] But we know that Deborah is used by God, she's a true prophetess.
[time=2072] And we also have to be reminded that there are two types of prophets, not just good or true and false,
[time=2082] but there are writing prophets and there are non-writing prophets.
[time=2086] Because we don't have a book called the book of Deborah, do we?
[time=2090] We don't, because just like Elijah and Elisha, Deborah is a non-writing prophet or prophetess.
[time=2098] She can do that, she's not writing scripture, but then we have those who write scripture, like Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and so on.
[time=2107] So even though she doesn't leave us anything in writing, she is speaking through her actions.
[time=2114] So we know as a prophetess, she was an intermediary between God and people.
[time=2119] We know that, that's by definition the role of a prophet.
[time=2122] So she's a prophetess, she's a good, a true prophetess, and then she is a judge.
[time=2128] Verse 5 says, she used to sit under the palm of Deborah between Rama and Bethlehem,
[time=2134] the hill country of Ephraim, and the people of Israel came up to her for judgment.
[time=2140] So not only was she a prophetess speaking God's word to the people, but she was a solver of legal disputes.
[time=2148] People, since the beginning of time apparently had legal disputes.
[time=2153] Where do they go? We know later they will go to Solomon, right?
[time=2157] The wise one, but now they go to Deborah, and the Bible says here that she was that type of judge.
[time=2164] She was a solver of legal disputes.
[time=2168] Now if you come to visit me at Grace, I can show you my office, and I think I really have the best office on campus.
[time=2176] It's a corner office with big windows, and I think I have the best view on campus.
[time=2184] But I kind of envy Deborah. Her office was under a palm tree.
[time=2191] I assume this was not in Indiana.
[time=2198] Look at her office space under the palm that actually got, they named her after Deborah.
[time=2209] We are not told what cases were brought before her.
[time=2213] We are not told how wise she was. That's not relevant.
[time=2218] What's relevant here is that God raises her to speak her word.
[time=2224] God raises her to judge the people, and we also see that God raises her, and she is really wise.
[time=2234] This is a video that I was going to show after this slide, but we can show it now.
[time=2246] It talks about teamwork.
[time=2254] [MUSIC - 231 seconds]
[time=2503] Could it be that if we are weak is because we run alone?
[time=2508] And I'm asking you as a family. I'm asking you as a church.
[time=2513] Is it us against them, or are we together running and accomplishing God's will for our lives?
[time=2523] Deborah was a wise leader because she understood her weaknesses. Notice, please what she does.
[time=2530] There are some things she can do. She can be a prophetess.
[time=2539] She can be the intermediary between God and people, and she can judge, but she is not a military leader, and she understands that she needs another leader.
[time=2550] She sent and summoned Barak, the son of Abimlan from Kedash Naftali, and said to him,
[time=2558] "Has not the Lord the God of Israel commended you, go gather your men at Mount Table, or taking 10,000 men from the people of Naftali, and the people of Zebulun."
[time=2571] And I will draw out Cicera, the general of Jabin's army, to meet you by the river Kishon with his chariots and his troops, and I will give him into your hand.
[time=2581] Barak said to her, "If you will go with me, I will go, but if you will not go with me, I will not go." And she said, "I will surely go with you. Nevertheless, the road on which you are going will not lead to your glory
[time=2592] for the Lord will sell Cicera into the hand of a woman." Then Deborah arose and went to Barak to Kedash, and Barak called out Zebulun and Taftali to Kedash, and 10,000 men went up at his heels, and Deborah went up with him.
[time=2609] My dear brothers and sisters, part of leadership is understanding your strengths and understanding your weaknesses.
[time=2616] As the great theologian, Clint Eastwood, said, "A man has got to know his limitations."
[time=2625] That's great theology right there.
[time=2628] Unfortunately, a lot of times we encounter problems, not just in the family or in the church or in the business, because we don't know our limitations, and we think we can do it all.
[time=2640] Deborah was wise and knew that she cannot do it all, so she went to the one who could.
[time=2649] Deborah is wise and goes and asks Barak to lead the troops.
[time=2655] Now, some people blame Barak for his hesitation.
[time=2659] I've read commentaries when some scholars are really, really tough on our brother Barak here.
[time=2667] But I agree with Dr. Davis in his commentary that writes this.
[time=2672] Barak refused to go without a prophetic compliment, the presence of Deborah.
[time=2678] Barak should not be judges lacking faith at this point.
[time=2683] He merely wanted the one who could give divine guidance and help for such an important occasion.
[time=2689] He knows his history, and he knows that in the past, only people who work together can accomplish God's purposes.
[time=2699] And I'm praying that we'll learn that lesson personally, as families, as a church, as business, whatever we're doing, the God will give us wisdom to understand what we are called to do and what we are not called to do.
[time=2718] And then, Deborah describes herself as Deborah the mother.
[time=2728] In chapter 5, we have that song of praise that we can look at in chapter 5.
[time=2737] But in verse 7, as she describes herself, she says, "I, Deborah, arose as a mother in Israel."
[time=2745] One Jewish writer puts it like this, Deborah, sitting serenely under the pantry looks through her with the song she sings.
[time=2756] "I arose a mother in Israel, arose with a sword and a word, and without her they could not move."
[time=2764] "A mother," she called herself, "but of course that was not all." She was a judge, warrior, wife, prophetess, and creator of song.
[time=2773] Prophecy flowed through her a wellspring of life, a teaching for our own generation.
[time=2779] For all women who are looking to define themselves and fully use their potential.
[time=2784] And yet being a mother in Israel was the mirror image and foundation of Deborah's strength and wisdom.
[time=2792] We sing, "You're a good, good father." Can I use my sanctified imagination there?
[time=2800] Don't answer that, because I know what your answer would be.
[time=2805] But I like to imagine the people gathering around the Bora and singing, "You're a good, good mother."
[time=2814] I kid, it's a joke. I don't think they did that.
[time=2818] But it would have been good if they could, right? We know, but she identifies herself as a mother in Israel.
[time=2826] And because of that and because God gives her victory, they praise God for victory.
[time=2831] Notice they don't give praise to Deborah, they give praise to God.
[time=2836] Again, look at me in chapter 5, please.
[time=2839] In chapter 5 we have this song, it's a duet, apparently.
[time=2844] Verse 5, chapter 5, verse 1 says, "Then sang Deborah in Barak the son of Abiram on that day,
[time=2850] that the leaders stood the lead in Israel, that the people offered themselves willingly blessed the Lord.
[time=2857] Hero kings, give hero princes to the Lord I will sing.
[time=2861] I will make medley to the Lord the God of Israel.
[time=2865] Lord, when you went out from say here, when you marched from the region of Edom, the earth trembled and the heavens dropped.
[time=2873] Yes, the clouds dropped water, the mountainsquake before the Lord even Sinai before the Lord, the God of Israel.
[time=2883] God is to be praised even though God uses Deborah and actually God uses another woman for the victory.
[time=2893] Look at me in chapter 4 starting in verse 17.
[time=2896] Another woman comes into the story, her name is Jael.
[time=2902] Starting in verse 17, verse 4, "But Cicera fled away on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Canaanite,
[time=2910] for there was peace between Jabin the king of Chatsor and the house of Heber the Canaanite.
[time=2915] And Jael came out to meet Cicera and said to him, "Turn aside my Lord, turn aside to me, do not be afraid."
[time=2922] So he turned aside to her into the tent and she covered him with a rug.
[time=2926] And he said to her, "Please give me a little water to drink for I am thirsty."
[time=2932] So she opened the skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him.
[time=2936] And he said to her, "Stand at the opening of the tent and if any man comes and asks you, is anyone here say no."
[time=2943] But Jael the wife of Heber took a tent peg and took a hammer in her hand.
[time=2948] Then she went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple until he went down into the ground while he was lying fast asleep from weariness.
[time=2955] So he died.
[time=2960] Looking verses 23 and 24, what does it say?
[time=2964] On that day, Deborah and Jael subdued, right?
[time=2968] Is that what it says?
[time=2969] No, it says on that day God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the people of Israel
[time=2976] and the hand of the people of Israel pressed harder and harder against Jabin the king of Canaan until they destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.
[time=2984] The guy who oppressed them for 20 years now is destroyed because of God who appoints women to lead
[time=2993] when there's a leadership crisis.
[time=2996] One scholar puts it like this.
[time=2998] Jael is a heroine who offers milk instead of water, death in place of sleep and a corpse instead of a captive.
[time=3011] Whose praises are we going to sing?
[time=3016] Deborahs?
[time=3017] We don't have any song that sings praise Deborah.
[time=3020] We don't have any songs that say bless the name of Jael, but we have plenty of songs that say praise the Lord.
[time=3027] Because God gets the ultimate credit because as chapter 4 verse 23 said it was God who did this.
[time=3041] The fact that God uses you and I should not be a reason for pride should be a reason for humility.
[time=3052] God in a leadership crisis can raise anybody to do anything.
[time=3060] We have to learn that none of us are indispensable.
[time=3063] If we think oh after I'm gone everything will go downhill we don't know who God is.
[time=3070] And more importantly we don't know who we are and that's even worse.
[time=3075] We need to understand that God's hands are not tied by a leadership crisis, but God will always raise anybody to do the work of ministry and he will accomplish victory.
[time=3088] There's actually a song about that I want us to sing together.
[time=3092] It's an older song.
[time=3093] We're just going to sing two verses of it.
[time=3097] So can we please stand and sing this we're just going to sing two verses.
[time=3106] I heard an old old story how a Savior came from glory.
[time=3121] How He gave His life for the Calvary, no Savior etched like me.
[time=3129] I heard loud He's grown in.
[time=3133] How His precious blood are told in.
[time=3137] Then I re-planted of my sin and won the victory.
[time=3145] Oh, victory in Jesus, my Savior forever.
[time=3153] He sought me and got me with His redeeming blood.
[time=3161] He loved me and I knew He.
[time=3165] And all my love is to Him.
[time=3169] He plunged me to victory.
[time=3173] We need the cleansing flood.
[time=3178] I heard an old He's seeding of His cleansing flowery veering.
[time=3186] I'll be made the lame to walk again and cause the blind to see.
[time=3194] And then I cry dear Jesus, come and heal my open spirit.
[time=3202] And somehow Jesus came and brought to me the victory.
[time=3210] Oh, victory in Jesus, my Savior forever.
[time=3218] He sought me and got me with His redeeming blood.
[time=3226] He loved me and I knew He.
[time=3230] And all my love is to Him.
[time=3234] He plunged me to victory.
[time=3238] We need the cleansing flood.
[time=3244] Amen, please be seated.
[time=3249] All right, my time is up, but I've got to finish this last two slides.
[time=3255] First of all, God provided the ultimate victory through Jesus Christ when He rose Him from the dead.
[time=3263] 1 John 3-8, if you don't know this verse, I urge you to learn it and to memorize it.
[time=3270] 1 John 3-8, or maybe underline it in your Bibles, or do something with this verse, especially when you are tempted to feel that you are defeated.
[time=3283] 1 John 3-8, whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning.
[time=3291] The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.
[time=3304] So what Jesus has done when He died for our sins and rose again, He destroyed the works of Satan, so we are now fighting a defeated enemy.
[time=3315] And that's very important to remember, because Satan will always lie to you, and you have to counter with truth.
[time=3323] That's why it's important to speak truth, because if we don't speak the truth, and if we don't teach the truth, we will believe lies.
[time=3333] And if you don't accept the truth, you'll make something else in its place. You'll make something else up. It happens all the time.
[time=3341] The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.
[time=3346] So the ultimate victory that we need to get and to put our faith in is what Jesus has done on the cross, and then when He rose again.
[time=3357] We sang this morning, Jesus died on Calvary, so the whole world would see, it was a great thing that He did for me.
[time=3365] And again, we sang, "Then I cried dear Jesus, come and heal my broken spirit, because Deborah is not going to heal you, Gile is not going to heal you, but Jesus will heal your broken spirit."
[time=3377] And that's why we have to put our faith in Him.
[time=3381] So three points for application. First of all, unlike the Israelites, we need to obey God fully, even when it's not popular.
[time=3389] Second of all, be a team player. Know your limitations. Examine yourself. What are my strengths? What are my weaknesses?
[time=3399] And if your weakness is to sing, then don't sing. Don't join the choir. Even with the cowbell, right there?
[time=3408] Okay. If your gift is not teaching or preaching, don't use it. Do something else. There are many things you can do.
[time=3420] Examine yourself. Know your limitation. And use your gifts for God's glory.
[time=3427] Maybe some people in the leadership of the church don't know your gifts. Go and tell them, "Hey, God has gift of me with this. Where can I serve? How can I serve?"
[time=3437] And lastly, praise and worship God exclusively. Don't praise people.
[time=3445] Be thankful for people. Be thankful for Godly leaders. Be thankful for Godly mothers. But don't give praise to them. Give praise to God.
[time=3455] Don't worship the creature. Worship the Creator. We will close in prayer, and then we will sing.
[time=3465] And while we sing and maybe afterwards, if you want to pray with someone, we'll have members of the Black Hawk family.
[time=3471] They want to pray with you either here in front or in the back, or I'll be in the prayer room.
[time=3475] If you go through those doors to the right, there's a prayer room. And I'll be glad to meet with you there afterwards. Let's pray.
[time=3484] Dear Father, we thank you for Godly mothers and grandmothers and mothers in law.
[time=3491] Thank you for those who went before us. I pray that today you will reward them for their faithfulness and their godliness.
[time=3500] We give you the praise and the glory for who they are and how you brought them in our lives.
[time=3506] And from today's lesson, I pray that you'll forgive us for the many times when we did not obey you fully.
[time=3512] Forgive us for the times when we tried to use other people's gifts, or maybe even criticize them.
[time=3519] I pray they will give us wisdom and fill us with the Holy Spirit so we know our limitations.
[time=3524] Help us to examine ourselves to know what our gifts are and may we use them for your glory, not just today, but every day.
[time=3533] And give us a spirit of praise and glory to praise you for who you are, not just on Sunday mornings, but every day.
[time=3541] Even in our cars, in our offices, wherever we are in our homes, may we praise you for who you are and what we have done.
[time=3549] And thank you for the victory we have in Jesus.
[time=3552] Thank you that Jesus came to destroy the works of Satan.
[time=3557] Help us to find that assurance in the personal work of Jesus Christ, in whose name I pray. Amen.
[time=3571] You
