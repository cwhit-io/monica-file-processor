[time=381] >> All right, go ahead.
[time=382] >> The question is two times.
[time=383] I have been crucified with Christ and I have no longer lived, but Christ lifted me the life I now live in.
[time=389] The body I live by faith and the God who loved me and gave himself for me.
[time=396] >> Yep, Lord Jesus Christ is my Lord Savior and Creator, nothing can separate us.
[time=402] All right, Rebecca, I'm gonna ask you those two same questions, okay?
[time=406] Have you repented of your sin?
[time=407] >> Yeah.
[time=408] >> And put your faith in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ?
[time=410] And are you proclaimed today to our family that you wanna fall in Christ and live for him?
[time=415] >> Yeah.
[time=416] >> All right, come right over here.

[time=601] [MUSIC]
[time=616] [APPLAUSE]
[time=623] [MUSIC]
[time=643] >> All right.
[time=645] We have Summer here and she's gonna share her story before we ask those questions.
[time=646] You ready Summer?
[time=647] >> Yeah.
[time=648] >> All right.
[time=649] You go ahead.
[time=650] >> Okay, so my name's Summer Johnson.
[time=657] I'm 21 years old.
[time=658] I'm a student athlete at ICFW on the volleyball team.
[time=663] I'm going into my senior year in the fall.
[time=667] I have an older brother who's married and they had their first child a month and a half ago so I'm an aunt now and my family's been coming to Black Heart for as long as I can
[time=679] remember.
[time=680] I've been longing for something new in my life, something different, but I could never quite
[time=694] put my finger on it.
[time=699] At the beginning of the year, I made a New Year's resolution to be a better Christian.
[time=705] And I know that's a pretty broad and vague statement.
[time=710] And I didn't know exactly how I would accomplish that by myself.
[time=715] I knew I would need some help.
[time=718] I've had a great support system my whole life.
[time=722] My parents have always been there for me.
[time=725] My friends never failed to have my back.
[time=729] And my boyfriend is one of the most amazing people I know, not to mention the coaches, teammates and mentors I've had through the years.
[time=738] I needed something more powerful to help me like divine intervention.
[time=744] I never wanted myself to get caught up in worldly things.
[time=749] I've always challenged myself to do the right thing.
[time=754] A lot of people think that the right thing's going to church and doing good deeds and those things will get you into heaven.
[time=761] I learned that it's not really the case.
[time=766] I've started reading the Bible more often, at least once a day, thinking that I would
[time=772] find some answers to my problems in there.
[time=776] And I did find some answers.
[time=779] It's actually really exciting to see the connections I've made so far.
[time=785] I've been able to apply what I've learned to the world around me.
[time=789] But I needed something more.
[time=792] So when I saw in the bulletin that they were doing baptisms here, I knew that that was the next step for me.
[time=799] God really placed his on my heart and now I'm answering his call.
[time=805] I know that the Bible says, "For I'll have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
[time=817] We don't really deserve anything down here.
[time=821] And I know enough about the world and can see where sin is taking it.
[time=826] And I want to be going the opposite direction.
[time=830] The path that seems to be less traveled these days.
[time=834] The one that spreads the word of God rather than the one that hides it.
[time=839] The one that inspires others to be better and to believe in God.
[time=845] What am I really doing on this earth if I don't let other people know about my faith?
[time=850] This is just a temporary home for us.
[time=854] We have to ask ourselves if this were my last day on earth, would I go to heaven?
[time=860] Have I done enough, gone above and beyond what God asked of me?
[time=865] Or have I just slid by and lived quietly in my faith?
[time=869] Ultimately, we should all be working for God's kingdom.
[time=874] I know Jesus is Lord.
[time=878] I haven't personally confessed it as much as I should or fully committed my life to Christ
[time=892] in front of this many people, but I believe in Jesus and His gift of salvation.
[time=899] And I want to live the rest of my life for Him.
[time=915] I think Summer answered those two questions.
[time=918] [AMEN] Summer, based on your profession of faith today, it's modern privilege to now baptize your
[time=926] name the Father and the Son of the Holy Spirit, great.
[time=951] Go ahead and tell everybody your name.
[time=952] My name is Shay.
[time=953] Shay, thanks for being here.
[time=954] Excited for you, man.
[time=956] Have you repented of your sin, Shay?
[time=957] Yes, I have.
[time=958] Place your faith in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ?
[time=960] Yes, I have.
[time=961] Awesome.
[time=962] And are you here today to proclaim to our family that you're going to follow Christ and live for Him?
[time=966] Yes, sir.
[time=967] All right.
[time=968] Shay, based on your profession of faith today, I know baptizing your name the Father, Son,
[time=975] Holy Spirit.
[time=990] I'm going to now invite John Bars to come into the baptismal for our last baptism.
[time=1001] My name is Mike Bisser, and I'm excited and feel privileged to be here today.
[time=1018] I'm thankful for the love and the support of my family and friends.
[time=1023] I grew up in a Christian home, but at the age 11, my parents got divorced.
[time=1028] And by the age of 14, I was going down the wrong path and my life was full of sin.
[time=1034] I know I'm a sinner and realized that I was a sinner at the age of 14.
[time=1038] When I was at a low point in my life, I reached out to God and prayed that He would be my Lord and Savior, knowing that He died from my sins through Him, my return alive, so that
[time=1049] so through my faith and my desire to be and serve the Lord, I choose adult baptism to continue
[time=1055] to strengthen my relationship with the Lord.
[time=1058] I'm thankful to be here at Black Hawk growing in my Christian faith.
[time=1069] Good morning, Black Hawk.
[time=1072] It's good to be back.
[time=1074] Good to see you all this morning.
[time=1075] Mike and Stephanie came to our home community in the fall of 2013, and we've had the privilege
[time=1082] of walking through life with them these last couple of years, and it's been a real blessing, and this is just Mike's next step in following his Lord.
[time=1091] And Mike, let's get behind here.
[time=1094] Because of your profession in the Lord Jesus Christ, it's my privilege to baptize you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[time=1108] Now, the angel of the Lord came and sat under the tear-benth at Oprah, which belonged to
[time=1115] Joesh and Abai's right while his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the wine press to
[time=1122] hide it from the Midianites.
[time=1124] And the angel of the Lord appeared to him and said to him, "The Lord is with you, almighty man of valor." And Gideon said to him, "Please sir, if the Lord is with us, why then has all this happened to us, and we're all His wonderful deeds that our Father's recounted to us, saying,
[time=1142] "Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt?
[time=1145] But now the Lord has forsaken us, and given us into the hand of Midian." And the Lord turned to him and said, "Go in this might of yours, and save Israel from the hand of Midian.
[time=1157] Do I not send you?" And he said to him, "Please Lord, how can I save Israel?
[time=1162] Behold, my clan is the weakest of Manasseh, and I am the least of in my Father's house."
[time=1169] And the Lord said to him, "But I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man." And he said to him, "If now I have found fear in your eyes, then show me a sign that it is you who speak with me.
[time=1184] Please do not depart from here until I come to you and bring out my present, and set it before you," and he said, "I will stay till you return." So Gideon went into his house and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes from an ephah of flour, the meat he put in a basket, and the broth he put in a pot, and brought
[time=1205] them to him under the pterometh and presented them.
[time=1210] And the angel of God said to him, "Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, and put them on this rock, and pour the broth over them," and he did so.
[time=1221] Then the angel of the Lord reached out the tip of his staff that was in his hand and touched the meat with the unleavened cakes, and fire sprang from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes, and the angel of the Lord vanished from his sight.
[time=1236] Then Gideon perceived that he was the angel of the Lord, and Gideon said, "Alasso, Lord God, for now I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face, but the Lord said to him, 'Peace be to you, do not fear, you shall not die.'" Then Gideon built an altar there to the Lord and called it the Lord as peace.
[time=1257] Good morning.
[time=1260] Please open your Bibles to Judges chapter 6.
[time=1266] This morning we're going to talk about the Gideon, and the next Sunday we're going to be for one more Sunday in the book of Judges, and Rich was going to preach on Samson.
[time=1276] I thought it would be better for him to preach on Samson because he looks like Samson.
[time=1282] It's going to be a good visual, except for the hair part, he doesn't have the long hair.
[time=1293] The making of a leader, page 117 in your Pew Bibles, if you don't have a Bible at home
[time=1300] or anywhere, feel free to take a Bible from the pews.
[time=1304] It's our gift to you.
[time=1306] But this morning we're going to look at Gideon, and we learn quickly that great leaders are
[time=1312] not made overnight.
[time=1315] Leaders actually are not born, they're made.
[time=1317] I think somebody already wrote a book about that.
[time=1319] I think it's called leaders are not born, they are made.
[time=1326] That being said, along with you, we need to recommit ourselves to pray for the pastor discovery team, and I promise that I continue to pray for you as a whole, and for the PDT
[time=1338] especially.
[time=1339] It's not an easy task because God has leaders out there, but again, as Matt said, we have
[time=1347] to, God has to reveal those to us.
[time=1349] So we need to continue to pray for that.
[time=1352] And for those of you who are in the practice of fasting, I encourage you to set aside one day for prayer and fasting specifically for this task that God will send you a pastor.
[time=1364] I know it's easier for us to criticize, to talk about the process, but it's harder to
[time=1371] fast and to pray, isn't it?
[time=1375] So if you really mean, and we say that we want a pastor, then we have to tap into the
[time=1381] power of prayer and fasting.
[time=1383] So set aside one day when you and your family can just skip breakfast or lunch or dinner.
[time=1390] The good Lord knows that all of us can skip a meal, huh?
[time=1394] Especially I.
[time=1396] And if you're in the same camp, not for medical reasons, but for spiritual reasons.
[time=1401] So all that to say is that keep praying and add to prayer fasting because the Bible speaks
[time=1407] about the prayer, the power of prayer and fasting together.
[time=1413] If you're reading the Bible carefully, all the great men and women of the Bible were men and women of prayer and fasting.
[time=1420] Not asking you to fast 40 days and 40 nights, but we can fast for one meal or two meals
[time=1427] or three meals.
[time=1429] Add fasting to your prayer and the Bible says there's power in prayer and fasting.
[time=1436] So let's look at the context of Gideon, how God raises Gideon to be a leader.
[time=1442] Remember the cycle of apostasy, the recycled misery, remember as Chuck Swindol calls it.
[time=1452] This cycle of apostasy repeats itself seven times in the book of Judges.
[time=1456] And here in today's text, again we see that Israel is added again and we start with Israel's
[time=1464] sin.
[time=1467] Judges chapter 6 verse 1, "The people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord."
[time=1475] And they did that before and they will do it again.
[time=1479] And in this case God sends the Medianites to oppress them starting in verse 2 of chapter
[time=1485] 6.
[time=1486] And the Lord gave them into the hand of Median seven years.
[time=1491] And the hand of Median overpowered Israel and because of Median the people of Israel made for themselves the dens there are in the mountains and the caves and the strongholds.
[time=1501] For whenever the Israelites planted crops the Medianites and the Amalekites and the people of the east would come up against them.
[time=1509] They would encamp against them and devour the produce of the land as far as Gaza and leave no substance in Israel and no sheep or ox or donkey.
[time=1519] Or they would come up with their livestock and their tents.
[time=1522] They would come like locusts in number.
[time=1525] Both they and their camels could not be counted so that they laid waste the land as they came
[time=1531] in.
[time=1532] And Israel was brought very low because of Median.
[time=1536] And what does Israel do in those cases, in those times?
[time=1540] The Bible says that Israel cries out to God.
[time=1543] This is no different, the second part of verse 6.
[time=1546] And the people of Israel cried out for help to the Lord.
[time=1550] And the Lord in His grace and mercy he always hears their prayer and sends or raises a deliverer.
[time=1557] Last time we saw how he raised up Deborah and now he raises up Gideon.
[time=1563] And that's what we have in chapter 6, 7, and 8.
[time=1569] And under Gideon's leadership, after the Medianites are destroyed, peace will reign for 40 years.
[time=1577] We call that successful leadership.
[time=1580] But this morning I want us to learn a few timeless principles from Gideon's story from
[time=1586] Judges 6, 7, and 8.
[time=1589] So these are some timeless principles that were through a thousand years before Jesus and they're true today.
[time=1596] First of all we need to learn that sometimes God uses tough times to get our attention.
[time=1602] This is a very important principle that we all need to learn.
[time=1606] Sometimes God uses tough times to get our attention.
[time=1610] In this case he sends the Medianites and Israel was brought very low because of Median.
[time=1618] Why does God do that?
[time=1620] The Bible says that God is our good, good Father, right?
[time=1625] Hebrews chapter 12, starting in verse 5 says this, "Have you forgotten the exhortation
[time=1632] that addresses you as sons?
[time=1635] My son do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor be we are you when reproved
[time=1642] by him, for the Lord disciplines the one he loves.
[time=1647] He chastises every son whom he receives.
[time=1651] It is for discipline that you have to endure.
[time=1654] God is treating you as sons.
[time=1656] For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?
[time=1660] If you are left without discipline in which all of her participated then you are illegitimate
[time=1667] children and not sons.
[time=1669] Besides this we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them.
[time=1675] Shall we not much more be subject to the father of spirits and live?
[time=1680] For they disciplined us for a short time as he seemed best to them but God disciplines us for our good that we may share in his holiness.
[time=1690] For the moment all disciplines seem painful rather than pleasant but later it yields the
[time=1696] peaceful fruit of righteousness who to those who have been trained by it.
[time=1702] My dear brothers and sisters are you going through some tough times?
[time=1707] Could it be that God is using that to get your attention?
[time=1712] It could be sometimes God is testing you like Job but sometimes we are suffering the penalty
[time=1718] of our own sin like the Israelites have done.
[time=1721] God is disciplining us because we have sinned.
[time=1724] Now sometimes you can't know the difference between is this discipline or is this God
[time=1730] punishing me, disciplining me for my sin or is he testing me, what is God doing?
[time=1734] Sometimes we can't say and I cannot answer that question for you and you cannot answer it for me.
[time=1741] You have to in front of God to ask yourself that question.
[time=1744] I'll give you an example on May 15, 2007 our house was hit by lighting and car on fire.
[time=1757] The whole second story had to be taken down and you went on and I scratched my head over
[time=1767] that for a long time.
[time=1770] What is God trying to tell me?
[time=1772] Is this a test?
[time=1774] Is God disciplining me for some sin in my life?
[time=1778] What is it?
[time=1779] And I had to before the Lord sit and ask myself that question but you couldn't have answered for me, I cannot answer that question for you.
[time=1786] But we have to stand before God when tough times come, what is God trying to do?
[time=1792] Is God trying to get our attention?
[time=1796] C.S. Lewis wrote, "God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks to us in our conscience,
[time=1803] but shouts in our pain.
[time=1805] It is his megaphone to rouse a deaf world." The first principle is that sometimes God uses tough times to get our attention.
[time=1814] The second principle we learn from the story of Gideon that as God sees more than we do.
[time=1821] That's a very important principle to understand God sees more than we do.
[time=1827] The angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon and said to him, "The Lord is with you, almighty
[time=1833] man of valor." Now what was Gideon doing at that time?
[time=1840] Was he working on his weapons, getting his swords ready to fight?
[time=1844] No.
[time=1845] Looking verses 7 to 10, "When the people of Israel carried out to the Lord on account of the Medianites, the Lord sent a prophet," by the way, this is an unnamed prophet at this point, "to the people of Israel," and he said to them, "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, I led you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of slavery, and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out before you and gave you their land.
[time=1871] And I said to you, "I am the Lord your God, you shall not fear the guides of the Amorites in whose land you dwell, but you have not obeyed my voice." And even though they have not obeyed God's voice, God in his grace and mercy raises up leaders to deliver them, in this case again, Gideon.
[time=1891] Now the Angel of the Lord came and sat under the turbanate of Ophra, which belonged to Joar the Abiyya's right, while his Gideon, what his son Gideon was beating out, beating
[time=1901] the winepress to hide it from the Medianites.
[time=1905] So Gideon is hiding from the Medianites, and yet the Angel of the Lord appears to him and calls him, "Almighty men of valor." Why is that?
[time=1915] Why does God see differently than we do?
[time=1919] This is a very important concept, God sees more than we do.
[time=1924] By the way, I was reading commentaries on this, and some commentators actually have the gods to call Gideon a coward.
[time=1935] God just called him a mighty man of valor, and we call him a coward.
[time=1938] How is that possible?
[time=1941] How are we so harsh with this man of God?
[time=1943] We're not so harsh with us, are we?
[time=1946] But others, apparently, we are so free to call him this, but that's not what's going on here.
[time=1953] Gideon uses what he has to the best of his abilities during that time.
[time=1958] And God honors that, Almighty man of valor.
[time=1964] We as humans might see a coward, a guy who's hiding, God sees a man of valor.
[time=1971] Could it be that God is looking at him?
[time=1975] Not just for who he is, but for who he was intended to be.
[time=1980] We look at people, sometimes on the outward appearance, as later we will learn in the
[time=1986] Book of Samuel.
[time=1988] But if you look carefully in the Bible, God uses strange characters, especially in the Book of Judges.
[time=1997] The idea is that God always sees more than we do.
[time=2002] God still uses strange characters today.
[time=2004] Amen?
[time=2005] If God can use you and I, he's still the same God that he was in the Book of Judges.
[time=2013] And sometimes God sees more than we do.
[time=2015] All you have to do is look around you.
[time=2017] Don't do it now.
[time=2019] Look in front of you, look behind you, look to your left and look to your right.
[time=2025] And you'll see that God uses strange characters, right?
[time=2030] Right Aaron?
[time=2034] My wife told me to stop picking on Darren, starting now, starting next Sunday maybe.
[time=2046] The first principle is that God uses tough times to get our attention.
[time=2049] The second principle is that God sees more than we do.
[time=2054] And God can use even you and I for the works of the gospel.
[time=2058] The third principle is that God blesses us with his presence and his peace.
[time=2064] We sang, "Jesus, your presence is heaven for me," right?
[time=2069] Oh, I love that song.
[time=2072] But if we belong to God, he blesses us with his presence and his peace.
[time=2078] Look starting in verse 13.
[time=2081] Gideon has some good questions for the angel of the Lord.
[time=2084] Gideon is said to him, "Please are starting in verse 13.
[time=2087] If the Lord is with us, why then has all these things happened to us?" Remember, it's a question we ask when we get into tough times.
[time=2095] And where are all these wonderful deeds that our fathers recounted to us saying, "Do not the Lord bring us up from Egypt?" But now the Lord has forsaken us as giving us into the land of Gideon.
[time=2105] And the Lord turned to him and said, "Go in the smite of yours and save Israel from
[time=2111] the hand of Gideon.
[time=2112] Do I not send you?
[time=2114] Do not I send you?" And he said to him, "Please, Lord, how can I save Israel?
[time=2119] Behold, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh and I am the least of my father's house.
[time=2125] My dear brothers and sisters, a leader will always be humble.
[time=2130] God uses humble leaders." See he doesn't say, "Lord, I'm glad you found where I lived.
[time=2137] I'm glad you finally saw that I'm the greatest and the best." No, he says, "My clan is the weakest in Manasseh and I am the least of my father's house."
[time=2149] And I would argue that God always uses humble vessels to put Sushayim, those who are considered
[time=2157] themselves strong.
[time=2160] What is important here is not Gideon, but the God who is with him and the God who gives
[time=2166] him peace.
[time=2168] And that's what God does.
[time=2170] Look in verse 16, "The Lord said to him, 'I will be with you and you shall strike the
[time=2176] mead in the night as one man.'"
[time=2182] Verse 22, "Then Gideon perceived that he was the angel of the Lord and Gideon said, 'Alas, O Lord God, for now I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face, but the Lord said to him, 'Peace me to you, do not fear, you shall not die.'" And Gideon built an altar there to the Lord and he called the Lord is peace.
[time=2201] Now you know this word, right?
[time=2202] The word shalom.
[time=2204] It's really the word that's still used in Israel today just to say, "Hi, and by shalom."
[time=2210] It's the word for peace.
[time=2212] The Lord is our shalom.
[time=2214] The Lord is our peace.
[time=2218] My dear brothers and sisters, God's presence and his peace go hand in hand.
[time=2224] If we understand God's presence with us and in us, then we will have peace and we are
[time=2231] going to be aware of his presence.
[time=2235] If you belong to the Lord, you have both his presence and you have to have his peace.
[time=2242] Those things go together.
[time=2244] If you don't have God's peace in your heart, could it be that you don't have his presence?
[time=2251] I'm just asking and I'm reminding you of what Jesus says in John 3.36, "Whoever believes
[time=2257] in the Son has eternal life, but whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but
[time=2263] the wrath of God abides on him." God blesses us with his presence and his peace and the fourth principle is God requires
[time=2274] private faithfulness as a prerequisite for public usefulness.
[time=2279] This is a very important principle.
[time=2280] It was true 3,000 years ago and it's true today.
[time=2285] Before God can use Gideon as a public servant, as a leader, he has to take care of the sin
[time=2293] in his own family.
[time=2296] Warren Wiersby writes, "It is one thing to meet God in the secrecy of a winepress, but
[time=2302] quite another thing to stand up for the Lord in public." He says, 6, starting in verse 25, "God says to Gideon, 'I'm going to be with you, and
[time=2313] I'll use you publicly, but first you need to take care of matters privately.'"
[time=2322] Idolatry creeped into the home of Gideon himself, looking verses 25 and on, "That night the
[time=2329] Lord said to him, 'Take your father's bull and the second bull seven years old and pull down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the ashirah that is beside it,
[time=2341] and build an altar to the Lord your God on top of the stronghold here with stones laid in due order, then take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering with the wood of the ashirah that you shall cut down." So Gideon took men, took 10 men of his servants, and did as the Lord told him, "But because
[time=2360] you are still afraid of his family and the men of the town to do it by day, he did it by night." Now, not everybody was happy with that.
[time=2369] Not everybody was happy when you'd kill sin.
[time=2372] Not everybody is happy when you deal with sin as you should, would take care of it.
[time=2379] Looking verse 28 and on, "When the men of the town arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the ashirah beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar that he had built.
[time=2390] And they said to one another, 'Who has done this thing?' And after they had searched and inquired, they said, 'Gidion, the son of Joash has done this thing.' Then the men of the town said to Joash, 'Bring out your son that he may die, for he has broken down the altar of Baal and cut down the ashirah beside it.
[time=2408] But Joash said to all who stood against him, 'Will you contend for Baal, or will you save him?
[time=2414] Whoever contends for him shall be put to death by morning.
[time=2417] If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because his altar has been broken down.
[time=2422] Therefore, on that day, Gideon was called Jerubah, that is to say, let Baal contend against him, because he broke down his altar.
[time=2433] Not everybody is happy when you deal with sin.
[time=2436] Actually the cry is this, 'Kill the messenger.' You've heard that before?
[time=2441] Yeah.
[time=2442] 'Kill the messenger.' Instead of us, repenting of our sin, we better kill the messenger.' You see, Gideon has to clean up his house first before he becomes the public leader.
[time=2455] This is by the way a New Testament concept as well.
[time=2461] When the Bible speaks about choosing leaders in your churches, in our churches, 1st Timothy 3, starting verse 1 through 7 says this, 'And listen to the concept of private versus public.'
[time=2475] The saying is trustworthy.
[time=2477] If anyone aspires to be at the office of overseers, overseer, he desires a noble task.
[time=2485] Therefore, an overseer, this is the Greek word for Episcopos, or where we have the word
[time=2492] "bishops" sometimes.
[time=2495] Whatever it is, it's a leader in the church.
[time=2497] Therefore, an overseer must be above reproach.
[time=2500] The husband of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach.
[time=2506] Not a drunker, not violent, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.
[time=2511] He must manage his own household well with dignity, keeping his children submissive,
[time=2517] for if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for God's church?
[time=2524] He must not be a recent convert, or he may become puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil.
[time=2531] Moreover, he must be well thought of by outsiders so that he may not fall into disgrace into
[time=2537] a snare of the devil.
[time=2538] Did you catch that?
[time=2540] Before God can use us for public usefulness, we need to be faithful in our private lives.
[time=2546] He must manage his own household well.
[time=2551] With all dignity, keeping his children submissive, for if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for God's church?
[time=2563] And then we have the very well-known story of Gideon, chapter 6, starting in verse 33.
[time=2569] Now, I know some of you grew up in church and you went to Sunday school and you learned about Gideon and the fleece, and that's the main story of Gideon, right?
[time=2580] It's actually here starting in verse 33.
[time=2586] Now all the Medianites and Amalekites and the people of Yist came together and they crossed the Jordan and camped in the Valley of Jezreel, but the Spirit of the Lord clothed Gideon and he resounded the trumpet.
[time=2597] And Abiyya's rights were called to follow him and he sent messengers to Arol Manasseh and they're all called out to follow him.
[time=2604] And he sent messengers to Asher's, they blew in enough tally and they went out to meet them.
[time=2609] And Gideon said to God, and this is the text, and you've probably heard a lot of sermons
[time=2615] on this.
[time=2617] Gideon said to God, "If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said, behold, I am laying a fleece of wool on the trashing floor.
[time=2624] If there's dew on the fleece alone and it is on all the ground is dried, then I shall know that you will save Israel by my hand as you have said." So basically, Gideon puts a test before the Lord and he was so.
[time=2638] And he rose early in the morning and squeezed the fleece he rung enough dew from the fleece to fill a bowl of water, bowl with water.
[time=2647] Then Gideon said to God, "Let not your anger burn against me, let me speak just once more.
[time=2652] Please let me test just once more with the fleece.
[time=2655] If you let it be dry, please let it be dry on the fleece only and all around the ground let it be dew." And God did so that night.
[time=2664] He was dry on the fleece only and on the ground there was dew.
[time=2669] First of all, my dear brothers and sisters, this text is descriptive, not prescriptive.
[time=2674] Descriptive, it tells us what happens.
[time=2677] It doesn't tell us that that's what you need to go home and do, because I know some
[time=2683] of you did that.
[time=2688] Dr. John Davis explains in his commentary and I quote, "It has been common for contemporary believers in a search for God's will to pull out the fleece."
[time=2698] That is, they set up a test by which God is obligated to respond, thus verifying some
[time=2704] aspect of God's will for their life.
[time=2708] While signs were required by an appropriate for the Jew, 1 Corinthians 1, 22, it is doubtful
[time=2714] that this is a legitimate practice for the church.
[time=2718] In other words, the text tells us what happened, it doesn't tell us that that's what you need to do, to go home and do that.
[time=2726] The lesson is not, Gideon blew his trumpet, you've got to blow yours.
[time=2732] By the way, I love playing the trumpet.
[time=2734] I love those who play the trumpet here, because I always wanted to learn and I was never good enough.
[time=2740] I love people playing the trumpet, but that's not the lesson that comes from here.
[time=2745] The fact that we worship God to all the instruments come from Psalm 150 that says that we've got to praise God with all types of instruments.
[time=2751] Also, the text doesn't tell us, Gideon squeezed his fleece and so you must squeeze yours.
[time=2759] That's not what it says.
[time=2762] What do we have that Gideon didn't have?
[time=2765] We have the whole council of God right here.
[time=2768] If you want to find God's will, find it here.
[time=2772] I was preaching one time in Romania and a guy came to me after church and he said, "I want to know the will of God." Well, what I fail to tell you is that he was drunk.
[time=2784] This was only about noon, but he was already drunk.
[time=2787] What I can tell you, you cannot find God's will in the bottle.
[time=2791] I can tell you that right now.
[time=2792] How do I know that?
[time=2793] I know it from here.
[time=2795] I bet that everything that you want to know about God's will for your life is right here.
[time=2800] Some people say, "Well, I want to know this about me." Well, are you saved?
[time=2804] The first requirement, the first will of God is for you to be saved.
[time=2807] If you are not saved, don't try to look anything else about God's will.
[time=2811] The first will of God for you is to be saved.
[time=2815] If you are not saved, stop looking for other answers.
[time=2818] You know, like we're to go to school, home to Mary or anything else like that.
[time=2822] No.
[time=2823] We have something very, very important.
[time=2824] We have the whole council of God.
[time=2826] You don't need to go out, put a fleece out, all you need to do is obey what God has already told you to do.
[time=2834] And if you want God to use it in a public manner, you have to be faithful in private.
[time=2841] God prepared Gideon for a public ministry, but he had to be faithful in his private life.
[time=2847] And then God gives the victory.
[time=2849] That's the fifth and final principle.
[time=2853] God provides victory through his power.
[time=2856] And we have another story that we know from the book of Judges, right?
[time=2860] Where God says, "Look, you have too many people in your army.
[time=2865] You have too many people.
[time=2867] We need to trim your army down, and they do so to 300."
[time=2873] And again, I'm sure you've heard sermons about, "Yeah, what this sermon is about is, what this is about is how you drink water.
[time=2881] It's those who kneel down or those who are lappers, and that's what this is about." That's not what it's about.
[time=2888] That's not what it's about.
[time=2890] What God wants to do here is to destroy their idol of self-sufficiency.
[time=2897] God wants to show them the victory will not be in your numbers.
[time=2900] I am giving the victory to you.
[time=2904] That's what God wants to get to them.
[time=2906] It's not about, you know, kneel down, you know, these guys are careful.
[time=2909] These are guys are...
[time=2910] Now, that's not what it's about.
[time=2913] The point of the text is not that the lappers were better than those who knelt.
[time=2918] God wants to destroy the idol of our self-sufficiency.
[time=2923] You have too many people.
[time=2925] Get 300.
[time=2926] By the way, the meeting, I'd say 135,000, 135,000 versus 300.
[time=2938] The victory is described in chapter 7, starting in verse 19, and I'll close with this.
[time=2946] So Gideon and the 300 men who were with him came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch when they had just set the watch, and they blew the trumpets and smashed
[time=2956] the jars that were in their hands, then the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the jars, and they held in their hands, their left hands, the torches, and in their right
[time=2966] hands the trumpets to blow, and they cried out a sword for the Lord and for Gideon.
[time=2971] Every man stood in his place around the camp, and all the army ran.
[time=2976] They cried out and fled.
[time=2979] When they blew the 300 trumpets, the Lord said every man sword against his comrade and against
[time=2985] all the enemy.
[time=2988] The victory was the Lord's.
[time=2992] This was not about Gideon's military strategy, because we know he didn't have any training.
[time=3000] Everything that happened here is that God did it.
[time=3004] God provides the victory.
[time=3007] So what can we learn for ourselves?
[time=3008] First of all, we need to humble ourselves before God.
[time=3013] Three very practical things to apply for today.
[time=3016] We have to humble ourselves before God, 1 Peter 5, 6.
[time=3022] Humble yourselves there for under the mighty hand of God, so that at the proper time he may exalt you.
[time=3029] How do you know if you're humble?
[time=3033] If there's one book I can recommend to anybody besides the Bible is the book Humility by Andrew Murray.
[time=3039] It's a classic word that I recommend to all my students, and I recommend it to you.
[time=3044] And in all the chapters he asks at the end of the chapter, are you clothed with humility?
[time=3050] Ask your daily life, ask Jesus, ask your friends, ask the world.
[time=3057] In your case, if you're married, ask your spouse, and then be prepared for the truth.
[time=3064] Do not ask people who just say, "Oh, how nice and how good of a person you are."
[time=3070] Ask people who know you, they can tell the truth in love.
[time=3074] It's one of the most humbling experience you can have, but we all need it.
[time=3079] We all need it.
[time=3081] Ask and begin praising God that there is opened up to you in Jesus, a heavenly humility of
[time=3089] which you have hardly known, and through which a heavenly blessedness you possibly have never yet tasted can come in to you.
[time=3097] Do you want God to use you?
[time=3100] We have to humble ourselves before him.
[time=3102] Second of all, be faithful in the little things as well in the big things.
[time=3108] Before Gideon was able to lead the 300 to victory God gave, he had to clearly stuff in
[time=3115] his own household.
[time=3117] He had to take care of private matters.
[time=3121] May we hear the words from our Lord, "Well done, good and faithful servant.
[time=3125] You have been faithful over a little.
[time=3128] I will set you over much," entering into the joy of your master.
[time=3132] We heard this morning, "Maybe you have obeyed God and you are obeying God, but you have
[time=3138] not obeyed him in the step of baptism." It says, "Those who are Mark 16, 16, those who believe and are baptized shall be saved.
[time=3149] Those who don't believe will not be saved." So did you believe and get baptized?
[time=3156] If not, you are living in disobedience.
[time=3159] Maybe you need to obey like you heard this morning.
[time=3163] Do you realize, some of them they realize they were living in disobedience and they wanted to fully obey God?
[time=3170] Be faithful in the little things, and God will use you in the big things.
[time=3174] And lastly, rely on God alone.
[time=3176] It is not the 300.
[time=3179] They gave the victory.
[time=3180] It is not even Gideon that gave the victory.
[time=3183] It is God who provided the victory.
[time=3186] Rely on God alone.
[time=3189] Allow God to shatter the idol of your self-sufficiency and trust God alone.
[time=3198] Cursed is the man who trusts in man Jeremiah writes, "Blessed is the man who trusts in
[time=3204] the Lord." We're saying, "Jesus, your presence is heaven to me." That means you have to first put your trust in him.
[time=3215] And again, I'm going to close with verse 36 from John 3.
[time=3220] "Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life.
[time=3227] Whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him."
[time=3233] And as they will close your eyes and bow your heads.
[time=3237] And as we prepare to sing the final song, if you want to surrender your life to Christ
[time=3243] today, you can do that in the privacy of your own place where you are right now.
[time=3249] If you want to come in front and pray, you can.
[time=3254] There will be people in the prayer room to pray with you.
[time=3257] I'll be back in the foyer if you want to come and talk to me.
[time=3261] Let's close in prayer.
[time=3262] Father, thank you.
[time=3265] For the way you use leaders, you use them and you still use them.
[time=3269] I pray that you will humble us.
[time=3272] I pray that you will shatter all our idols of self-sufficiency.
[time=3276] Forgive us for the many times when we trust it in our own power and help us to only rely on you.
[time=3283] I pray that many people will come to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[time=3287] Thank you for those who obeyed and baptized and got baptized today to show a whole world
[time=3293] what you have done in their hearts.
[time=3296] Teach us what it means to be faithful in the little things and in the big things, to be faithful at home and in public.
[time=3303] And may we be used by you for your glory to provide the victory.
[time=3307] Thank you for providing the ultimate victory to the personal work of Jesus Christ in whose name I pray.
[time=3313] [AMEN] Stay with us and sing "Great is Thy Faithfulness."
