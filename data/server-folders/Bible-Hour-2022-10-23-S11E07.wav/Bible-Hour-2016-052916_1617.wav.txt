[time=836] And crown to His love
[time=857] Praise the Lord Oh, my soul, praise His name
[time=882] Praise the Lord
[time=896] A long time afterward, when the Lord had given rest to Israel
[time=902] From all their surrounding enemies And Joshua was old and well advanced in years Joshua summoned all of Israel, its elders, its heads, its judges And officers, and said to them, I am now old And well advanced in years And you have seen all that the Lord your God has done to all these nations
[time=929] For your sake, for it is the Lord your God who has fought for you Behold, I have allotted to you as an inheritance for your tribes Those nations that remain Along with all the nations that I have already cut off from the Jordan To the great sea in the West The Lord your God will push them back before you and drive them out of your sight
[time=955] And you shall possess their land just as the Lord your God promised you
[time=961] Therefore be very strong to keep and do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses
[time=968] Turning aside from it neither to the right hand nor to the left
[time=974] That you may not mix with these nations remaining among you Or make mention of the names of their gods or swear by them or serve them or bow down to them
[time=984] But you shall cling to the Lord your God just as you have done to this day
[time=990] For the Lord has driven out before you great and strong nations
[time=996] And as for you, no man has been able to stand before you to this day
[time=1003] One man of you puts to fight a thousand since it is the Lord your God who fights for you
[time=1010] Just as he promised you Be very careful therefore to love the Lord your God Now therefore fear the Lord and serve him in sincerity and faithfulness Put away the gods that your father served beyond the river and in Egypt and serve the Lord
[time=1030] And if it is evil in your eyes to serve the Lord choose this day whom you will serve
[time=1036] Whether the gods for your father served in the region beyond the river Or the God of the Amorites in those lands you dwell As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord
[time=1052] Good morning, please open your Bibles to Joshua 23
[time=1058] If you don't have a Bible there are Bibles in your pews and it's page 113 in the pew Bible
[time=1064] If you don't have a Bible at home you feel free to take one from the pew
[time=1070] It is our gift to you As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord That's probably one of the better known verses in scripture You can probably find that in your local Christian store in calligraphy, right?
[time=1084] You can put it above your fireplace Some of you probably have done that and that's a great idea
[time=1093] Those words in context are the words of a leader to the people he has led for many many years
[time=1102] The Bible describes good leaders and bad leaders If you look in church history there have been good leaders and there have been bad leaders
[time=1113] If you look in history period there have been good leaders and there have been bad leaders
[time=1120] Who said, for example, I'm going to give you a lesson from history or remind you of a lesson in history
[time=1126] Who said, after me, the flood?
[time=1132] Oh, I thought everybody knew European history, sorry Napoleon, Napoleon is great known as the great leader of France
[time=1143] Well, he was not such a good leader Besides the fact that he lost a lot of words To say, after me, the flood, that's the sign of a weak leader Meaning, I don't care what happens after I am gone Joshua is not like that Joshua cares about the people he leads And he wants to make sure that they know where they have been Where they are going and where they are presently He doesn't say, after me, the flood He actually gives them instruction what they are to do after his death
[time=1184] By the way, Joshua was about 20 years old when he leaves Egypt
[time=1190] He's about 60 years old when he enters the promised land He will die at 110 years old, so he will live in the promised land for about 50 years
[time=1203] So here in this text is about, again we can guesstimate About 100 to 110 years old He's seen many things and he is experienced What God has done, and like any good leader Joshua teaches the people or reminds the people about the past
[time=1226] The past, and in the past God has fought for Israel
[time=1232] Look at the first three verses in chapter 23 A long time afterward A long time, what does that mean?
[time=1240] Well, it took them about 40 years for them to conquer the whole land
[time=1247] There were military campaigns in the center of Israel You've heard about their defeat at I last week Some battles they win, some they lose, and they lose some of them because of their disobedience But they have to fight in the center of Israel They fight in the northern campaign and they fight in the southern campaign And it takes about 40 years And after, that's why the Bible says here a long time afterward When the Lord had given rest to Israel from all their surrounding enemies And Joshua was old and well advanced in years Joshua summoned all Israel, it's elders and heads So the focus here is on the leaders And it's judges and officers And said to them, I am now old and well advanced in years And you have seen all that the Lord your God has done to all these nations for your sake For it is the Lord your God who has fought for you One of the worst things we can do is to look back and say, I have done that I built that I did that, it was the power of my hands that did that It was my wisdom that has done that And Joshua reminds the people that if anything good has happened in our lives It's because God has fought for us We need to establish that from the beginning And Joshua reminds them that actually Israel means God fights Remember when God changed Jacob's name from Jacob to Israel?
[time=1337] Jacob, remember, meant the one who grabs the heel?
[time=1341] And God says, no, I'm going to change your name back in Genesis 32 You are now the God who fights, God who fights And whatever is going to happen in their history They will be reminded, even their name reminds them that God fights Isn't that true for Israel today?
[time=1358] Look at the map of the Middle East And you'll see how Israel is surrounded by all their enemies How is it possible that they not only survive, but they thrive?
[time=1369] Because God fights for them It's in their name And Joshua reminds them that it was God who fought for them in the past
[time=1380] In the book of Deuteronomy, Moses gives the new generation rules for warfare
[time=1386] How are they to fight? This is their Geneva Convention, apparently And intertwined through the rules, we hear God's promises in Deuteronomy 20
[time=1398] When you go out to war against your enemies and see horses and chariots And an army larger than your own, you shall not be afraid of them For the Lord your God is with you who brought you up out of the land of Egypt
[time=1414] And when you draw near to the battle, the priests shall come forward and speak to the people
[time=1420] And shall say to them, "Hero Israel, today you are drawing near for battle against your enemies
[time=1426] Let not your heart faint Do not fear or panic or be in dream of them, for the Lord your God is he who goes with you
[time=1436] To fight for you against your enemies to give you the victory
[time=1442] Did you catch the promises? These are not just rules for warfare But intertwined are promises, the promises of God that God is with you, verse 1 The Lord your God is with you Notice it's not nothing about military strategy There's nothing here about how they should scale walls or anything like that No, just remember the promises of God that the Lord is with you, verse 4 The Lord your God is he who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you the victory
[time=1476] And because God has been with you in the past, the future is bright God will provide for Israel, verse 5 The Lord your God will push them back before you and drive them out of your sight And you shall possess their land just as the Lord your God promised you
[time=1496] Why should I trust God for the future?
[time=1500] Because I know what he's done for me in the past I am not asked to trust in a God that has not acted in the past God has acted in the past, that's why he can trust him in the future The Lord will God will push them back before you and drive them out of your sight And you shall possess their land just as the Lord your God has promised you
[time=1524] Things change Leaders move on It may snow in April But God's word stays the same And you shall possess their land just as the Lord God has promised you My dear brothers and sisters, we need to rely on God's promises I'm reminded of the great old hymn standing on the promises of Christ my King
[time=1556] Through eternal ages ladies, praises ring glory in the highest I will shout and sing standing on the promises of God Someone wise once challenged our students
[time=1571] Are we standing on the promises or are we just sitting on the premises?
[time=1578] This is a challenge for all of us this morning Are we standing on the promises or are we just sitting on the premises?
[time=1586] Let us examine ourselves this morning if really we are standing on the promises And we believe that the God who has acted in the past, he will be with us in the future What are we to do in the present? Well, Joshua addressed that God is to be obeyed in the present Therefore, verse 6, therefore be very strong to keep And to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses Turning aside from it neither to the right nor to the left My dear brothers and sisters, God's sovereignty does not nullify personal responsibility
[time=1625] It's clearly outlined throughout the Bible God is sovereign, he acts, he fights for us, he is with us, but that does not nullify my personal responsibility to obey him
[time=1638] God will do his part but we have to be strong and to keep all that is written in the book of the law of Moses
[time=1648] Dr. Davis in his book Conquest and Crisis writes The principles for godly activity were not to be found in the land of Canaan
[time=1658] But were clearly revealed in the book of the law of Moses So our responsibility after we know what God's promises are And what the word says, our responsibility is to obey God's word That's our responsibility In a culture that mocks God's word, we are called to obey God's word
[time=1680] I don't have to tell you that our society continues to rebel against God and his word
[time=1686] And continues to rebel against God and his word by redefining many things They redefine what sin is They redefine what family is They redefine what marriage is and more recently they have redefined what a man or a woman is
[time=1703] Do I have to tell you that or do you just have to watch the news?
[time=1709] Bruce Jenner has become Caitlin Not only that, there's a TV show about that right now
[time=1720] How did we go from here to here?
[time=1724] We went from there to here by mocking God's word and by turning our back against God
[time=1733] And God is calling us to be strong and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses
[time=1743] I say Tiberius, I tell you a little bit more open-minded than that
[time=1751] Well, here's what I found I found that the most intolerant people are the so-called open-minded people
[time=1759] The so-called open-minded people who call everyone to be tolerant of their deviant views
[time=1766] And these open-minded people are not so open-minded when it comes to the Bible
[time=1772] Right? That's what it is They're tolerant about everything else except your Christian views And that's very intolerant by the way So when we come to that, we have to ask who are we going to obey?
[time=1788] Are we going to obey man or are we going to obey God?
[time=1792] And in the present Joshua tells the people you are to obey God
[time=1798] God is to be obeyed, very specifically looking in verse 7
[time=1804] That you may not mix with these nations remaining among you
[time=1812] Or make mention of the names of their gods or swear by them or serve them or bow down to them
[time=1819] The people are told they got in to do and they're asked to do a thing that's not very popular Not to intermix with pagan nations
[time=1830] Obedience, my dear brothers and sisters, means living holy lives by not intermering with pagan nations
[time=1837] You may not mix with these nations Paul later will call this "Do not be unequally yoked" In 2 Corinthians chapter 6, Paul addresses this
[time=1851] Starting in verse 14 Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness?
[time=1861] Or what fellowship has light with darkness?
[time=1864] What a court has Christ would be all?
[time=1866] Or what portion does a believer share with an unbeliever?
[time=1871] What agreement has the temple of God with idols?
[time=1874] For we are the temple of the living God as God said
[time=1882] My dear brothers and sisters, separation from the world Means clinging to God, that's all we have in the next verse
[time=1893] It says that you may not mix with these nations remaining among you Or make mention of their names of their gods or swear by them Or serve them or bow down to them, verse 8 But you shall cling to the Lord your God just as you have done to this day Not mixing with pagans means clinging to God If we cling to God closely, we will not intermarry We will not mix with pagan nations That was Joshua's word to the people Not only that, but in the present we are to not just obey God, but we are to love God
[time=1930] Be careful therefore to love the Lord your God You see God always wanted a relationship with us And this relationship is to be based on love It's very interesting though the words be very careful Therefore to love the Lord your God Meaning loving God means taking time to think about how we're loving God
[time=1960] Everything boils down to our love for God Our obedience needs to be rooted in love We obey God because we love Him And we love Him because He loved us first He loved us, He loved us, He loved us As a result we are asked to obey Him and to love Him God has told us about His love for us Jeremiah 31-3, "I have loved you with an everlasting love"
[time=1996] Malachi 1-2, "I have loved Him"
[time=2002] And as a result we are asked to love God in return I'm reminded about the good old hymn There is a name I love to hear I love to sing its worth It sounds like music in my ear, the sweetest name on earth We already sang about Him this morning Oh, how I love Jesus Everything revolves around Jesus Is Jesus your Lord and Savior or is He not?
[time=2031] Are you clinging to pagans or are you clinging to Jesus?
[time=2035] Are we depending on people for what we believe Or are we depending on God's Word and Jesus is introduced as the Word of God?
[time=2045] In the beginning was the Word You can say I love Jesus but I hear His Word You can say I love Jesus but I'm not going to do what He says No, no, no, no, in the beginning was the Word And the Word was with God and the Word was God You cannot separate those two Love God, to love God means to love His Word And to love His Word means to do it and to obey it When Jesus is asked about the greatest commandment In Matthew chapter 22 This is what this is how He responds Matthew 22 starting in verse 36 Teacher, this is the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[time=2091] One of the lawyer, verse 35, one of the lawyer Asked Him a question to test Him Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?
[time=2100] And He said to Him I love the Lord your God with all your heart With all your soul and with all your mind This is the great and first commandment And a second is like it You shall love your neighbor as yourself On these two commandments Depend all the law and the prophets Loving God and loving people And after Joshua addresses the leaders Now he addresses the entire congregation Now we're moving to Joshua chapter 24 Joshua 24 starting in verse 3 And here's I want us to see the past Again, Joshua goes back to his main points The past And notice please hear the verbs that describe God's actions And His goodness for His people Now here on the slide I just kind of gave you some of those verbs But as we read starting in verse 3 I want you to pay close attention to all the verbs that describe God
[time=2171] Joshua 24 starting in verse 3 Seen in Joshua 24 starting in verse 2 As Joshua said to all the people Now there's a shift from the leaders to the people Thus I'll start in verse 2 Thus says the Lord the God of Israel Long ago your fathers lived beyond the Euphrates Tara the father of Abraham and of Nahor And they served other gods Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the river And led him through all the land of Canaan And made his offspring many I gave him Isaac And to Isaac I gave Jacob an Esau And I gave Esau the hill country of Seir to possess But Jacob and his children went down to Egypt And I sent Moses and Aaron And I plagued Egypt to what I did in the midst of it And afterward I brought you out Then I brought your fathers out of Egypt And you came to the sea And the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen To the Red Sea And when they cried to the Lord He put darkness between you and the Egyptians And made the sea calm upon them And covered them and your eyes Saw what I did in Egypt And you lived in the wilderness a long time Again notice the verbs I did this, God is speaking here in the first person I took, I gave, I sent, I brought out I gave, I destroyed I gave, these are the last words of Joshua To the people of Israel God proves his love Not through just words but through actions The Bible is a book about God What about in the present?
[time=2279] Joshua is about to die, he tells the people That this present time is the time to decide Looking verse 14 Now therefore fear the Lord and serve him In sincerity and faithfulness Put away the gods that your fathers served beyond the river in Egypt And serve the Lord My dear brothers and sisters A good leader not only reminds the people about their past And about their future But a good leader challenges the people to live a certain way in the present And notice please, Joshua doesn't say You know, if you want to worship God You know, on Sundays or on weekends And then on Monday through Friday You can worship the other gods, that's okay with them He doesn't say that He doesn't say that He says fear the Lord and serve him in sincerity And in faithfulness And if you need to repent And do away with your false gods Put away the gods that your fathers served beyond the river And in Egypt and served Yahweh Today, what Joshua says is decision time Decision time God did his part Now you have to decide and do away with all the false idols in your life
[time=2362] And do what?
[time=2363] Serve the Lord We saw an example this morning Beautiful example Of how a family serves the Lord By taking in people they need help You see here every Sunday morning, right?
[time=2377] An example of serving of people who lead us in worship through music Darren, can I come to the choir thing on Wednesday night?
[time=2387] Do you accept me in the choir?
[time=2389] Yes Okay, then everybody can come If he accepts me, everybody is acceptable before Darren
[time=2399] To sing instrumentalists Can I play the cowbell?
[time=2406] See, there's a limit to his love for us
[time=2416] And we do More cowbell Don't you think in heaven there will be cowbell?
[time=2431] He didn't study at Grace College, obviously To serve, look at the end of verse 14, this is very important, and serve the Lord That verb occurs 15 times in this section Again, a challenge for us, my dear and brothers and sisters How are we serving the Lord today?
[time=2452] And again, it's not just serving here on Sunday morning, that's part of it How are we serving the Lord every day of our lives?
[time=2460] Serving the Lord is not a weekend activity And actually, I would suggest in my humble but correct opinion The Wednesday night practice is more important than the Sunday morning performance
[time=2475] The Wednesday night practice is more important than the Sunday morning performance
[time=2483] You might disagree with me, but you're wrong
[time=2491] And then, of course, verse 15 Verse 15, the most famous one of all And if it is evil in your eyes to serve the Lord, choose this day Whom you will serve, whether the gods of the Father served in the region beyond the river Or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord For my Spanish-speaking friends, pero y, pero yo, amicasa
[time=2520] Cerviremos al Senor Muchas gracias I took half a semester of Spanish I got an F-O Alright Joshua's message is clear, you cannot serve false gods and serve Yahweh, the true God
[time=2546] There's only one to be worshiped, Jesus would say like this later in Matthew 624 No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other Or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other He cannot serve God and money G.I. Packer challenges us, what other gods could we have beside the Lord?
[time=2569] Plenty For Israel, there were the Canaanite bales, those jolly nature gods whose worship was a ramping of gluttony, drunkenness and ritual prostitution
[time=2579] For us, there are still the great gods of sex, shekels and stomach Unholy Trinity constituting one God, self And the other enslaving Thrio pleasure possessions and position whose worship is described as the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes
[time=2597] And the pride of life in 1 John 2 16 Football, the firm and the family are also gods for some Indeed, the list of other gods is endless, for anything that anyone allows to run his life becomes his God
[time=2612] And the claimants for this prerogative are legion In the matter of life's basic loyalty, temptation is a many-headed monster
[time=2622] But for me and my house, we will serve the Lord I don't know if we have this written somewhere in our houses, but I pray that that will be the reality of our lives
[time=2634] And here again, I got to start talking to the men and the parents And as I close the last 8 minutes and 48 seconds, I want us to talk about how to serve the Lord with our family in a very practical manner
[time=2649] First of all, we have to get rid of idols together First, all of us need to identify if there are any false idols in our lives that we need to get rid of
[time=2662] Team Keller, again, challenges us What is an idol?
[time=2670] He says, "It is anything more important to you than God Anything that absorbs your heart and imagination more than God Anything you seek to give you what only God can give A counterfeit God is anything so central and essential to your life that should you lose it Your life will feel hardly worth living An idol has such a controlling position in your heart that you can spend most of your passion and energy
[time=2696] Your emotional and financial resources on it without a second thought
[time=2702] It can be family and children or career-making money or achievement and critical acclaim It can be a romantic relationship, your beauty or brains or even success in the Christian ministry
[time=2713] What you are meaning in life is to fix someone else's life We call it co-dependency, but it is really idolatry
[time=2724] Identify the idols in your life And then as a family, sit down together and tell your children we need to get rid of these idols
[time=2734] You cannot expect your children to get rid of their idols and you keep on to yours
[time=2740] That doesn't work Children are smarter than that Serve the Lord with your family by praying together There is a focus here today on prayer You need to pray with them and you need to pray for them If your children are small I would encourage you to start teaching them to kneel by the bed and pray Teach them the kneeling position of prayer as early as they can kneel down
[time=2773] And I can tell you if you teach them early on they will never forget it
[time=2779] I learned mine when every summer my parents would send us to the village in southwestern part of Romania
[time=2787] To build my grandparents and every evening no exception
[time=2793] After dinner we would have to sit by the radio and listen to Radio Free Europe and listen to a sermon
[time=2800] That was given by a pastor in the west but we would get it through shortwave radio in Romania
[time=2809] And after each sermon my grandfather would have us kneel by the bed and pray
[time=2816] I learned the power of prayer not in a seminary not even a church
[time=2824] But on an uneven floor in a small village in Romania
[time=2831] And I'll never forget that You've got to teach your children how to pray when they're young So if you have small children this is the time to start if you haven't started already
[time=2843] Not only do you have to start to pray with them you've got to pray for them Storm your martian in her book the power of a praying parents writes this I didn't have peace when my first son Christopher was born because I would worry about everything
[time=2857] I was afraid that someone could drop him that he would drown in the tub that he would get an incurable disease
[time=2864] That he would be kidnapped or that he would get or that a dog would bite him
[time=2871] That he would have a car accident that would be kidnapped or that he would get lost Out of desperation more than out of obedience I cried out to God Immediately he reminded me that Christopher is a gift from him and that he cares more about him than I do
[time=2887] I remember the biblical teaching that tells us to give him our worries Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you And that's what I did, I gave him to the Lord Recently I had to do it again when he left for college And I have a feeling that even after that you still need to pray for your kids, right?
[time=2916] Read the vitals together, pray together, read the words together
[time=2923] Is the Bible at home in your home?
[time=2929] Read the Bible to them when they're little again I'm focusing on those of you who have little kids Because this is a good way to start, read to them And when they're little use pictures, use pictures Even if they portray Jesus as blonde and blue-eyed You can explain to them later how wrong that is, but at the beginning it's okay
[time=2952] Please they know about Jesus Quality time, sometimes when I drive with Tim Nicholas in a car Sometimes we listen to the Bible app, you can actually put the Bible app to read the scripture for you So use today's technology for your benefit
[time=2973] I have nothing against technology or iPhones, apps, they're great
[time=2981] You can use this, or you can use the app as long as you feed them the Word of God
[time=2987] You've got to speak truth in your kids' lives Even if they might not get the whole thing, they might give birth to questions
[time=2999] And lastly, go through life together One of the hardest things for me is to let my children learn from my mistakes
[time=3009] But we have to let our children learn from our successes And as we go through life together, we need to let them learn from our failures as well
[time=3020] Don't put yourself and tell them you never did anything wrong Because they cannot identify with you then But if you realize that, hey, they realize you're human and you make mistakes
[time=3033] Then they can say, oh, there is hope for me And as you've seen again, the example today, do ministry together Go on mission trips together When you go to witness to someone, do it together, and they will see what you do And ministry and life will be caught more than taught
[time=3055] There are many things we can do When we say, as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord
[time=3065] And if children ask questions, and you don't know the answers Like I do, you just say, I don't know
[time=3076] You need to learn to say these beautiful words There's three words, six words you need to know I love you, and I don't know
[time=3096] Get your idols together, pray together, either work together and go through life together
[time=3103] Joshua said to the children of Israel, it's decision time And it's decision for us, decision time for us today, this morning at Black Hawk Jesus Christ, it's not your Lord and Savior, this morning I invite you to accept them as your Lord and Savior
[time=3119] As we sing this morning, if you want to come down and pray here, we'll have elders who will pray with you If you have not been the leader in your home that you needed to be, maybe you need to come and repent and confess
[time=3133] And maybe you need to go back home and confess and repent and just confess to your children
[time=3139] Whatever it is, God has been good to us
[time=3146] He fought for us, He was with us, He will be forever with us But today is decision time, we need to make some decisions Either we will go on worshiping false gods, or we will worship God alone
[time=3162] I pray that this will be a church that can safely say every day, as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord
[time=3170] Let's pray Dear Father, I thank You For Your word, that reminds us about Your faithfulness in the past It reminds us about Your goodness in the future And I pray that today, as decision time is today, that we will decide to worship You
[time=3188] As for us and our houses, we will serve the Lord Pray they will teach us what that means I pray if there needs to be repentance, there will be repentance Thank You that You will allow Your turns, and I thank You that You allow us to come back and to serve You
[time=3207] Teach us what it means to serve, not just today but every day And I pray that this church will have strong individuals, strong families
[time=3217] They will make the society stronger, and it will turn back to You In Christ's name I pray, amen
[time=3234] Stand with us and sing, I have decided to follow Jesus I have decided to follow Jesus
[time=3244] I have decided to follow Jesus
[time=3256] No turning back No turning back Don't don't go with me, still I will follow
[time=3267] Don't don't go with me, still I will follow
[time=3273] Don't don't go with me, still I will follow No turning back No turning back When you leave me, I will follow Where you leave me, I will go Where you leave me, I will follow Jesus take me down that road Where you leave me, I will follow Where you leave me, I will go Where you leave me, I will follow Anywhere I will go Yes, I will go And I have decided to follow Jesus
[time=3317] I have decided to follow Jesus I have decided to follow Jesus
[time=3328] No turning back No turning back Don't go behind me The cross before me The world behind me The cross before me The world behind me The cross before me No turning back No turning back When you leave me, I will follow Where you leave me, I will go Where you leave me, I will follow Take me down that road Where you leave me, I will follow Where you leave me, I will go Where you leave me, I will follow Anywhere I will go Yes, I will go
[time=3396] Even if I walk alone Lord, this I choose to do
[time=3406] I will not look back I'll follow no one else but you
[time=3417] Even if I walk alone
[time=3423] Lord, this I choose to do
[time=3429] I will not look back I'll follow no one else 'Cause it may sit and feel like we're all by ourselves Even if I walk alone Lord, this I choose to do
