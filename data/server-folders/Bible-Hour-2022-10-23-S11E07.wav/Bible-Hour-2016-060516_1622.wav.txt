[time=705] You lift up your heads on ye days.
[time=1140] Feel free to take one home with you.
[time=1145] I don't know about you, but I love, love stories.
[time=1150] Especially the ones that go from tragedy to triumph.
[time=1155] Last weekend, I was in California.
[time=1157] My parents celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary.
[time=1162] Yesterday, my dad turned 80, so we kind of celebrated both.
[time=1167] It's always nice to celebrate great love stories.
[time=1171] Growing up, you probably like me, read fairy tales or saw.
[time=1177] Love stories like Snow White and the Prince.
[time=1181] It's a great love story.
[time=1184] Cinderella and Prince, charming.
[time=1188] Jasmine and Aladdin.
[time=1193] Sarah and Darren.
[time=1196] Also known as Beauty and the Beast.
[time=1209] I always have the last story, you know.
[time=1215] Now, the greatest love story ever told is the story of God loving us.
[time=1221] The greatest love story is when God sent his son Jesus Christ to redeem us and to make us his bride.
[time=1229] That's the greatest love story ever told.
[time=1232] But this story today reminds us of that greater love story.
[time=1237] So we have to look at it this morning in the book of Ruth.
[time=1243] Ruth and Esther are the only two Bible books that are named for women.
[time=1249] And what's interesting is that Ruth is a pagan who marries an Israelite.
[time=1257] And Esther is an Israelite that marries a pagan.
[time=1262] Both books in the Bible named for women Ruth and Esther have something very interesting in common.
[time=1271] They're both, in a sense, love stories.
[time=1275] But the main point of this book when we look about what it teaches us about God is that God takes care of the poor and the needy.
[time=1287] We many times overlook that when we read this great love story.
[time=1293] But when we look at what the book teaches us about God is that God always takes care of the poor, the weary, the widow and the needy.
[time=1304] In this short but beautiful story we see God accomplishing his purposes by using unlikely people.
[time=1316] The first thing we see is that we go from famine to funeral. The chapter one verse one starts like this.
[time=1324] In the days when the judges ruled there was a famine in the land and a man of Bethlehem in Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons.
[time=1338] But unfortunately what he does is not actually doesn't turn out as he plans because we read verses three to five.
[time=1350] But Elimelech, the husband of Naomi died and she was left with her two sons.
[time=1355] These took Moabite wives, the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth.
[time=1361] And they lived there about ten years and both Mahlon and Killian died so that the woman was left without her two sons and her husband.
[time=1371] The book opens with tragedy, famine that makes Elimelech move and go to another country.
[time=1383] Now the Bible doesn't say here but some scholars speculate that this was not a good thing because they go from the promised land to a pagan land.
[time=1397] Now I'm not ready to make that judgement because the Bible is silent about that.
[time=1401] So if the Bible doesn't say it let's not speculate about it, it's improper.
[time=1408] Now what we do know is that these sons marry Moabite women.
[time=1416] Was that wrong?
[time=1418] According to the law that was wrong because they were not supposed to marry pagan women.
[time=1425] They basically go against the law of God.
[time=1429] But what the Bible doesn't say is why the sons die.
[time=1434] We are not told that Elimelech the father that he dies because of disobedience and we are not told that these two sons die because they marry Moabite women.
[time=1443] I say that because some commentators go there and they say God judge these men and punish them with death because they married pagan women.
[time=1452] The Bible doesn't say that.
[time=1454] So for us to speculate is improper.
[time=1457] I like how one scholar puts it and this is really good and I quote.
[time=1460] We should respect the silence of the narrator.
[time=1466] What we do know is for sure what?
[time=1469] That this man dies and the two sons die.
[time=1473] That's how we know.
[time=1475] The Bible doesn't say why they do that.
[time=1477] But the story starts with tragedy.
[time=1479] They go from famine instead of going from famine to plenty.
[time=1482] They go actually from famine not to one, not to two, but to three funerals.
[time=1488] And that in a period of ten years.
[time=1491] Think about that.
[time=1494] But we see the story of tragedy to triumph begins to unfold starting in verse 16.
[time=1506] We see here going from broken to being blessed.
[time=1511] Naomi has now two dollars in law.
[time=1517] And for their sake she says go back to your mothers.
[time=1523] Go back to your families.
[time=1527] But they say no.
[time=1529] We will return with you.
[time=1533] Naomi is able to persuade Orpa but she cannot persuade Ruth.
[time=1539] And she makes these statements that are memorable and some of you have used them in your weddings.
[time=1546] Out of context.
[time=1549] Right?
[time=1550] Because they're beautiful words.
[time=1552] But these are our context.
[time=1554] This is actually from a daughter-in-law to a mother-in-law.
[time=1559] It's not from a wife to a husband.
[time=1563] Do not urge me to leave you or to return from following you where you go, I will go.
[time=1571] Where you lodge, I will lodge and the most important thing is in the last part.
[time=1576] Your people should be my people and your God, my God.
[time=1581] Ruth sees something in Naomi that she wants.
[time=1587] Bringing us to a very important applicable point, what do our children see in us?
[time=1594] What kind of legacy are we leaving for our children?
[time=1598] Do our children look at us and say I want a faith like my parents?
[time=1603] I want a marriage like my parents.
[time=1606] Or do they say when I'm out of the house I'm done?
[time=1610] What kind of legacy are we leaving because Naomi leaves the legacy so great the Ruth is able to change her zip code.
[time=1620] Ruth is willing to change her nationality.
[time=1623] Ruth is willing to change her religion.
[time=1627] She basically gets converted to worship God, the God of Israel.
[time=1633] That's the contemporary language.
[time=1635] Ruth gets converted to faith in Yahweh.
[time=1639] Your God will be my God.
[time=1643] So we see the beginning of going from broken to blessed.
[time=1646] She is a widow and not only that, she is childless.
[time=1653] How long was she married?
[time=1655] What does the text say?
[time=1657] Ten years.
[time=1658] To go ten years without children is very clear back then that she was barren.
[time=1664] We'll see that later that it's actually becoming even more clear.
[time=1668] But she is a broken person.
[time=1670] She is a widow.
[time=1672] She is childless.
[time=1674] But now she becomes part of the family of God.
[time=1679] And that continues in chapter two.
[time=1681] She goes from broken to blessed.
[time=1685] They make the trip back from Moab which is east of the Jordan River.
[time=1693] They go back to the promised land.
[time=1698] And the book of Ruth again teaches us that God takes care of the poor and the needy.
[time=1703] And we see that right at the beginning of chapters two, looking in verse one through three.
[time=1709] Ruth Naomi had a relative of her husband, a worthy man of the clan of Elima like whose name was Boaz.
[time=1717] And Ruth, the Moab, said to Naomi, "Let me go to the field and glean among the years of grain after him and whose sight I shall find favor."
[time=1725] And she said to her, "Go, my daughter." So she sent out and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers.
[time=1732] And she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the clan of Elima like.
[time=1739] My dear brothers and sisters, we learn that God is at work in the corners of the field.
[time=1746] Sometimes we want God to work in the limelight.
[time=1750] But I want us to see how God sometimes works in the corners of our field.
[time=1756] By the way, I have a picture here of a wheat field here.
[time=1761] And the reason that's there is because to understand what the law said.
[time=1765] You see, God in the law always made provision for the poor and the needy and for the widow.
[time=1771] So if you had a field like this, God would say, "You shall harvest it, but you shall leave a corner of your land unharvested."
[time=1783] Why? So the poor and the needy and the widow can go and glean there.
[time=1789] Now let me ask you, what percentage of the field was supposed to be left unharvested?
[time=1796] Does anybody know?
[time=1798] Good, because the Bible never specifies.
[time=1802] You can be as generous as you want.
[time=1806] You can leave that corner of the field as big as you want.
[time=1810] How generous can you be? And we ask what? How little can I give?
[time=1815] How little of the corner can I cut?
[time=1818] But the question is this, how generous can I be with the poor and the needy and the widow?
[time=1824] Again, very applicable this morning. My dear brothers and sisters, let us ask.
[time=1828] Last time we cut the check after we got paid, what percentage of my income went to the poor and the needy and the widow?
[time=1840] Don't answer out loud.
[time=1842] Go home, take a piece of paper and ask yourself how generous was I?
[time=1850] First ask, how generous was God with me?
[time=1854] And then ask yourself, how generous can I be with the poor and the needy?
[time=1859] Because God in this book always cares for the poor and the needy.
[time=1865] God is a work in the corners of the land and Ruth is not lazy.
[time=1870] God does not bless laziness. Rather, Ruth is industrious.
[time=1875] She's determined. She takes the initiative. See, she's not sitting around and Naomi says, "Hey, go and do something." No. Ruth takes the initiative and she says,
[time=1887] "Let me go to the field and clean." And here we're introduced to Boaz, starting in verse 4.
[time=1894] "And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem and he said to the reapers, "The Lord be with you and they answered. The Lord bless you." And Boaz said to his young man who was in charge of the reapers, "Whose young woman is this?" And the servant who was in charge of the reapers answered, "She's the young Mo by two woman who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab." She said, "Please, let me clean and gather among the sheaves after the reapers." So she came and she has continued from early morning until now, except for a short rest. Then Boaz said to Ruth, verse 8.
[time=1929] "Now listen, my daughter." Those words are important.
[time=1932] That's why I emphasize them here on the slide.
[time=1935] "Do not go green in another's field or leave this one, but keep close to my young women."
[time=1944] The words "my daughter" suggest two things. Boaz is older.
[time=1950] And we know that from later in the narrative, when he will say to her, "You could have married someone younger." And now he calls her "my daughter."
[time=1961] So it looks like Boaz is older, we learn that, and we learn that he is kind.
[time=1967] He treats her like a daughter with kindness.
[time=1975] Another application for us, my dear brothers and sisters, when we show to whom can we show kindness?
[time=1983] Again, as we look in our lives, as we understand how God has been good and kind to us,
[time=1989] how do we show that kindness to others?
[time=1993] Think about last week.
[time=1996] Have you been kind to someone who needed kindness?
[time=1999] To whom did you show the loving kindness of the Lord?
[time=2004] Because sometimes we are like the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea only takes water, but never gives it to anybody. That's the Dead Sea.
[time=2014] God doesn't want us to be like the Dead Sea.
[time=2017] God wants to pour grace into us and kindness into us so that we can give it to others.
[time=2026] And that's what Boaz does here.
[time=2029] Boaz is kind.
[time=2032] My dear brothers and sisters, we are always surrounded by broken people, but we can be a blessing to those broken people.
[time=2040] The question is, are we? Are we intentionally doing that?
[time=2045] If God is working at the corners of our fields, what role do we play?
[time=2053] Because God does here, he takes a broken person and blesses her, but he uses Boaz.
[time=2059] Looking verses 9 through 12.
[time=2064] Let your eyes be on the field that they are reaping and go after them.
[time=2069] "Have I not charged the young men not to touch you?" And you are thirsty. Go to the vessels and drink what the young men have drawn.
[time=2075] Then she fell on her face, bowing to the ground and said to him, "Why have I found favor in your eyes?
[time=2081] Then you should take notice of me since I am a foreigner." She basically says, "I have no rights." But Boaz answered her, "All that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband has been fully told to me and how you left your father and mother and your native land and came to a people that you did not know before." And now the word of Yahweh, the word Lord appears.
[time=2105] That's the word Yahweh.
[time=2107] The Lord repay you for what you have done and a fully word be given to you by the Lord, the God of Israel under whose wings you have come to take refuge.
[time=2119] I want you to put yourself in her sandals.
[time=2124] She probably didn't have shoes, sandals of some sort.
[time=2127] She goes home and she shares this with Naomi and Naomi tells her, "Wow, that's our relative.
[time=2135] That's our Kingsman Redeemer.
[time=2137] It's a term that appears in the Book of Ruth.
[time=2141] It's not Boaz's relative starting in chapter 3.
[time=2146] Watch, therefore, anoint yourself and put on your cloak and go down to the trashing floor.
[time=2152] Now Naomi is putting something in place here.
[time=2155] She's playing in a way matchmaker.
[time=2160] Watch, therefore, chapter 3, verse 3.
[time=2162] Watch, therefore, anoint yourself and put on your cloak and go down to the trashing floor but do not make yourself known to them until he has finished eating and drinking.
[time=2170] But when he lies down, observe the place where he lies and then go and uncover his feet and lie down and he will tell you what to do.
[time=2179] And she replied, "All day you say, I will do." So she went down to the trashing floor and did just as the mother-in-law had commanded her and when Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was married, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain.
[time=2195] Then she came softly and uncovered his feet and lay down.
[time=2198] At midnight the man was startled and turned over and behold a woman lay at his feet.
[time=2204] We have a transition here from broken to blessed, from rejected to being redeemed.
[time=2213] Verse 9, "Who are you?" And she answered, "I am Ruth your servant, spread your wings over your servant for you are a redeemer."
[time=2223] Very important concept there, redeemer.
[time=2227] Now, young men who are not married, if a woman comes to you and says,
[time=2233] "The spread your wings over your servant, how would you interpret that?" The first thing you should say, "I have no wings," right?
[time=2243] Or maybe you do.
[time=2245] Well, here's the explanation.
[time=2247] Imagine that Boaz had a long robe.
[time=2251] The bottom of the robe was called a wing.
[time=2256] So if you had a robe, the bottom of the robe was a wing.
[time=2263] And if someone wanted to marry someone, wanted to propose marriage,
[time=2269] they would say, "Spread your wing over me." Basically that's a marriage proposal.
[time=2277] Basically what Ruth says is, "Merry me." Pretty forward for a woman living 3,000 years ago, huh?
[time=2287] I know someone married guys are here, "I wish I had that." No, it's different in our culture, right?
[time=2294] The man has to conquer.
[time=2297] But no, in that culture apparently was acceptable, at least Boaz doesn't take it as an offense.
[time=2305] By the way, that's also in Ezekiel, chapter 16, when the prophet talks about God marrying Israel.
[time=2314] It's the same concept of spreading one's wing.
[time=2318] Ezekiel 16, verse 8, "When I passed by you," this is God speaking of Israel, "Behold,
[time=2326] you are at the age of love, and I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your nakedness, I made my vow to you and entered into a covenant with you, declares the Lord God and you became mine." So God is the husband of Israel.
[time=2347] And in the same way, Ruth says to Boaz, "Merry me."
[time=2353] Why? Because you are a redeemer.
[time=2356] This concept was also from the Old Testament law.
[time=2360] If a family became destitute or poor and didn't have any more money,
[time=2366] someone close of kin, a kinsman redeemer, would have been able, should have been able,
[time=2374] or should have tried to redeem that person or that family.
[time=2379] And in this case, Boaz is a close kinsman redeemer.
[time=2387] Naomi tells that to Ruth.
[time=2389] They're from the same extended family.
[time=2394] But there is a little glitch here.
[time=2399] Turn with me, please, to chapter 4.
[time=2407] What we find in the story is a little glitch because they find out that there is a closest
[time=2414] kinsman redeemer than Boaz. There is another man who is a closer relative than Boaz.
[time=2425] Look in chapter 4 with me.
[time=2433] And Boaz had gone up to the gate and sat down there and behold the redeemer of whom Boaz had spoken,
[time=2440] and came by. So Boaz said, "Turn aside, friends, sit down here." And he turned aside and sat down.
[time=2446] And he took ten men of the elders of the city and said, "Sit down here." So they sat down. Then he said to the redeemer Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of the land that belonged to our relative, Elimelech.
[time=2458] So I thought I would tell you of it and say, "Buy it in the presence of those sitting here and in the presence of the elders of my people." If you will redeem it, redeem it. But if you will not tell me that I may know, for there is no one besides you to redeem it, and I come after you.
[time=2475] And the man says, "That's a good business proposition." He says, "I will redeem it." Then Boaz says, "Hey, there's a footnote here.
[time=2487] There's an amendment.
[time=2490] The day you bite the field from the hand of Naomi, you also acquire Ruth the Moabite."
[time=2496] The widow of the dead, in order to perpetuate the name of the dead in his inheritance, then the redeemer said, "Ah, I don't think that will go well with my wife."
[time=2507] I'm using my sanctified imagination.
[time=2513] Well, we know for sure as this, "I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I impair my own inheritance.
[time=2520] Take my right of redemption yourself, or I cannot redeem it." So the closest of kin doesn't want to, you know, he's okay with the land being redeemed.
[time=2531] He's okay with making a good business transaction, acquiring land, but not acquiring a person,
[time=2538] not redeeming a person.
[time=2541] So then Boaz benefits from this, and they get married.
[time=2550] Look in chapter 13, chapter 4, verse 13.
[time=2556] So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife, and he went into her.
[time=2561] Now, notice please hear the words, and the Lord gave her conception.
[time=2567] Very, very important words there.
[time=2571] The Lord gave her conception, and she bore a son.
[time=2579] The book begins with a funeral and ends with a wedding.
[time=2583] The book begins with death and ends with life.
[time=2587] Ruth goes from being a wife to being, from being a widow to being a wife again.
[time=2594] But in the whole book, the narrator only mentions God directly acting twice.
[time=2602] This is the narrator making God the subject of an action of her only twice.
[time=2607] First in chapter 1, verse 16, when it says, "The Lord had visited his people and given them food."
[time=2614] And now the second time is here in chapter 4, when the Lord gave her conception.
[time=2620] The NIV smooths it out, "The Lord enabled her to conceive." And she gave birth to a son.
[time=2628] Now how long was Ruth in Moab ten years?
[time=2632] Ten years without being a mother.
[time=2635] And now all of a sudden, she's able to be a mother, why?
[time=2639] Because the Lord intervened.
[time=2642] The Lord gave her conception. The Lord enabled her to conceive.
[time=2652] She goes from being rejected to being redeemed.
[time=2656] And not only that, notice please where she ends up.
[time=2661] She ends up in the New Testament in the genealogy of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2667] That's how Ruth, the book of Ruth ends with this genealogy.
[time=2672] Salmon fathered Boas, Boas fathered Obed, Obed fathered Jesse, and Jesse fathered David.
[time=2680] Now what did we learn in the book of Judges?
[time=2682] In the book of Judges, remember what the theme was?
[time=2686] There was no king in the land. Everybody did what?
[time=2689] Oh, it was right in their own eyes.
[time=2691] And now all of a sudden, their eyes go towards, "Oh, there's a king coming."
[time=2697] And not just a king, there's a king David coming.
[time=2700] And this king David coming will have another successor down the line who will be King Jesus.
[time=2706] And that's what Matthew wants to do in his genealogy.
[time=2710] Look in Matthew's genealogy in Matthew chapter 1.
[time=2715] Who appears in Jesus' genealogy?
[time=2720] Talk about redemption.
[time=2724] Matthew 1.5.
[time=2725] Salmon fathered Father of Boas by Rahab and Boas the father of Obed by Ruth.
[time=2730] And Obed the father of Jesse in verse 16 and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband and Mary of whom Jesus was born who is called the Christ, who is called the Messiah.
[time=2741] There are four women mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus.
[time=2746] You ready for this? Who the four are?
[time=2749] Tamar, Rahab, Bathsheba, and Ruth.
[time=2754] Think about that for a second.
[time=2757] The four women who are mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus.
[time=2761] Tamar, Rahab, Bathsheba, and Ruth.
[time=2765] One scholar asks, "Why not Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, or Leah?"
[time=2773] And here's his answer, partly correct.
[time=2777] Because all these women are not only sinners, but sinners who engage in sexual sin
[time=2784] or what might be interpreted as sexual sin.
[time=2787] Ruth, by the way, was not engaged in that.
[time=2790] Their inclusion here accomplishes two things.
[time=2792] First, it underscores the ministry of Jesus as Savior of all kinds of sinners.
[time=2798] Second, these four Old Testament women become prototypes of Mary who conceived a child apart from her husband.
[time=2807] The story of Ruth, the reason I love the story is because it's your story and it's my story.
[time=2815] You see, we don't belong. We are not born Jews.
[time=2819] We don't belong. Actually, listen to what the law says about Moabites.
[time=2824] Astronomy 23, 3 says this, "No Ammonite or Moabite may enter in the assembly of the Lord."
[time=2831] What?
[time=2833] "No Moabites shall enter in the assembly of the Lord, and yet in Matthew,
[time=2840] where is Ruth in the genealogy of the Lord Jesus Christ?"
[time=2847] What is that called?
[time=2849] It's called grace.
[time=2853] I love Ruth's story because it's my story and it's your story.
[time=2858] See, the law says, "No Moabite may enter into the assembly of the Lord."
[time=2864] If we were to take that contemporary culture, it would be no Romanian, no American, no Colombian, no Texan may enter into the assembly of the Lord.
[time=2876] That's what it says.
[time=2878] But I have better news for you, Isaiah 56. Listen to what it says.
[time=2885] It's the prophet Isaiah, the evangelist of the Old Testament.
[time=2889] "And the foreigners who join themselves to the Lord, to minister to Him, to love the name of the Lord and to be His servants.
[time=2896] Everyone who keeps the Sabbath and does not profane it and holds fast my covenant.
[time=2900] These I will bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer.
[time=2905] Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar.
[time=2909] For my house shall be close, a house of prayer for all people." Isn't that good news?
[time=2915] That's great news.
[time=2917] That is grace.
[time=2921] And it's only possible because of what Jesus Christ has done for us.
[time=2926] Ruth's story is my story and it's your story.
[time=2930] You see, without Jesus we are like Ruth.
[time=2935] We don't belong.
[time=2937] Actually, the Bible says that without Jesus we are dead in our sins, Ephesians chapter 2.
[time=2943] Without Jesus we are broken.
[time=2947] Naomi Ruth was a widow, a childless widow, and she was broken.
[time=2956] And not only that, but she was rejected.
[time=2959] Without Jesus we are broken because sin, not just basically we're dead in our sin,
[time=2966] but we are broken and enslaved by our addictions.
[time=2971] And we are rejected, but in Jesus the Bible says that we are alive.
[time=2978] If Jesus Christ is your Lord and Savior you are alive.
[time=2982] And the power that raised Jesus from the dead, Paul says, resides in you.
[time=2988] You are alive.
[time=2990] We are alive.
[time=2991] And we are blessed.
[time=2992] Aren't we?
[time=2993] We are blessed in so many ways, but one thing that we overlook sometimes, and I overlook is the fact that I have the Holy Spirit living in me.
[time=3002] And when you get the Holy Spirit it teaches you right from wrong.
[time=3006] It guides you what to do, it teaches you what the Bible says, and then most importantly we are redeemed.
[time=3015] We are redeemed because of what Jesus Christ has done for us on the cross.
[time=3026] If we could transport Ruth this morning,
[time=3032] I would like to believe that she would join Jonathan in singing together in a duet, that song.
[time=3043] Were it not for grace?
[time=3047] I can tell you where I'd be, wandering down some pointless road to nowhere with my salvation up to me.
[time=3056] And I know how that would go, the battles I would face forever running but losing the grace.
[time=3062] Were it not for grace?
[time=3067] Forever running but losing the race.
[time=3073] Were it not for grace?
[time=3075] Here's the good news.
[time=3077] The greatest love story ever told is still being written.
[time=3083] You can be part of the bride of Jesus Christ.
[time=3088] Isn't that beautiful?
[time=3090] The greatest love story is still being told.
[time=3094] And it's still being written because we learn in Revelation chapter 19 what happens?
[time=3104] In Revelation chapter 19 the Bible ends with the great marriage feast,
[time=3112] the marriage supper of the Lamb.
[time=3116] And listen what happens.
[time=3119] Then I heard what seemed to be a voice of a great multitude like the roar of many waters,
[time=3125] and like the mighty pearls of thunder crying out, Hallelujah for the Lord our God the Almighty reigns.
[time=3133] Let us rejoice and exalt and give him the glory for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his bride has made herself ready.
[time=3141] It was granted her to clothe herself with fine linen, bright and pure for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.
[time=3150] You can be part of the bride of Christ.
[time=3153] The church is called the bride of Christ.
[time=3156] And who's part of that bride?
[time=3159] Revelation chapter 5 verses 7 and on.
[time=3164] I love this because it talks about the universality of what God wants to do.
[time=3171] When he went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne, and when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp and golden balls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints, and they sang a new song saying, "Worthy are you to take the scroll and to open its seals, for you are slain, and by your blood are you redeemed people for God?" What does it say? From Israel alone?
[time=3199] No! From every tribe and language and people and nation,
[time=3205] and you have made them a kingdom and priests to our God, and they shall reign on earth.
[time=3210] Isn't that good news? That's the good news.
[time=3214] That we can be part of the bride of Christ, and we don't have to be born in Israel
[time=3220] or of Jewish descent.
[time=3223] Let us pray. Dear Father, we thank you.
[time=3226] For the love story that you are still writing.
[time=3230] Thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ into the world to give us grace.
[time=3235] To save us even though we were dead, we were broken, we were rejected.
[time=3241] Thank you that through Jesus Christ and through the Holy Spirit we are alive, and we are blessed and we are redeemed.
[time=3248] I pray they will touch our hearts to go this week and to just evaluate the corners of our field.
[time=3255] How generous are we? Like you used Boaz 3000 years ago,
[time=3261] I pray they will touch our hearts so we can be kind to those who need our help.
[time=3267] May we be generous with the corners of our field.
[time=3274] I pray that someone here doesn't know Jesus Christ is the Lord and Savior as the Messiah, that today will be the day of their salvation and they will surrender their life to you.
[time=3284] They could be part of the bride of Christ in the last days.
[time=3289] And thank you that you not just saved Israelites, but saved people from every language and every tribe.
[time=3297] I pray they will touch our hearts so we can go and tell about your love to all these people,
[time=3303] today and every day. In Christ name I pray. Amen.
[time=3312] Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, worthy is the King who conquered the grave.
[time=3317] Let's stand and sing about His amazing grace.
[time=3329] To face the power of sin and darkness whose love is mighty, and so much stronger,
[time=3338] than King of glory, than King of all He.
[time=3344] To chase the whole earth before we thunder and leaves us endless.
[time=3354] In our wonder, the King of glory, the King of all He.
[time=3363] This is amazing grace.
[time=3367] This is amazing love.
[time=3372] That you would take my place.
[time=3376] That you would bear my cross.
[time=3381] You laid down your love.
[time=3385] That I would be instead free.
[time=3391] Oh Jesus I sing for all that you've done for me.
[time=3406] Who brings our chaos back into order, who brings to your friend a son and daughter.
[time=3415] The King of glory, the King of glory, who is who patience.
[time=3422] Into the justice shines like the sun in.
[time=3426] All of His brilliance, the King of glory, the King of all He.
[time=3435] This is amazing grace.
[time=3440] This is amazing love.
[time=3444] That you would take my place.
[time=3449] That you would bear my cross.
[time=3454] You laid down your love.
[time=3458] That I would be instead free.
[time=3464] Oh Jesus I sing for all that you've done for me.
[time=3474] Wordy is the land that was slain.
[time=3478] Wordy is the King of all He.
[time=3483] Wordy is the land that was slain.
[time=3487] Wordy is the King of all He.
[time=3492] Wordy is the land that was slain.
[time=3496] Wordy is the King of all He.
[time=3501] Wordy is the land that was slain.
[time=3504] Wordy, Wordy, Wordy.
[time=3508] This is amazing grace.
[time=3512] This is amazing love.
[time=3517] That you would take my place.
[time=3521] That you would bear my cross.
[time=3526] You laid down your life.
[time=3530] That I would be instead free.
[time=3536] Oh Jesus I sing for all that you've done for me.
