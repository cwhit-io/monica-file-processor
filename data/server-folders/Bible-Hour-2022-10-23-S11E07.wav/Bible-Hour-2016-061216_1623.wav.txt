[time=729] Well, the plates are being passed I get to read a chapter of scripture to you from the book of 1 Samuel again, my name is Corbin normally I'm in Poland serving as a missionary sent by Blackhawk to reach teenagers with the Gospel of Jesus and with rock and roll that's why I have weird clothes and crazy hair but it's really good to be here we love what we do in Poland but we really love being here with all of you if you want to follow along in your Bible I'm going to read from 1 Samuel the whole chapter, chapter 1 and please forgive me for verse 1 and 2 because it's got so many words that I don't know how to pronounce once we get into verse 3 I think everything will be okay there was a certain man of Remeth and Zofeem in the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Elkhana the son of Jarrahal son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuf and Ephrathite he had two wives the name of the one was Hannah and the name of the other Peninna and I was going to come up again, this is going to be bad and Peninna had children but Hannah had no children now this man used to go up year by year from his city to worship and to sacrifice to the lord of hosts at Shiloh where the two sons of Eli, Haphne and Phineas were priests of the lord on the day when Elkhana sacrificed he would give portions to Peninna, his wife and to all her sons and daughters but to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her though the lord had closed her womb and her rival Peninna used to provoke her grievously to irritate her because the lord had closed her womb so it went on year by year as often as she went up to the house of the lord she used to provoke her therefore Hannah wept and would not eat and Elkhana, her husband said to her, "Hannah, why do you weep and why do you not eat and why is your heart sad am I not more to you than ten sons?" after they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh, Hannah rose now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of the temple of the lord she was deeply distressed and she prayed to the lord and she wept bitterly and she vowed a vow to the lord and said "Oh lord of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your servant and remember me and not forget your servant but will give to your servant a son then I will give him to the lord in all the days of his life and no razors shall touch his head" and she continued praying before the lord and Eli observed her mouth Hannah was speaking in her heart, only her lips moved and her voice was not heard, therefore Eli took her to be a drunken woman and Eli said to her, "How long will you go on being drunk?
[time=906] put away your wine from you" but Hannah answered, "No, my lord, I am a woman troubled in spirit I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but I have been pouring out my soul before the lord" to not regard your servant as a worthless woman for all along I've been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation then Eli answered, "Go in peace and the god of Israel grant your petition that you have made to him" and she said, "Let your servant find favor in your eyes then the woman went her way and ate and her face was no longer sad" they rose early in the morning and worshiped before the lord and they went back to their house in Brahma and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife and the lord remembered her and in due time Hannah conceived and bore a son and she called him Samuel for she said, "I have asked for him from the lord" the man Elkanah in all his house went up to offer to the lord the yearly sacrifice and to pay his vow but Hannah did not go up for she said to her husband as soon as this child is weaned I will bring him so that he may appear in the presence of the lord and dwell there forever Elkanah, her husband said to her, "Do it seems best to you, wait until you have weaned him only may the lord establish his word" so the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him and when she had weaned him she took him up with her along with her three-year-old bowl and an effa of flour in the skin of wine and she brought him to the house of the lord at Shiloh and the child was young then they slaughtered the bowl and they brought the child to Eli and she said, "Oh my lord, as long as you live" as long as you live my lord I am the woman who is standing here in your presence praying to the lord before this child I prayed and the lord has granted me my petition that I made to him and therefore I have lent him to the lord as long as he lives he is lent to the lord and he worshipped the lord there Good morning thank you Coribun thank you Darren I understand Coribun the clothes and the hair what about Darren?
[time=1042] what's his excuse?
[time=1045] he started it by the way
[time=1051] you guys will make a good team actually please open your Bibles to 1 Samuel today we are going to be in a book of 1 Samuel and for the next couple of Sundays we are in a book of transitions of sorts you see the book of Samuel is a book of transition because the nation of Israel goes from being a theocracy to being a monarchy see God intended Israel to be a theocracy people ruled by God, by Theos, by God but the book of 1 Samuel shows us that the people of Israel actually want to be a monarchy people ruled by a monarch or by a king and that's what the book of 1 Samuel is and there are two main characters in the book of 1 Samuel Samuel the last judge and soul the first king now David appears on the scene a little bit but he's not the main character we have Samuel and soul as the main characters and for the first few chapters we have Samuel as the main character the title of the sermon points to three people that we're going to look at this morning a godly mother Hannah a careless father that's the priest Eli and then the devoted son being Samuel the book doesn't start actually by telling us about Samuel or about Eli it starts by describing Hannah the mother of Samuel so we first start by looking at Hannah a godly mother how does a godly mother look like?
[time=1160] first of all godly mothers pray godly people in general pray but godly mothers especially pray the book starts by describing two problems that Hannah has there are two problems here in the first few verses one problem caused by her husband ladies can I get an amen the problems in your lives probably originate with your husbands right?
[time=1188] you can say that's fine the second problem originates with god but the first problem originates with the husband and we see that in the first few verses genny elkana is introduced in verse one but then verse two tells us the problem she had two wives god's design for marriage was established in Genesis chapter one god created Adam and Eve and thus he established the marriage principle a man and a woman not a man and two women not a man and a man not two women not nothing like that a man and a woman that's god's principle for marriage god's design for marriage and once we started first Samuel in verse two he had two wives all of a sudden we should see a problem and here elkana complicates his life and complicates the life of those around him by not following the word of the Lord and that's a very important principle for today whenever we don't follow god's word we complicate our lives and the lives of those around us that's a daily principle we can see that all the time in our lives but she also has the affliction of being born she cannot have children so she faces problems from within and from without she is a woman who has problems and she first is persecution from outside from the other wife verses 6 and 7 and her rival used to provoke her grievously to irritate her because the Lord had closed her womb so he went on year by year as often as she went up to the house of the Lord she used to provoke her therefore Hannah wept and would not eat but Hannah turns to god in prayer verse 10 this is what we have on the screen she was deeply distressed and prayed to the Lord and wept bitterly my dear brothers and sisters godly people pray whenever we are afflicted whenever we are persecuted we should always turn to god in prayer I'm reminded about a good old hymn what a friend we have in Jesus all our sins and grieves to bear what a privilege to carry everything to god in prayer oh what peace we often forfeit oh what needless pain we bear all because we do not carry everything to god in prayer so it's a point of application my dear brothers and sisters let me ask you how is our prayer life how often do we pray how much do we pray when we are afflicted when we are persecuted do we wine and complain or do we turn to god in prayer because godly people pray and Hannah is a great example of a godly woman not only does she pray but in the prayer she makes a vow and then we'll see that she will keep her vow verse 11 and she vow to vow and said all Lord of hosts if you will indeed look to on affliction of your servant and remember me and not forget your servant but will give to your servant a son then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life and no razor shall touch his head and the beautiful thing about this is that god answers her prayer verses 19 and 20 and elkana knew his wife Hannah his wife and the Lord remembered her and in due time Hannah conceived and bore her son and she called his name Samuel for she said I have asked for him from the Lord but if you look here in verse 19 what does it mean that the Lord remembered her?
[time=1427] does this god forget?
[time=1429] the answer is no whenever we see the Bible the Lord remember in conjunction with the Lord that doesn't mean to bring back to mind whenever the Bible says that the Lord remembered by the way talked about the Lord remembered Abraham the Lord remembered Noah the Lord remembered Hannah the Lord remembered Ruth so forth and so on whenever we have those words used for God it means that God is acting on that person's behalf remember in the case of God doesn't mean to bring back to mind it means to act on someone's behalf and in this case God is answering prayer and is acting on the behalf on behalf of Hannah and the one who closed the room now opens the room and she gives birth to Samuel and she called his name Samuel for she said I have asked for him from the Lord the word Samuel comes from the root "shamad" means to hear or to listen so Samuel means God hears or God listens if your name is Sam this morning whenever some people call your name you always should remember God hears that's a great reminder God listens God hears prayer and Hannah makes a vow and Hannah will keep her vow looking verses 24 to 28 and when she had weaned him she took him up with her along with a three-year-old bull an F.R. flower in a skin of wine and she brought him to the house of the Lord at Shiloh and the child was young then they slaughtered the bull and they brought the child to Eli and she said oh my Lord as you live my Lord I am the woman who was standing here in your presence praying to the Lord for this child I prayed and the Lord has granted me my petition that I made to him therefore I have lent him to the Lord as long as he lives he is lent to the Lord and he worshiped the Lord there now Jewish women would wean their children until the age of three so Samuel is three years old when Hannah takes him and brings him to the temple sorry the tabernacle to serve there you see according to the law of Moses all first born children were to be dedicated to the Lord all first born children should be serving the Lord in the tabernacle and later the temple how come not all of them did well because God made a provision in the law that if you do not want your son to serve the Lord in the temple or the tabernacle then you could redeem him back for five shekels so most people did that by the way that's in the book of Exodus chapter 13 starting in verse 11 when the Lord brings you into the land of the Canaanites as he sword to you and your fathers and shall give it to you you shall set apart to the Lord all that first opens the womb all the first born of the animals there are all male shall be the Lord every first born of a donkey and you shall redeem with a lamb or if you will not redeem if you shall break its neck every first born of men among your sons you shall redeem so you had that option of buying back or redeeming back your son if you didn't want him to serve the Lord in the tabernacle or later the temple and Hannah says no I don't want him back I want him to belong to the Lord because I made a vow God if you give me a son I'm going to have him serve the Lord now let me ask you parents how many of you ever prayed that prayer?
[time=1660] maybe some of you have it's interesting score when he's a missionary do you know what the number one obstacle to missions is?
[time=1672] I think I mentioned this before parents if someone says to their parent mom dad I want to be a missionary the first obstacle to the mission field is the parent who says no no I don't think that's such a good idea and I'm not talking about pagan parents I'm talking about Christian parents think about that think about how we should probably rephrase our prayers and maybe learn from Hannah to make a vow to the Lord and to keep that vow what better way for our children to serve the Lord and to be a missionary and yet sometimes we say well I'd rather him be close to me I'd rather him be a doctor or a lawyer by doing nothing wrong with that but what about what's the best place for your child to be then in the center of God's will whether in Poland or Romania or Israel or Texas or wherever it is but God can use our children Hannah prays Godly people pray my dear brothers and sisters and Godly people make vows and they keep their vows I don't know if you're like that we had people like Daniel Romania when we lived under communism people would say Lord if you help me to go to the United States I'll serve you forever and I'm going to do all these things for you and we made it here and now all we care about is how much money we make and how big our houses are and how our cars are and how big are we to get about the vows that we made to the Lord if you made a vow to the Lord keep that vow Godly people pray make vows and keep vows Hannah as a godly mother also knows her God and she exolds God look please in chapter two this is a lesson in theology for all of us in chapter two we have here in the first part the prayer of Hannah recorded and really it's a lesson in theology and I want us to see that when she prays to God she knows the God she's praying to verse one Hannah prayed and said my heart exalts in the Lord my horn is exalted in the Lord my mouth derides my enemies because I rejoice in your salvation now some weird stuff going on here my horn is exalted in the Lord that it's actually an expression that comes from it's a figure of speech of an animal in triumphant march an animal with the has a horn and comes comes back from defeating another animal has the horn high inside a victory and that's the idea here the idea is not that Hannah had horns or anybody else no it's a figure of speech denoting victory God gave her victory you see Hannah knows her God Hannah knows that God gave her victory and on all the story it says I rejoice in your salvation Hannah knows that God is the giver of salvation she knows her theology very well look in verse two Hannah knows that God is holy there's none holy like the Lord for there's none beside you there is no rock like our God she knows that God is strong and you can rely on him there's none holy like the Lord we mentioned that Samuel means God hears if your name is Michael or Michelle that's another beautiful biblical name it's a question who is like God the idea is that nobody is like God they're all these beautiful names in the Bible but Hannah knows that God is holy he is strong looking verse six the Lord kills and brings to life he brings down to Sheol and raises up see she knows that God is sovereign and he is in charge verses seven and eight the Lord makes poor and makes rich he brings low and he exalts he raises up the poor from the dust he lifts the needy from the ashheep to make them sit with princes and inherit a seat of honor whenever you want to pray to God and you don't have the words for it sometimes it's good to read the prayers of the saints that went before us read Hannah's prayer maybe if you if you sin then you're confessing your sin and you don't have the words to say read David's prayer and sound 51 read the prayers in the Bible and maybe God will give you the words to say but godly people pray godly people know who they pray to and godly people make vows and they keep vows but in stark contrast with Hannah is Eli the priest and he is a careless father he is introduced to us in the first Samuel chapter two starting in verse 12
[time=1983] in contrast to the godly mother stands a priest whom you expect to be a godly leader instead he is a careless father look at his children I put here the two versions for a reason now the sons of Eli were worthless men they did not know the Lord in the original it basically says something like this now the sons of Eli were sons of belly-al was a pagan deity that's translated worthless men now do you remember who also called worthless earlier as Corbin right did you catch that?
[time=2029] did you catch that in the in the scripture reading?
[time=2032] Eli thought that Hannah was worthless when she was praying did you see what's going on here a leader who has no discernment he thinks that a woman praying is worthless and she doesn't see that his own sons are worthless whoa to the people who have worthless undistcerning leaders the sons of Eli were worthless men didn't they did not know the Lord now the NIV that's something very interesting Eli's sons were scoundrels how did they get that from sons of belly-al or worthless I don't know if you want to read the NIV fine what I want to point out here no no no it's fine I want to show you the difference between a literal translation and a prayer-phrastic translation which again it's fine whatever you read as long as the word of God but I want you to see the difference see the ESV the English Standard version the New American Standard version they're what we call literal translations they try to hold to a literal word-for-word translation the NIV is a paraphrastic translation they try to put in their own words what they think the text means so they make it better for a 2011 and after translation the NIV 2011 is the newest translation so they went with sons of belly-al and they tried worthless and they translated that scoundrels they put it in basically present day English because scoundrel is probably better understood to the young readers than worthless would be the Bible in the second part says they did not know the Lord that by the way it's what the Hebrew says they did not know the Lord and from there the NIV paraphrased it and said they did not they had no regard for the Lord whatever is going on here if Eli was a good priest he was a horrible father and unfortunately other times a lot of times some of the worst kids are preacher's kids and why is that Eli can be a good priest but he's a horrible father look what it says here in starting in verse 13-17 what made them worthless and why is Eli so careless as a father?
[time=2193] the custom starting in verse 13 of the priest with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice the priest's servant would come while the meet was boiling with the three pronged fork in his hand and he would thrust it into the pen or kettle or cauldron or pot all that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself this is what they did at Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there moreover the fact was burned the priest's servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing give me for the priest who rose for he will not accept boiled meat from you but only raw and if the man said to him let them burn the fat first then take as much as you wish all you must give it now and if not I will take it by force thus the sin of the young man was very great in the sight of the Lord for the man treated the offering of the Lord with content here's how one scholar explains it quote "these young priests were greedy and lazy in a frenzy of gluttony the servant poked a pronged fork into any and every cooking pot at hand all that the fork found the priest would take for himself my dear brothers and sisters God does not bless laziness God does not bless greed but both sons are guilty of this but notice in verse 18 in stark contrast to these 10 Samuel but Samuel was ministering before the Lord a boy clothed with a linen effort in contrast to these stands Samuel who is ministering before the Lord but what's the problem with Eli well here let's look at the text Eli was disobedient not only are his sons lazy and greedy but they turned the tabernacle into a brothel looking in verse 22 now Eli was very old and he kept hearing all that his sons were doing to all Israel and how they lay with the women who were serving at the entrance to the tent of meeting now what were the sons supposed to be doing they were supposed to be ministering and serving the people right instead of serving they are sinning with them and they are leading them into sin now notice please Eli's response Eli doesn't say stop it he doesn't say any like that he just says why do you do such things have you have you met parents like that who commit a sin and instead of you discipling the child why did you do that what made you do that you're trying to do like the psychoanalysis of the kid and what you should be saying stop it but you want to be a cool parent and cool parents don't stay stop it you are stifling their personality really man my dad stifled my personality when he took out the belt now a Romania there were no laws there apparently for that notice his response starting in verse 23 why do you do such things for I hear of your evil dealings from all the people know my sons it is no good report that I hear the people of the Lord spreading abroad if someone sins against the men God will mediate for him but if someone sins against the Lord who can intercede for him but they will not listen to the voice of their father for it is for it was the will of the Lord to put them to that and I know some of you are thinking Tiberius you're too harsh on Eli but look please with me in chapter 3 verse 13 if you think I'm too harsh in the words of judgment from God to Eli's house this is what God says in 1 Samuel 3 13 and I declare to him that I'm about to punish his house forever for the iniquity that he knew because his sons were blaspheming God and he did not restrain them he did not restrain
[time=2457] them those of you who have small children here's my two-sense parenting tip for you I learned it when I was a young parent it's called the funnel method it's called the funnel method you know the funnel is wide here small here when your children are small you got to keep them strict you got to teach them what to do what to say what not to say even more and more freedom what do we try to do sometimes oh I let my child have freedom and as they grow older and become teenagers I'm going to I'm going to discipline them then right how is that working for you oh now working now working you got to keep them strict when they're young and then as they grow you give them more and more freedom how early do you have to start them someone asked how old does my child have to be to discipline him?
[time=2521] well how old is he? he's two well you already lost two years I'm not kidding you got to start the disciplining process as early as they can I still remember today I can share this because Timoth is not here but I remember when Timoth was about one he just started learning how to walk and we had this boom box do you guys remember boom boxes?
[time=2547] we had a boom box apparently it was cool back then and he went to touch the boom box and I said don't touch the boom box and I was in front of him and he was to the back to the boom box and he goes like this
[time=2567] he was one who taught him how to do that?
[time=2571] this by the way is called total depravity it's in the doctrines of the church you don't have to teach a child to be disobedient they will start as early as they can because they are born and sin some 50-51 forces insane my mother conceived me you don't have to teach a child that's why you got to teach him not to sing teach him right or wrong as early as you can start early and then give him and more and more freedom he did not restrain them and because of that Eli is severely judged and punished by God starting in verse 23 there came a man of God to Eli and said to him starting in verse 27 of chapter 2 that says the Lord did I indeed reveal myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt subject to house of Pharaoh did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest go up to my altar to burn incense to where an effort before me I gave to the house of your father all my offerings by fire from the people of Israel why then do you score in my sacrifices and my offerings that I commanded for my dwelling and honor your sons above me did you catch that?
[time=2655] parents honoring sons and daughters more than God why then do you honor your sons above me by fattening yourselves on the choices parts of every offering of my people Israel therefore the Lord the God of Israel declares I promise that your house and the house of your father should go in and out before me forever but now declares the Lord far beat from me and those who honor me I will honor and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed behold days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father's house so that there will not be an old man in your house then in distress you will look with envious eye on all the prosperity that shall be bestowed on Israel and there shall not be an old man in your house forever the only one of you whom I shall not cut off from my altar hard to weep his eyes out to grieve his heart and all the descendants of your house shall die by the sword of men and this shall come upon your two sons Hovny and Phineas shall be the sign of you both of them shall die on the same day and I will raise up for myself a faithful priest who shall do according to what is in my heart and in my mind and I will build him a sure house and he shall go in and out forever and everyone who is left in your house shall come to implore him for a piece of silver over a loaf of bread and shall say please put me in one of the priest's places that I may eat a morsel of bread a godly mother a careless father but now we are introduced to Samuel the devoted son first of all what we see is that God calls Samuel chapter three starting in verse one now the boy Samuel was ministering to the Lord in the presence of Eli and the word of the Lord was rare in those days there were no frequent visions at that time Eli who's eyesight had began to grow dim so that he could not see was lying down in his own place the lamp of God had not gone yet out and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the Lord where the ark of God was then the Lord called Samuel and he said here I am and ran to Eli and said here I am for you called me but he said I did not call lie down again so he went and laid down and the Lord called again Samuel and Samuel arose and went to Eli and said here I am for you called me but he said I did not call you my son lie down again now Samuel did not yet know the Lord
[time=2819] and the word of the Lord had not yet been revealed to him and the Lord called Samuel again a third time and he arose and went to Eli and said here I am for you called me then Eli perceived finally Eli perceives he discerns that the Lord was calling the boy therefore Eli said to Samuel go Eli down and if he calls you you shall say speak Lord for your servant hears so Samuel went down and lay down in his place and the Lord came and stood calling at us other times Samuel Samuel and Samuel said speak for your servant here my dear brothers and sisters I wish that we can engrave those words in our hearts and I wish that that would be our response where God calls us to serve him and when God speaks to us in his word may we say speak Lord for your servant is listening not speak Lord for your servant is going to now butcher the word and take it apart in such a way that I'm not going to do what it says there are many people who can do that but speak Lord for your servant is listening whenever you think God is silent all you have to do is open the Bible and read and he will speak to you see this is not the time of Samuel when the visions were there we have a time when God spoke and his word is complete to us all we have to do is sit down and open it and God speaks God speaks to his word God calls Samuel and God gave Samuel his message looking in verse 11 then the Lord said to Samuel behold I am about to do a thing in Israel which the two years of everyone who hears will tingle see to be a messenger of God is not easy you'll have to declare certain things that people will not like and people will leave the church for certain things that you will say that's why I think it was Spurgeon who said sometimes you'll have to preach a church empty before you can preach it full and in certain cases that's what you need to do but don't expect if you teach or preach the word to be the most popular person on campus because if everybody likes what you have to say you're not saying the whole truth you're just trying to be popular but Samuel has to say certain things that you will be mocked for and persecuted for verses 12 and on on that day I will fulfill against Eli all that I've spoken concerning his house from the beginning to end and I declare to him that I'm about to punish his house forever for the iniquity that he knew because his sons were blaspheming God and he did not restrain them therefore I swear to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever so Eli is coming to Samuel and I say hey Samuel what did God say to you?
[time=3000] how would you like to be in Samuel's position?
[time=3004] Samuel could have said well God says it's not that bad everybody's doing it but that's not what he does looking verse 15 and 18 Samuel lay until the morning then he opened the doors of the house of the Lord and Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli but Eli called Samuel and said Samuel my son and he said here I am and I said what was it that he told you do not hide it from me may God do and more also if you hide anything from me all of all that he told you so Samuel told him everything and he had nothing from him and he said it is the Lord let him do what seems good to him I can tell you my dear brothers and sisters one of the hardest things is to keep telling the truth because a lot of people don't like the truth they want the sugar-coated version of the truth but when you do that you are diminishing the power of the Word of God Samuel doesn't do that and Samuel his ministry is established because he does the looking verses 19 and 20 and Samuel grew and the Lord was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground and in all Israel from Dan to the north part to Bersheba in the south knew that Samuel was established as a prophet of the Lord and the Lord appeared again at Shiloh for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of the Lord how do we apply the truth this morning first of all let's develop a life based on prayer Hannah prayed and we need to pray never underestimate your life of prayer there's not one way to pray some people make lists some people pray spontaneously do whatever is best for you but pray develop a life based on obedience if God tells you to go somewhere or to do something do what God tells you to do if you choose to live in this obedience then don't search to be a leader because you don't want to lead others because you don't want to lead others in your disobedient ways but if you want to live in obedience to God then do whatever is asking you to do and lastly develop a life based on discipline and what I mean here personal discipline first and then family discipline as a parent and then discipline for example as a leader in the church before you lead others you need to learn how to lead yourself if you cannot lead yourself well how are you going to lead your children well?
[time=3184] if you cannot lead your children well how can you lead the church of God well?
[time=3190] it's actually somewhere in the New Testament and Paul talks about that if you cannot raise your own kids to follow the Lord how can you be a leader in the church of God where you tell others how to follow the Lord?
[time=3206] we don't like discipline right?
[time=3210] no we don't that's why we have songs like amazing grace not amazing discipline because we like grace we like God's amazing grace but do we like the amazing discipline?
[time=3222] we don't like it but my dear brothers and sisters we have to develop them we have to develop the personal spiritual disciplines I highly recommend Richard Foster's book the celebration of disciplines the celebration of discipline develop the discipline of prayer reading God's word meditating on God's word fasting evangelizing let's develop a life of discipline and we cannot do that apart from Jesus and the Holy Spirit so when we pray about the rushing wind we need that we need that Holy Spirit within us that will help us pray but to save what to understand what we pray and to obey and then to be disciplined in everything God has calling us let's pray dear father I thank you for those who end before us who set examples may we learn from those good examples like Hannah and like Samuel in his youth forgive us for the times when we were like Eli we were more interested in pleasing people than pleasing you I pray that today will be a day of repentance and we will repent if we led a prayerless life a disobedient life an undisciplined life and I pray that you will fill us with your Holy Spirit and teach us what it means to follow you to lead a life of prayer and obedience a disciplined life in such a way that we will show lost world Jesus and his salvation in his name I pray Amen
