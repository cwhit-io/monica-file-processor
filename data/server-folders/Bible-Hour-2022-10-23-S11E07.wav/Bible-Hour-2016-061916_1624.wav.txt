[time=1210] You came down to find us.
[time=1213] Let us out of death.
[time=1216] You alone belongs the highest praise.
[time=1244] When Samuel became old, he made his sons' judges over Israel.
[time=1249] The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second Abajaya, and there were judges in Bathsheba.
[time=1257] Yet his sons did not walk in the ways but turned aside after gain.
[time=1263] They took bribes, perverted justice.
[time=1266] Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Rama and said to him, "Behold, you are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways.
[time=1276] Now, a point for us a king who will judge us like all the nations." But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, "Give us a king to judge us." And Samuel prayed to the Lord.
[time=1289] And the Lord said to Samuel, "Obey the voice of the people in all that they say to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from becoming king over them." According to all the deeds that they have done from the day I brought them out of Egypt, even to this day for saking me and serving other gods, so they are doing to you.
[time=1314] Thank you, Dave, and thank you, Tim, and thank you, Darren, for leading us in worship through music.
[time=1322] If you have your Bibles, please open to 1 Samuel 8.
[time=1325] If you're using the Pew Bible is page 132.
[time=1328] And if you don't have a Bible, you feel free to take the one in the pew.
[time=1334] This morning we're looking at three chapters in 1 Samuel.
[time=1339] Israel demands a king.
[time=1342] We established last week that 1 Samuel is a book about transition where the children of Israel are going from a theocracy to a monarchy.
[time=1353] A theocracy people ruled by God, Theos, or they want to be a monarchy.
[time=1361] People ruled by a monarch, a king.
[time=1365] And the two main characters in the book are Samuel, the last judge, and Saul, the first king.
[time=1373] Now we have to establish that a king was not against God's plan.
[time=1380] If we read carefully the first five books of the Bible, God talks about a king that he will raise in the future.
[time=1390] Actually, he gives very specific details, commandments about how the king should be, how he should be, and how he shouldn't be, how many horses he can have, and he shouldn't have many horses, and he shouldn't have a lot of wealth and all those things.
[time=1407] So if you look carefully in the book of Deuteronomy, God established that.
[time=1413] So what is the problem here by them demanding a king?
[time=1417] We will see today.
[time=1420] And we're still here focusing a little bit on Saul, on Samuel, before we get to Saul.
[time=1426] But what's interesting is that chapters four through seven kind of give us a glimpse into his life.
[time=1435] Only a couple of chapters to talk about Samuel's life.
[time=1439] We had chapters one, two, three to talk about his birth, his miraculous birth, his godly mother, right?
[time=1446] And then only a couple of chapters about Samuel's entire life.
[time=1452] And the answer is yes.
[time=1455] What happens here in chapters four through seven, we have the Philistines inflicting some casualties among the Israelites.
[time=1465] Not only that, but they take the Ark of the Covenant.
[time=1467] Remember the Ark of the Covenant?
[time=1469] The very symbol of God's presence with his people.
[time=1475] The Philistines they just take.
[time=1477] Now the Israelites recover it.
[time=1480] God orchestrates a victory against the Philistines and Samuel names that place a victory, "Ebon Israel".
[time=1488] Which literally means stone of help.
[time=1491] Evan, stone as their help.
[time=1495] Stone of help.
[time=1497] So whenever the children of Israel would pass by that stone, they would have remembered, or they should have remembered, what God did for them.
[time=1507] But I want to point to you, first Samuel chapter seven, please, turn there with me, before we get to chapter eight.
[time=1514] Because in chapter seven, Samuel calls Israel to repentance and to follow the Lord.
[time=1522] For Samuel seven, starting in verse three.
[time=1525] And Samuel said to all the house of Israel, "If you are returning to the Lord with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the ashtharoth from among you and direct your heart to the Lord and serve him only.
[time=1540] And he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines." So the people of Israel put away the bales and the ashtharoth and they serve the Lord only.
[time=1551] Then Samuel said, "Gather all Israel at Mitzvah, and I will pray to the Lord for you." So they gathered at Mitzvah or Mitzvah and drew water and put it out before the Lord and fasted on that day.
[time=1564] And they said there, "We have sinned against the Lord, and Samuel judged the people of Israel at Mitzvah." But it seems that this repentance was only temporary because of all we see in the subsequent chapters.
[time=1581] So the first thing we see is that they are asking for a king.
[time=1586] That's the first point.
[time=1588] Now, if you are like me, if you grew up in the church, you've heard, well, very quest was bad because they just wanted to be like the other nations, but if you look carefully in the text, there are three reasons why they're asking for a king.
[time=1603] I don't know if we conveniently or selectively ignore the first two
[time=1609] and only focus on the third, but if we look carefully, there are three reasons.
[time=1614] All of them in verse five of chapter eight.
[time=1618] Reason number one, why they wanted a king is that they tell Samuel, "Behold, you are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways."
[time=1630] Actually, there we have reason one and two.
[time=1633] Now, old does not mean bad.
[time=1637] We know that.
[time=1638] But the truth of the matter is that some people just don't know when to hang it up.
[time=1644] I'm sure all of us had bosses or friends or that we know relatives that didn't know when to retire.
[time=1651] And apparently that was the case here or was it?
[time=1657] But reason number one is you are old, second reason, your sons do not walk in your ways.
[time=1664] So like Eli, it seems that Samuel failed as a father.
[time=1670] And again, as a parent and as parents and maybe grandparents, we have to stop and evaluate our lives.
[time=1678] It is good for sometimes to sit down and think about, "How am I doing as a father?" Not to say, "Well, okay, we're going to feel bad again this morning because we have failed as parents." No.
[time=1689] But to evaluate, if we are not doing something that we should be doing, what is it that we need to correct?
[time=1696] Do we need to repent?
[time=1697] Do we need to change our ways?
[time=1699] Do we need to say, "I'm sorry"?
[time=1702] Wherever it is, it's okay to evaluate where we are.
[time=1707] Unfortunately, Samuel failed as a father.
[time=1713] And one thing we need to stop and establish from the beginning as parents is, "Are we leading by example?" Because see, we cannot ask our children to read the Bible if we don't read our Bibles.
[time=1725] We cannot tell our children, "Hey, you pray and then we don't pray." We have to lead by example.
[time=1730] We have to show our children what it means to follow the Lord.
[time=1736] Behold, you are old, reason number one.
[time=1739] Two, your sons do not walk in your ways.
[time=1743] Reason number three.
[time=1747] Now point for us a king.
[time=1750] Why?
[time=1753] To judge us like all the nations.
[time=1756] Now, I want you to think about with me for a little bit here.
[time=1760] If we take the big three superpowers from around Israel that day, Egypt, Babylon, and Assyria.
[time=1769] I want you to think about those nations and their kings.
[time=1773] What kind of kings do they have?
[time=1776] Just think about it for a second.
[time=1778] Where are these God-fearing kings?
[time=1784] Who is ruling in Egypt?
[time=1788] Pharaoh.
[time=1789] Was Pharaoh or Yahweh worshiper, one who judged with equity?
[time=1793] No.
[time=1794] How about in Babylon?
[time=1796] Who is the king in Babylon?
[time=1797] Was he Yahweh worshiper that followed the Lord?
[time=1800] No.
[time=1801] What about in Assyria?
[time=1803] No, you know what all these people have been coming?
[time=1805] There were old politicians worship many gods and they were all pagans.
[time=1810] And they're saying, "Do you want someone like that?" Really?
[time=1816] Well, sometimes God gives us what we ask for.
[time=1823] But God could have asked, "Do you want someone like them?
[time=1826] Is that what you want really?" Sometimes we have to ask ourselves, "What are we asking God?"
[time=1836] And why are we asking Him what we ask?
[time=1839] And is it possible that sometimes gives us what we ask for to actually discipline us for not wanting the right thing?
[time=1849] I don't know.
[time=1850] But if reasons number one and two, you are old and your sons don't walk in your ways, if those reasons make sense from a human perspective, this one doesn't make sense from a human perspective or from God's perspective.
[time=1867] Give us a point for us, a king, to judge us like all the nations.
[time=1876] And of course Samuel doesn't like the request.
[time=1881] He takes it very personally.
[time=1883] If you read the text, you'll see that Samuel says they have rejected me.
[time=1888] But really God says to Samuel, "Obey the voice of the people in all that they say to you, for they have not rejected you,
[time=1896] but they have rejected me from being king over them."
[time=1902] Now let me ask you, my dear brothers and sisters, looking in their history so far, does Israel have a record about rejecting God's leadership?
[time=1914] Yeah.
[time=1916] So this should not surprise anybody.
[time=1918] If you have read the Bible from Genesis until now, this should not have surprises because they rejected God's leadership over and over again.
[time=1927] And they wanted to be like the other nations and they were like the other nations.
[time=1931] Remember when they came out of Egypt?
[time=1933] They worshiped the golden calf just like the Egyptians.
[time=1937] That's right.
[time=1938] They get to Canaan and we just saw here in the text, they worshiped Baal and the Asherah just like the Canaanites.
[time=1946] So whatever they're asking here is not something new, they're basically just want to have a stamp of approval.
[time=1955] Their desire to be like the other nations is nothing new.
[time=1961] The problem here is God says, "I'm going to give you what you want, but there will be a price to pay."
[time=1970] There will be a price to pay.
[time=1972] They're asking for a king and God tells them you'll be paying for that king.
[time=1978] That's what we have in the next few verses.
[time=1983] There will be a price to pay.
[time=1986] Be careful what you wish for.
[time=1989] Notice, please, in verses 11 and 12 of chapter 8, how will they pay?
[time=1996] First of all, there will be a draft, a military draft.
[time=2001] And who do you think will be part of that draft?
[time=2003] You're?
[time=2004] What does it say up there?
[time=2006] He will take your sons.
[time=2010] Don't think that you're asking for something and you won't pay the penalty for it.
[time=2016] These will be the ways that the king will reign over you.
[time=2018] He will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and to be his horsemen and to run before his chariots.
[time=2024] And he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties and some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest
[time=2032] and to make his implements of war and the equipment of his chariots.
[time=2038] You will pay.
[time=2040] You will pay through your sons.
[time=2042] There will be a price to pay.
[time=2044] Look in verse 14.
[time=2046] You will pay and the king will take your land.
[time=2052] Verse 14.
[time=2054] He will take the best of your fields and the vineyards and olive orchard and give them to his servants.
[time=2061] There will be a price to pay.
[time=2064] Look in verse 15, he will impose taxes on you.
[time=2068] He will take the tenth of your grain and of your vineyards and give it to his officers and to his servants.
[time=2074] There will be a price to pay.
[time=2076] And you know what?
[time=2077] He will take away your freedom.
[time=2079] Verse 16 and 17.
[time=2081] He will take your male servants and female servants in the best of your young men and your donkeys and put them to his work.
[time=2087] He will take the tenth of your flocks and you shall be his slaves.
[time=2092] He will take your freedom.
[time=2097] My dear brothers and sisters, we have to be very careful what we ask for.
[time=2102] And if God gives us something, sometimes it is because he wants to teach us a lesson.
[time=2110] They are asking for a king and God says, "I am going to give you that king, but you will pay for it." You will pay for it.
[time=2116] Be careful what you ask for.
[time=2118] And then look in chapter 9.
[time=2120] Samuel meets Saul.
[time=2122] Saul is introduced in the first verse.
[time=2126] Before we get to verse 17 when actually Samuel meets Saul, because notice it only happens in verse 17.
[time=2134] God tells Samuel about Saul and only in verse 17 do they meet.
[time=2139] But look in verses 1 and 2.
[time=2142] Saul is introduced to all of us.
[time=2145] There was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish.
[time=2148] And the son of Abile, the son of Zeror, the son of Bekorath, the son of Afiyyad, a Benjaminite, a man of wealth.
[time=2155] And he had a son whose name was Saul, a handsome young man.
[time=2161] There was not a man among the people of Israel more handsome than he.
[time=2165] From his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people.
[time=2171] As I was reading this I am thinking, is this really what people want in a king?
[time=2177] Tall and handsome?
[time=2179] Really?
[time=2181] I hope they want more than this.
[time=2184] And the answer is this is not just what Saul is, thankfully.
[time=2191] What we learn about Saul is that Saul is an obedient son.
[time=2197] Oh, how is he different? Is he different than the other sons we heard about?
[time=2202] Oh, he is different than the sons of Samuel who are corrupt and take bribes.
[time=2208] And he is different than the sons of Eli who have turned the tabernacle into a brothel.
[time=2216] He is different.
[time=2217] He walks in the ways of obedience.
[time=2221] When we find him, you know what he does?
[time=2224] He is looking for his father's what?
[time=2227] Donkeys.
[time=2229] What?
[time=2230] Is that his CV? Is that what's on his resume?
[time=2234] I am watching my father's donkeys.
[time=2236] What do you want to be? King.
[time=2239] Funny, right? But that's exactly what happens.
[time=2242] What does God see in this guy?
[time=2246] Well, he is actually looking for his father's donkeys.
[time=2249] The idea here is that he is walking on the path of mundane obedience.
[time=2256] Nothing very exciting.
[time=2259] You and I would think.
[time=2261] But when God looks at us, he wants to know that we are walking on the path of obedience.
[time=2268] We will see that even more clearly next Sunday.
[time=2273] Because Saul starts very well.
[time=2276] Okay, he is good looking. He is tall and handsome.
[time=2280] But really, that's not what we need.
[time=2283] We need someone who walks in obedience.
[time=2285] And what God really wants is a humble man, looking verse 21.
[time=2290] When Samuel tells him that he is going to be the king, Saul answered, "Am I not a Benjamin?
[time=2297] From the least of the tribes of Israel and is now my clan, the humblest, all of all the clans of the tribes of Benjamin.
[time=2303] Why then have you spoken to me in this way?" Saul is humble.
[time=2310] Saul is obedient.
[time=2312] And that's what God is looking for.
[time=2315] God cannot work through pride, through prideful men and women.
[time=2322] Because pride is that sin that says, "I can do it." Humility is that, "Hey, without God, I can't do anything." Saul is obedient.
[time=2333] He is looking for his father's donkeys.
[time=2336] Maybe you are thinking, "Well, I work in a little cubicle.
[time=2340] I have been teaching in third grade.
[time=2343] I help with the nursery.
[time=2345] I do all these mundane things." You know what?
[time=2349] That's the kind of people God needs.
[time=2352] The ones that can walk in mundane obedience day to day.
[time=2358] He is not looking for the ones.
[time=2360] You know, their names are on the marquee and their names are engraved somewhere.
[time=2367] No, no, no.
[time=2368] God is looking for humble men and women who are walking in the path of mundane obedience day to day.
[time=2377] Sometimes you and I are tempted to say, "Well, I'm only doing this thing and this thing." You know what?
[time=2383] That's what God wants.
[time=2385] God wants us to be faithful in the little things that He has entrusted to us.
[time=2390] And He is humble.
[time=2392] But the most important things is here in verse 17.
[time=2395] Saul is handpicked by God to be king.
[time=2398] When Samuel saw Saul, the Lord told him, "Here is the man of whom I spoke to you.
[time=2403] It is He who shall restrain my people." Now, I don't know about you, but I would have expected here another verb.
[time=2410] Restrain?
[time=2411] What are you talking about?
[time=2412] I thought we need a leader.
[time=2414] Actually, some translations do that.
[time=2417] They take this word and just translate it.
[time=2420] These, this man will lead your people.
[time=2424] But that's not what it says.
[time=2426] It says, "He shall restrain my people." As one scholar puts it, "It is He who shall restrain my people.
[time=2435] Saul would be used by God to hold back the people of Israel from their determination to be like the other nations."
[time=2443] And Saul starts well, and God is using them not just to lead, but to restrain his people.
[time=2451] And Samuel, because of that, he anoints Saul as king.
[time=2456] Look in verse 1 of chapter 10.
[time=2459] Then Samuel took a flask of oil and put it on his side and kissed him, and said, "Has not the Lord anointed you to be prince over his people Israel?
[time=2467] And you shall reign over the people of the Lord, and you will save them from the land, from the hand of their surrounding enemies.
[time=2476] And this shall be the sign to you that the Lord has anointed you to be the prince over his heritage."
[time=2482] Now, how did Samuel know how to anoint a king?
[time=2486] Did he do it before?
[time=2488] No.
[time=2489] So how does he know to anoint a king?
[time=2491] Well, he basically uses the same procedure he used for priests.
[time=2497] The priests were supposed to be anointed with oil.
[time=2500] And that's exactly what he does here.
[time=2503] The priests were selected by God to serve.
[time=2506] And just like that, God elects a king to serve.
[time=2509] So he is anointed with oil.
[time=2511] And basically, so Samuel tells Saul, "You are the king."
[time=2520] Now, what's interesting here is about we have signs confirming this.
[time=2525] Now, this doesn't happen all the time.
[time=2527] Sometimes, signs accompany prophecy.
[time=2530] And in this case, there are very interesting signs.
[time=2534] They're all here in chapter 10.
[time=2536] First of all, in verse 2, it says, "That Saul will meet two men who let him know that the donkeys will be found."
[time=2543] Remember what he's doing?
[time=2544] He's looking for the last donkeys.
[time=2547] And God says, "This is one of the signs that he is the king.
[time=2552] He will meet someone that will tell you that the donkeys have been found."
[time=2558] Chapter 10, verse 2, "When you depart from me today, you will meet two men by Rachel's tomb in the territory of Benjamin Azelza."
[time=2566] And they will say to you, "The donkeys that you went to seek are found.
[time=2570] And now your father has ceased to care about the donkeys and his anxious about you saying, "What shall I do about my son?"
[time=2578] That comes through the second sign.
[time=2581] Saul will meet three men carrying three young goats, three loaves of bread and a bottle of wine.
[time=2587] Apparently, they were not baptized.
[time=2592] Wine, okay.
[time=2594] I grew up baptized, so we were not able to drink.
[time=2598] But the third sign, Saul will meet a group of prophets singing prophecies.
[time=2602] And you see and you read.
[time=2604] And all these things happen, but the most important thing happens in verse 9.
[time=2609] Look, please, with me in 1st Kings 10, verse 9.
[time=2612] "When he turned his back to leave Samuel, God gave him another heart."
[time=2619] And all these things came to pass that day.
[time=2624] God gave him another heart.
[time=2626] One scholar writes this and I quote, "Whatever he meant for Saul to be given another heart, he meant a profound change."
[time=2633] The country lad was not in himself equipped for the task ahead of him.
[time=2638] God changed him and the change began without delay.
[time=2642] God was not slow in keeping his word.
[time=2647] If everything so far happened privately, just between Samuel and Saul, now Samuel presents Saul in a public presentation.
[time=2658] Looking verses 24 and 25.
[time=2661] And Samuel said to all the people, "Do you see him whom the Lord has chosen?
[time=2666] There is none like him among all the people.
[time=2669] And all the people shouted, "Long live the king." Then Samuel told the people the rights and duties of the kingship.
[time=2675] And he wrote them in a book and later up before the Lord.
[time=2678] Then Samuel sent all the people away each one to his home.
[time=2687] It is a beautiful thing when God selects a leader.
[time=2692] And really, really encouraged about what's happening at your church with the pastor discovery team.
[time=2700] Continue to fast and pray.
[time=2702] Because just like God worked 3,000 years ago, he will provide today.
[time=2708] Do you believe that?
[time=2710] You have to believe that.
[time=2711] You have to pray and you have to believe and you have to fast and a leader.
[time=2719] What we learn here at the end of chapter 10 is that a leader will always deal with conflict.
[time=2727] Look with me, please, in the last verses of chapter 10.
[time=2731] You see, not everybody was happy.
[time=2734] Not everybody was happy that Saul was selected king, even though God hand picked him.
[time=2740] Notice, please, the end of chapter 10, verses 26 and 27.
[time=2745] And the last 10 minutes that I have, I want to focus on this and how we apply the truth.
[time=2751] Saul also went to his home at Gebia and with him went men of valor whose hearts God had touched.
[time=2758] Did you catch that?
[time=2760] The people's hearts were also touched.
[time=2763] But some worthless fellows.
[time=2767] Do you remember when we encountered the word worthless before?
[time=2771] Do you remember?
[time=2772] It was last Sunday, a couple of Sundays ago.
[time=2775] Worthless was the word to describe Eli's sons.
[time=2780] It literally means sons of Belial.
[time=2784] But some worthless fellows said, "How can this man save us?"
[time=2791] And they despised him and brought him no present.
[time=2796] But he held his peace.
[time=2799] My dear brothers and sisters, a leader needs to have the peace of God.
[time=2807] And a leader needs to learn how to deal with conflict.
[time=2811] If you are in a church and there is no conflict, you're doing something wrong.
[time=2817] You're probably going in the wrong direction.
[time=2821] There will always be conflict.
[time=2823] Whenever you tell the truth, there will be people who won't like it.
[time=2828] Whenever you do what is right, there will be people who won't like it.
[time=2834] And that's exactly what happened here.
[time=2836] The guy didn't do anything yet.
[time=2839] Notice, please.
[time=2841] He didn't do anything yet and yet they despised him.
[time=2845] All we know is that God selected him, Samuel anointed him, and yet these people despised him.
[time=2852] But what I like here is that he held his peace.
[time=2857] You see, soul starts out well.
[time=2861] The question is, will he finish well?
[time=2865] And we'll find out next Sunday, so you've got to come back next Sunday.
[time=2870] And actually, I have a better thing for you.
[time=2873] Read ahead.
[time=2875] Go home and read after chapter 10.
[time=2881] Read 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[time=2884] And you'll see what happens and then we'll unpack it here next week.
[time=2890] So how do we apply the truth?
[time=2891] And I'm going to come back to this idea.
[time=2893] But first of all, we need to learn not to be conformed to the world.
[time=2899] Romans 12, too.
[time=2901] Do not be conformed to this world.
[time=2904] In other words, don't ask what the Israelites have asked.
[time=2907] We want to be like the other nations.
[time=2909] No, God says, do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind
[time=2916] that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.
[time=2924] Do not ask, how can I be like the world?
[time=2928] Ask, how can I be more like God?
[time=2931] And that's what my next point is, do not be conformed to the world, seek to be like Christ.
[time=2938] You see, unfortunately, a lot of times today, we ask, how can I be as close to the world
[time=2945] but not like the world?
[time=2947] Rather than asking, how can I be more like Christ and not like the world?
[time=2953] I heard about this illustration and maybe I used it before, so forgive me if I have.
[time=2958] But there was this time in the U.S. when we didn't have cars.
[time=2964] So if you wanted to travel, you had to travel by a horse-drawn carriage.
[time=2969] And I heard about a man who was busy with his fields that he could not take his wife and children
[time=2976] to the city when they wanted to go.
[time=2979] So he decided to hire a carriage driver, a man to drive the carriage.
[time=2986] And he interviewed the top three candidates and he told them, look, this is my family, my wife and my children,
[time=2996] your job would be to take them to the city, into town and tell me, as you pass by that cliff,
[time=3008] how close can you get to the cliff and still keep my family safe?
[time=3014] And the first one, young and cocky, said, I can come this close to the edge without putting your family in danger.
[time=3023] Well, the second one, I was even more cocky and he said, I can come this close to the edge and your family will still be safe.
[time=3033] The last man came and said, well, if the question is about your family safety, my question for me is not how close I can get to the edge.
[time=3043] But how far can I go from the edge?
[time=3046] And came your family safe.
[time=3049] You see, when it comes to us being like the world, we're asking the wrong question.
[time=3054] We want to know how close can I be like the world?
[time=3057] And really, what God wants us, how close can I be to Christ?
[time=3061] And how can I be close to Christ?
[time=3063] That's the question.
[time=3065] We're sometimes asking the wrong question.
[time=3069] So as we go through life this week, my dear brothers and sisters, let's ask ourselves, how can I be more like Christ?
[time=3077] In the way I talk, in the way I act, in the way I think, not how can I be like the world, but how can I be like Christ?
[time=3088] And then, don't despise the Lord's anointed.
[time=3092] When God brings to you the new pastor, don't despise him, embrace him.
[time=3100] Serve God, don't serve him, serve God.
[time=3105] It is okay to interview, it is okay to vet, God has given you wisdom and wise people to do that, and you have to follow that.
[time=3114] But once you have that person, don't despise the Lord's anointed, rather know the peace of God.
[time=3124] See, Christian leaders act, worldly leaders react, Christian leaders have God's peace in their hearts, even when there's opposition.
[time=3136] And to have that peace is so, so important that you are doing the right thing.
[time=3144] The most important thing you can have in your life is peace, and that can only come if you have the prince of peace as your Lord and Savior.
[time=3151] The Apostle Paul writes about that in Ephesians 2, 14 through 16, talking about Jesus, Paul writes,
[time=3158] "For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing world of hostility by abolishing the law of commandments expressed in ordinances that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, so making peace.
[time=3175] And might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility."
[time=3183] Earlier, we sang about what Jesus did.
[time=3187] We sang, "You stood before my failure and carried the cross for my shame, my sin weighed upon your shoulders, my soul now to stand."
[time=3197] What's our response?
[time=3199] So what can I say and what can I do?
[time=3202] But offer this heart of God, 50%, completely to you.
[time=3211] That's the best thing we can do today, and that, in that way, you will experience the peace that passes all understanding.
[time=3218] I still remember when I first experienced that October 2, 1983, and I gave my life to Christ, I felt that peace that passes all understanding, and life has never been the same again.
[time=3231] If you don't have that peace, let me again just say it only comes through a correct relationship with God through Jesus Christ.
[time=3239] Make him your Lord and your Savior, and he will bring the Holy Spirit into your life, and he will give you this peace that passes all understanding.
[time=3249] At the end of the service, if you want to come and pray, there will be people here to pray with you in the foyer, I'll be in the prayer room, but don't go home without peace.
[time=3259] God wants you to have peace, and that's why he sent his son Jesus Christ into the world, so we can have not just eternal life and forgiveness as a sin, but also peace for today.
[time=3272] Let's pray.
[time=3273] Dear Father, we thank you for the way of orchestrated history in the past and how you can still orchestrate it today.
[time=3282] I pray they will forgive us for the times when we have despised the leadership you have put in place.
[time=3289] I pray that in place you put peace in our hearts.
[time=3294] I pray they will teach us to be obedient in the little things, in the mundane things of everyday life.
[time=3302] Whether we are looking for donkeys, or pushing paper, or teaching preschool, or dealing with numbers, or maybe we're the CEO of a big company, whatever we are.
[time=3315] Maybe we may be faithful in the little things.
[time=3318] Maybe we be humble, realizing that without you we are nothing.
[time=3323] Forgive us our pride, forgive us when we have despised people, and places, and things, and help us to be submissive to you, humble, obedient, to serve you not just today, but every day.
[time=3339] And for the Lord's anointed day you want to bring to Blackhawk, we again pray that you will bring him in your time.
[time=3347] And may we not despise your leadership, but accept it, and together may we work for the enlargement of the kingdom and the glory of your name.
[time=3359] In Christ's name I pray. Amen.
[time=3366] Let's stand with us, and let's sing.
[time=3376] We bow our hearts, we bend our knees, oh Spirit, come make us humble.
[time=3385] We rise from evil things, oh Lord we cast down our idols.
[time=3395] Give us clean hands, give us pure hearts, let us not lift our souls to another.
[time=3421] Oh God, let us be a generation that sees, who seeks your face, oh God of Jacob.
[time=3451] Jesus said, he who has the Son has eternal life, but he who does not have the Son of God, shall not see one, but the wrath of God invites you.
[time=3467] The wrath or peace of the world, God wants to give you peace, and the only times, if you accept Jesus Christ as you are, then save it.
[time=3476] And when you do that, the peace of God, the past is the longest ending comes into your life.
[time=3482] I remember what happened to me, I took a second line to me, when I gave my life to Christ.
[time=3488] I remember crying over my sins, but after that, feeling like grace that passes you will understand me.
[time=3495] If you want to give your life to Christ, you can do it in a lot of ways, but one way to do it is to ask you for what you want.
[time=3504] So if that's what you want, just say this prayer, to me, to Father.
[time=3510] Forgive me, to me in a second.
[time=3514] I regret of my sins, and I want to follow you.
[time=3518] I will be with the Holy Spirit, make Jesus Christ my oldest, and help me follow you over this.
[time=3527] In Jesus' name I pray.
[time=3531] If you make a decision, let us know.
[time=3535] We want to rejoice with you, and we want to provide you opportunities to grow in this relationship with God.
[time=3541] When you accept Christ, it's like being born.
[time=3544] Again, that's why the Bible is born.
[time=3547] It's like being a newborn baby, but you have to go.
[time=3550] You have to go by reading your Bible, by praying, by joining a community of believers and following Christ together.
[time=3558] I hope you do that today, and indeed you will have the Son of God, and you will have peace.
[time=3574] You
