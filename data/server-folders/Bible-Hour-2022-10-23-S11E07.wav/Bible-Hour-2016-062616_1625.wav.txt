[time=120] [APPLAUSE]
[time=130] >> Father, that's our prayer this morning.
[time=139] That we would be followers of you in every aspect of life.
[time=144] It's also our prayer this morning that you would come and dwell in this place today and inhabit our crazies.
[time=151] We pray this in Christ's name, amen.
[time=154] [MUSIC]
[time=156] >> I have decided I have resolved to wait upon control.
[time=166] [MUSIC]
[time=168] My rock and redeemer shouldn't be worn.
[time=173] I'll wait upon you Lord, as surely as the sun will rise.
[time=183] You'll come to us, certain as the dawn appears.
[time=191] You come, let your glory fall to respond to us.
[time=202] Spirit ray, blood into our thirsty hearts today.
[time=211] You'll come, you'll come, you'll come.
[time=220] [MUSIC - 168 seconds]
[time=418] >> We're so, so, so thankful for the chance to be here and to talk about what we do.
[time=432] We really love what God has us doing.
[time=434] We're sad that it's so far away from all of you, but we love.
[time=439] Hi, are we doing this together now?
[time=442] >> No, I- >> So this is my wife, Tanya.
[time=445] >> [APPLAUSE] >> Okay, and then up on the screen are our beautiful kids.
[time=453] And we love that it isn't just about my job and my ministry, but it's something that we do together, that the kids are a part of.
[time=461] And we're gonna tell you what that's like, just to brag on my kids a little bit.
[time=466] We made a tough decision to have them go into Polish school, where 100% of their classes are done in Polish.
[time=474] We live in Poland, by the way, and they're excelling now.
[time=479] And it's so fun to watch those little brains just adapt and mold and by God's grace.
[time=484] They're understanding what the teacher says and making really good grades and we're super proud of them, so those are our kids.
[time=491] Maya is ten, Maya is ten and about to go to fourth grade.
[time=496] The twins on the left are both going into third grade.
[time=501] And then Roman is still at home with us and he's three, so that's us.
[time=506] We didn't look like that a couple years ago, but we do now, and so that's us, okay, okay.
[time=512] So we served with Josiah Vincher, I'm gonna tell you a little bit about Josiah Vincher.
[time=517] And we served in Poland, and I was at the pool the other day.
[time=520] And a guy was like, Poland, like close to China, right?
[time=523] >> [LAUGH] >> No, and I didn't blame him because I really didn't know where Poland was a few years ago.
[time=530] So we're gonna play a little game.
[time=532] This is where Josiah Vincher serves, everything in orange.
[time=535] This is Europe, by the way, and we're gonna play a game where is Poland?
[time=540] Is it country number one, country number two, or country number three?
[time=546] So you have two seconds to decide and then choose with your finger which number you
[time=552] think it is, number one, number two, number three, and hold it up.
[time=556] Be confident because you might be right.
[time=559] The answer is, number one is Poland.
[time=562] We don't have a prize for you, other than the satisfaction of being smarter than the people around you.
[time=568] So that's Poland, and that's where we live in the city of Katowice.
[time=575] Katowice has 3 million people, and we serve there with one other missionary couple.
[time=582] Now there are more missionaries with other organizations, but that just gives you a little bit of a perspective of what we're jumping into.
[time=588] Poland has 38 million people, and less than 1% know and understand the gospel.
[time=594] So it is an amazingly important task that we have in front of us, and we love that we get to do it.
[time=599] Josiah Vincher has an amazing vision, and it isn't just for what we do in Poland, but it's for what we do in all 14 countries.
[time=605] And that is to see a movement of God return to this part of the world.
[time=611] We don't wanna have a program where Corbin and Tanya are the saviors.
[time=615] We don't wanna have really cool numbers and great funding and new buildings, but we wanna be ambassadors for Jesus that usher in a movement of God that just transforms this part of the world.
[time=630] A movement of God among the youth.
[time=631] We're targeting the next generation.
[time=635] And just like King Josiah was a young man, when he started following God, we wanna see young men and women in this part of the world begin to follow God and mature in him.
[time=644] It's a movement of God among the youth of Central and Eastern Europe.
[time=648] We work in post-communist countries, that big wall that was going on in Russia, invading everything, which they're trying to do again, that's awesome.
[time=656] Central and Eastern Europe, that's where we work.
[time=660] A movement of God in that part of the world that finds its home in the local church.
[time=664] Everything that we do as an organization is funneled through the local church.
[time=668] We try to find believers that already know the gospel and we empower them to reach their own neighbors and friends for Jesus.
[time=677] Not only do we want it to find its home in the local church, but we want it to transform society.
[time=681] We believe that as young men and women give their hearts to Jesus, they will grow up and they'll be salt and light in their neighborhoods that will just ripple across their country and the region.
[time=691] And we will see a totally different Central and Eastern Europe as God moves in and through these young Josiahs.
[time=698] So here's a little video that kind of says what I just told you.
[time=701] But videos are more interesting than me, so let's watch it together.
[time=728] [BLANK_AUDIO] Today, central East Asia, desperately needs and social societies.
[time=737] Young men and women who are brave and willing to be able to rise.
[time=741] [BLANK_AUDIO] God is called just side attention to the apartments.
[time=746] [BLANK_AUDIO] Every day we stay working as we share Jesus with young people through our English and
[time=754] games before the arts and sportsmen students.
[time=759] As we train students and leaders, raising up men and women who are committed to
[time=765] Christ and discipling others.
[time=768] As we partner with local churches, it's no help in reproducing communities and
[time=774] beliefs.
[time=775] [BLANK_AUDIO] God is changing lives, it is changing countries.
[time=782] It's happening now, but we know this is just the beginning.
[time=790] God is asking us to follow Him as He continues to bring hope and
[time=796] life to this generation.
[time=798] [MUSIC]
[time=806] Young Josiahs are waiting.
[time=809] [MUSIC]
[time=819] >> Sure, we can clap for what God's doing then.
[time=822] >> [APPLAUSE] >> And you have joined us by sending my family and me, by sending Josh Howard, supporting us as a church and as individuals.
[time=835] And we're really thankful for your investment in this part of the world.
[time=838] Specifically, we serve our church by helping them run a program called Fusion.
[time=845] And Fusion is so much fun.
[time=849] We take music and we go crazy and we rock out and we dance.
[time=855] And it's all in the name of building relationships with young people.
[time=859] So that we've earned the trust that we need to look him in the eye and say, Jesus loves you, can we talk about that?
[time=865] Because in this part of the world, there's so many relational barriers that you can't just go door to door and hand out tracks with success.
[time=873] You need to get into their lives.
[time=874] And this is a great tool to do that.
[time=876] Many people say one in the world is Fusion.
[time=878] It's not easy to describe, but this is just an idea.
[time=882] It is a music ministry.
[time=884] We do teach them songs about Jesus, but mainly we use songs that they already know and love, the songs that they hear.
[time=892] We use secular music that's not trashy in order to say, ooh, I want to come to rehearsal because I already kind of like that song and I want to try to play it on the drums or sing it.
[time=902] 80% of the teenagers in a Fusion choir do not know Jesus or believe something different
[time=908] about Jesus.
[time=909] We serve in a really Catholic country and some of the teenagers' ideas about God are really skewed and mixed up.
[time=915] They don't know the difference between the Bible and tradition.
[time=919] Tradition is also about relationships.
[time=922] Relationships drive everything we do because we want to build that trust that I talked about earlier.
[time=928] So we let people try new things.
[time=930] We have conversations with them outside of rehearsal and it's a really fun relational experience.
[time=936] But it's also deep and thought-provoking.
[time=938] Every rehearsal, we open the Bible and we talk about truth.
[time=941] We talk about values.
[time=944] And then we also invite them to Bible studies and we invite them to be a part of our local church.
[time=949] And I'll say it again.
[time=950] Fusion is a part of the local church.
[time=953] Everybody on our Fusion leadership team is a member of our church and so as the teenagers get to know the leaders, they're also getting to know people that have the Holy Spirit in their hearts and are members of our church.
[time=965] So that's what Fusion is, but Fusion is also people and I wanted to show you some faces of the young Josiahs we're spending time with.
[time=973] This is Sonia and if we had an hour, I could tell you so much about this sweet girl's life and how she's just given her heart to Jesus and she's been transformed mostly through a strong relationship with my wife.
[time=986] Sonia shared the Gospel with her and she said, "I don't think so.
[time=990] I'm not interested.
[time=991] If there is a God, I don't like him." And through the course of a year, they continue to talk about it.
[time=996] And a year later, she said, "I want your God to be my God." And she became a Christian and she's growing and changing and she's coming to camp with us next week and she's inviting her non-Christian friends.
[time=1006] And it's like, "This is exactly what we want to see happening.
[time=1011] I won't show you the pictures of the people that are doing things.
[time=1013] We don't want to see happening, but that's whatever." Okay, but this is something to celebrate.
[time=1017] This is a guy named Sebastian, we call him Saba, and he's a young Christian who is learning how to fish for men.
[time=1025] You know, like he's trying to share the Gospel with other people and today, he's in Bulgaria.
[time=1030] He's a Polish guy, but we send him out on this international internship with Fusion and he's going to be serving in Bulgaria, Estonia, Ukraine, and Czech Republic all summer long,
[time=1040] telling other people outside of his country what it's like to be a follower of Jesus and we love that about Sebastian.
[time=1047] This is Amilka.
[time=1048] She's a member of our church and on the leadership team and God took her through a really scary life transition where she lost a job and now she's actually raising support in Poland and serving with us part-time to help advance Fusion, not just in our church, but we want
[time=1064] to see it in other churches in Poland and we love that about Amilka, or you could call it Emily, if Amilka seems weird.
[time=1071] The other thing I want to tell you about is summer camp.
[time=1075] We do Fusion all year long, but in the summer, we have a week together at a camp and it is
[time=1082] musically enriching and spiritually exciting and we actually run this camp with partners
[time=1090] from the states and I love it that for the last year's camp and this year's camp, a team from my church is coming to help us run my camp.
[time=1120] In the middle of the storms of this life I won't turn back, I know you are near.
[time=1129] And I will fear no evil for my God is with me, if my God is with me.
[time=1147] Boom then, shall I fear, boom then, shall I fear, boom then, shall I fear.
[time=1154] Oh no, never let go through that coming through the storm.
[time=1160] Oh no, never let go every night, every low.
[time=1166] Oh no, never let go before, never let go of me.
[time=1177] I can see the light that is coming for the heart that holds on, but glorious like the
[time=1185] young ball can pair.
[time=1187] And there will be men, choose troubles, but until that day comes, we'll live to know you
[time=1196] here on the earth.
[time=1199] And I will fear no evil for my God is with me, if my God is with me.
[time=1216] Boom then, shall I fear, boom then, shall I fear, boom then, shall I fear.
[time=1223] Oh no, never let go through that coming through the storm.
[time=1230] Oh no, never let go every night, every low.
[time=1236] Oh no, never let go before, never let go of me.
[time=1244] Oh no, never let go through that coming through the storm.
[time=1252] Oh no, never let go, every high, every low.
[time=1259] Oh no, never let go before, never let go of me.
[time=1266] I can see the light that is coming for the heart that holds on, and there will be men,
[time=1277] choose troubles, but until that day comes.
[time=1281] Still I will praise you, still I will praise you.
[time=1292] See it again, see your light, see your light that is coming for the heart that holds on,
[time=1300] and there will be men, choose troubles, but until that day comes.
[time=1307] Still I will praise you, still I will praise you.
[time=1317] See it again, oh no, never let go through the coming through the storm.
[time=1324] Oh no, never let go, every high, every low.
[time=1331] Oh you never let go, oh you never let go of me.
[time=1341] Oh no, never let go through that coming through the storm.
[time=1348] Oh no, never let go, every high, every low.
[time=1354] Never let go, oh you never let go of me.
[time=1362] Oh you never let go of me.
[time=1379] Saul lived for one year and then became king, and what he had rained for two years over Israel.
[time=1386] Saul chose 3,000 men of Israel, 2,000 were with Saul in McMache and the hill country of Bethel,
[time=1393] and 1,000 were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin.
[time=1398] The rest of the people he sent home, every man to his tent.
[time=1402] Jonathan defeated the garrison of the Philistines that was at Gaba, and the Philistines heard of it,
[time=1408] and Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land saying, "Let the Hebrews hear." And all Israel heard it said that Saul had defeated the garrison of the Philistines,
[time=1419] and also that Israel had become a stench to the Philistines.
[time=1423] And the people were called out to join Saul at Gilgal.
[time=1427] And the Philistines mustered to fight with Israel, 30,000 chariots and 6,000 horsemen
[time=1433] and troops like the sand on the seashore and multitude.
[time=1437] They came up and encamped at McMache to the east of Bethaven.
[time=1442] When the men of Israel saw that they were in trouble, for the people were hard pressed, the people hid themselves in caves and in holes and in rocks and in tombs and in cisterns.
[time=1454] And some Hebrews crossed the fords of the Jordan to the land of Gad and to Gilead.
[time=1460] Saul was still at Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
[time=1466] But at seven days, the time appointed by Samuel.
[time=1470] But Samuel did not come to him.
[time=1472] So Saul said, "Bring the burnt offering here to me and the peace offerings." And he offered the burnt offering.
[time=1481] As soon as he had finished offering, the burnt offering, behold Samuel came and Saul went out to meet him and greet him.
[time=1489] Samuel said, "What have you done?" And Saul said, "Well, when I saw the people were scattering from me and that you did not come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines had mustered at McMache, I said, now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the favor of the Lord."
[time=1512] So I forced myself and I offered the burnt offering.
[time=1517] And Samuel said to Saul, "You have done foolishly.
[time=1521] You have not kept the command of the Lord your God, with which he commanded you.
[time=1526] For then the Lord would have established your kingdom over Israel forever.
[time=1531] But now your kingdom shall not continue.
[time=1535] The Lord has sought out a man after his own heart, and the Lord has commanded him to be prince over his people, because you have not kept what the Lord commanded you."
[time=1549] Good morning.
[time=1551] Please open your Bibles to 1 Samuel chapter 13.
[time=1556] If you're using the Pew Bible, it's page 134, and Happy Father's Day to all the fathers.
[time=1562] For those of you Spanish-speaking Feliz Día del Padre.
[time=1568] And then Ada.
[time=1570] And Ada, my friend from Colombia.
[time=1574] Please pray for us.
[time=1576] I'm also going to be leaving for Israel this week, the group of students, and a group actually of family members from Blackhawk.
[time=1585] We are family.
[time=1587] So pray for us as we go and as we return.
[time=1592] But this morning I want to talk about Saul.
[time=1596] Remember we started last week to see how God selected hand-picked Saul to be the king.
[time=1603] But unfortunately, Saul only started out well.
[time=1608] He did not finish out well.
[time=1611] I remember the day Frank Sinatra died because all the radio stations and all the TV programs sang his signature song.
[time=1622] And now the end is near, and so I face the final curtain.
[time=1627] Don't worry, I won't be singing it there.
[time=1629] I know you're scared.
[time=1631] I'll be singing it.
[time=1633] I'll state my case of which I'm certain I've lived a life that's full.
[time=1637] I've traveled each and every highway but more, much more than this.
[time=1641] I did it.
[time=1643] Oh, you guys know that song.
[time=1648] The question is, which way are we doing things?
[time=1652] Our way or God's way?
[time=1655] You see, we have a choice every day.
[time=1657] Are we going to live God's way or are we going to do things my way?
[time=1663] Unfortunately, Saul chose to live his way.
[time=1668] Which way was that?
[time=1670] First of all, the Bible says that his way was the way of deception,
[time=1676] the passage that Tanya read here, verses 3 and 4.
[time=1681] Notice it says very clearly that Jonathan defeated the garrison of the Philistines,
[time=1688] but when the announcement was made, who actually won the battle, it said what?
[time=1694] All the Israel heard that Saul had defeated the garrison of the Philistines.
[time=1700] You must say that's a minor detail.
[time=1702] No, it's not.
[time=1704] Insecure leaders lie.
[time=1707] Godly leaders tell the truth.
[time=1710] God's way is always to tell the truth.
[time=1714] Man's way is to deceive and to lie.
[time=1718] God's way is telling the truth.
[time=1721] We have this throughout Scripture.
[time=1724] Ephesians 4.25 is one of those verses.
[time=1727] Therefore, having put away false knowledge, it let each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor for we are members of one another.
[time=1736] Psalm 15, "Lord, who may dwell in your sanctuary?" David asks.
[time=1742] "Who may live on your holy hill?" And the answer comes.
[time=1746] He who's walk is blameless and who does what is righteous, who speaks the truth from his heart and has no slander on his tongue.
[time=1759] Colossians 3.9, "Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your own self with his practices."
[time=1767] And the way of truth needs to be our way everywhere we go, not just at church, in our family, at school, at work, wherever we go.
[time=1778] Insecure leaders lie. Godly leaders tell the truth.
[time=1784] What was Sol's way? Sol's way was also the way of impatience.
[time=1789] You see, insecure leaders are impatient, starting in verse 7.
[time=1795] You have that scene where Sol is supposed to wait for Samuel to bring the burnt offering,
[time=1802] but he doesn't want to wait. He doesn't want to wait.
[time=1805] Sol says in verse 9, "Bring the offering, the burnt offering here to me and the peace offerings, and he offered the burnt offering." Again, you might say, "What's the big deal?" The big deal is that that was reserved for the priest to do, and especially for the high priest.
[time=1822] It's not your job. Have you met leaders that they can do everything?
[time=1827] They know about everything. They can do everything. They don't delegate.
[time=1830] They don't ask anybody. That is foolish.
[time=1834] Insecure leaders will be impatient and will do things their way and not God's way.
[time=1842] Notice, please, the judgment. The judgment that God says through Samuel.
[time=1851] You have not kept the command of the Lord your God.
[time=1858] See, it doesn't say you haven't kept Samuel's word. You have not kept the command of the Lord your God,
[time=1865] which he commanded you. For then the Lord would have established your kingdom over Israel, but now your kingdom shall not continue. The Lord has sought out a man after his own heart.
[time=1875] And the Lord has commanded him to be priests over his people because you have not kept the Lord.
[time=1881] What the Lord commanded you.
[time=1885] It doesn't seem here that soul sin was a sin of arrogance or ignorance.
[time=1890] It's simply the sin of impatience, but that's still a sin.
[time=1896] Because it says here very clearly, you did not do as the Lord commanded you.
[time=1904] Do we have examples of people in Scripture that were impatient and went ahead and now waited for God?
[time=1914] The truth is that is the case. Abraham, did not want to wait for God's promise.
[time=1923] So he went ahead and had Ishmael through Hagar.
[time=1927] Was that a problem? It's still a problem today.
[time=1931] Still 4,000 years later, the tension between the Israelis and the Palestinians are still there.
[time=1939] It's still there because one man could not wait on God for the fulfillment of his promise.
[time=1945] God's way, my dear brothers and sisters, is what we're saying is waiting on him,
[time=1951] even if he takes a long way, Psalm 37, 34, wait for the Lord and do what?
[time=1959] Keep his way. See, those things go together.
[time=1962] It's what we established a couple of weeks ago that we have to walk in the way of mundane obedience.
[time=1968] Be faithful in the little things, wait for the Lord and keep his way, and he will exalt you to inherit the land.
[time=1976] You will look on when the wicked are cut off.
[time=1979] See, waiting on the Lord is not laziness.
[time=1982] As G. Kemper Morgan said, waiting for the God is not laziness.
[time=1988] Waiting for God is not going to sleep.
[time=1990] Waiting for God is not the abandonment of effort.
[time=1993] Waiting for God means first activity under command.
[time=1997] See, wait for the Lord and keep his way.
[time=2001] Second readiness for any new command that made come.
[time=2004] Third, the ability to do nothing until that command is given.
[time=2007] That's why we sang, "We'll go wherever you send me."
[time=2013] Where you go, I'll go.
[time=2015] Whether it is Poland, where it's Israel, wherever it is, I'll go.
[time=2021] Insecure leaders, my dear brothers and sisters, are impatient.
[time=2026] Godly leaders, wait on God.
[time=2028] We learn this in seminary.
[time=2029] We teach students when you go to a new church.
[time=2032] Don't make any changes in your first or second year of ministry.
[time=2036] Wait, learn the people.
[time=2040] See who they are.
[time=2042] Learn about them, love them, and then you can make changes.
[time=2049] Sol's way was not just impatience as we saw.
[time=2054] It was not just deception.
[time=2056] It was always also pride.
[time=2058] This is a lesser-known passage.
[time=2061] Actually, as I was reading it, I kind of forgot about it.
[time=2066] This is a passage in 1 Samuel 14 that shows us that insecure leaders are proud.
[time=2074] Sol's way here was pride.
[time=2076] Now, I'm not going to read the whole chapter, but basically what happens is Sol and his son Jonathan are leading the army of Israel and against the Philistines.
[time=2088] And Sol does a silly thing, or we would say a foolish thing.
[time=2094] And I want us to see here that he's pride is seen in the fact that he's not asking God for counsel.
[time=2101] He's pride is seen in the fact that he's not asking someone else for counsel.
[time=2105] He just makes a decision himself, and this decision is his.
[time=2111] I hear in verse 24 of chapter 14, "Cursed be the man who eats food until it is evening, and I am avenged on my enemies."
[time=2119] Now, some of you have been at war, physical war.
[time=2124] You've been in either in Afghanistan or somewhere and fought.
[time=2131] That's hard to fight a war is hard, but to fight a war on an empty stomach, I would assume it's even harder.
[time=2140] So Sol makes this foolish decision and says, "Cursed be everybody who will eat." Basically, until we win the battle.
[time=2148] Now, again, some people might say, "Well, he's over-spiritualized, and this is actually a good thing."
[time=2155] No, it's not a good thing.
[time=2157] And the problem here is not just that, but the problem is that Jonathan is not with them when that happens, and Jonathan eats honey.
[time=2166] And then, so basically, Jonathan just signed his death warrant, right?
[time=2171] And so here's about this.
[time=2173] And so instead of Sol saying, "Hey, I made a mistake, okay, I spoke foolishly, I spoke rashly."
[time=2181] He doesn't do that.
[time=2182] He says, "What? Jonathan must die." Wow.
[time=2187] You shall surely die, Jonathan.
[time=2191] My dear brothers and sisters, foolish leaders are proud.
[time=2196] Not only that they make rash decisions without asking anybody else, but they are proud that when they see that they've done something wrong, they don't fix it.
[time=2205] So it doesn't come and says, "Look, I was wrong." Or, "Hey, Jonathan didn't know about this, we'll forgive him, right?" No, he is, Jonathan must die.
[time=2215] What?
[time=2217] Your own son, the one who actually won the victory over the Philistines, he must die because why?
[time=2224] Because you have made a foolish, rash vow.
[time=2229] My dear brothers and sisters, foolish leaders are always proud.
[time=2234] But that's not what God wants.
[time=2237] God wants humble leaders.
[time=2239] God's way is the way of humility.
[time=2244] James 4-10, "Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you."
[time=2251] 1 Peter 5, 5 and 6.
[time=2254] Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the elders.
[time=2258] Close yourselves all with you, all of you, with humility toward one another.
[time=2263] For God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.
[time=2268] "Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, so that at the proper time he may exalt you."
[time=2277] Someone said, "Pride is the only sin that stings in the nostrils of everybody else, except the one who has it."
[time=2286] And yet God uses humble leaders.
[time=2291] I read about George Whitfield.
[time=2294] George Whitfield and John Wesley didn't always agree on everything.
[time=2298] Actually, they kind of disagreed, sometimes even on theological matters.
[time=2304] But George Whitfield and John Wesley were careful about not to go into public with their disagreements.
[time=2312] When someone asked Whitfield if he thought he would see Wesley in heaven, this is how he replied.
[time=2320] He said, "I fear not, for he will be so near the eternal throne, and we, such at a distance, we shall hardly get sight of him."
[time=2333] That's humility.
[time=2335] When you disagree with someone, I say, "When you get to heaven, he'll be so close to the throne."
[time=2341] And I'll be so far away that we probably won't see each other.
[time=2345] That's probably not theologically accurate, because the Bible says that we will all know each other in heaven.
[time=2354] But the idea of humility is here that even though they disagreed, Godly leaders are humble.
[time=2364] Insecure leaders are proud.
[time=2367] They don't ask God.
[time=2369] They don't ask other people.
[time=2371] They don't ask the elders, like it says here, and I'm not going to be elders as a group of leaders.
[time=2377] I'm talking about the elders, people who are actually elderly, that they've been through life.
[time=2382] They've been where you are.
[time=2384] If you are young, if you are young couple especially, go talk to an older couple.
[time=2388] They've been married for 40, 50, 60 years and asked them about marriage.
[time=2394] You think they can teach you something about it?
[time=2397] Yeah, the worst thing you can do is to think, "I know it all." The worst thing you can do is to sing, "I did it my way."
[time=2408] My way is actually, unfortunately, the failure way, because Saul failed.
[time=2417] His way was pride, God's way is humility.
[time=2420] Saul's way was also disobedience.
[time=2423] In chapter 15, we learn that insecure leaders are disobedient.
[time=2429] If he disobeys God in chapter 13, he disobeys again in chapter 15.
[time=2435] Look with me, please, in chapter 15, starting in verse 7.
[time=2439] Another episode in Saul's life.
[time=2442] Saul defeated the Amalekites from Havelai as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt.
[time=2447] And he took Agag, the king of the Amalekites, alive and devoted to destruction.
[time=2452] All the people who the age of the sword, but Saul and the people, spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fattened calves, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy all that was despised or worthless, they devoted to destruction.
[time=2470] And look at the end result in verses 10 and 11.
[time=2473] The word of the Lord came to Samuel.
[time=2475] Just like he came before, you have the judgment of the disobedience.
[time=2480] The word of the Lord came to Samuel.
[time=2482] I regret that I have made Saul king.
[time=2486] For he has turned back from following me and has not performed my commandments.
[time=2494] And Samuel was angry, and he cried to the Lord all night.
[time=2499] Did you catch that?
[time=2502] Samuel was angry and cried to the Lord.
[time=2505] But unfortunately, while we see in Saul we don't see repentance.
[time=2510] Saul is not only disobedient, but unrepentant when he is confronted with his sin.
[time=2517] Look in verses 19 and 20, he blames someone else.
[time=2522] Why then did you not obey the voice of the Lord?
[time=2525] Why did you pounce on the spoil and do I was even in the sight of the Lord?
[time=2529] And Saul said to Samuel, "I have obeyed the voice of the Lord." Well, lie number two, three, four, five, six.
[time=2538] I don't know, you count.
[time=2540] "I have gone on the mission on which the Lord sent me.
[time=2543] I have wrought a gag or a gag, the king of Amalek, and I have devoted amalekized to destruction."
[time=2550] Verse 21, "But the people," have you heard people like that before?
[time=2555] It's only someone else's fault, right?
[time=2557] It's always someone else's fault.
[time=2560] And the people took the spoil, sheep and oxen, and the best of the things devoted to destruction to sacrifice to the Lord your God in Gilgal.
[time=2568] Insecure leaders never take responsibility for their sin.
[time=2576] Godly leaders obey and take responsibility.
[time=2582] You see, God's way is obedience, and this is the main point of these three chapters.
[time=2589] Starting in verse 22, God's way is the way of mundane obedience.
[time=2597] And Samuel said, "Has the Lord, as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices,
[time=2603] as in obeying the voice of the Lord, behold, to obey is better than sacrifice,
[time=2611] and to listen than the fat of rams.
[time=2615] For rebellion is as the sin of divination, and presumption is as iniquity and idolatry.
[time=2623] Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, he has rejected you from being king."
[time=2632] I'm going to ask you this question.
[time=2634] How long did it go from the time when God elected God, sold to be king, until God said, "I have rejected you"?
[time=2643] Well, go back to chapter 13, verse 1.
[time=2646] Now, in the Pew Bibles, apparently, whoever did this particular translation
[time=2652] resolved the text-critical problem that's there, but I want to address it.
[time=2656] In most Bibles, you should have something like this.
[time=2660] In chapter 13, verse 1, in my version of the ESV says this, "Sold was, dah, dah, dah, years old when he began to reign, and he reigned dah, dah, dah, and two years over Israel."
[time=2676] That's what we call a text-critical problem, meaning the original text from which
[time=2682] we have the other versions and translations and copies was corrupt in some way,
[time=2689] and we couldn't tell what numbers were there.
[time=2692] So, we actually don't know exactly after how many years Saul was rejected by God.
[time=2701] But we know that there's a number two there.
[time=2706] So, when we do the math, we know that Saul actually reigned about 40 years in Israel.
[time=2713] We know that.
[time=2715] Because after 40 years, David reigns for 40 years, and then Solomon reigns for 40 years,
[time=2721] so we can put those together and we know Saul reigned about 40 years.
[time=2726] So, it seems that if these numbers are correct and they are, but we don't know the dah, dah, dah, dah there, but it could be that God rejected Saul after two years on the throne.
[time=2743] So, how long did God still allow Saul to be on the throne?
[time=2747] 38, think about that.
[time=2750] Can God elect a leader and say after two years I have rejected you,
[time=2758] I'm still going to allow you to be on the throne for 38, which he did.
[time=2762] Can God do that?
[time=2764] Yeah.
[time=2765] Why?
[time=2766] We don't know.
[time=2767] Well, we don't know for sure that during this time, God was preparing whom?
[time=2771] David.
[time=2773] The one that God calls the man after my own heart.
[time=2779] When you look at Saul's sins, and when you look at David's sins, I would say from a human perspective, David's sins were much greater.
[time=2789] Adultery, murder, or lying was an everyday occurrence.
[time=2795] So, how come when you read in history, David is still remembered as a man after God's own heart, but Saul is not?
[time=2807] God never says of David, "I have rejected you." What happens?
[time=2812] What's the difference?
[time=2814] I think the difference is here.
[time=2816] Saul was never as repentant as David.
[time=2821] If you read carefully, David in Psalm 51 shows us how truly he repented and God, even though David suffered the consequences of his sins,
[time=2832] God was never rejected from being king.
[time=2836] But Saul was.
[time=2838] I would argue that it's because Saul was unrepentant.
[time=2845] My dear brothers and sisters, we always have a choice.
[time=2849] We're going to do things God's way, or we're going to do things our way.
[time=2853] Saul chose to do things his way, which was the way of deception, which was the way of impatience, the way of pride and the way of disobedience.
[time=2866] But God wants us to do things his way, whether as a leader, since his father's day, as a father, or just as a follower of Jesus Christ.
[time=2878] Jesus Christ, we are called to live as God wants us to live, to tell the truth, to wait on him, to be humble, and to be obedient.
[time=2894] Thomas Akampis says this, instant obedience is the only kind of obedience there is.
[time=2902] Delayed obedience is disobedience.
[time=2906] Whoever strives to withdraw from obedience withdraws from grace.
[time=2913] So who is our example of humility and obedience?
[time=2917] Well, we have one in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2922] In your bulletins, I put this passage, part of this passage from Philippians 2, there in its entirety.
[time=2930] Because our example of humility and obedience is not David, it's not Saul, it's not Samuel, it's not Solomon, we'll see later, our example is Jesus Christ.
[time=2943] Have this mind among yourselves, Paul writes to the church of Philippi, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, something like this.
[time=2956] Jesus is going to say, "I'm going to take this because it's mine." That's what this means.
[time=2962] He did not count equality with a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself by taking the form of a servant, being born in likeness of men, and being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on the cross.
[time=2984] You see how humility and obedience go together?
[time=2987] Pride and disobedience also go together.
[time=2990] So we have a choice.
[time=2992] We have a choice in life how we're going to live our lives.
[time=2997] And as we think about applying the truth, that's what we need to establish this morning.
[time=3004] Are we going to do things God's way, or are we going to do it our way?
[time=3010] First of all, be patient and wait on the Lord.
[time=3014] Maybe you've been praying about something that God will open some doors for you.
[time=3021] Maybe it's a job, maybe you don't know exactly what's cool to go to.
[time=3025] Pray and wait on him.
[time=3029] Sometimes we pray and we wait and we want the answer to come tomorrow, or in two minutes or in five minutes.
[time=3036] But, you know, if you look in the Bible, sometimes the answer comes a lot later.
[time=3042] Just be patient and wait on the Lord.
[time=3045] And while you do that, be humble and ask God for wisdom.
[time=3050] Ask people who are around you for counsel.
[time=3056] Don't be like soul who says, "Oh, everybody's going to die, they eat." Oh, Jonathan ate, let him die.
[time=3062] Don't be like that.
[time=3064] It's not your way or the highway.
[time=3067] Think about first, what would God say?
[time=3070] And if that's not clear in Scripture, what would my parents say?
[time=3074] What a concept.
[time=3077] How about what would my grandparents say?
[time=3080] People that have been there before.
[time=3083] Talking to you young people now.
[time=3086] You know, where you are today, your parents have been.
[time=3089] But what your parents are, you haven't been.
[time=3092] That's why it's very, very wise for you to ask counsel for people who went before you.
[time=3100] You want to go on the mission field?
[time=3103] Ask missionaries.
[time=3105] Ask those who have been and done that.
[time=3109] Ask.
[time=3111] Humble yourself.
[time=3112] Realize that you don't have all the answers.
[time=3115] And no, yes, you're 16 and you don't know everything.
[time=3120] One of the worst things we can have at seminaries is people who come and they start the preaching class and they already know how to preach.
[time=3129] It's one of the worst things to see.
[time=3133] Humble yourself and ask God for wisdom.
[time=3137] Surround yourself with godly people when you ask counsel and lastly, but most importantly, be obedient and trust in him.
[time=3147] That mundane obedience, you know, being faithful in the little things might sound boring to you.
[time=3156] And I'm telling you, sometimes it can't seem boring because you're just doing what God wants you to do.
[time=3162] But you know what?
[time=3163] It's really the thing that God wants for you to do.
[time=3166] That's why it's called mundane obedience.
[time=3170] It's called mundane obedience.
[time=3174] Insecure people, my dear brothers and sisters, do it their way.
[time=3179] Godly people, do it God's way.
[time=3182] I'm reminded of the great hymn, "Trust and obey, for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus but to trust and obey."
[time=3197] Not good. That's why I love the whole hymns. They give us good, good, timeless truth.
[time=3207] Let's pray, dear father, forgive us for the many times when maybe not out loud, but in our hearts we sang, "I did it my way."
[time=3219] Forgive us for the times when we did damage to the church or our families or our places of employment because we did it our way.
[time=3230] I pray that you will teach us what I mean is to live in the way of mundane obedience day to day, to speak the truth, to wait on you, to humble ourselves and to obey you even when it's the little things.
[time=3248] Teach us what it means to obey in the little things and in the big things, but to follow you nonetheless, and every day to trust and obey, teaches that there really is no other way.
[time=3263] In Christ's name I pray. Amen.
[time=3278] When we walk with the Lord in the light of His birth, what a glory He sheds on our way.
[time=3295] And while we do His forth will, He abides with us still, and with all who will trust and obey.
[time=3311] Trust and obey, for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.
[time=3333] Not a burden we bear, not a sorrow we share, but our joy leadeth which we repay.
[time=3350] Not a grief nor a loss, not a flounder or a cross, but His plastic we trust and obey.
[time=3365] Trust and obey, for there's no other way to be happy.
[time=3376] Jesus, come to trust and obey.
[time=3382] Please help me to trust and obey.
[time=3389] Lord, I love you.
[time=3391] Please help me to trust and obey.
[time=3402] Let Him fill all ships deep.
[time=3406] We will sit at His feet, or we'll walk by His side in the way.
[time=3419] What He says we will do, where He says we will go.
[time=3427] Never fear or need trust and obey.
[time=3433] Trust and obey, for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.
[time=3466] Lord, I love you.
[time=3469] Please help me to trust and obey.
[time=3474] Lord, I love you.
[time=3476] Please help me to trust and obey.
[time=3482] Lord, I love you.
[time=3484] Please help me to trust and obey.
[time=3500] Good morning and thank you for watching the Bible Hour.
[time=3503] This morning we talked about obedience.
[time=3507] Whether we do it God's way or we do it our way, Saul chose to do it his way.
[time=3514] And his way was the way of lying, the way of disobedience, and the way of pride.
[time=3521] But God's way for us is to obey Him no matter what.
[time=3526] His way is to tell the truth no matter what.
[time=3530] And his truth is for us to be humble.
[time=3533] But our example should not be Saul or any other leader.
[time=3537] Our example is Jesus Christ.
[time=3541] As Paul says in Philippians that even though Jesus was God, He humbled Himself to the point of death, even death on the cross.
[time=3550] And that's the answer for us.
[time=3552] Jesus, to be our Lord and Savior.
[time=3555] If Jesus Christ is now your Lord and Savior or now your example, maybe today is the day of salvation.
[time=3561] Surrender your life to Jesus Christ and choose to live God's way.
