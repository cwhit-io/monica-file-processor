[time=0] You
[time=30] [MUSIC - 266 seconds]
[time=300] The Lord said to Samuel, how long will you grieve over Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel?
[time=308] Fill your horn with oil and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for myself a king among his sons.
[time=316] When they came, he looked on Eliaab and thought, surely the Lord's anointed is before him, but the Lord said to Samuel,
[time=324] do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature because I have rejected him.
[time=329] For the Lord sees not as a man sees, man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.
[time=337] Then Samuel said to Jesse, are all your sons here?
[time=341] And he said, "There remains yet the youngest, but behold he is keeping the sheep." And Samuel said to Jesse, "Send and get him, for we will not sit till he comes."
[time=352] And he sent and brought him in.
[time=355] Now he was ready and had a beautiful eyes and was handsome, and the Lord said, arise, anoint him, for this is he.
[time=363] Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers, and the spirit of the Lord rushed upon David from that day forward.
[time=371] Now the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and a harmful spirit from the Lord tormented him.
[time=376] And Saul's servant said to him, behold now, a harmful spirit from God is tormenting you.
[time=384] Let our Lord now command your servants who are before you to seek out a man who is skillful in playing the liar.
[time=390] And when the harmful spirit from God is upon you, he will play it, and you will be well.
[time=396] Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse.
[time=399] And said, send me David your son who is with the sheep.
[time=403] Jesse took a donkey laden with bread and a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them by David to us all.
[time=411] And David came to Saul and entered his service, and Saul loved him greatly, and he became his armor bearer.
[time=418] And the Philistines stood on the mountain on one side, and Israel on the mountain on the other side, and a valley between them.
[time=425] And there came out from the camp of the Philistines, a champion named Goliath of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
[time=433] He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, why have you come out to draw up for battle?
[time=439] Am I not a Philistine and are you not servants of Saul?
[time=442] Choose a man for yourselves and let him come down to me.
[time=445] If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants.
[time=449] But if I prevail against him and kill him, you shall be our servants and serve us.
[time=455] And the Philistines said, I defy the ranks of Israel this day.
[time=459] Give a man that we may fight together, and all of Israel heard these words of the Philistines, and they were dismayed and greatly afraid.
[time=467] Good morning.
[time=473] Well, welcome to Blackhawk. Welcome to Sunday.
[time=478] I'm Rick Raber, one of the elders here, and we're really thankful.
[time=483] Whether you're watching Vila Bible Hour or the live stream, we're just really thankful that you're here with us.
[time=489] Since September of 1969, Blackhawk, as a family, has met to faithfully have the word of God opened and proclaimed.
[time=504] Unashamedly, the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and that's why we're here.
[time=510] We're going to do that today.
[time=513] The gospel of Jesus Christ for the forgiving of sin.
[time=516] Today actually won't be any different that way.
[time=519] Well, actually it will be different.
[time=522] Back then, you would have come to this building and heard this guy preach, David Jeremiah.
[time=534] Today, you came to this building, and you can all tell I'm not David Jeremiah, in more ways than one.
[time=545] Back then, a dab was something that some of you in this room recognize, called Brill Cream.
[time=558] A little dab of doo-doo-doo, you'll be so debonair, the girls will want to come and chase you down.
[time=566] Today, some of these guys down here in this corner recognize that a dab has nothing to do with something that's put in your hair,
[time=576] and it's a celebration and a, you know, it's that concept of a change.
[time=585] There's a difference.
[time=589] Time can certainly change some things in the way people see them.
[time=592] We're talking about seeing and perception.
[time=595] Many things other than time can affect how we see things in the way we were raised, and the way that our parents did things.
[time=603] There's a perception, and there's things that happen that we learn from our parents, and there's things like this that occur,
[time=615] where children are influenced to stick a bumper plate during youth group of 212.
[time=622] There's two families here this morning that I am so thankful that the battle between Michigan and Ohio State is way bigger
[time=632] has something way bigger than that battle.
[time=637] See our friends, the Delaware Gringes, and our friends, the flaggies, and a bunch of others, they happen to like those nuts from over across the line.
[time=649] Their abers don't, and that's not a surprise to you.
[time=653] But it's about perspective that's greater than things like that, and that we can have things.
[time=659] This is actually still in our house.
[time=661] People have said, "Why in the world do you still have that thing in your house?" Because it reminds me of my kindred spirit with Mark Flakey, and Zach's kindred spirit with Jordan Delagrange.
[time=674] It's way bigger, folks.
[time=677] It's way bigger, perspective matters.
[time=680] Forget guys in the real cream.
[time=682] The women in this room right now, some of you don't have a problem at all with the gray hair.
[time=690] Show one in your face, show one on your head, and others have a whore of the thought that a gray would ever show.
[time=698] Anyone right or wrong?
[time=700] Nah, but it's a perspective.
[time=704] Sometimes we see another person's face, and it can lead to misconceptions.
[time=710] Sophie.
[time=712] Sophie, one of Zach's friends, was at the house towards the end of the school year,
[time=718] and somehow it came up the fact that Dad preaches once in a while at a Baptist church.
[time=725] Sophie's not Baptist.
[time=727] And so Sophie's perception of a Baptist minister is this, and...
[time=736] (Laughter) Well, that's not what you're going to get this morning.
[time=745] Some of my colleagues at work, when we were talking about these misconceptions about faith this week,
[time=753] he shared with me something that came up for him.
[time=756] He said, "You know, if you live out your life in a way that has the Catholics think in your Baptist,
[time=763] and the Baptist think in your Catholics, you're probably a Lutheran." (Laughter) What does that look like?
[time=774] Well, these are just a couple of the reasons.
[time=776] There are a few of the reasons that we can't go from a perspective of who your favorite team is,
[time=782] or what season of the year it is that we can't go about whether it's 1969 or 2016.
[time=794] We have to go back to the unchanging Word of God.
[time=800] That's the same one that David Jeremiah stood up and proclaimed almost 50 years ago.
[time=808] This Word, we believe it.
[time=811] We believe it's literal.
[time=812] We believe it's to be taken and read.
[time=814] We believe that it's applicable to life.
[time=817] It matters.
[time=819] So in the same way that we've done for nearly six decades.
[time=823] We've touched six decades from the sixties through 2016.
[time=829] Today, we're going to use this Word as the source of truth and the foundation to lead us to a great reminder
[time=837] that a view that's anything different than a biblical worldview leads you to a really dangerous spot.
[time=845] We believe all of that, that the Bible is authored by men who were guided, controlled, and inspired by God Himself,
[time=852] that it's infallible, that it doesn't have errors in it.
[time=857] Yeah.
[time=858] That they are the supreme and final authority that the Word of God can be trusted to believe literally and obeyed fully
[time=868] and it will remain to the very end of the age as the only complete and final revelation of God to us.
[time=877] And we have the privilege of being able to read it.
[time=881] Today, we have two famous, real known, well known, biblical accounts that we're going to cover from the Word of God
[time=890] about the life of David.
[time=894] It's an incredible backdrop to remind us to check our perspective against God's and seeing from God's perspective is paramount.
[time=904] Pray with me, William.
[time=906] Heavenly Father, today, we thank you for the privilege that you, Holy Spirit, have opened the eyes of our heart and our ears so that we can hear what your Spirit says through the Word of God, what it says about sin and righteousness and judgment.
[time=924] Thank you, God.
[time=925] Today, we would ask that you would use my preparation, that you would use the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart to speak the truth to those who hear.
[time=938] May you be glorified in our time today in Jesus' name.
[time=942] [AMEN] So our portion of Scripture for today is from 1 Samuel 16 and 17.
[time=949] If you don't have a Bible, we have the few Bibles there in front of you.
[time=952] It is the section of Scripture is from page 136 through 138 in there,
[time=958] but 1 Samuel 16 and 17.
[time=963] I want to take just a minute to remind us of where we were from Tiberius last week.
[time=970] Tiberius last week reminded us that King Saul had decided to do this King thing his way.
[time=979] He had decided to do things my way, and that led to deception,
[time=985] impatience, pride, disobedience, and ultimately a lack of repentance that resulted in God,
[time=996] rejecting him, it's King of Israel.
[time=1000] It's that concept that we're stepping into today in the wrapping of Saul's removal
[time=1007] and David's anointing.
[time=1009] As I already said in all aspects of life, seeing things from God's perspective is paramount.
[time=1015] That was no different for Samuel.
[time=1022] Samuel was the message of God, messenger of God, excuse me, who had heard the Lord's voice to him say, "Tap Saul, he's the guy."
[time=1034] And now he heard Saul again say, "God again say, no, Saul's done.
[time=1041] I've rejected him." 1 Samuel 15, 11 says, "I regret that I have made Saul for he has turned back from following me
[time=1053] and has not performed my commandments." And look what Samuel was.
[time=1057] Look what Samuel was.
[time=1059] It says Samuel, God's anointing, God's guy, his prophet.
[time=1064] Samuel was angry and he cried, "How long?
[time=1070] All night." Samuel was angry and he cried to the Lord all night.
[time=1075] When you get to chapter 16, verse 1, we get to see God's response and actually his correction.
[time=1082] His correction of Samuel, 16-1 says, "The Lord said to Samuel, 'How long will you grieve
[time=1092] over Saul?' How long?
[time=1097] Since I have rejected him from bringing King over Israel, fill your horn with oil and go.
[time=1103] I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for myself a king from among
[time=1109] his sons, under outline, under David's anointing to be King, capital letter A, as Samuel was
[time=1116] angry and mourned over God's plan."
[time=1128] I have to tell you that I believe my thought is probably accurate.
[time=1135] Over the last 18 months, there's probably a sudden sum in this room that have mourned over
[time=1145] God's plan for Bock Hock as it relates to being having a pastor.
[time=1151] Some of you have lost sleep, some of you have not been happy.
[time=1158] Warning over what we thought was supposed to be versus having our eyes up and open.
[time=1166] In expectation, knowing that God is moving, we need to expect that he's moving and be
[time=1172] ready to join him there.
[time=1174] Henry Blackaby says, "Find where God is moving and go join him there."
[time=1180] That's what our expectation is of the PDT bringing the next pastor to us so that we
[time=1187] can affirm him and we can seat him and we can celebrate God's provision for us.
[time=1195] We need to not be stuck in the rut and be ready with the tools God equips us, equips you and I with and be ready to go.
[time=1203] Samuel was the agent of God, anoint to anoint the next king.
[time=1207] He needed to get his horn filled and ready to anoint the next man God had planned.
[time=1213] Samuel was too busy mourning over the guy that he thought was supposed to be king and God
[time=1219] says, "Stop!
[time=1221] Take that horn you got, fill it with oil and go see Jesse.
[time=1225] Get out of the rut that you're in." Isaiah 55-9 says, "For as the heavens are higher than the years, so are my ways higher than
[time=1236] your ways and my thoughts, your thoughts.
[time=1241] God has a different perspective than you and I do.
[time=1245] I want to ask you this morning, is there something that you're hanging on to wishing
[time=1254] that it was different and maybe even thinking that God got it wrong?
[time=1265] Move on to where God is versus being stuck where he was and blaming him that you're still
[time=1273] there.
[time=1276] Move to where God's at.
[time=1278] Don't be stuck where you're at.
[time=1282] Our human tendency is to see circumstances and events in our past from an earthly mindset.
[time=1291] He comes to anointing a king when Samuel had Jesse's sons come before him.
[time=1295] Caleb read it.
[time=1297] He saw a lie of which was the oldest and he was a big dude and he says, "Surely." He says, "Surely the Lord's anointed is before me."
[time=1307] In addition to having distorted views and perception of past events and circumstances, our perspective
[time=1315] is often out of line in the way physically that we look at other people and the way we see
[time=1323] them.
[time=1324] For Samuel 16-7, "But the Lord said to Samuel, 'Do not look on his appearance or on the
[time=1331] height of his stature because I have rejected him.'" That's not my man.
[time=1336] "For the Lord sees not as man sees, but the Lord looks at your heart."
[time=1344] The Lord looks on the inside.
[time=1347] The Lord judges the thoughts and the intentions of your heart through the Word of God.
[time=1354] Let her be in your outline under Section 6, Chapter 16, as God's perspective is not like man's.
[time=1362] God's perspective isn't like yours and mine.
[time=1366] I don't even see things the way everybody else does.
[time=1369] I don't see things.
[time=1371] I don't see things the same all the time, but I know that he loves me and I love him.
[time=1376] We don't see the things the same all the time.
[time=1381] All the way back then, humanity had the same tendency to look on the outward appearance.
[time=1386] Beauty and stature and think that it mattered.
[time=1391] Well, guess what?
[time=1394] Centuries, centuries of not cured are fleshless tendencies in this arena.
[time=1402] Beauty, fashion, physique, homes, cars, jewelry, you name it, you fill in the blank.
[time=1416] If we're honest, they're all factors that our culture has worked into our heads to make
[time=1426] us think that they matter more than what's on the inside of a person.
[time=1432] It's not just what we actually see.
[time=1435] The problem is, is we end up with preconceived notions.
[time=1439] We end up with preconceived thoughts that leave us at a spot that when somebody does show up,
[time=1445] all of a sudden, we miss what it's supposed to be.
[time=1450] They drive our ability to even receive or embrace someone.
[time=1457] They're thoughts, the way they're dressed, the things that they may have or not have.
[time=1464] I just heard this week, I loved this view.
[time=1467] There's a little boy that had a brain cancer, and his dad, and he had to have a surgery and he ended up losing his hair and he ended a big giant sea scar on top of his head.
[time=1479] What you know what that ends up for a little boy?
[time=1482] He gets looked at everywhere he goes.
[time=1485] So dad, shaves his head, and gets a tattoo put on his head to match the same shaped sea
[time=1494] of his son.
[time=1496] It's perspective.
[time=1498] What are we willing to do?
[time=1502] 1 Corinthians 1, 25, I want you to catch God's perspective on this.
[time=1506] For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
[time=1512] For consider your own calling, brothers.
[time=1514] Not many of you were wise according to worldly standards.
[time=1518] Not many were powerful.
[time=1520] Not many were of noble birth.
[time=1523] But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise.
[time=1529] God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong.
[time=1533] God chose what is low and despised, even the things that are not, to bring to nothing
[time=1540] things that are so that human beings might boast in the presence of God.
[time=1545] And because of him, you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness,
[time=1554] sanctification, and redemption.
[time=1557] So that is written, let the one who boast, boast in the Lord.
[time=1565] It's the eyes of our heart that need to be given the Holy Spirit-powered ability to see with Jesus' eyes.
[time=1572] It's that we look, and we don't see the things the world sees.
[time=1582] Who or what is it that you need to reconsider what your first reaction is?
[time=1590] Jesus touched lepers.
[time=1593] In the parable of the good Samaritan, there were religious people that said, "Whoa, I'm
[time=1600] walking over here."
[time=1607] Religious people that said, "I don't want to go next to that guy.
[time=1611] Who is that for you?" Our vantage point on circumstances, events, and outward appearance are things that need
[time=1621] to be regularly challenged next to the standards of God's Word.
[time=1627] Next we get to see God's power for leadership.
[time=1630] We must never forget, even for Saul and Samuel and David, the Lord determined when Saul was
[time=1641] done and when David was to be ushered in.
[time=1649] It's interesting.
[time=1652] Let's look at verse 13 and 14 of chapter 16.
[time=1655] And Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers.
[time=1659] Notice this wasn't a big public event at this point.
[time=1664] And the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon David from that day forward, and Samuel rose up and went to Rama.
[time=1670] Verse 14, "Now the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul."
[time=1678] Departed from Saul in a harmful spirit, tormented him.
[time=1682] One letter C is God determines who leads and has the Spirit's power.
[time=1688] Do you believe that?
[time=1692] Do you believe that God determines?
[time=1698] Saul didn't select, Samuel didn't select Saul.
[time=1703] God didn't.
[time=1706] Samuel wasn't going to select David.
[time=1711] He was going to select the alliab because of what they looked at.
[time=1718] It's interesting that the Bible says it was parent, even to Saul's servants.
[time=1726] The spirit on Saul was different than the spirit that had been on him before.
[time=1731] It was going to be a spirit, the tormented.
[time=1733] His servants recognized it.
[time=1737] Interesting as well.
[time=1738] Notice that even after David was anointed by Saul, by Samuel.
[time=1741] Man, I keep getting those two guys screwed up.
[time=1744] Notice that even after David was anointed by Saul as Israel's next king, he didn't take
[time=1750] the throne immediately.
[time=1753] He went back to tending his father's sheep.
[time=1762] He returned to a position of simplicity.
[time=1764] Tiberius has said it a couple times recently.
[time=1767] We have to understand that sometimes the obedience in the simple and mundane things
[time=1774] is what brings God the most glory.
[time=1776] Don't think that you've got to get up and do these big, giant things.
[time=1780] Obedience in the simple things brings God glory.
[time=1784] David did it so well that when he came back to serve Saul, it said Saul loved him greatly.
[time=1795] He went from one modest job to another from tending the sheep of his dad to serving the
[time=1802] present king.
[time=1805] Wrap your head around that one for a minute.
[time=1809] He went to serve the present king knowing that he was going to be the next one.
[time=1813] And I'm sure that David got to see Saul do some really dumb stuff, just like kids you've
[time=1820] probably seen mom and dad do.
[time=1823] Just like employees you've probably seen your boss do.
[time=1829] How you respond in those situations is really key.
[time=1836] Catch the fact that he did it well in verse 21 and Saul's response is he loved him greatly
[time=1842] it says.
[time=1844] Would actually end up being many years between his anointing and actually taking the throne.
[time=1850] That determined when Saul would eventually leave power and when David would take the throne.
[time=1861] I want to make sure that you're not confused.
[time=1864] Don't think that this is any different today.
[time=1868] Lest you be confused when we wake up on Wednesday November 9th of 2016 and you find out who
[time=1877] the next president of the United States is.
[time=1881] Our heavenly Father does not cease to be in control.
[time=1886] He does not.
[time=1888] It doesn't matter whether it's a man or a woman.
[time=1890] It does not matter.
[time=1892] God is the one who gives authority and power and there is no one.
[time=1899] No one that gets in there without God instituting it.
[time=1906] Our Christlike response, I want you to hear this, our Christlike response is going to
[time=1912] be telling to the people around us of what we believe about Jesus and what we believe
[time=1920] about character and just because, just because you may not agree, please don't stay at home.
[time=1934] Jesus cannot take precedence over our need to represent so that the world will know what
[time=1941] we believe.
[time=1943] It can't take precedence.
[time=1945] Don't let your attitude over Democrat, Republican, whatever it is, take and Trump, no pun intended,
[time=1952] and Trump, that's not in my notes by the way, you're attitude in your heart for Jesus.
[time=1962] That's what's got to be in play.
[time=1964] That's got to be our call.
[time=1965] I don't care who gets elected.
[time=1967] We're several months away from it, folks.
[time=1970] November 9th, you're going to wake up and you've got to remind yourself Jesus, our Heavenly Father, is still in the throne.
[time=1979] Romans 13, let every person be subject to the governing authorities for there is no authority except from God and those that exist have been instituted by God.
[time=1989] Therefore whoever resists the authorities, catch this, resists what God has appointed
[time=1996] and those who resist will incur judgment.
[time=2003] Throughout the process of Samuel's announcing Saul's rejection in David's anointing in chapter
[time=2009] 16, we are reminded that when it comes to our view of events and people and who God puts
[time=2016] in leadership, it's paramount that our vantage point must be one of seeing from God's perspective.
[time=2024] I want to do something slightly different this morning, primarily driven because of something
[time=2030] Tiberius said last week.
[time=2033] He quoted a guy that talked about the best and only obedience is instant.
[time=2041] I believe that the Holy Spirit has used some of this stuff, not because of me, but he's
[time=2048] used this.
[time=2049] I want to give it just a few seconds, a few minutes, not a minute for you to stop and
[time=2056] to bow your head and ask God, what do you want you to do with your perspective on past
[time=2063] events, something that's happened that you're hanging on to, something that you're looking
[time=2069] at the wrong thing, that you've got a wrong perspective on the way that you're seeing things, or maybe somebody that's an authority over your life.
[time=2079] Take a minute, bow your head, I want you to do that and make the opportunity to hear instant.
[time=2097] Father, we believe that your Holy Spirit is living and powerful, that you word it, it's sharper than any two-edged sword.
[time=2104] Please speak to those who you want them to change the way that they see an event, the
[time=2112] way that they're looking at people, or somebody that's in leadership.
[time=2117] We trust you, God, mess up our lives to conformist to you, Jesus, amen.
[time=2126] It's at this point in the Bible, transition to chapter 17, and we get to the battlefield
[time=2132] in the Valley of Allah.
[time=2135] The Israelite army versus the Philistines, have we ever heard of these crazy Philistines before?
[time=2141] Yeah.
[time=2142] A lot.
[time=2143] They're not new, they go all the way back to first Samuel 4, they go all the way back to the beginning.
[time=2148] These guys have been a pain to the Israelites for a long time, so it's not new that they're
[time=2155] fighting the Israelites.
[time=2157] The interesting thing is, is that now we get to a spot and instead of line against line,
[time=2164] they send this big guy down, and they're ready to go man versus man champion.
[time=2170] This is a bit new for the Israelites, but can you think about this?
[time=2173] Goliath, big guy, right?
[time=2176] You got the biggest guy that scares the daylights out of everybody.
[time=2180] I can see why they kind of get behind this idea that says, okay, we're going to send ours down, you send yours down, whoever loses, you're going to serve.
[time=2191] I could see why the Philistines get behind that.
[time=2195] They got Goliath.
[time=2198] It's interesting.
[time=2199] Come on, wouldn't you be behind him?
[time=2201] He's the big guy that scares everybody.
[time=2206] I wrote this down.
[time=2207] Peyton made it really easy for some of you to be cults fans.
[time=2213] There's people are really easy to follow because they win a lot.
[time=2218] The attention to detail used to describe Goliath of Gath is worthy of note, chapter 17, verse
[time=2224] 4.
[time=2225] There came out from the camp of the Philistines, a champion named Goliath of Gath, who was six cubits in a span.
[time=2230] He had a helmet of bronze on his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail and a weight of coat of 5,000 shekels of bronze, and his broads armor on his legs, a javelin of bronze
[time=2240] slung between his shoulders.
[time=2242] The shaft of a spear was big like a weaver's beam, and the head of his spear weighed 600
[time=2252] shekels.
[time=2253] Well, you know what, 600 shekels is 15 pounds.
[time=2260] That's like throwing, instead of throwing a shot put, that's like throwing a shot put with a spear on the end of it, okay?
[time=2268] That's what people are trying to, it's what he was trying to direct.
[time=2271] The coat of mail that he put on for his armor, 125 pounds, 125 pounds.
[time=2280] Now, some of your Bibles have a note in it regarding this whole six cubits thing.
[time=2287] There are some original, some manuscripts in the Dead Sea Scrolls that say he was actually
[time=2294] four cubits in a span.
[time=2296] Let's just cut to the chase here.
[time=2299] Here it was six foot nine, like Jack Ventil around here somewhere.
[time=2304] If anybody knows Jack, Jack's a big guy.
[time=2307] Six foot nine or nine foot nine, he's a really big guy in that day.
[time=2312] Don't get caught up on that.
[time=2314] Let's stick with what we know is clear.
[time=2316] Goliath is big, he's intimidating, and the Philistines were willing to get behind him
[time=2325] for what he was winning or losing.
[time=2329] Don't be mistaken.
[time=2331] When Saul, just remind yourself, Saul was a head taller than all the rest of the people of his day.
[time=2337] So when Saul and the rest of the soldiers encountered Goliath, verse 11 says they were
[time=2346] dismayed, when Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistines, they were dismayed
[time=2353] and what?
[time=2355] Be afraid, fear, fear of how big the guy took over.
[time=2363] So we get to the first point under chapter 17, letter A, is Goliath a giant or is he defiant?
[time=2370] Because I want to tell you something.
[time=2372] I don't want this to be about the giant.
[time=2374] That's not what this passage is about.
[time=2376] It's not about how big the guy is.
[time=2381] It's not.
[time=2382] He's really big.
[time=2384] And you know what?
[time=2385] He was big enough to scare the daylights out of thousands as David gets sent there by dad.
[time=2392] His dad tells him to give the food to the quartermaster of the thousand, of their thousand.
[time=2399] So this wasn't just a few of his brothers.
[time=2401] There was a bunch of people that saw Goliath and heard him.
[time=2408] They saw Goliath and heard him, a perspective on this subject alone serves as a groundwork
[time=2415] for how we respond.
[time=2418] If you see it the way Saul and David's older brothers and the army did, you see it like
[time=2426] the rest of the world.
[time=2427] Go Google David and Goliath and guess what it's about, an underdog.
[time=2434] It's all focused about how big the giant was and how little of a chance they had.
[time=2444] We see this come into play when David arrives at the battlegrounds sent by his father Jesse to check on his three oldest brothers.
[time=2451] He arrives right at the time of day where they're relying all up and they're rallying the troops and they're blowing the battle cry, David shows up just in time to throw the food
[time=2462] to the quartermaster and head out and he goes to find his brothers.
[time=2467] In verse 23, as he talks with his brothers, Goliath came out, gave his challenge like
[time=2474] he had every morning and night.
[time=2479] Every morning and night for almost six weeks, folks, 40 days, 40 days he came out morning
[time=2486] and night and said, I defy your God of Israel, send somebody out to fight me.
[time=2494] Let her be a wrong perspective leads to fear and fleeing.
[time=2501] You get a distorted view and you're not seeing life from God's way and all of a sudden you want to run.
[time=2506] You want to get away from it.
[time=2508] You don't want to engage.
[time=2511] That's exactly where everybody was at.
[time=2516] He said the same words, verse 23, it says, he said the same words that he had before.
[time=2521] Yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda.
[time=2526] That's what he was saying.
[time=2528] They cowered in fear and fled.
[time=2531] Their wrong view paralyzed them from being able to move anywhere.
[time=2535] They were stuck.
[time=2536] They weren't fighting and they wouldn't surrender.
[time=2541] They saw themselves as the army of Saul versus the army of God.
[time=2550] That's how they saw themselves.
[time=2552] Another example of this distorted view was David's oldest brother, Lyab.
[time=2558] He heard him asking questions and he just unloads on his brother, verses 28 and 29.
[time=2566] Now Lyab, his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the man and Lyab's anger was kindled against David and he said, why have you come down?
[time=2577] With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness?
[time=2579] I know your presumption and the evil of your heart.
[time=2584] For you have come down to see the battle and David said, what have I done now, brother?
[time=2592] Was it not but a word I said?
[time=2594] Remember, no one in David's life except his family knew that he had been anointed king
[time=2603] at this point.
[time=2605] Sounded a little bit like Joseph's brothers, isn't it?
[time=2609] Joseph's brothers weren't very happy that he had been anointed.
[time=2619] I'm sure it never happens.
[time=2621] All that would be in your outline, distorted view leads to poor judgment of others.
[time=2627] I'm sure it never happens in any other home except for the ravers with siblings, with
[time=2634] anyone else pronouncing judgment on a sibling or a spouse or a co-worker.
[time=2641] But when you get to phrases like, what are you doing here?
[time=2646] Why aren't you doing what you were told to do?
[time=2651] I know what you're thinking really dangerous to say that.
[time=2655] I know what you're thinking and see your horrible evil attitude.
[time=2663] You're so selfish doing what you do.
[time=2666] Why are you here?
[time=2668] Anytime we hear ourselves with you, you, you, you, you, we ought to experience a lot
[time=2675] of caution.
[time=2680] Everything that your perspective of others should be exactly what Darren read this morning from Philippians 2.
[time=2688] Do nothing out of selfish ambition or concede.
[time=2691] Humility count others more significant than yourself.
[time=2697] Let each of you look not only to the interests, but also to the interests of others.
[time=2703] That's Jesus' attitude.
[time=2706] You're not seeing the circumstances of your life from God's vantage point.
[time=2710] Not only do we tend to criticize others, you end up experiencing loss of hope and heart.
[time=2718] Let no man's heart fail, David says.
[time=2722] When circumstances leave you thinking that there's no way out, there are times we can be so full of despair that phrases like it's no use, I can never change.
[time=2736] No one sees it my way.
[time=2739] They all seem to be a normal frame of mind.
[time=2743] That's the exact posture that the enemy wants you in.
[time=2747] He wants you in a posture that says there's no way.
[time=2752] The giant's too big.
[time=2753] It's exactly where he wants you.
[time=2759] He wants you questioned in the motives of actions and others without heart, without courage and without hope.
[time=2767] There is a war to be battled in the realm of our minds.
[time=2771] Thoughts that need to be taken captive and made them obedient that are contrary to Christ.
[time=2777] What's the lies you're believing?
[time=2781] What's the stuff you're telling yourself?
[time=2785] Is it a line with what Jesus says about you?
[time=2797] Others wrong perspective doesn't negate the Spirit's power, anointing an insight for those who God chose.
[time=2804] We had thousands of people that heard the same thing David heard for 40 days.
[time=2809] David hears at one time.
[time=2817] We move from negative or wrong perspectives to right perspective like David's.
[time=2823] The right perspective like David's leads to see God's provision and preparation.
[time=2832] And David said to Saul, Saul said to David, you are not able to go.
[time=2837] You are a buddy of youth.
[time=2842] He's a man of war.
[time=2845] See, Saul didn't get through to David because David didn't hear that.
[time=2849] David was listening by the Spirit's power.
[time=2853] He was thinking with God, all things are possible.
[time=2856] God will provide.
[time=2858] He's been faithful in the past.
[time=2860] I've been escaped from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear.
[time=2866] He had some history.
[time=2872] In verse 38 he even dresses David in his own personal armor.
[time=2876] This is where I actually became convinced this week that so much of what we've heard over the years and so much of what we've been taught about David being a wee little boy
[time=2887] doesn't fit because Saul was not an idiot.
[time=2891] It's his kingdom, with his kingdom at stake, with his kingdom at stake and his people getting
[time=2898] ready to be at risk of going to serve the Philistines.
[time=2902] Do you think for one moment that Saul would have put armor on David that left him like
[time=2909] this and a helmet that didn't fit if it was going to do anything to impair his ability
[time=2917] to win?
[time=2918] I don't think so.
[time=2921] Chapter 16 even calls David when the guy's describing of, "Hey, I know a guy over Jesse
[time=2928] that can play the liar," he describes as the man three different times.
[time=2934] It just says he's the youngest son.
[time=2940] The wisdom that comes from a right, accurate perspective leads to one's seeing that what
[time=2946] isn't a right fit for you.
[time=2952] David even goes to the length of strapping on his sword over the armor, but it was an
[time=2958] exercise in futility.
[time=2960] He's never used armor before.
[time=2962] He wasn't prepared and battle tested.
[time=2965] He knew what he was good at.
[time=2969] He knew what was going to work.
[time=2971] He knew what killed lions and bears.
[time=2977] He threw off the stuff and said, "I'm going." And he didn't let the thoughts of the king diverting.
[time=2985] His skill was with a sling and a stone.
[time=2990] Not very complicated, was it?
[time=2993] You got some skills that aren't very complicated either, but they're needed in this place.
[time=2998] And the Philistine moved toward David and came near him with his shield bearer in front
[time=3006] of him.
[time=3007] And the Philistine looked and saw David.
[time=3008] He disdained him for he was ruddy, youth, handsome in appearance.
[time=3013] And the Philistine said to him, "Am I a dog that you come to me with sticks?" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
[time=3023] Philistine said to David, "Come to me and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air." Look what David says to him, "You come to me with a sword and a spear and with a javelin.
[time=3035] But I come to you in the name of the Lord of Host, the God of the armies of Israel whom
[time=3042] you have defiled.
[time=3044] This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand."
[time=3050] Only Goliath acted consistent with what he had been doing all along, disdain, defying God.
[time=3059] Spirit-powered insight gave David the faith-based boldness to engage the enemy with the truth.
[time=3066] God had walked with him.
[time=3068] He had led him to kill the things that were killing his sheep.
[time=3073] And David knew, and he had faith that God was going to be the same God that he had been before.
[time=3081] Faith-based boldness to engage the enemy with truth.
[time=3088] David made it clear that Goliath had sinned and defied God.
[time=3093] He also made his purpose clear in verse 46.
[time=3097] It was so that all the world might know that there was a God in Israel.
[time=3106] The declaration of David ensured there was no misunderstanding.
[time=3110] The battle was the Lord's.
[time=3112] It was the Lord's.
[time=3113] It wasn't David's.
[time=3114] It wasn't for David to be all Beidhi and mighty.
[time=3119] It was so that the world would know.
[time=3122] The battle was the Lord's.
[time=3123] And the victory wasn't for David's fame, but for God's name.
[time=3131] Something from God's perspective is paramount to your own faith, hope, and victory in life.
[time=3140] What attitude adjustment or perspective do you need?
[time=3144] Some might be Samuel, living in the things that are done.
[time=3149] Some might be an older brother.
[time=3153] Some of you might be an older brother that's got an attitude towards a younger or a co-worker or something like that.
[time=3159] Some of you might be Saul.
[time=3162] You might be Saul experiencing rejection, and God's correcting you.
[time=3172] Whatever it is, we're going to pray, Darren and the team are going to come up, and we're
[time=3179] going to sing a song.
[time=3180] We're going to sing a song, but I would beg you to ask a God for what it is.
[time=3188] Only because we can come, and we can do the same thing.
[time=3192] I love Alistair Begg.
[time=3196] He talks about, "I can fall into the armies of Israel" mode.
[time=3201] Come to church, week in, week out, hear the same thing, go back and not respond.
[time=3209] That's what the armies of Israel doing.
[time=3211] They were going week in, week out, day in, day out with no change.
[time=3218] We're going to have elders down front that will be here available for you to pray.
[time=3224] If you came, and you don't feel comfortable coming down front, ask somebody who's next to you to pray with you if you want, this is something that you need.
[time=3234] God wants to help you.
[time=3238] He is the point of the story, not the giant.
[time=3244] He's the point of the story, not Goliath.
[time=3247] He is the God of the armies of Israel, and He is the same God that has power to give victory to you.
[time=3254] Pray with me.
[time=3256] Heavenly Father, God, just even as I look around this morning, I see faces.
[time=3268] They are hurt by the battle of a husband making choices that aren't honoring you, of
[time=3280] sons exercising behaviors, that aren't what they would choose, of people wishing jobs
[time=3291] were different, please God, please help our people, help me to see that you're the great
[time=3305] I am, your God Almighty, and God mess up our lives, mess us up, draw our attention to
[time=3314] your power, bring the David's into our life to speak the truth that you might be glorified
[time=3321] in Jesus name, amen.
[time=3338] Jesus our God.
[time=3348] What are you turned into wine?
[time=3353] Open the eyes of the blind, there's no one like you, none like you, into the darkness
[time=3368] shine, out of the ashes we rise, there's no one like you, there's none like you, our
[time=3384] God is greater, our God is stronger, God knew our higher than any other, our God is
[time=3395] stronger, awesome and power, our God, our God, into the darkness we shine, out of the
[time=3417] ashes we rise, there's no one like you, none like you, our God is greater, our God is
[time=3434] greater, our God is stronger, our God is greater, our God is stronger, God knew
[time=3453] our higher than any other, our God is greater, awesome and power, our God, our God.
[time=3475] And if our God is for us, then you could never stop us, and if our God is with us, then
[time=3491] we could never stop us, and if our God is with us, then we could never stop us, and
[time=3504] if our God is greater, our God is stronger, God knew our higher than any other, our
[time=3528] God is greater, our God is greater, our God is stronger, God knew our higher than any
[time=3548] other, our God is greater, our God, our God.
