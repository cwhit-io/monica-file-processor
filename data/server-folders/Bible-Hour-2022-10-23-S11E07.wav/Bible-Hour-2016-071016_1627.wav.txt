[time=270] You are good.
[time=274] [MUSIC]
[time=285] This is a good, good father to you are.
[time=290] It's who you are.
[time=294] I'm loved by you.
[time=298] It's who I am.
[time=308] When I've heard a thousand stories of what they think you're like, but
[time=319] I've heard a tender whisper of love in the dead of night and you tell me that
[time=332] you're pleased and that I'm never alone.
[time=339] It's who you are.
[time=351] I'm loved by you.
[time=353] It's who I am.
[time=363] When I've seen many searching for anything.
[time=368] Searching for answers far and wide, but I'm new.
[time=376] We're all searching for answers only you've probed by as you know.
[time=385] Yes.
[time=386] What we need before we say a word your good could have to you are.
[time=397] It's who you are.
[time=401] I'm loved by you.
[time=405] It's who I am.
[time=413] You are perfect in all of your ways.
[time=601] [MUSIC]

[time=845] [MUSIC]
[time=855] [APPLAUSE]
[time=863] I think I told you this once before, but I hired Darren, but
[time=874] it's not my fault that he's here.
[time=879] Nancy recommended him, knew his mother well, and they talked him into coming.
[time=884] So it's totally Nancy's fault.
[time=889] [APPLAUSE]
[time=897] Yeah, we're celebrating Independence Day this weekend.
[time=903] And it's a good thing.
[time=906] We've been enjoying for hundreds of years the freedom that a lot of people paid a huge price for.
[time=918] And many people since then have paid a huge price.
[time=924] Living and dying, they paid a big price.
[time=929] And I'm thankful for that.
[time=931] I'm really grateful.
[time=933] I've been raised in a place where I've been free to come and go, do the things I want to do.
[time=939] And I'm really thankful for that.
[time=944] The reservation I have about that feeling that I have of independence, which I really cherish and enjoy.
[time=951] And I want us to experience it.
[time=953] I want everybody to experience that kind of freedom.
[time=955] But the reservation I have is that we would carry that further than God intends us to carry it.
[time=965] And sometimes I think we tend to think of ourselves as independent and not needing anyone else.
[time=980] That's dangerous.
[time=981] That's not what God intended for us.
[time=984] God wants us to be utterly dependent on Him.
[time=988] I mean completely, fully, utterly dependent knowing that every breath that we have,
[time=996] He's allowing us to really experience.
[time=1000] So He wants us to be dependent on Him.
[time=1003] And not only that, He designed us to be interdependent with each other.
[time=1010] And we sometimes even say things like, "I don't need anyone."
[time=1017] That's not true.
[time=1020] That's unhealthy.
[time=1022] God's designed us to be interdependent and to need each other.
[time=1029] In 1979, we moved here to Fort Wayne.
[time=1035] Dave Jeremiah, really all he wanted was a basketball coach.
[time=1038] I got to do some other things, but all he really wanted was a basketball coach.
[time=1043] And as a matter of fact, Matt, your dad and a lot of other people, all they really wanted was a basketball coach too.
[time=1052] But I got to grow and learn here.
[time=1055] What happened was we moved here in '79, had our first child Stephanie in 1980,
[time=1061] and then in an interdependent relationship in a healthy community of people.
[time=1067] Renee and I, and the kids, got to experience life in a circle that was right here at Les Meyer and State.
[time=1077] And the people that helped us and that we got a chance to help build a bond together.
[time=1084] There's a friendship together.
[time=1086] There's a dependence that we have on each other.
[time=1088] It's interdependence, not co-dependence, but we needed each other.
[time=1092] All those years, I went to church here for those of you that don't know, I belonged here at Blackhawk.
[time=1097] I went to church here from August of '79 until May of 2015.
[time=1102] And Nancy and I have since moved.
[time=1105] But, wow, what we got to experience here, life.
[time=1111] We got to experience abundant life to the extent that we were willing to give and receive.
[time=1121] And we received a lot.
[time=1124] Went through a lot of life changes.
[time=1127] Wow, together, you went through them, we've gone through them.
[time=1131] I saw Jack back there this morning and I said, "Jack, we met in that August of 1979 and we started playing basketball together that year.
[time=1141] Dave actually thought he was better than he was. Jack was good."
[time=1150] We had wonderful community.
[time=1155] I think that's what God wants.
[time=1158] He wants us to experience relationship in a healthy, healthy way where we need each other.
[time=1164] We're transparent and honest with each other and we give and receive with each other.
[time=1172] Well, I'm thankful for that and now Nancy and I are experiencing a new circle of life.
[time=1181] What I get to do now is I work at a crop insurance business called Silvius Insurance Group in Warsaw.
[time=1190] And there we are attempting to build a platform in the comprehensive crop insurance industry across the country
[time=1199] to honor God and enrich the lives of the people that we bump into.
[time=1205] Whether it's employees, coworkers, vendors, customers.
[time=1211] Our desire is that God would be honored that we'd do excellent work there that would honor him.
[time=1217] That we'd produce a profit that we could invest in our people and the others that we meet so that we can hopefully get a chance to have a voice.
[time=1228] Whether it's with my mouth or with my actions or both, we're trying to build a platform so that we have a voice
[time=1236] to tell people about what's really important while we live here.
[time=1241] That's Christ.
[time=1243] And so I'm really fortunate.
[time=1245] I get to minister at work every day.
[time=1248] You know what?
[time=1249] God's given me an opportunity since I was 24 years old to minister every day at work.
[time=1257] No matter what job I've had.
[time=1260] There have always been people there.
[time=1263] No matter where I've been.
[time=1265] And I've had an opportunity to be a minister for Christ in every single one of those settings.
[time=1271] Now it's with some farmers and vendors and sales agents who sell crop insurance.
[time=1278] And wow, I'm enjoying it.
[time=1281] And we get to go to church.
[time=1284] We have a local body that we worship with called Christ Covenant there in Warsaw.
[time=1290] And we get revived there so that we can go and do our ministry all week again.
[time=1297] I'm so thankful.
[time=1299] And Black Hawk's been doing that for people since it started in 1969.
[time=1306] Reviving people, energizing people so that they can be equipped to do the work of the ministry.
[time=1313] All week long.
[time=1315] And I'm thankful because much of the equipping that I received in my life happened right here at State and Leymeyer.
[time=1323] Listening to great preaching, hearing Sunday school teachers, getting a chance to study so I can be a Sunday school teacher.
[time=1331] Great opportunities.
[time=1332] I'm really thankful.
[time=1337] My life has been enriched because I had a chance to be here.
[time=1342] And you've invested.
[time=1345] And I thank you for that.
[time=1348] Father in Heaven.
[time=1350] Now we're going to turn to your word.
[time=1354] And God, I pray that every single thing that we read that's prescriptive, that we'd be really careful to do what you command us to do.
[time=1368] And Lord, where it's not prescriptive but it's describing things that have happened, I pray that you will give us your thoughts rather than ours blocking the way.
[time=1380] I pray that we would be enlightened by you that your spirit would reveal to us with wisdom and revelation who you are through your word.
[time=1391] And I pray we'd not get in the way. And Lord, I pray we wouldn't add to or subtract from at all.
[time=1399] And where it's subjective, Lord, and it isn't prescriptive, I pray that opinions would be received as opinions and just considered.
[time=1411] But where you've mandated things, Lord, I pray that we'd be just obedient.
[time=1416] Please help us to be discerning as we move through your word to do that.
[time=1420] And Lord, I thank you for the example we have of Jonathan and David and their friendship.
[time=1431] And I pray for each and every one of us that we'd have friends like that, with you between us.
[time=1440] In Christ's name I pray, amen.
[time=1445] A British publication one time offered a prize for the best definition of a friend.
[time=1455] Found this on the internet, obviously. I wasn't there at the time.
[time=1460] Among the thousands of answers that they got, I chose a few.
[time=1469] A person described a friend as one who multiplies joys.
[time=1477] Divides grief, I like that, multiplies joys, divides grief, and whose honesty cannot be violated.
[time=1494] Well, that's a good definition for a friend.
[time=1496] Another one said, "It's one who understands our silence." It's been hard for me to let people be silent in my life.
[time=1506] I have a tendency to talk, and I want them to talk back, and I haven't given people much time for silence that really needs silence and time to think that way, as I don't.
[time=1516] I can't think alone.
[time=1519] My mind wanders all over the place, but some need silence.
[time=1523] Another definition was, "A watch that beats true for all time and never runs out."
[time=1536] The winning definition was, "A friend is the one who comes when the whole world has gone."
[time=1547] I like that.
[time=1549] I modified that one a little bit. I liked it so much.
[time=1552] I said, "A friend is one who comes when no one, including the one who comes, wants to come."
[time=1564] I can't remember the times when I truly wanted to go when somebody was suffering.
[time=1572] Most of the time, I didn't want to go.
[time=1576] A friend is one who comes when no one, including the friend who comes, wants to come.
[time=1585] Then a friend chooses when you need them over what they want.
[time=1598] A friend is somebody who they're going to choose to go when you need them.
[time=1609] Over the comfort that they'd rather experience, either avoiding or being there but not speaking the truth.
[time=1622] With a friend, I'm safe. I'm safe to be transparent.
[time=1630] I can expose myself. I'm safe to be transparent. I'm safe to trust them.
[time=1639] I'm exposed. Some people don't want to be comforted, but they need comfort.
[time=1646] I need to expose myself and allow people in when I really need comforted instead of saying, "I don't need that."
[time=1656] I need to expose myself and be willing, when they come in, to confront me about what I need to do to change.
[time=1666] The behaviors they see in my life that aren't healthy for me or for others.
[time=1671] I need to expose myself to that and say, "Come."
[time=1678] I was driving up 69 this morning, and there was Arlen.
[time=1685] There's a billboard on 69, and it's the biggest picture of Arlen, and I think you can possibly imagine.
[time=1693] I've been thinking so much about this friendship and a willingness to step in and confront when you don't want to, and there he was.
[time=1705] One of the people in my life that I've experienced a willingness to step in when he didn't want to, in comfort and bringing conviction.
[time=1720] Thankful, Harlan.
[time=1725] Well, let's look now at what the word has to say about that.
[time=1730] That's a bunch of stuff that some people had to say and that I had to say about friendship.
[time=1735] Let's look at a little bit about what the word has to say.
[time=1738] Let's look at 1 Samuel chapter 18 together.
[time=1748] 1 Samuel 18-1.
[time=1751] As soon as he had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David.
[time=1763] Wow!
[time=1766] "And Jonathan loved him as his own soul. Saul had just brought David home after the events that took place when David slew Goliath.
[time=1778] And this as far as we know is Jonathan's first encounter with David, and his soul is knit to him."
[time=1788] Verse 2, "And Saul took him that day and would not let him return to his father's house.
[time=1793] Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as his own soul.
[time=1800] And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him and gave it to David and his armor and even his sword and his bow and his belt."
[time=1813] So Jonathan immediately has a love for young David.
[time=1822] And some commentators went pretty far with this and said this was establishing David as the line that the royal line of David.
[time=1837] And he was giving him his robe saying, "Oh, I realize you're now going to be king. It won't be me following my father Saul."
[time=1845] And that may be. The Scripture doesn't say that.
[time=1850] But it's an interesting thought. He takes off his royal robes. He gives him his armor for protection.
[time=1857] He gives him his weapons because it says he loved him.
[time=1865] And then verse 5 says, "David had incredible success." And you know the story. David goes on and he leads armies for Saul.
[time=1874] And he comes back to town and when they get back to Jerusalem, the people are singing, Saul has slain his thousands, and David has tens of thousands.
[time=1886] And there's something that happens to Saul in his soul and his heart.
[time=1891] And a few times in the next chapters, it actually says God gave Saul over to an evil spirit.
[time=1900] I don't get that. I don't understand that.
[time=1905] But I do know that that's what happened. And Saul becomes jealous of David and Saul then hurls a spear in verses 11 and 12 of chapter 18 to kill David.
[time=1917] And David gets away twice, it says.
[time=1924] Now verse 1 of chapter 19.
[time=1930] And Saul spoke to Jonathan, his son, and to all his servants that they should kill David.
[time=1936] But Jonathan, Saul's son, delighted much in David.
[time=1942] He was knit to him and he delights in him. And Jonathan told David, Saul, my father seeks to kill you.
[time=1949] Therefore, be on your guard in the morning. Stay in a secret place and hide yourself.
[time=1954] And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak to my father about you.
[time=1960] And if I learn anything, I will tell you.
[time=1962] And Jonathan spoke of well of David to Saul's father and said to him, let not the king sin against his servant because David,
[time=1970] because he has not sinned against you and because his deeds have brought good to you.
[time=1978] For he took his life in his hands and he struck down the flistine, and the Lord worked a great salvation for all Israel.
[time=1984] You saw it, it rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood by killing David without cause?
[time=1992] And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan, Saul swore as the Lord lives, he shall not be put to death.
[time=1998] And Jonathan called David, and David reported to him all these things, and Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as before.
[time=2008] Well, in 19-2, Jonathan warns David. In 1910, Saul tries to spear him again.
[time=2022] So this brother, who loves him, warns him, and Saul tries to spear him because Saul is jealous, angry, and frustrated.
[time=2037] Chapter 20.
[time=2041] Chapter 20, you really need to read the whole chapter to really grasp what God is saying to us about this relationship, but basically it's this.
[time=2054] Jonathan's commitment grows, they renew their covenant that they made, this covenant.
[time=2059] The Lord shall be between them, was their covenant, and between their offspring.
[time=2069] Most times, when something comes between you, it reduces your relationship.
[time=2081] In this case, what they're saying is, let our relationship be about our relationship with the Lord.
[time=2090] He's between us, and let him be the center between our offspring as well.
[time=2097] Healthy relationships take place when God is at the center of the relationship.
[time=2112] Jonathan and David understood that. Then in chapter 23, verses 17 and 18, they renew their covenant again. Let's look at that quickly.
[time=2127] Chapter 23 verse 17, it says, "And he said to him, 'Do not fear for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you.
[time=2140] You shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you.
[time=2144] Saul my father also knows this, and the two of them made a covenant before the Lord.
[time=2151] David remained at Horish, and Jonathan went home. They renewed their covenant again.
[time=2159] Doesn't prove to be true. Saul continues to pursue David and want to kill him.
[time=2166] But Saul and Jonathan and Saul's other two sons die in the battlefield at the end of 1 Samuel.
[time=2176] And then in the first chapter of 2 Samuel, David sings this song of lament about Jonathan and Saul dying.
[time=2189] David never says a bitter word toward Saul. And I think this is why.
[time=2197] I think the Lord was between David and Saul from David's perspective.
[time=2210] And I suggest to you that you can have a healthy, joy-filled, not happy relationship with anybody.
[time=2223] When you treat them as though the Lord is between you and them, and you're discovering from his perspective
[time=2232] how you should be treating them instead of responding to them in your own natural condition.
[time=2238] I think Jonathan and David had something figured out there that's really important.
[time=2244] And David lived that out.
[time=2249] Well, all that caused me to think about the things that I've been thinking about for several years.
[time=2256] I'll never forget I asked somebody one time a friend. I suggested to him.
[time=2261] I said, "You know this year, I think you've been my best friend." And he was uncomfortable with that. There's a lot of stuff that comes with being a best friend.
[time=2271] There's a lot of obligation. And I remember he said, "Well, how about best of friends?" I said, "Fine."
[time=2279] But the reason I was suggesting to him that he'd been my best friend that year was he had spoken into my life more often than anybody about helping me grow.
[time=2291] It wasn't always fun being with him, but it sure was healthy for me.
[time=2300] So I started thinking, "When do I was so uncomfortable with that?" And I started mulling that over, and I really remember reflecting on this a few years ago thinking, "Okay, friends are at different levels in my life. I have friends, honestly. I have acquaintances like some people.
[time=2316] I've bumped into some people. I remember who they are. They remember who I am. That's it.
[time=2320] Those are acquaintances." But I have some people that I'd literally call friends.
[time=2325] And my friendship with them is totally on their terms.
[time=2331] I want to be with them. I enjoy being friends with them.
[time=2335] And they decide when, where, what, how we're going to do things. It's really on their terms.
[time=2340] Those aren't the richest relationships, but they're still good.
[time=2344] And then I have some friendships that I've discovered as I've thought it through. They're really on my terms.
[time=2349] I'm the one that initiates. I decide what we're going to do, when we're going to do it, how we're going to do it.
[time=2354] And that's okay, too. That's good. We have good relationships that way.
[time=2359] The ones that are really rich and deep are the ones, the friendships that I have, where it's on our terms.
[time=2369] We both initiate. We both have the freedom to say no.
[time=2374] We both have the desire to say yes.
[time=2379] Then we comfort and we confront both.
[time=2385] Those are rich, deep relationships.
[time=2388] I want more of those that we both share the responsibility and the joy of the relationship.
[time=2399] Those are relationships on our terms.
[time=2404] You know, there's a step above that, and I've thought about this a little bit.
[time=2409] There's something about my family that's a step beyond that, even.
[time=2414] Because what's pretty natural for me to do for my family, not for everybody, but for me, I really do want what's best for them, and I'm pretty willing to jump in and sacrifice and do what's best for them.
[time=2425] I'll give up money, stuff, whatever.
[time=2429] Because I just naturally care for them as my flesh and blood and as my wife.
[time=2438] That's even a, that's a deeper step.
[time=2442] And that took me to John 15. Let's go there. John 15, 9 through 17.
[time=2448] Maybe somebody was already thinking about that out there.
[time=2452] John 15, let's start at verse 9.
[time=2456] "As the Father has loved me," Jesus said, "so have I loved you, abide in my love.
[time=2463] If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love.
[time=2466] Just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love."
[time=2472] These things I have spoken to you that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be full.
[time=2480] This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.
[time=2484] Greater love has no one than this, that someone laid down his life for his friends.
[time=2493] You are my friends if you do what I command you.
[time=2496] No longer do I call you servants.
[time=2498] For the servant does not know what his master is doing, but I have called you friends.
[time=2502] For all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you.
[time=2508] You did not choose me, but I chose you.
[time=2511] And appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give it to you.
[time=2518] These things I command you so that you will love one another.
[time=2524] Jesus wants us to love each other.
[time=2526] When he prayed in John 17, he prays and he's just praying like crazy, "Lord, would you please unify those who follow me?"
[time=2537] He wanted us to have experience unity in the body of Christ.
[time=2545] Greater love has no man than this, that he laid down his life for his friends.
[time=2552] That does not mean die.
[time=2557] That means live for.
[time=2564] I looked it up.
[time=2568] It does not mean that I am willing to die for you.
[time=2572] There were times long ago when I first understood this passage.
[time=2575] If I had a couple come in and, you know, sometimes they came to me first before I sent them to somebody who really knew how to do counseling.
[time=2583] But I often asked one of the spouses this.
[time=2587] Whichever spouse seemed to be the one that wanted to leave, I just asked this simple question.
[time=2591] Would you be willing if a life-threatening event took place?
[time=2597] Would you be willing to die in order to keep your spouse and children from dying?
[time=2605] They always said yes, and I think they meant it.
[time=2610] They were always willing to die for the people that they were living with in the family, but they weren't willing to live for them.
[time=2620] That's what this means.
[time=2622] Are you ready to lay your life down and live the rest of it on this Earth in obedience to Christ out of love for other people?
[time=2631] Now that's powerful.
[time=2636] That lay downward, just so you know I really did look it up, it means to put, to set, to place.
[time=2646] I place my life down, die to myself.
[time=2651] We'll look at that in a second, and then live for you.
[time=2661] Are you willing to live for your friends?
[time=2667] Jesus said that's the greatest love of all.
[time=2673] That made me think about Mark 8, turn to Mark 8, 34, and 35.
[time=2681] In Mark 8, this isn't just to the disciples.
[time=2688] This begins by saying and calling the crowd to him with his disciples, he said to them, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself."
[time=2702] That's what that John 15 passage is talking about.
[time=2705] Let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whoever would save his life will lose it.
[time=2718] Whoever loses his life for my sake and the Gospels will save it.
[time=2725] I suggest to you the greatest act of friendship that I have is picking up my cross saying,
[time=2736] "Lord, I'm dying to self today.
[time=2741] I'm not going to do just what I want to do.
[time=2743] Sometimes it actually works out that I get to do what I want to do and I get energized by that and it's fun.
[time=2749] Sometimes other things interrupt that and I want to be willing because I have my cross."
[time=2755] You know, carrying the cross down the street was a public profession that they were under authority.
[time=2765] The Romans didn't have people carry their cross just for no reason because they didn't want somebody else.
[time=2768] No, that was a clear picture that they were under the authority of Rome.
[time=2776] Is it clearly understood?
[time=2778] Do people see that you are carrying your cross because you are under the authority of the living God?
[time=2787] Have you picked up your cross?
[time=2790] Have you laid down your life and stayed living for others?
[time=2796] Jesus said, "That's the measure."
[time=2802] He must deny himself, "Choose humility." It's natural for me to desire pleasure.
[time=2812] It's natural for some of you to desire security.
[time=2819] We're typically bent that way.
[time=2821] A friend of mine of psychologists said that most people, about 75% of people, their selfishness is motivated out of fear of the future and insecurity that they might experience what they experienced
[time=2834] or what they didn't experience.
[time=2836] And their sinfulness is driven by their insecurity.
[time=2840] He said, "About 25% are like you, Steve." He pointed at me and goes, "You're just driven by your own pleasure." That felt bad, but I know it was true.
[time=2852] Desires of the flesh, lust of the eyes, meaning I possess things to make me experience pleasure.
[time=2860] Other people possess things because they're experiencing the pride of life.
[time=2864] They're so insecure, they're looking for a position that will give them security and that all the possessions, they accumulate that stuff in order to feel more secure when he's saying,
[time=2874] "Be secure in me.
[time=2876] Pick up your cross.
[time=2878] Get rid of that stuff.
[time=2880] Follow me.
[time=2881] Live for other people."
[time=2887] Follow me.
[time=2889] The tense of that verb is to keep on following.
[time=2894] Now, there's a day when we won't have to follow anymore because we're going to be with him.
[time=2898] He says we're going to be like him.
[time=2899] I don't get that.
[time=2901] But until then, what he wants us to do is what he did.
[time=2907] He laid down life in heaven with the Father.
[time=2914] Can you imagine?
[time=2917] He laid down life.
[time=2920] He picked up a cross even before he was born,
[time=2927] submitting to the one that he reported to God the Father.
[time=2937] He carried that thing for 33 years, investing in us, giving himself up.
[time=2946] Can you imagine going from what he was experiencing to life here like we live it?
[time=2952] And then taking on the sin that every one of us are guilty of.
[time=2958] He took it all.
[time=2960] He climbed on the cross that he carried.
[time=2965] He didn't just lay his life down and live.
[time=2968] He also laid his life down and died for us.
[time=2971] Like nobody else could.
[time=2974] Yeah, I'm thankful.
[time=2977] Christ laid down his life in submission to the Father for me,
[time=2984] for each and every one of you.
[time=2989] When he came to earth, he was constrained in flesh.
[time=2996] Can't imagine.
[time=2999] Then he carried his cross and he died for me.
[time=3003] And he said this.
[time=3006] He said to those disciples, "If you'll now do what I tell you to do, you're my friend."
[time=3017] Jonathan and David had a really good friendship.
[time=3021] I've had a really rich friendship with a lot of you, but I'll tell you right now, I'd give all that up to be his friend.
[time=3031] But the standard's really high.
[time=3034] He says to be his friend, he said, "Steve, keep my commandments." In humility, choose these people over you.
[time=3046] Consider them as more important than you.
[time=3049] Die to yourself today.
[time=3050] Pick up your cross, die today, and then do what's best for everybody else instead of what you want to do.
[time=3059] Well, that's a high calling.
[time=3061] But here's the incredible, wonderful truth.
[time=3065] He sent his spirit to dwell in us so that it's possible.
[time=3072] But I'll tell you, unless I'm feeding on him, unless I'm really aware of his presence, unless I'm in prayer yielding and listening and waiting on him and responding to him appropriately, unless I get the counsel of other people to make sure that I'm doing that right, unless it's in harmony with the Word of God.
[time=3092] I can do all kinds of things that I say are commandments and obedience, but if they're not aligned to what his ways are and his thoughts are, then it's not healthy.
[time=3102] I want to be his friend.
[time=3107] Father in heaven, you are our God.
[time=3115] Oh, the sacrifice that you made to give your Son so that he could be my friend and I could be his friend.
[time=3126] What an amazing thing that God would say it's possible.
[time=3132] I pray, Lord, that you'd help us.
[time=3135] Please, by your spirit, empower us to be the friends to other people in this interdependent community that we call church.
[time=3144] Would you help us, please, empower us to do things your way to love others the way they need to be loved.
[time=3152] Sometimes, Lord, it's comfort.
[time=3154] Sometimes it's confrontation.
[time=3157] Both are loved.
[time=3159] Would you help us, please?
[time=3161] We need to discern that well.
[time=3164] Thank you for Jonathan and David, Lord.
[time=3166] Thank you for the image that I saw when I think about you being between them and between their offspring, haven't ever thought about that before.
[time=3176] You need to be between every one of us so that we're focused on you and we see the others through your perspective, not ours.
[time=3186] Please help us.
[time=3187] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
