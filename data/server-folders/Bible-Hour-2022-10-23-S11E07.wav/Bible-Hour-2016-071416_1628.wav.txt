[time=1] - Good morning.
[time=2] My heart is so full of worship.
[time=4] How about you?
[time=5] Thank you, worship team.
[time=7] Thank you so much, Darren, and the way you lead that team and the wonderful things that we get to participate here in here at Blackhawk.
[time=14] Just a moment ago, we sang one of my favorite songs right now, because you know favorite songs come and flow in cycles in your life.
[time=21] Flawless.
[time=23] No matter the bumps, no matter the bruises, no matter the scars, the cross has made you flawless.
[time=29] No matter how the hurt or how deep the wound is.
[time=32] And that's what we believe here at Blackhawk.
[time=34] It doesn't matter where you are, where you've been, what's going on.
[time=37] When you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior, the cross makes you flawless.
[time=41] Amen?
[time=43] Oh man, that's just a beautiful song.
[time=44] I'm so thankful that we got to sing that.
[time=46] Like most people, many adults, I graduated from my school and I was starting out to try to find my way in life.
[time=54] And I said to myself, what do I want to do?
[time=56] Who do I want to become?
[time=58] And I really only ever had one passion in my life.
[time=61] And that was to play Major League Baseball.
[time=63] Oh, you laugh.
[time=66] But I had a real, I could hit.
[time=68] I was a good third baseman and I had a good arm.
[time=70] I said, that's what I'm going to do.
[time=73] It's only I cared about.
[time=74] I went away to college and made the baseball team.
[time=76] And after just about two or three weeks after the roster was finalized, before we played our very first game, God showed up and he said, no, Rich, you're not playing baseball.
[time=89] He said, baseball is not in my plan for you, but I was 18 years old, I was headstrong, you know how that is, right?
[time=95] And I thought, and I really didn't have a chance, to be honest with you, now that I'm 52, almost 52, I understand I wasn't that good.
[time=101] But at that time, I thought I was.
[time=103] But God said, no, you're not going to play baseball.
[time=106] See, we were in the outfield and we were taking batting practice and a ball was hit out to me and I picked it up and I came up here and my friend Greg was rounding second and he yelled, Rich, I'm going to third.
[time=116] So, of course, I step up and I go right about here and you know, I don't know if I ever threw Greg out, I don't know if the ball even made it to the infield because when it got to about right here, I felt a horrible pop and a tear and searing pain.
[time=130] And my brother Matt Hicks could probably tell you a whole lot more about that than I can, but what I can tell you is this, that this right here, things in here were loose.
[time=138] They were not attached the way God had designed them.
[time=141] I was in pain.
[time=143] I'd never had an athletic injury before and so I was stubborn.
[time=146] I went back to my dorm and I couldn't lift my arm up.
[time=148] I couldn't write my homework.
[time=150] My roommate helped me put on my shirt.
[time=152] The next day I show up to practice.
[time=154] I'm going to fight through this.
[time=156] I'm good, I figured, you know, I'll heal, it's all good.
[time=159] I'm at third base, we're taking an infield and I picked the ball up, I can't throw it anymore.
[time=163] And for those of you that know anything about baseball, I went from being a guy they had potentially thought could be a pitcher to, I couldn't throw the ball from third to first in the air with every ounce of physical strength I had.
[time=175] Probably did more damage to it, didn't I, Matt, by trying.
[time=178] You know, I was trying to throw, I couldn't do it anymore.
[time=180] The coach and I said, well, I need to go see medical attention so I did.
[time=184] And after all the tests and all the time and all the diagnostics and all the consultation, here's what became very apparent to me.
[time=191] My baseball career was over.
[time=192] And I never, ever played baseball again.
[time=197] Now I would love to tell you that I dropped to my knees and I said, father, thank you for being so clear in my life.
[time=203] Thank you for leading me in such a way that there is no question of what you want me to do.
[time=210] Thank you, Lord, but I didn't do that, I was crushed.
[time=214] 'Cause the only thing that I really wanted to do in life, the only thing that I thought I had skill was to play baseball and that was taken from me emphatically at that moment done, gone no more.
[time=227] It hurt physically and emotionally, I did all the what ifs and y-me's and all that kind of thing.
[time=233] But you know, one thing I did not do, I did not look to heaven and thank my heavenly father.
[time=237] See, sometimes we have a desire or a passion.
[time=240] In and of itself is not a bad thing, but maybe it's not what God planned for you and that's what happened to me.
[time=249] And sometimes God may need to step in and say, no, no.
[time=254] And how do we handle it when that happens?
[time=256] Well, King David faced just a situation in 2 Samuel, chapter seven.
[time=261] This is the very same David that defeated Goliath when he and then he ran in hiding in fear from Saul.
[time=268] He pretended to be a madman among the Philistines, committed adultery with Bathsheba and premeditated murder of Uriah and someone of whom God spoke of in Acts, chapter 13, verse 22, take a look at that.
[time=281] And when he had removed him, Saul, he raised up David to be their king of whom he, that's God testified and said, I have found in David, the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart who will do all my will.
[time=295] That's what God thought of David.
[time=297] Now let's take a look at how no played out in the life of someone who God said was a man after his own heart.
[time=305] 'Cause David had a desire in 2 Samuel, chapter seven, verse one, David's desire was to build a temple for the Ark of the Covenant.
[time=315] The Ark of the Covenant had traveled with the Israelites throughout the wilderness and it was housed inside of a tent that God had designed, God had told them to build.
[time=323] That's where it lived.
[time=324] David in chapter seven, verse one, and thank you for reading that for us, just a little bit of Gokani.
[time=330] David lived in his house and the Lord had given him rest from all his surrounding enemies.
[time=334] Here's David sitting in there, notice it says, given him rest from a surrounding enemy, enemies, Israel was experiencing peace.
[time=344] That's, we don't understand that.
[time=345] Israel doesn't experience peace these days.
[time=347] Back then, there was peace.
[time=349] David was peaceful, so he started to reflect.
[time=351] And he said, you know what, I live in this beautiful house, this beautiful mansion or castle or whatever you want to call it, but it was a beautiful place made of cedar.
[time=358] And he's thinking, you know what, God's covenant.
[time=361] That which represents God is living in a tent.
[time=364] I want to do something about that.
[time=365] And so David was going to build a tabernacle for the Ark of the Covenant.
[time=370] So the first thing he did, he did, he didn't go to God.
[time=373] The first thing he did was he called in his buddy Nathan.
[time=375] Now Nathan was a prophet.
[time=377] He brought Nathan and he said, you know what, this is what's happened.
[time=381] And I want to be able to build this tabernacle for God.
[time=385] Nathan said, go do it.
[time=388] That's a great thing.
[time=389] You want to please God, you want to honor God.
[time=391] Have at it, David.
[time=393] Now remember, David was a warrior and he was an Israeli champion.
[time=397] That will come back later in our service today and figure out why.
[time=401] God had not instructed David to do this.
[time=409] God did not lay the plan out for David to do this.
[time=411] Was it a bad thing?
[time=413] No.
[time=413] Was it a bad thing for Rich to want to play baseball?
[time=417] No, that's not a bad thing.
[time=418] And there, I'm going to tell you right now, I'm going to get to heaven someday and I'm going to high five some major league baseball players because that's not a bad desire.
[time=426] Just like this was not a bad desire for David to do this.
[time=429] However, God had not chosen David to do that.
[time=433] And so God responds to David's desire in verse four.
[time=439] But that same night, the word of the Lord came to Nathan.
[time=442] "Go and tell my servant David, thus says the Lord.
[time=445] Would you build me a house to dwell in?
[time=447] Another translation might say, are you the one who should build a temple for me?
[time=452] I've not lived in a house since the day I came up out of Israel, brought my people out of Israel from Egypt to this day.
[time=458] But I've been moving about an attempt for my dwelling.
[time=460] Here's basically what's happening.
[time=462] God is telling Nathan, hey, I want you to tell David this.
[time=465] I want David to understand, I have been an attempt since I took you out of Egypt.
[time=469] I didn't ask anybody to build me a temple.
[time=472] I didn't ask anybody to do that.
[time=474] Why would I ask you?
[time=475] Because see, God dwelled in a tent.
[time=479] Why His people dwelled in a tent?
[time=483] And so God would want to be with His people.
[time=485] Jesus Christ came to the earth to be with His people.
[time=488] David, I'm sorry, God corrected Nathan.
[time=495] And here's an example where we have it in the Old Testament of a prophet, of God, who got it all wrong.
[time=501] He gave him counsel without seeking counsel from God first.
[time=506] Even though they were prophets, they were not perfect.
[time=509] We know that, they still needed to go to the Lord.
[time=513] Now, this entire, this entire, these few verses, David and Nathan would have understand that, of God saying, no, you're not going to build the temple.
[time=524] You're not going to build the temple.
[time=527] God just told David no.
[time=532] But when God says no, it's because he has a better plan.
[time=536] Rich Taverni was not to be a baseball player.
[time=538] God had a different plan for him, just like God had a different plan for David.
[time=543] When Connie read this earlier, she took us through verse eight.
[time=549] Let's take a look there.
[time=550] Now therefore, "Thus you shall say to my servant David, "Thus says the Lord of hosts, "I took you from the pasture from following sheep.
[time=556] "God is giving David a little bit of a history lesson.
[time=559] "You are a sheep herder.
[time=560] "I brought you out of that.
[time=562] "I anointed you to be the new king.
[time=564] "I cut off all your enemies in verse nine.
[time=567] "Those who were pursuing you, I cut them off "so they couldn't catch you.
[time=571] "I always thought this was interesting.
[time=573] "David was anointed by Samuel to be the next king of Israel, "yet he ran in fear from Saul.
[time=579] "God said, you're going to be the next king.
[time=581] "I would have been like, cool.
[time=583] "That's great, I'm going to be the king.
[time=584] "I wouldn't have wanted to be the king." But David knew he was going to be the king, yet he was in fear of a man, Saul, and so he ran.
[time=593] I always found that to be very interesting.
[time=595] And then notice at the end of verse nine, God calls David one of the great ones of the earth.
[time=600] Remember we said earlier about David, all the mistakes David made, all the missteps that David made?
[time=606] God calls him one of the great ones of the earth.
[time=608] God just elevated him up into Moses and Abraham and Adam, all those great men of the faith at that point.
[time=616] That's what God does with David, a man after God's own heart.
[time=620] This is the beginning of the God's covenant with David.
[time=625] Tiberius took us through God's covenant with Abraham, the Abrahamic covenant.
[time=630] Remember three things, great name, great nation, great land, right?
[time=635] Well now God is giving a covenant to David.
[time=638] So we're just going to look at these verses again and look at how many promises God makes to David.
[time=644] Here we go.
[time=646] Verse 10, I will appoint a place for my people Israel and we'll plant them.
[time=651] We talk about planting them, that's permanency.
[time=655] So that they may dwell in their own place and be disturbed no more.
[time=659] Is that currently happening in Israel?
[time=661] Is Israel being disturbed no more?
[time=664] No, that's not happening.
[time=665] They're always in conflict.
[time=668] Well, scholars would say that time hasn't come yet.
[time=672] So we're still anticipating and waiting for that time and violent men shall afflict them no more.
[time=676] God promises Israel their own land.
[time=678] In verse 11, God promises David rest from his enemies.
[time=682] When he says, "I will give you rest from all your enemies." And then God says, and this is interesting, look at the end of verse 11.
[time=690] He says, "The Lord declares to you that the Lord will make you a house." Wasn't it David's desire to build God a house?
[time=697] God flips the tables and he's going to build David a house.
[time=700] The difference between God's house and David's house that he would build, David would have built a tabernacle that could have been destroyed.
[time=707] God is going to build David a house that is going to be permanent forever.
[time=713] That's going to be a dynasty.
[time=715] And David isn't even realizing it.
[time=717] Verse 12, "When your days are filled, you will lie down.
[time=721] That's when you die.
[time=722] I will raise up your offspring." That word offspring represents Solomon at this point.
[time=728] I will raise up your offspring after you who shall come from your body and I will establish his kingdom.
[time=734] He shall build a house for my name and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
[time=739] Now the next few verses and all of this part about the Davidic Covenant.
[time=742] There is a lot of theology in here and we don't have time to go through all of that.
[time=746] But there is a lot of theology and the transitions back and forth between talking about Solomon and Jesus or the Messiah.
[time=753] And we'll talk about that just a little bit, but we really need, we need several weeks to really develop the Davidic Covenant.
[time=760] So we won't do that today because you guys probably want to leave soon.
[time=765] But notice that Solomon is tasked with building the temple that David wanted to build.
[time=772] Verse 14, "I will be to him, a father, and he shall be to me a son.
[time=779] When he commits iniquity, I will discipline him with a rod of men, with the stripes of the son of men.
[time=784] But my steadfast love will not depart from him." And that's a difference between you and I and God.
[time=789] God has steadfast love.
[time=791] It doesn't matter what you or I do.
[time=794] God still loves us, correct?
[time=796] We are fickle as human beings and sometimes our love can come and go.
[time=800] God's not that way.
[time=802] Verse 16, "And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever be for me." There's the word forever, meaning that David's dynasty will last forever.
[time=815] And to me that means even into eternity and your throne shall be established forever.
[time=821] And those words that are used in that verse are referring now not just to Solomon, but now we're talking about the Messiah.
[time=828] I wanna read these words and I want you to hear them again and keep them in your mind 'cause we're gonna kick ahead to another verse.
[time=834] "Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me.
[time=838] Your throne shall be established forever." Let's take a look why we know this refers to our Messiah, Jesus.
[time=847] We're gonna jump ahead to Luke chapter one verse 30.
[time=850] Luke chapter one verse 30 and the angel said to her, and this is Gabriel announcing to Mary the birth of Jesus, do not be afraid Mary for you have found favor in God.
[time=861] And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son and you shall call his name Jesus.
[time=867] He will be great and will be called the son of the Most High and the Lord will give to him the throne of his father, David.
[time=874] The throne that was just prophesied in 2 Samuel chapter seven that would last forever right there.
[time=879] That throne is given to Jesus Christ and he, Jesus, will reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there will be no end.
[time=888] So God during the Davidic covenant is revealing his plan for future events, part of that to David and letting David know that his line is going to rule forever.
[time=900] That's exciting.
[time=901] David's desire was to build a house for God
[time=907] and God told him no, but you know what?
[time=909] David, God loved David's heart.
[time=912] He loved that David desired to build an Ark of the Covenant by building a temple, but God turned the tables and honored David by making the covenant with him and David responds with a prayer of gratitude.
[time=926] After hearing everything God had planned, David sat before the Lord and humbly offered his prayer of thanksgiving.
[time=932] I've asked Jared to come and to read David's prayer.
[time=936] As you hear these words, please listen to David's heart.
[time=942] (silence) - Then King David went in and sat before the Lord
[time=955] and said, "Who am I, O Lord God, "and what is my house that you have brought me thus far?
[time=964] "And yet this was a small thing in your eyes, O Lord God.
[time=971] "You have spoken also of your servant's house "for a great while to come, "and this is instruction for mankind, O Lord God.
[time=981] "And what more can David say to you "for you know your servant, O Lord God, "because of your promise and according to your own heart,
[time=996] "you have brought about all this greatness "to make your servant know it.
[time=1001] "Therefore you are great, O Lord God,
[time=1008] "for there is none like you, "and there is no God besides you, "according to all that we have heard with our ears.
[time=1016] "And who is like your people, Israel, "the one nation on earth whom God went to redeem "to be his people, making himself a name "and doing for them great and awesome things "by driving out before your people "whom you redeemed for yourself from Egypt, "a nation and its gods.
[time=1042] "And you established yourself, "your for yourself, your people, Israel, "to be your people forever.
[time=1054] "And you, O Lord, became their God." - Have you ever just poured your heart out to God in prayer?
[time=1065] Until you just didn't have anything left to say.
[time=1068] That's the state that David was in.
[time=1071] Did you hear the heart in those words?
[time=1075] His recognition, his humble recognition of God's power and authority in his life.
[time=1082] That's how David responded when God said no.
[time=1084] He responded through humble prayer.
[time=1090] I can just imagine him sitting there, worshiping God, his heart soft and overflowing with gratitude and probably feeling pretty overwhelmed that the God of all the universe just did this for him.
[time=1104] But then it didn't stop there.
[time=1106] David got up and passionately pursued God's plan.
[time=1111] Let's take a look at David's response action in First Chronicles, verse chapter 28.
[time=1118] Not only did David respond in thankful prayer, humble prayer, but then David got up and he did something.
[time=1127] He did something.
[time=1130] First Chronicles 28 verse one, David assembled at Jerusalem all the officials of Israel, the officials of the tribes, the officers of the divisions that served the king, the commanders of thousands, hundreds.
[time=1141] He brought everybody in.
[time=1143] And this is what he says in verse two.
[time=1145] King David rose to his feet and said, "Hear me, my brothers and my people." I had it in my heart to build a house of rest for the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and for the footstool of our God.
[time=1155] And I made preparations for the building.
[time=1157] But God said to me, you may not build a house for my name, for you are a man of war and have shed blood.
[time=1164] All those years of David's life, of him being a warrior and a champion for Israel, disqualified him to build the temple.
[time=1173] Yet the Lord God of Israel chose from me, chose me from all my father's house to be king over Israel forever.
[time=1181] There's he's recognizing God's prophecy.
[time=1184] He chose Judah as leader in the house of Judah, my father's house, and among my father's sons, he took pleasure in me to make me king over Israel.
[time=1191] And of all my sons, he has chosen Solomon, my son, to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel.
[time=1202] He recognizes Solomon is the one God has chosen to build the temple.
[time=1208] In verse six, it is Solomon, your son, who shall build my house and my courts.
[time=1212] For I have chosen him to be my son and I will be his father.
[time=1216] I will establish his kingdom forever if he continues strong and keeping my commandments and my rules as he is today.
[time=1222] So not only did David offer a prayer of gratitude and thanksgiving to the Lord, he went out and did something.
[time=1228] He gathered all the people of Israel, all the leaders.
[time=1231] And he said, hey, listen, I wanted to do this.
[time=1234] I wanted to build the temple.
[time=1235] God said, no, I'm okay with that.
[time=1238] And you know what?
[time=1238] He chose my son Solomon to do it.
[time=1240] I'm good with that.
[time=1242] When my arms snapped in college, I should have, I gotta said, thank you Lord.
[time=1248] I'm ready to go on to your next path.
[time=1251] But I chose a different response than our brother, David.
[time=1255] David's first action was to share God's plan with his people.
[time=1260] But he doesn't stop there.
[time=1261] Later in the chapter, he shows Solomon the building plans if you continue to read there.
[time=1266] And all the specifics about the temple, he brings Solomon in and shows him, this is how it's supposed to be.
[time=1271] This is what it's supposed to look like.
[time=1274] David then, at the end of the chapter, commissions all the skillful and willing men in Israel to be available to work on the temple.
[time=1281] David knows he's not gonna do it, but Solomon's gonna need help.
[time=1284] So he says, all those guys that have the skills, they're yours.
[time=1287] If they're willing, they're yours.
[time=1289] And then David, in chapter 29, goes farther.
[time=1296] And he says, moreover, in verse three, more on addition to all that I have provided for the Holy House, I have a treasure of my own gold and silver.
[time=1308] And because of my devotion to the house of my God, I will give it to the house of God.
[time=1313] 3,000 talents of gold.
[time=1317] According to Dr. John MacArthur, is that talent is 75 pounds.
[time=1321] If that's the case, then we're talking about 112 tons of gold.
[time=1326] Let that sink in a second.
[time=1329] That's what David pulled out of his bank account to send it to build the temple.
[time=1333] 112 tons of gold.
[time=1336] In today's market, that's about $4.8 billion that David handed over.
[time=1341] And then he goes on 7,000 talents of refined silver.
[time=1346] That's another one plus billion dollars.
[time=1349] This is just what David is contributing.
[time=1351] David is becoming vested in this project.
[time=1355] But then he says to the leaders, he said, "Hey, who will then offer willingly "consecrating himself to the Lord in verse seven?" At the end of verse seven, he's asking the leaders, "Are you going to join me?
[time=1369] "What are you going to give to this project?" And in verse six, it says, "The leaders and fathers of the house "made their free will offerings, "as did all the leaders of the tribes, "the commanders of thousands, hundreds, "and the offers of the king work.
[time=1381] "They gave for the service of the house 5,000 talents." At 75 pounds per talent, that's 187 tons of gold.
[time=1393] That the children of Israel brought to the project of building the temple.
[time=1399] That's why it has been revered over history as one of the greatest architectural feats, one of the most beautiful places ever constructed.
[time=1406] Look what was contributed for this.
[time=1408] Like take a look at verse nine.
[time=1414] And this is really interesting.
[time=1416] And in the heart of Christians, here we go, then the people rejoiced because they had given willingly.
[time=1422] For with their whole heart, they had offered freely to the Lord, David the king also rejoiced greatly.
[time=1429] They not only gave it, but they gave it willing and they were excited about it.
[time=1432] David instead of high-fiving everybody running around and saying, "What a great job we did.
[time=1438] "We got it done." David once again returns to prayer.
[time=1444] Oh no, it's going to read this prayer because if I don't read the prayer, I will quote it in a different version.
[time=1448] So, Steve, you guys will enjoy this verse.
[time=1452] David therefore blessed the Lord in the presence of all the assembly.
[time=1455] And David said, "Blessed are you, O Lord, "the God of Israel, our Father, forever and ever." Yours, O Lord, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty.
[time=1466] For all that is in the heavens and the earth is yours.
[time=1469] Yours is the kingdom, O Lord, and you were exalted as head above all.
[time=1474] Both riches and honor come from you alone and you rule over all.
[time=1479] In your hand our power and might and in your hand it is to make great and to give strength to all.
[time=1485] And now we thank you, our God, and praise your glorious name.
[time=1489] Once again, he enters in humble prayer before the Lord of thanksgiving.
[time=1495] When God said no to David, David sat before the Lord in humble prayer and thanksgiving, but he didn't stop there.
[time=1501] He didn't just pray and say, "Okay, okay God, I'm with you." He did something.
[time=1506] He got up and did something.
[time=1508] He jumped in with all of his heart and did what he could to prepare the way for his son Solomon to build the temple.
[time=1514] When God says no as Christians, we need to praise him
[time=1520] because he has something better and then we need to jump in with all of our heart, just like David.
[time=1526] I know that's hard.
[time=1531] Because in the fall of 1982, I was sitting in my dorm room and I didn't want anything to do with a new plan.
[time=1538] I wanted to go back to the original plan.
[time=1540] I liked that plan.
[time=1541] About a year later, I got medical clearance after all the stuff and the rehab and all that kind of stuff.
[time=1551] I got medical clearance to play baseball again, but you know what?
[time=1553] My heart wasn't there anymore.
[time=1556] God had used that year to take my heart and to refocus my energies and my passion to making a difference in the lives of kids forever.
[time=1565] That's what God did.
[time=1566] God shows a much better path for me.
[time=1570] So when we hear no, when we hear no, that's just simply, and you've been told this before, that's because God has a different plan.
[time=1579] But how do we do that?
[time=1581] How do we do it?
[time=1582] Well, the first thing we do is we pray.
[time=1586] Talk about prayer a lot here at Blackhawk, and here's the reason we talk about prayer a lot, because it's the right answer.
[time=1593] It is the right answer.
[time=1595] Prayer is not us giving God directions, giving him a list of do's and a to-do list.
[time=1602] That's not what prayer is.
[time=1604] Prayer is aligning our hearts with God's will.
[time=1607] That's what prayer is.
[time=1608] Take a look at a couple of verses we have for you on prayer.
[time=1613] First of all, Colossians 4-2, continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it and thanksgiving.
[time=1619] Steadfast is passion.
[time=1622] That's committed passion, remaining steadfast.
[time=1626] And back in second Samuel chapter seven, we talked about God's steadfast love that never goes away.
[time=1632] This tells us to remain steadfast in prayer, always having an attitude of prayer.
[time=1638] First Thessalonians 5-17 says pray without ceasing,
[time=1644] always communicating with the Lord.
[time=1647] Does that mean that I'm always on my knees and I'm not being productive in life?
[time=1651] No, that's not what that means.
[time=1652] But I always have an attitude of prayer.
[time=1655] I'm always communicating with God.
[time=1656] I'm thanking him along the way.
[time=1658] I'm asking for help along the way.
[time=1660] That's praying without ceasing.
[time=1665] The great Reformationist Martin Luther said to be a Christian without prayer is no more possible than to be alive without breathing.
[time=1676] That's how significant prayer needs to be in our Christian walk in our day to day.
[time=1681] Next, we need to read God's word.
[time=1684] We need to read his word.
[time=1687] Romans 10-17 says so faith comes from hearing and hearing through the word of Christ.
[time=1692] Psalm 119-105 says your word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.
[time=1698] Reading God's word is essential.
[time=1702] And it doesn't matter how you do it.
[time=1704] If you do it in the Bible, if you have a physical copy of the Bible you can read there.
[time=1710] If you don't have one and you want one, there's one in the back of the pew, you can just take that home with you.
[time=1714] If you read it on your iPad or maybe your phone or some smart device, it doesn't matter how you read it, read it because here's what I know.
[time=1723] When you are reading the Bible with a passion, when you are reading the Bible with purpose to learn, to understand and to develop the word of God in your heart, that book does something to you.
[time=1736] It does something to you.
[time=1739] It grows you.
[time=1742] It changes your attitude.
[time=1743] It changes your perspective.
[time=1744] It changes your outlook on life.
[time=1746] It changes you.
[time=1748] If you are reading it with a desire to know God more,
[time=1754] I saw this post and I thought it was applicable.
[time=1758] It says complaining about a silent God while your Bible is closed, is like complaining about not getting texts when your phone is turned off.
[time=1767] God gave us his living word.
[time=1772] Communicate with God in a couple of ways.
[time=1775] One, we communicate with him through prayer and he communicates with us through the Bible.
[time=1780] God can communicate through us with prayer and he can communicate through us with his word.
[time=1785] We can't dismiss those things.
[time=1788] Read our Bible.
[time=1789] Pray.
[time=1792] Next, always remain humble.
[time=1795] David, when he was told no, he took on a posture of humility.
[time=1800] When David, even when they rejoiced at all of the materials
[time=1806] that they had raised to build the temple, he still responded in humility.
[time=1811] James 410 says, humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you.
[time=1817] The word there tells us if we're gonna go ahead and exalt ourself, then God is not gonna do it for us, he wants us humble.
[time=1825] And then at the right time, he will exalt us if that's his plan.
[time=1828] A much stronger verse, I think even, is in first Peter chapter five, verses five to six, likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the elders, close yourself, all of you with humility toward one another.
[time=1842] For God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.
[time=1846] Let's work that out a little bit.
[time=1848] God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.
[time=1852] God opposes the proud, which means if I am running life on my own terms, that's pride.
[time=1857] Opposition means this, that's what I'm doing.
[time=1861] I am putting myself in direct opposition with God.
[time=1864] Dude, is that where you wanna live?
[time=1866] No, we don't wanna live there.
[time=1868] We don't wanna be proud because when we are proud, the Bible tells us right there, we are in direct opposition with God.
[time=1874] That's no fun.
[time=1877] He continues and said but he gives grace to the humble.
[time=1882] What is humble?
[time=1885] Humble means that I'm thinking less of myself and more of others, putting others ahead of me.
[time=1891] Striving to meet the needs of the other and to respond to God rather than waking up and thinking about how I can fill my day with me.
[time=1899] I do that, do you do that sometimes?
[time=1903] How am I gonna fill my day with me?
[time=1906] God says we need to be humble.
[time=1908] Verse six, humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, so that the proper time he may exalt you.
[time=1915] Not only should we pray, put ourselves in a position where we are at the feet of the Father and we are offering ourselves to come in line with his will, but we are to read his word so that his word can mold us and shape us and develop us.
[time=1931] The verse in Psalms said, "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path." Notice it doesn't say our feet and our path.
[time=1941] It specifically says my feet and my path.
[time=1943] I have a responsibility to jump in the word individually, myself and God will be the direction.
[time=1952] And then we need to remain humble, to remain humble.
[time=1956] It's not about us, it's never been about us.
[time=1960] Never been about us.
[time=1964] It's always been about the Lord.
[time=1966] And then finally, yearn for the heart of God.
[time=1969] Yarn for the heart of God.
[time=1972] Yurning means passionately pursuing, yearning.
[time=1976] When you are thirsty, have you ever gone a long time without water and you're like, it's really thirsty?
[time=1984] Man, there's this thing in you and it's like, you're gonna do whatever you gotta do to get water.
[time=1990] Or if you've ever fasted for a day or two days or three days, and then all of a sudden there's like a bowl of ice cream, you're like all over it 'cause you want something to eat.
[time=1999] There's a yearning inside of you.
[time=2001] Psalm 63, more words from David,
[time=2009] the man after God's own heart.
[time=2010] Listen to his yearning here.
[time=2013] Oh God, you are my God.
[time=2016] Earnestly I seek you.
[time=2018] My soul thirsts for you.
[time=2020] My flesh faints for you as in a dry and weary land where there is no water.
[time=2026] So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary, beholding your power and glory because your steadfast love is better than life.
[time=2033] My lips will praise you.
[time=2035] So I will bless you as long as I live.
[time=2038] In your name I will lift my hands.
[time=2040] David is yearning for the heart of God.
[time=2043] As Christians we ought to yearn for the heart of God.
[time=2047] And then one more verse for you, John 635 and this is Jesus.
[time=2053] Jesus said, I am the bread of life.
[time=2054] Whoever comes to me shall not hunger and whoever believes in me shall never thirst.
[time=2058] He uses two very powerful emotions or powerful physical feelings in our lives, thirst and hunger to represent the connection with Jesus Christ because those are very, very powerful things in our hearts, in our lives, thirst and hunger.
[time=2073] And that's what we should do.
[time=2074] We should thirst and hunger for Jesus Christ.
[time=2077] We should yearn for the heart of God.
[time=2084] Sometimes when we have a passion, we plan out an event or direction for our lives, God steps in and in some way stops us as if to say no.
[time=2093] Now we are humans, so we could, we do have free will,
[time=2099] so we could have, excuse me, so we could push on and force the issue.
[time=2103] You know, David, he could have gotten up and started building the temple, couldn't have he?
[time=2106] He could have, he had the resources.
[time=2107] I mean, he donated like five, six billion dollars.
[time=2110] Or he had the resources, he could have started the project, but he submitted to the will of God.
[time=2116] One thing, and that's what should separate us
[time=2122] as Christians from the world is our willingness to submit to the will of God, to put aside our desires and respond to him.
[time=2131] For us, this should be the ultimate privilege and that will create within us a refocused passion.
[time=2140] Father in heaven, I love you and I thank you for this day.
[time=2142] I thank you that you love us, that you gave your son to die in a cross for us and that you always have our best interest at heart.
[time=2151] And Lord, sometimes as human beings, we come up with plans, we come up with ideas, we come up with passions that we want to pursue, that not necessarily are bad, but they fall outside of your plan for us.
[time=2162] Lord, thank you.
[time=2164] Thank you that you step forward and say no, because when you say no, that means there's something better for us.
[time=2172] And that's difficult sometimes for us to digest, it's difficult for us to accept, but Lord, help us to pray.
[time=2179] Help us prayer to be a driving force in our lives and reading your word and being connected to you and Lord, we desire to remain humble and Lord, we yearn for your spirit and for your heart in Jesus' name, amen.
