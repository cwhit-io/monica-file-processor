[time=30] [MUSIC]
[time=61] I think you're lying, but I've heard the tender whisper of love in the dead of night and you tell me that you're reasoning that I never knew.
[time=82] [MUSIC - 210 seconds]
[time=302] [APPLAUSE]
[time=321] Before we sing the next song, let me read this verse to you.
[time=325] One of the ways that God loves us is not just in what he rescues us from, but what he protects us from in the future, Psalm 124 says.
[time=334] If it had not been the Lord who was on our side led Israel saying, if it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when the people rose up against us, then they would have swallowed us up alive.
[time=347] When their anger was kindled against us, then the flood would have swept us away, the torrent would have gone over us, then over us would have gone the raging waters.
[time=357] I don't really know the exact scenario that was happening here, probably some sort of battle, some sort of conflict with Israel, and they decided to sing together as a people, this refrain of if you weren't on our side, craziness would have happened.
[time=373] We would have died, the waters, the evil, the enemy, all of this, that and the other.
[time=378] And I love that the Psalmist kind of pricks his imagination and he says, "Okay, God, I know that you rescued me, but I want to thank you for what you didn't rescue me from directly, but that you could have rescued me from if it were that I was alone and you were not on my side."
[time=395] Sometimes in my life, I forget to take inventory of the things that God saved me from in advance.
[time=404] If the Lord had not been on my side when I was five years old, would I have given my heart to Jesus?
[time=409] If the Lord had not been on my side when I was thirteen, would I not have decided to follow him wherever he would call me to go?
[time=416] And if the Lord had not been on my side, what about this and what about that?
[time=419] And how would I have ended up? And God, thank you not just for what I know you saved me from, but thanks for the "what if" scenarios too that you saved me from me.
[time=427] So as we sing and worship our God today, just let your imagination kind of go with what God saved you from and what your life would look like if the Lord had not been on your side today.
[time=449] Let it be Jesus, the first name that I call, let it be Jesus.
[time=476] My son inside the storm, never need another.
[time=489] For me to live is Christ, for me to live is Christ.
[time=503] God agrees your name above everything, let it be, let it be Jesus.
[time=520] Let it be Jesus, for the rising of the sun, let it be Jesus.
[time=541] All is said and done.
[time=548] I never need another, Jesus there's no other for me to live is Christ, for me to live is Christ.
[time=568] God, I agree your name above everything, let it be, let it be Jesus.
[time=589] Let it be Jesus, for the rising of the sun, let it be Jesus, for the rising of the sun, let it be Jesus.
[time=615] Let it be Jesus, let it be, let it be for me to live is Christ.
[time=632] God agrees your name above everything, let it be, let it be Jesus.
[time=658] Father in heaven let that be our anthem this morning, that our lives would be totally and fully dedicated to you, for us to live is Christ.
[time=672] To live is Christ, for us God means that we make our decisions based on the words of Christ, that we let our hearts be filled with the passion of Christ,
[time=683] that we make our plans for today and our plans for the future based on the calling of Christ, that we evaluate others based on the truth of Christ.
[time=696] God, I pray that as we sing these songs today that it would be more than words that pass our lips, but that they would be the prayers of our hearts.
[time=709] Should I ever be a banner? Should I ever be a claim? Should I ever be surrounded by the fire and the flame?
[time=723] There's a name I will remember, there's a name I will prepare, let it be, let it be Jesus.
[time=736] Let it be, let it be, let it be for me to live is Christ.
[time=752] Let it be, let it be Jesus, let it be Jesus.
[time=782] [AMEN]
[time=793] Thanks for singing those songs with us, you may be seated for now.
[time=797] Just by way of introduction, I'm kind of a new face, new voice this summer, my name is Corbin.
[time=806] I used to serve here at Black Hawk for years, and now my family and I continue to serve via Black Hawk with a new organization called Josiah Venture in Poland.
[time=815] The shortest singer of the morning, who's walking my way right now, is my daughter Vivi, and she's doing a great job.
[time=827] She's not nervous at all, all the adults are nervous to sing on stage, but not her.
[time=833] We're actually in a church situation that's pretty different from Black Hawk.
[time=838] Right now, we're part of a home church community in Poland, and so we have a church that meets in our home three weeks a month.
[time=849] And then once a month, we meet with other churches in kind of like a community center, and so the environment is totally different, and it's totally Polish.
[time=859] And so when you have a really, really small church setting, you have to ask all sorts of helpers to lead worship and things like that.
[time=866] And so Viv's like a huge part of the worship leading process in our home, and actually her sisters do a great job of playing the hand drums and doing all sorts of things.
[time=874] So it's a really fun thing that we get to do.
[time=877] So this morning, we wanted to share with you one of the songs that we like to sing in our home church, and we're going to do it in Polish, because it's like normal for us to sing this song in Polish.
[time=886] There is an English version, and we'll put the words on the screen so you can have some meaning in context.
[time=891] I don't know it in English.
[time=892] You don't.
[time=893] That's true.
[time=895] She just figured out this, and we're like, "Ah, there's an English version to that?" So that's just normal life for us these days, so we're going to sing it for you now.
[time=916] [MUSIC - 237 seconds]
[time=1168] Great morning so far, a time of worship, praise, singing to the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and celebrating with our own missionaries that we've sent here from our church.
[time=1180] Before I introduce our speaker, I need to make a PDT announcement.
[time=1187] The PDT has been working very hard, as you know, and has been interviewing several candidates listening to a lot of messages, and they have some exciting news for us, which they'll be sharing with you next week.
[time=1200] [Laughter] So make sure you're here to find out about that.
[time=1207] Our speaker, Bob Provost, I first heard the name Bob Provost in 1982.
[time=1215] Bob was a pastor at a church called the Chapel in Akron, Ohio.
[time=1220] God then used him to go from the church there to become the Executive Vice President to the Master's Seminary in College.
[time=1229] God then directed him to work with the Senate International since 1994, he's been the President of Slavic Gospel Association.
[time=1238] He's no stranger to Black Hawk, he's preached here before, he's been here many times, but God has used this servant of Jesus Christ in a mighty way to reach thousands of people as you'll hear about today.
[time=1253] We talked in the first hour and also he'll be speaking at six o'clock tonight, so for those of you who want to learn more about the ministry, make sure you're back tonight at six o'clock.
[time=1264] But God has used Bob in a mighty way, lots of roles, he has his Masters from Grace Seminary, which I applaud, and not only that, he has his Dr. Divinity from the Master Seminary.
[time=1277] So with that, I'll turn it over to Brother Bob Provost.
[time=1281] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1287] Thank you Mark, thank you.
[time=1290] Good morning.
[time=1293] What a glorious day it is outside.
[time=1297] You can't wait to get back out there, right?
[time=1301] I'm going to try to make this time go more quickly than you thought it was going to go.
[time=1308] It is a phenomenal joy for my wife, Luetta, and I to be with you today.
[time=1314] A little piece of our hearts are always here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=1320] You have supported our work virtually when we first became missionaries, when the Lord opened the door to the former Soviet countries.
[time=1332] It's interesting to share in a report from Poland, it's one of the first countries that I served in when the Lord brought the curtain down
[time=1342] and had the opportunity to help develop the first seminary there in a place called Vratswaf.
[time=1350] How many can spell Vratswaf?
[time=1354] You can't. There are a few here today, but if you saw it written, you would call it Rockloft because it's spelled W-R-O-C-L-A-W.
[time=1368] Do you hear that?
[time=1369] W-R-O-C-L-A-W, Vratswaf.
[time=1375] Well, I was having a meeting with the Baptist leaders, and they asked if we could consider helping them develop a seminary.
[time=1383] So I went to my hotel room that night, and I got out the map.
[time=1387] They told me there are 800,000 people there, and I couldn't find it on the map.
[time=1394] I just couldn't find it. No Vratswaf.
[time=1399] The next day I found out that the key to Vratswaf, of course, we'd lived in Germany, so I knew about pronouncing a W-S-V-R-O-C.
[time=1410] I didn't know about pronouncing a C as its, and then there was a W.
[time=1421] How did you get that W-A into a Vratswaf?
[time=1428] I mean, it's an L, W-R-O-C-L.
[time=1438] How did you get that L into a W?
[time=1440] In the Polish language, it's kind of like an encrypted language.
[time=1444] When there is a little diagonal across an L, it becomes a W.
[time=1452] So say Vratswaf and pray for Vratswaf.
[time=1455] There are a lot of unsafe people there today.
[time=1459] So you folks have prayed for our ministries.
[time=1462] You have supported our ministries.
[time=1465] Since 1990, when we started to serve in the former communist world, and through your help and the great help of our Lord, lots of things have happened for His glory.
[time=1479] But the main thing that differentiates our ministry is that we exist to serve national churches.
[time=1488] Now the believers in all these countries suffered greatly at the hand of the communists, and many of them were killed for their faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=1496] And so when the Lord first opened the door for us to go there, we decided to go to meet with the national Baptist leaders in every country and simply introduce ourselves, ask them what they felt God wanted them to do, and then ask them how we could help them.
[time=1516] And in every single country, whether it was in Eastern European countries or then when the Soviet Union broke into 15 smaller countries, in every place, the answer was the same.
[time=1528] Well the first priority is pastors. We had so many pastors killed.
[time=1533] We have so many churches that have no pastor. Would you help us train pastors?
[time=1538] Secondly, we had so many churches closed. There are so many cities that don't even have one gospel witness. Can you help us plant new churches?
[time=1550] Okay, number three, what's your third priority?
[time=1554] Everything that we need in order to accomplish priorities one and two.
[time=1560] And that became the agenda of the Slavic gospel, first of all, send international for four years, and then for Slavic gospel for the remaining time since 1994.
[time=1574] So why do we do that? Why don't we have our own agenda?
[time=1579] Ninety-nine percent of the other ministries have their own agenda.
[time=1583] Well in most of these countries, the Americans who came with their own agenda after five or ten years gave up and went home.
[time=1592] Josiah Adventure is one of the only ones that the Lord has enabled to survive all these years.
[time=1599] And it's great that you have a partnership with them.
[time=1603] So that's what differentiates it. We serve the churches.
[time=1607] Christ isn't building missions. Christ is building only churches. Jesus said, I will build my church. You can't find a mission in the Bible.
[time=1617] And so I concluded long ago, if we're not serving churches, then we don't have authority even to exist because there's no mission in the Bible.
[time=1627] And that's what differentiates us. Would you please turn in your Bibles to Genesis in chapter 12?
[time=1641] We call it missions, but you know there is no missions in the Bible.
[time=1649] But again, there's just churches. And there's God's plan. And what we call missions, then a couple hundred years ago became a department in churches.
[time=1663] When in reality, what we call missions, friends, is the main purpose of every church, the mission.
[time=1671] It is the mission. It starts right here in God's call to Abram. Now, the Lord said to Abram, go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you.
[time=1683] This is how God personally calls a missionary. Okay? Are you watching that?
[time=1689] Go from your country, from your family, from your father's house to the land that I will show you.
[time=1697] Now, he didn't describe the land that he wanted him to go to. He wanted him to be willing to go, not knowing where it was.
[time=1709] And then he promised. God is saying to Abram, "If you totally trust me and believe me, I will bless you."
[time=1718] And he says that to every believer today. That's what God wants of you and he wants of me to completely trust him the way Abram did.
[time=1728] He promised. He said, "If you're willing to go from family, go from everything, go from everybody to somewhere you don't even know about, then I will bless you. How will I bless you?
[time=1740] I will make of you a great nation. Think of Israel. And I will bless you and make your name great.
[time=1747] Next to Jesus, the name Abram to become Abraham is the most widely known name on the planet.
[time=1755] These many years, thousands of years later.
[time=1760] So that you will be a blessing. He will make him a blessing. I will bless those who bless you.
[time=1765] And him who dishonors you, I will curse. And in you, all the families of the earth shall be blessed.
[time=1773] In who? In Abram to become Abraham, to become Abraham's spiritual descendants.
[time=1780] And if you have repentant of your sin and trusted in Christ as Savior and Lord, you're right there.
[time=1787] Okay, you're included in the families of the earth that God would bless. Right there.
[time=1794] I mean, it's pretty exciting to me. You find yourself right there early in the book of Genesis.
[time=1800] Okay, so big picture. How is God going to bless all the families of the earth?
[time=1808] Turn over, please, to Isaiah chapter 49. Isaiah 49.
[time=1817] This, friends, is really cool stuff. Don't miss this.
[time=1823] Isaiah 49. In Isaiah 49, it's one of the most amazing chapters in God's Word because what we have here
[time=1835] is an opportunity through the Spirit of God to look in upon a conversation going on in heaven
[time=1845] between God the Father and God the Son. And the conversation is dealing with the planning
[time=1855] of God the Son coming to earth. Watch this. Verse 6, "Become right into the middle of it."
[time=1865] And we can tell that this is a continuation of the conversation. God the Father says, "It's too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to bring back the preserved of Israel." Israel was in trouble as they had frequently gotten into trouble.
[time=1883] And so God would send his son to rescue Israel. Watch it again.
[time=1890] It's too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to bring back the preserved of Israel. So he's confirming that's first priority.
[time=1901] First priority, go. You're going to go and rescue Israel. But he's saying,
[time=1907] "Since you're going there, I mean, since you're going to give up everything that you have in heaven
[time=1914] to go to earth, you really ought to do something else there." And he says,
[time=1920] "I will make you as a light for the nations that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth."
[time=1928] And you find yourself there again. It reached Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1936] Is that incredible? I mean, you just think it's so incredible, you know?
[time=1943] Now, it gets even more interesting. In the Word of God phenomenal.
[time=1949] Okay, turn over to John 20 in 21.
[time=1955] Now we go to the risen Christ. He's been on the earth for 33 years.
[time=1961] He's died to pay for our sins.
[time=1967] Now it's on the evening of the resurrection.
[time=1972] On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being locked were the disciples were for fear of the Jews. They were hiding.
[time=1984] They didn't want what happened to Jesus to happen to them. So there they are.
[time=1989] They're locked. Doors are locked. Jesus came and stood among them.
[time=1995] You see, a resurrected body, like you're going to have someday.
[time=2000] Are you going to have a resurrected body someday?
[time=2003] If you're not sure of that, don't go home until you are made sure of that this morning.
[time=2009] You're going to be able to walk through doors.
[time=2011] If there are any doors in heaven, I don't know if there are.
[time=2014] I mean, there's not going to be anybody to hide from in heaven, right?
[time=2021] So with no door, suddenly he's standing with them.
[time=2026] Can you imagine? I mean, they're hiding there.
[time=2030] They've heard by now that he's alive again, but they can't quite comprehend it.
[time=2037] And then suddenly he's standing in their midst.
[time=2041] I would love to get the audio when he said, "Peace be with you." He's trying to call them done. Hey, guys, it's okay. It's me.
[time=2048] You know, it's all right.
[time=2053] And by the way, in the Hebrew, he would have said shalom.
[time=2056] And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side.
[time=2061] And then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.
[time=2064] And Jesus said to them again, "Peace be with you." It's like, "Come on, relax, guys. It's okay." Now, this next thing that he says is a yet one more occurrence of the Great Commission and a very important one.
[time=2084] We think of the Great Commission. We think of Matthew 28 and Luke 24 and Mark 16 and Acts 1.
[time=2093] But this one is really important when he said to them,
[time=2099] "As the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you."
[time=2108] Do you remember how the Father sent him? We just read about it.
[time=2111] How did the Father send him? First to the Jews and then to all the others.
[time=2121] Then to all the others. That's how Jesus told the disciples what their responsibility would be.
[time=2135] And who are his disciples today? We are. What is our assignment? First to the Jews.
[time=2145] How many of us have forgotten the Jews? I had forgotten the Jews.
[time=2149] And when we think of Israel only as a place for holy land tours, Israel is priority one for the gospel.
[time=2158] I had never been to Israel as I told Discovery class this morning. I had never been there.
[time=2166] People would say, "Provost, you've been all over the world. Why don't you go to Israel?" And I would simply say, "Well, it's the only place that I know for sure I'm going to be one day
[time=2182] and I'm going to be there for a thousand years. And I'm not going to need to buy a ticket to go there.
[time=2190] And it's going to be peaceful then. So why in the world should I be in a hurry to go to Israel now?
[time=2196] I have plenty of work in Russia." And then six years ago, the Lord took me to Israel.
[time=2205] I got invited to speak to a small pastor's conference. Twenty-five men.
[time=2214] What was different was these twenty-five pastors were all believing Jews.
[time=2222] Twenty-five believing Jews. I said to the what? Maybe this is the first time in twenty-five.
[time=2230] In two thousand years there's ever been a meeting like this. How can I not go?
[time=2234] That led to the development of our ministry in Israel.
[time=2240] Where we have a partnership with Israel College of the Bible, which none of us had ever heard of before.
[time=2249] A totally indigenous Bible school with whom we are one hundred percent in agreement on ten pages of doctrine.
[time=2259] When I first met with their leaders, went like this. So tell me about your students.
[time=2265] Well, we have eighty believing Jewish students and forty believing Arab students and they study God's word together.
[time=2273] Outside of the building, they're killing each other in the street.
[time=2277] Because of Jesus Christ inside the building, the Arabs and the Jews are loving each other and studying God's word together.
[time=2284] But then the president said, "But we have a problem." He said, "A third of the Jewish population of Israel today speaks Russian."
[time=2294] And they haven't been there long enough yet to speak Hebrew, so we need help to teach the Russian believers that are coming to Christ.
[time=2306] And so within a few months, we had our first believing Russian students at Israel College of the Bible.
[time=2315] And this last semester we had thirty-nine in our two-year certificate program and thirteen in our Bachelor of Arts program, all of them believing Jews.
[time=2326] It's incredible. And the Lord connected us with twenty-six Russian Jewish rehab centers.
[time=2335] And the rehab centers have become pipelines to Israel College of the Bible.
[time=2340] Because these recovering drug addicts, they get really serious about the Lord, and they want to continue to study His word.
[time=2347] So it's really amazing.
[time=2349] Then the Lord connected us with three different, three different indigenous believing Israeli publishing companies.
[time=2362] One of them was founded by Robert Murray McShane, Scottish missionary, I think in 1730s or 1740s, who went to Israel and was awakened, that Israel is a mission field.
[time=2375] When back to Scotland then started this ministry to Israel that goes on to this day, the publishing company is called Hagefan Publishing.
[time=2386] And the main thing they do is translate Puritan books into Hebrew.
[time=2393] And they just started translating the MacArthur commentary series into Hebrew.
[time=2400] Titus has been translated and will be printed in August.
[time=2406] It's incredible, incredible. I mean, who would have thought, right?
[time=2410] I mean, put it on your list of things that surely marked the last days, right?
[time=2415] I mean, there's a great movement among the Jewish people towards their Messiah.
[time=2423] And I'm not talking about what's called Messianic Jews, these people don't worship the Old Testament.
[time=2429] I mean, they're doctrines exactly the same as Iers.
[time=2432] They don't call themselves Messianic Jews, they just call themselves Believers in Christ.
[time=2438] Well, I didn't really have all that on my notes here today, I just got carried away.
[time=2444] It's just so incredible. I just was constrained to give you all that detail here.
[time=2450] But there's so much we're doing. I'm really out of time here. Let's see.
[time=2455] Could I have the map up, please? I've got a map here.
[time=2459] You folks are real involved in our training ministries with the Antioch Initiative.
[time=2465] Let's see what we have.
[time=2468] Okay, I'm sorry I don't have a point pointer that will go to both at once, and this one isn't going to work at all.
[time=2474] There it is. No? It doesn't go that far.
[time=2479] It's on. It just doesn't go far enough. Can you see it?
[time=2485] It's on the ceiling.
[time=2488] [laughter]
[time=2498] Maybe I need a new battery. Okay, I'm going to just point the old-fashioned of it.
[time=2502] Okay, over to the left. You see all those cities indicated?
[time=2505] There are 36 cities where your men have helped us train Russians for the gospel ministry, 36.
[time=2515] 1,300 men in those 36 cities.
[time=2519] Now, you can see kind of in the middle towards the bottom, it says Novosibirsk.
[time=2525] That's where our main seminary is in Russia.
[time=2529] And it's located in what's called the Academic City, Academic Orthodox.
[time=2533] It's the brain center of Russia.
[time=2535] It's where all the technical institute, that's where their nuclear scientists are, that's where that's...
[time=2539] See, they moved it that far in, so we wouldn't be able to attack it in the Cold War.
[time=2544] And so we said, well, believers have never been a lot to go to graduate school before,
[time=2553] so pastors tend to be intimidated by highly educated people.
[time=2557] So let's put the seminary where they're going to be shopping with PhDs.
[time=2562] I mean, almost everybody, there's a PhD in the Academic City.
[time=2565] And so that's where we put it in the year 2000.
[time=2569] And the Lord began to bless, so we've trained 500 there.
[time=2574] At Novosibir's seminary, and next year we're starting first doctoral program,
[time=2580] a doctor of theology program to produce teachers for all of our other schools.
[time=2585] And by the way, the guy hitting that up is Yevgeny Bekmutsky,
[time=2591] who we helped finish his doctorate at Baptist Bible Seminary in Pennsylvania in May.
[time=2596] And he graduated in his second language, first in his class with a 4.0 magna cum laude.
[time=2602] And he was the only doctoral graduate that they gave opportunity to speak.
[time=2607] And he told about how both of his grandfathers had been exiled to Siberia as pastors.
[time=2613] Anyway, so from 14 of these cities where you helped us develop strong foundation,
[time=2623] 14 of those cities are requesting that Novosibir seminary create extension centers.
[time=2630] So Novosibir is going to be impacting on regular basis at a higher level, 14 of those cities.
[time=2641] Now, over to the right, where it's green, now they taught us in America that Siberia goes all the way to the Pacific.
[time=2651] But it doesn't. Siberia is right there in the middle.
[time=2655] This green part is called Far East Russia.
[time=2660] And it's filled with villages.
[time=2664] It's filled with villages that are accessible only by air.
[time=2671] There are no roads.
[time=2673] This is the part of Russia.
[time=2675] You've heard about the mineral wealth in Russia, the gold and the diamonds and the platinum.
[time=2680] That's where it is, oil and gas and timber.
[time=2685] So they needed people to work in all these remote places.
[time=2688] So under the communist, they didn't ask for volunteers.
[time=2690] They just made people move to these places to work in these various industries.
[time=2695] But they didn't put any roads in.
[time=2697] So the only way you can drive to these villages that are all over that part of Russia is in the wintertime,
[time=2703] when it's minus 40, you can drive on the river because they're all located on rivers so they could ship whatever it is that they're producing.
[time=2713] Well, in 1993, when I was still with Send International, I began to develop a burden for these people.
[time=2725] And so I contacted Missionary Aviation Fellowship and I said, let's partner.
[time=2730] Let's buy an airplane together for Far East Russia so we can fly into these villages and take the gospel to these people.
[time=2736] Now remember, these people, these thousands of people in these villages,
[time=2742] they not only have no roads, they have no radio, they have no television, they have no internet.
[time=2748] So they are probably the most unreached people on the earth in terms of never hearing the gospel.
[time=2756] And so we had picked out an airplane.
[time=2761] We had a budget.
[time=2763] We were already Missionary Aviation Fellowship and Send International.
[time=2766] And then the Lord called me to Slavic Gospel.
[time=2769] And they had a whole set of new problems at Slavic Gospel, and I had to abandon that vision.
[time=2775] And last summer, last summer I was at a conference in Los Angeles.
[time=2780] A young man walked up to me, introduced himself, and he said, "Several people have told me that I need to meet you." And he said, "My name is Mika Iyels Varenko.
[time=2797] I'm a Russian. I'm a pilot.
[time=2800] And I'm a graduate of the Master's Seminary, and I want to go back to Russia."
[time=2806] They said, "You're kidding. I've been waiting for you since 1993." And he said, "More than that, I have an airplane." And somebody gave me an airplane to take to Russia.
[time=2818] Well, he's finishing his ordination right now at Grace Community Church
[time=2824] to be sent as Missionary to Far East Russia, the first one.
[time=2828] They're trying to get there actually by first of September, but they need a lot of support to do that.
[time=2832] They want to get there by first of September because their eldest daughter needs to start school.
[time=2837] And Mother's saying she needs to be there for the first day, which is September 1.
[time=2841] Anyway, so what I want to say next.
[time=2849] The way we have one pilot and one plane there now, two more on the way.
[time=2855] And we have actually more than 30 more planes available to us in Alaska.
[time=2860] All right, and in Alaska there's a ministry called Kingdom Air Corps, and it's led by a man that I've met since Senator National Days.
[time=2869] And over the years, Christians around America who have airplanes and are getting too old to fly them have heard that instead of selling their airplane,
[time=2879] if they contact the Wayne King in Alaska, they can donate it and have a tax write-off.
[time=2885] And so God's people all over America have given him 36 airplanes.
[time=2890] And he's been bringing young Russians over to Alaska and training them to get their flying.
[time=2895] He has trained 10 young Russian pilots.
[time=2899] And they're all Bible college graduates in Russia.
[time=2902] And so the Lord is putting together a gospel air force, folks, to reach all of those villages.
[time=2909] I mean, it's just incredible.
[time=2912] Anyway, and so the first pilot there is a PhD in physics
[time=2922] who's a member of the Baptist Church in a bar, a bar-esque.
[time=2925] And he just cut back his teaching load for this fall to be half-time flying to these villages.
[time=2930] But he describes it this way.
[time=2932] He said, "When I go the first time to a village,
[time=2938] I go down low when I circle a few times, because it's pretty noisy, airplane, if it's low, you know how that sounds.
[time=2944] And to all the people come out of their houses.
[time=2947] So they're all, "Come on, because nobody ever comes there." And then he says he finds a place where he can land it, lands it on the grass or on a street or something.
[time=2957] Then he said, "They all run out to the airplane.
[time=2959] They all want to know what I've come for." And they're so excited to have a visitor, and they're so open, and they start asking, "Well, could we maybe have a program for the children?" The children don't have anything.
[time=2973] "Well, of course we could have a program for the children." And so that's the intro.
[time=2980] And then it's like, "Well, why don't you come back and speak to the people?"
[time=2987] The mayor will typically say, "Well, I'll just call everybody together, and you can speak to them." I mean, it's just ready-made, phenomenal, harvest situation, all these little villages.
[time=2999] Okay, now I really have to check my notes because I'm running out of time.
[time=3005] One more thing.
[time=3009] Up in the middle of that green, it says "saka" -- S-I-K-H-A, "republic." We started the first Antioch training there in March.
[time=3020] The Russian believers have won so many Eskimo types to Christ
[time=3026] that they formed their separate Baptist Union.
[time=3029] And so if some of you join up with our Antioch, developing Antioch initiative there, you'd go for two weeks.
[time=3037] You teach the Russian speakers through a translator the first week, and then the second week you teach the Eskimos in their language.
[time=3045] I'm calling them Eskimos.
[time=3047] They're Russian native people, okay?
[time=3049] So you understand that.
[time=3051] We've not had an Antioch program where you have to go and teach in two languages to two different ethnic groups.
[time=3060] So the way this aviation ministry is going to look is -- well, I'm going to show a video.
[time=3068] We have five minutes left and a three-minute video, okay?
[time=3071] This is the aviation video because I want to get you involved.
[time=3076] [ Inaudible ]
[time=3196] [ Inaudible ] [ Inaudible ]
[time=3215] It's just incredible.
[time=3218] What the Lord is doing.
[time=3220] [ Applause ] Turn with me quickly here in your Bibles to Acts in chapter 1.
[time=3228] I know you're -- some of you have one foot out the door already, I know.
[time=3233] [ Inaudible ] Thank you.
[time=3243] Okay, verse 6.
[time=3251] You know, it's often been -- people often say, you know, when someone dies,
[time=3257] people want to know what were their last words.
[time=3261] What were their last words?
[time=3262] There's always great interest in what was their last words.
[time=3264] In this case, these are the last words of somebody who died,
[time=3270] was returned to life and now is going to fly up to heaven.
[time=3274] What about those last words?
[time=3275] Does that sound important to you?
[time=3279] So when they had come together, they asked him, "Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?" Now, the disciples, they were expecting him to get rid of the Roman soldiers.
[time=3291] I mean, it was hard for them there.
[time=3293] They wanted the kingdom to be restored to Israel.
[time=3297] And now they're getting the message.
[time=3298] He's leaving momentarily and he hasn't done that.
[time=3301] So they ask him, "Watch how he answers." And by the way, his answer is a direct quote of Daniel chapter 2.
[time=3311] He said to them, "It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority." He's talking about politics, folks.
[time=3326] He's talking about politics here, isn't it?
[time=3329] This is all about politics.
[time=3332] And he's saying, "Don't be concerned about the politics."
[time=3340] And then the biggest but in the Bible is next, okay?
[time=3345] B-U-T, if you don't have that circle, circle it.
[time=3348] It's not for you to know times or seasons at the Father has fixed by his own authority.
[time=3352] But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you.
[time=3356] You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the end of the earth.
[time=3361] That's what's important, not the politics, okay?
[time=3366] And that's for us today.
[time=3369] We need to turn off the Fox News or whatever we watch, okay?
[time=3373] Too many of God's people in America are consumed with the politics of America and forgetting about the gospel.
[time=3385] And I love the way he says it's a done deal, okay?
[time=3392] But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you.
[time=3395] If you have repented of your sin and trusted in Christ as your Savior and Lord, you didn't have to wait at that moment, the same Spirit of God entered into your heart to reside there forever, okay?
[time=3410] And you will be my witnesses.
[time=3415] It's not a command here.
[time=3417] It's a done deal.
[time=3418] You will be my witnesses.
[time=3421] And you can apply it to our lives today.
[time=3423] If God's Spirit is in your heart, then you will be his witnesses.
[time=3428] And then he says Jerusalem, Judea, Judea, Samaria, to the end of the earth.
[time=3436] So many people have taught in America that when it says Jerusalem, that means Fort Wayne, wherever you live.
[time=3441] I don't believe that for a second.
[time=3443] I mean, Israel's priority won for him.
[time=3447] You think when he says Jerusalem, he meant Jerusalem, well, that's where it started.
[time=3450] The church was founded in Jerusalem, wasn't it?
[time=3453] I mean, this is not talking about America here.
[time=3456] This is reinforcing the priority of Israel and the Jewish people.
[time=3463] And when he had said these things, as they were looking on,
[time=3470] he has lifted up and a cloud took him out of their sight.
[time=3477] And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold two men stood by them in white robes, apparently angels.
[time=3486] And they said, men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven?
[time=3492] This Jesus who was taken up from you into heaven will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.
[time=3499] He'll come back.
[time=3500] It's like, didn't you hear?
[time=3502] Didn't you hear about your responsibility, men?
[time=3506] Why are you standing here looking up?
[time=3508] You got work to do.
[time=3510] Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, in the end of the earth are waiting and he's coming back.
[time=3518] Friends, that's for us today.
[time=3521] It's for us today.
[time=3523] May the Lord help you do it.
[time=3525] Would you pray with me?
[time=3526] Our great God and Father in heaven, thank you for this precious time with these dear people.
[time=3531] Lord, I pray that what we've just finished with here, you would help all of us.
[time=3537] Lord, help all of us reduce our involvement in worldly, earthly politics.
[time=3546] Lord, help us set it aside for the much greater opportunity and responsibility that we have as your witnesses
[time=3559] in Israel here and to the ends of the earth.
[time=3563] If we pray in your name, amen.
