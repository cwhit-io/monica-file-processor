[time=1316] At Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night.
[time=1320] And God said ask what I shall give you.
[time=1323] And Solomon said you have shown great and steadfast love to your servant David my father because he walked before you in faithfulness in righteousness and in uprightness of heart toward you.
[time=1336] And you have kept him this great and steadfast love and have given him a son to sit on his throne all day.
[time=1344] And now, O Lord, my God, you have made your servant king in place of David my father, although I am but a little child.
[time=1353] I do not know how to go out or come in.
[time=1356] And your servant is in the midst of your people whom you have chosen, a great people, too many to be numbered or counted for multitude.
[time=1366] Give your servant therefore an understanding mind to govern your people that I may discern between good and evil for who is able to govern this, your great people.
[time=1379] It pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this and God said to him, "Because you have asked this and have not asked for yourself long life or riches or the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern what is right, behold.
[time=1396] I now do according to your word, behold, I give you a wise and discerning mind so that none like you has been before you and none like you shall arise after you.
[time=1409] I give you also what you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that no other king shall compare with you all your days.
[time=1419] And if you will walk in my ways, keeping my statutes and my commandments as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days."
[time=1428] And Solomon awoke and behold, it was a dream.
[time=1432] Then he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord and offered up burnt offerings and peace offerings and made a feast for all his servants.
[time=1444] Good morning. Please open your Bibles to 1 Kings chapter 3.
[time=1453] We pick up where we left off in our gospel project series.
[time=1461] And today we're going to talk about Solomon. Until now we talked about David, the first king, the second king, sorry, sold the first king, David the second king.
[time=1471] And today we start to talk about Solomon, the third king of Israel.
[time=1477] But before we do that, I bring you greetings from your brothers and sisters in Israel and Romania.
[time=1483] Thank you for your prayers. Thank you for your prayers while we were in Israel.
[time=1491] As you know, God has protected us and provided for us.
[time=1495] We are actually in the Istanbul airport two days before the bombings.
[time=1500] And we are grateful that God was with us.
[time=1504] This is the Black Hawk team overlooking the city of Jerusalem. Very appropriate because in the background there you see the Temple Mount.
[time=1515] You see right there where the Dome of the Rock is?
[time=1518] That's where the Temple of Solomon once stood.
[time=1522] And unfortunately right now all that's left is the platform on which the Temple stood.
[time=1528] There are two mosques actually on the Temple Mount today.
[time=1532] The Dome of the Rock you can see there and the Aksa Mosque which is the third most holy site in Islam.
[time=1540] So I'll let you decide what's going to happen with the third Temple.
[time=1545] According to Ezekiel 40-48 Israel will build again the third Temple.
[time=1552] So I'll let you decide that on your own.
[time=1556] But we are grateful. We had a blessed time to literally walk where Jesus walked.
[time=1564] And again thank you for your love and support and prayers.
[time=1569] I think everybody's over. They're a jet lag.
[time=1572] And again we're ready to start talking again about Solomon.
[time=1577] Unfortunately the title of the sermon represents the reality of Solomon's heart.
[time=1585] His heart was a divided heart.
[time=1589] You see first Kings gives us a glimpse into Solomon's life.
[time=1594] Basically first Kings chapters 1 through 11 gives us about 40 years of his life from beginning until his fall.
[time=1606] And if we look at Solomon he is studying contrasts.
[time=1612] As we will see God gives him wisdom and yet at times he acts very very foolishly.
[time=1620] And we'll see that as we go through the study.
[time=1625] But one of the problems from the beginning is to see that Solomon does not listen to the word of God nor does he listen to his father's advice.
[time=1636] If you have your Bibles please turn to 1 Kings chapter 2. Before we get to chapter 3 listen to the words of David his father.
[time=1645] On David's deathbed he has some last words for his son Solomon that will follow him on the throne.
[time=1654] 1 Kings chapter 2.
[time=1657] When David's time to die drew near he commanded Solomon his son saying I am about to go the way of all the earth.
[time=1667] Be strong and show yourself a man and keep the charge of the Lord your God walking in his ways and keeping his statues, his commandments, his rules and his testimonies as it is written in the law of Moses.
[time=1683] Then you may prosper in all that you do and whatever your turn that the Lord may establish his word that he spoke concerning me saying.
[time=1691] If your sons pay close attention to their way to the work before me in faithfulness with all their heart and with all their soul you shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.
[time=1703] Did you catch that little word if? That little word if will appear again and again in God's communication to Solomon.
[time=1713] A very very important word and from the beginning we turn to chapter 3 we see that Solomon is caught between peace and obedience.
[time=1725] He is caught between peace and obedience. You see Solomon's name means peace.
[time=1733] Shalomo in Hebrew comes from the word shalom meaning peace.
[time=1739] So his name means peace which is very indicative of how he ruled.
[time=1744] If David enlarged the borders of the land through war he was the man of war.
[time=1751] Solomon enlarged the borders of the land through peace and that's what we see here in chapter 3 verse 1.
[time=1759] A brilliant military strategy.
[time=1763] Solomon made a marriage allegiance with Pharaoh King of Egypt. He took Pharaoh's daughter and brought her into the sea of David until he had finished building his own house and noticed his building projects.
[time=1775] His own house something for himself.
[time=1778] The house of the Lord something for God and the wall around Jerusalem something for the people.
[time=1785] He is a master builder. He is a military strategies par excellence but notice please that whatever happens here in verse 1 goes against what David his father told him.
[time=1798] David his father told him make sure you follow the Mosaic law.
[time=1804] What did the Mosaic law say about intermarriage with pagans?
[time=1810] Deuteronomy 17 starting in verse 14. God says to Moses.
[time=1817] When you come to the land that the Lord your God is giving you and you possess it and dwell in it then say I will set a king over me like all the nations that are around me.
[time=1827] You may indeed set a king over you whom the Lord your God will choose.
[time=1832] One from among your brothers you shall set a king over you.
[time=1837] You may not put a foreigner over you who is now your brother.
[time=1841] Only he must not acquire many horses for himself or cause the people to return to Egypt in order to acquire many horses since the Lord has said to you you shall never return that way again.
[time=1854] And he shall not acquire many wives for himself lest his heart turn away.
[time=1861] Nor shall he acquire for himself excessive silver and gold.
[time=1866] And when he sits on the throne of his kingdom he shall write for himself in a book a copy of this law approved by the Levitical priests.
[time=1876] And it shall be with them and he shall read it all the days of his life that he may learn to fear the Lord his God by keeping all the words of this law and his statues and doing them that his heart may not be lifted up above his brothers and that he may not turn aside from the commandment.
[time=1894] Either to the right hand or to the left so that he may continue long in his kingdom.
[time=1900] He and his children in Israel.
[time=1904] When Solomon is caught between peace and obeying God he chooses peace.
[time=1911] And I'm not talking about the peace of God.
[time=1913] I'm not talking about the peace of God that passes all understanding.
[time=1916] I'm talking about a military peace done very strategically but against God's word.
[time=1925] That's what happens here.
[time=1928] Solomon caught between peace and obedience. Solomon is also caught between love and worship.
[time=1934] You might say those should go together.
[time=1937] Yes they should.
[time=1939] But what happens here is God between love for God and false worship or incorrect worship.
[time=1946] Look what happens in verses 2 and 3 please.
[time=1950] Pay close attention to the word only in the English.
[time=1954] The people were sacrificing at the high places.
[time=1958] However because no house that he had been built for the name of the Lord.
[time=1962] Solomon loved the Lord.
[time=1965] Walking in the statues of David his father only but we can say it's a contrast of conjunction there.
[time=1975] Only he sacrificed and made offerings at high places.
[time=1980] And sometimes we might want to jump on Solomon's defense and say well there was no temple.
[time=1987] So where was he going to sacrifice?
[time=1989] You know where he could sacrifice?
[time=1991] At the tabernacle. The tabernacle was still set up and he was still ready for sacrifices.
[time=1997] But he didn't want to go there.
[time=1999] He elected to go to high places.
[time=2002] What's wrong with sacrifices at high places?
[time=2005] Well listen to Leviticus chapter 26 verse 30.
[time=2011] When the law talks about high places.
[time=2015] He mentions the high places in language of judgment.
[time=2020] Language of judgment for disobedience.
[time=2022] God says in Leviticus 26.30 I will destroy your high places and cut down your incense altars.
[time=2031] In Numbers 33.52 God gives the people who will enter the promised land directions what to do with the high places.
[time=2038] Numbers 33.52 then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you
[time=2044] and destroy all their figured stones and destroy all their metal images and demolish all their high places. Did they do that?
[time=2053] No. Not only did not they do that but now that you were using them for their own worship.
[time=2059] You might say that's not such a big deal. It is a big deal.
[time=2063] Because he doesn't say Solomon loved the Lord and he worshipped him. No.
[time=2068] He says he loved the Lord only contrastive but he sacrificed and made offerings at high places.
[time=2078] Solomon consistently disobeys God's word.
[time=2085] You might say well Tiberius that was before God gave him wisdom.
[time=2090] Okay. Let's look at see what the Bible says.
[time=2095] When Solomon is God between wisdom and foolishness he chooses correctly.
[time=2100] If in the first two places he chooses wrongly he finally chooses correctly.
[time=2105] God appears to Solomon and God gives him something that he hasn't given anybody else in Scripture, a blank check.
[time=2115] In 1 Kings 3 starting in verse 5.
[time=2120] "It gave me on the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night and God said, 'Ask what I shall give you.'
[time=2126] And he is caught between wisdom and foolishness. Do I ask for wisdom or am I foolish and ask for things that don't matter?'
[time=2134] And here Solomon chooses correctly.
[time=2139] Solomon said, 'You have shown great and steadfast love to your servant David my father because you act before you in faithfulness in righteousness
[time=2148] and in uprightness of heart toward you and you have kept for him this great and steadfast love and have given him a son to sit on the stone this day.
[time=2156] And now all Lord my God you have made your servant king in place of David my father although I am but a little child.
[time=2163] I do not know how to go out or come in and your servant is in the midst of your people whom you have chosen a great people too many to be numbered or counted for multitude.
[time=2174] And here is the request in verse 9. "Give your servant therefore an understanding mind to govern your people.
[time=2183] That I made discern between good and evil for who is able to govern this your great people."
[time=2190] Solomon finds himself in a new situation.
[time=2194] He is the king of Israel. He has never been king before, right?
[time=2198] So what does he do? He asks for the right thing.
[time=2201] He asks for wisdom to lead. He cannot draw upon his experience.
[time=2206] You have been there before, right? You have been through a situation where you have never been there before.
[time=2211] What do you do? Well hopefully you ask for God's wisdom.
[time=2215] Solomon did the right thing here. Not only that but he is humble.
[time=2220] Notice he assesses himself and concludes, "I am but a little child."
[time=2227] Meaning I am inexperienced. I do not know how to go out or come in.
[time=2234] He is humble and asks for the right thing.
[time=2237] When he is caught between wisdom and foolishness in this instance he chooses correctly.
[time=2242] He asks God for wisdom and look at the end result verses 10 to 12.
[time=2248] "It please the Lord as Solomon has asked this."
[time=2254] And God said to him, "Because you have asked this and have not asked for yourself long life or riches or the life of your enemies,
[time=2260] but have asked for yourself understanding to discern what is right, behold, I now do according to your word.
[time=2267] Behold, I give you a wise and discerning mind so that none like you has been before and none like you shall arise after you."
[time=2280] My dear brothers and sisters, let's pretend, let's use our sanctified imagination, that God gives us a blank check.
[time=2289] Meditate a little bit upon that. If God gives you a blank check, what would you write on it?
[time=2295] What would you say that God, that you want from God?
[time=2302] It would be a faster car, bigger house, better job, corner office for your kids to have straight A's and straight teeth.
[time=2320] Hey, I know what I would want. I'm kind of projecting my questions upon you sometimes.
[time=2329] Sometimes we ask the wrong things because we have the wrong motivation.
[time=2335] In this case, Solomon asked correctly and God listened to Solomon and gave him what he asked for.
[time=2344] God gave Solomon wisdom, and if you read these verses and these chapters, you see how God gave him, indeed, wisdom.
[time=2354] I give you a wise and discerning mind so that none like you has been before you and none like you shall arise after you.
[time=2361] And if you look, starting in verse 16, there's a case study that Solomon's wisdom is put to the test.
[time=2369] You know the story. It's right here in 1 Kings 3.
[time=2373] Two prostitutes come before him to be judged. Both prostitutes had babies.
[time=2380] But one baby died, and now they come to the king and say, both of them said, "Hey, the living child is my baby."
[time=2391] They come, and both say it's their baby.
[time=2397] Solomon uses his God-given wisdom starting in verse 24. The king said, "Bring me a sword."
[time=2403] So a sword was brought before the king, and the king said, "Divide the living child into and give half to the one and half to the other."
[time=2412] Then the woman whose son was alive said to the king, "Because her heart yearned for her son." "Oh my Lord, give her the living child." And by no means put him to death.
[time=2422] But the other said, "He shall be neither mine or yours. Divide him." Then the king answered and said, "Give the living child to the first woman." And by no means put him to death. She is his mother.
[time=2436] And after this, listen to what the writer concludes, verse 28.
[time=2442] "And all Israel heard of the judgment that the king had rendered, and they stood in awe of the king because they perceived that the wisdom of God was in him to do justice."
[time=2456] God answers his prayer, and God gives Solomon wisdom.
[time=2461] If this is not enough, look in chapter 4, please with me.
[time=2464] In chapter 4, starting in verse 29, I only have verses 33 and 34 here.
[time=2473] But if you look at me, start with me, please in verse 29.
[time=2477] And imagine that this is Solomon's resume.
[time=2480] Imagine that he applies for a job, and this is in his resume, and ask yourself, "Would I hire this guy?"
[time=2486] And I know some of you might say he's overqualified.
[time=2490] Look what he says. "God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding beyond measure and breadth of mind like the sand on the seashore, so the Solomon's wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt."
[time=2505] Verse 32.
[time=2506] He also spoke 3,000 Proverbs, and the next two Sundays will be in the Proverbs of Solomon, and we see wisdom from those.
[time=2516] 3,000 Proverbs, and his songs were a thousand and five.
[time=2521] Remember David writing the sounds?
[time=2524] Solomon surpassed David in song writing.
[time=2529] He spoke of trees from the cedar that lives in Lebanon to the hystop that grows out of the wild.
[time=2535] He spoke also of beasts and of birds and of reptiles and of fish, and people of all nations came to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom.
[time=2544] So I want you to imagine a family reunion in Solomon's life, and they're playing trivial pursuit.
[time=2553] It was no fun, because Solomon won every time, because he knew about everything.
[time=2561] How did he know that?
[time=2563] We'll see later in scripture.
[time=2565] He learned by the fact that God gave him that wisdom, inspiration, but he also learned by observation.
[time=2575] He looked and he saw what was going on under the sun.
[time=2579] We'll see that later.
[time=2581] But not only did God give him wisdom, God gave Solomon some things that he has not asked for.
[time=2588] God gave Solomon wealth.
[time=2591] But there are many verses that talk about his wealth.
[time=2594] I don't want to dwell on this.
[time=2596] The second chronicle is 9, starting in verse 13, kind of summarizes his wealth.
[time=2603] The weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was 666 talents of gold.
[time=2608] All king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were pure gold.
[time=2614] Silver was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon.
[time=2620] God in his grace gives Solomon what he asks for, and God in his grace gives Solomon what he doesn't ask for.
[time=2628] Now, I was tempted in the past to say, see Solomon was wrong, because he had a lot of wealth.
[time=2637] And I would say, so Solomon was wrong to acquire many horses, because remember what the law said, right?
[time=2643] The law said that the king shall not acquire a lot of wealth, and the king shall not acquire a lot of horses, right?
[time=2649] But this, according to the scripture, is actually God giving this to him.
[time=2655] He was not after these things.
[time=2657] This was a direct result of him asking for wisdom.
[time=2662] So we cannot blame Solomon for having a lot of wealth, and we cannot blame Solomon for having a lot of horses.
[time=2672] But we can blame Solomon for having a lot of wives, because that did go directly against God's will.
[time=2681] We will see what the Bible says about that in the future.
[time=2686] But God not only allowed him to have wisdom, he allowed him to put a wisdom into practice when he built God's temple.
[time=2696] This is a replica of the temple in Jerusalem, obviously this temple was destroyed in 70 AD never to be rebuilt again.
[time=2704] So I gave you here a timeline of the temple of Solomon's temple.
[time=2710] So when Solomon built the temple, it was basically this area right here, let's see, can you see?
[time=2717] All right there.
[time=2718] That was the temple proper.
[time=2720] That was the temple divided into the holy place and the holy of holies.
[time=2724] Now later they built courtyards and later they built porticoes and that was much, much later.
[time=2733] But this was the temple that once was considered one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, because think about when this was built.
[time=2742] This was built about 950 BC, about 20 years into Solomon's reign, and we know he reigned for 40 years.
[time=2751] But this temple was destroyed in 587 by the Babylonians.
[time=2755] Remember Nebuchadnezzar comes and destroys the temple.
[time=2758] Well that temple was rebuilt during the time of Ezra, Nehemiah and Zerubbabel, and he was rebuilt in 517 BC.
[time=2767] That temple was ultimately destroyed in 7 AD, but not before he was renovated in 19 BC by Herod the Great.
[time=2775] Remember Herod the Great?
[time=2777] We don't remember Herod because of his great mastery in architecture.
[time=2781] We remember Herod the Great because of him being the baby killer.
[time=2786] It's the same Herod.
[time=2788] But before he killed babies he held renovate a temple because remember he wanted to keep the peace.
[time=2794] He wanted to have the Jews be at peace with Rome.
[time=2797] So he renovated their temple.
[time=2801] But this temple was destroyed in 7 AD, never to be rebuilt again.
[time=2810] Then where can we go to worship?
[time=2816] Well if you look in the Gospels and you see Jesus' ministry and you know Jesus' words, Jesus' words are clear that the ministry of this temple will come to an end in the person and work of Jesus Christ.
[time=2830] Remember always in the temple?
[time=2834] There was manna, there was bread.
[time=2837] Jesus comes and says I am the bread of life.
[time=2840] Remember always in the temple the manorah, the candlestick, the provided light.
[time=2845] Jesus comes and says I am the light of the world.
[time=2849] Little by little Jesus comes and tells him the ministry of this temple will come to an end.
[time=2855] At one point he says takes this temple down and I am going to rebuild it in three days.
[time=2861] He was talking about his own body.
[time=2863] When we talk about wisdom, my dear brothers and sisters, we read about the wisdom that only comes from the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2873] The first point of application is this.
[time=2876] If you want to live a life of wisdom, the starting point is accepting Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior.
[time=2884] You cannot be wise unless you have Jesus Christ.
[time=2889] You might be business savvy, you might be creative in all your ways, it doesn't matter.
[time=2895] But from God's perspective you are not wise unless Jesus Christ is your Lord and Savior.
[time=2901] That's it's clear in the first Corinthians.
[time=2904] We preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to the Jews and folly to Gentiles, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks,
[time=2911] Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
[time=2916] There is no wisdom apart from the person and work of Jesus Christ.
[time=2921] So the first step of wisdom is to accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior.
[time=2926] Second of all, if you are like me and you need wisdom, the Bible tells us what to do.
[time=2933] If any of you lacks wisdom, if. Isn't that a good joke?
[time=2939] Actually in Greek that's called a conditional that's better translated since.
[time=2947] That same word can be translated if or since in Greek.
[time=2951] Now for some reason our English translators go with if.
[time=2955] I would argue that since is a better word.
[time=2958] Since you lack wisdom, let him or ask God who gives generously to all without reproach and it will be given to him.
[time=2972] I want to take you back to January 8, 1986.
[time=2978] That's when I stepped foot on American soil.
[time=2982] My dad defected communist Romania in July of 1984. He arrived here in November of 84.
[time=2989] Did a paperwork and I came with my mom and my told their brothers January 8, 1986.
[time=2996] We landed JFK in New York.
[time=3000] Lost the connection for LA or supposed to fly to LAX.
[time=3005] So they put us in a van and they took us to a Chinese restaurant.
[time=3011] That was my first clash of cultures because I never eaten at a Chinese place and that was the first time and for five years I never ate there again.
[time=3026] That's because I was narrow minded.
[time=3031] The next day we fly to Los Angeles and imagine landing LAX and I see the skyscrapers of LA and we go to the place where my dad rented a house in Buffalo, California.
[time=3047] And I remember like it was yesterday.
[time=3050] I was 15 and a half.
[time=3053] And I remember I mean here in this country I know the language very little, what am I going to do?
[time=3062] I remember this feeling of helplessness come over me.
[time=3067] And like it was yesterday I remember what I did that night.
[time=3072] I got down on my knees and I prayed Solomon's prayer.
[time=3077] I said Lord I don't want riches, I don't want fame, but give me wisdom to know how to live my life in this great country that's called the United States of America.
[time=3095] And I would argue that that prayer I still need to pray every single day.
[time=3104] And if you're like me I encourage you to pray that prayer every single day.
[time=3111] God give us wisdom.
[time=3114] Not just in the matters of every day but in the matters of little things, school, spouse, children, pastor, president, whatever it is.
[time=3129] Let's ask God to give us wisdom, to know how to live our lives every day.
[time=3137] And the good news, God gives how generously.
[time=3143] God is a generous God isn't he?
[time=3146] Oh he gives us wisdom.
[time=3148] Come and ask the great Greek philosopher Socrates, or Socrates if you're from somewhere else.
[time=3159] Socrates said this, to gain knowledge one must first understand one's ignorance.
[time=3175] Come to God who gives generously.
[time=3178] And lastly, let us learn from Solomon not to have a divider heart, but to have a whole heart from God.
[time=3187] Listen to the words of Jesus who tells his disciples and who tells us.
[time=3193] You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.
[time=3203] By the way, that's not a New Testament development.
[time=3206] That's a quote from the Old Testament.
[time=3209] What Jesus does, he quotes from the Old Testament.
[time=3212] That was always what God wanted from his people.
[time=3218] You see, sometimes we make compartments of our lives.
[time=3222] We say this is the compartment of church, this is family, this is work.
[time=3226] And you know, I have authority here and here, and God has authority here, and it shouldn't be like that.
[time=3233] Our life should be one, and God should be master of the whole life.
[time=3239] That's what God wants.
[time=3241] God wanted that during the time of Solomon, and God wanted that during the time of Jesus, and that's what God still wants.
[time=3251] Let's pray, dear Father, thank you.
[time=3255] For those who went before us, help us to learn from their successes, and help us learn from their mistakes.
[time=3261] Forgive us for the many times on our hearts, seem to be divided, or we are even divided.
[time=3269] Forgive us for the time when we opted to be disobedient, and opted to be foolish.
[time=3277] I pray, you fill us with the Holy Spirit to surrender our entire lives to you.
[time=3283] Fill us with the wisdom that comes from God, and we confess that we need it.
[time=3289] We need it every day, and we need it every hour.
[time=3292] Be our wisdom, and teach us what it means to follow you, every day.
[time=3299] In Christ's name, the wisdom of God, I pray.
[time=3304] [AMEN] Be our salvation, the Lord of my heart.
[time=3313] Not be all else to be safe at that heart.
[time=3321] Thou my best, Lord, by day or by night.
[time=3330] Be our sleepy, our presence, my light.
[time=3341] Be our light, wisdom, be our light, true world.
[time=3349] I ever with thee, and thou with me, Lord.
[time=3357] Thou my great Father, I thy true Son.
[time=3366] Thou when we dwell thee, and I with thee, one.
[time=3378] In Jesus I need not more land than He prays.
[time=3386] Thou my inheritance, I have always.
[time=3394] Thou won't we be first in my heart?
[time=3403] Hiking of heaven, my treasure now on.
[time=3414] Hiking of heaven, when it be His one.
[time=3423] May I reach heaven's joy, so bright and sun.
[time=3432] High of my own heart, wherever we fall.
[time=3441] Still be my vision, a ruler of all.
[time=3454] Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Bible Hour this morning.
[time=3459] Salomon, what a story.
[time=3461] A study in contrast.
[time=3463] God gives him wisdom, and yet sometimes he does very foolish things.
[time=3469] It's a testimony to us that we also have to choose every day.
[time=3473] Do we live in wisdom, or do we live in foolishness?
[time=3478] See, Salomon's problem was that he had a divided heart.
[time=3481] From the beginning, even though God gives him wisdom, God also gives him some very important commands, and he's supposed to live according to the law of Moses, but unfortunately, Salomon chooses to systematically and consistently disobey God.
[time=3499] That's why he gets to the end of his life and says meaningless.
[time=3503] Meaningless, everything is meaningless.
[time=3505] How did he get there from a man who is the wisest of them all to meaningless?
[time=3512] Well, he gets there by walking in the path of disobedience.
[time=3516] So the lesson for us is that we also have a choice every day.
[time=3520] Do we live in wisdom, or do we live in foolishness?
[time=3525] Again, the problem is a divided heart.
[time=3528] Salomon had a divided heart.
[time=3531] He did not follow God with his whole heart.
[time=3535] Again, our lesson is to listen to the words of Jesus who tells us that we need to love God
[time=3541] with everything that we have, soul, mind, strength and heart.
[time=3548] God doesn't want half of our heart, half of our life.
[time=3552] He wants all of us.
[time=3554] And I pray that that will be our life story and that will be our testimony that we will follow God every day with our whole life.
