[time=1106] >> Proverbs 1 verses 1 through 9, the Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel, to no wisdom and instruction to understand words of insight, to receive instruction and wise dealing in righteousness, justice and equity, to give prudence to the simple knowledge and discretion to the youth.
[time=1133] Let the wise hear an increase in learning and the one who understands, obtain guidance, to understand a proverb and a saying, the words of the wise and their riddles.
[time=1146] The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, fools despise wisdom and instruction.
[time=1153] Hear my son, your father's instruction and forsake not your mother's teaching, for they are a graceful garland for your head and pendants for your neck.
[time=1167] >> Good morning.
[time=1168] Please open your Bibles to the Book of Proverbs.
[time=1172] This morning we are entering into a new genre of biblical literature called wisdom literature.
[time=1179] Wisdom literature is the literature genre that informs a person to the principles of God's moral universe.
[time=1190] So a wise person is one who lives in harmony with these moral principles that God gives.
[time=1197] There are actually a few books in the Old Testament that are particularly called wisdom literature, the Book of Job, the Book of Proverbs and the Book of Ecclesiastes.
[time=1210] And we're going to look at these in the next couple of weeks, but today we're going to look, and today, and next week we're going to look at the Book of Proverbs.
[time=1220] Now, Proverbs in the Bible are similar to Proverbs in the English language.
[time=1228] They are short and they are memorable.
[time=1232] You can remember them, right?
[time=1234] And the good thing is they're short.
[time=1238] Remember that when the Bible was written, so this was about 3,000 years ago, the 1,000 BC, most people couldn't read and write.
[time=1249] So whenever you teach something, you better make it short and memorable, because people had to remember that.
[time=1259] And not everybody had a Bible at home, so they could read over and over again.
[time=1264] So from that perspective, we are very, very blessed.
[time=1267] But these short things in the Book of Proverbs are very memorable, and they are very practical.
[time=1276] That's why today, and next week I all have slides at the end that says applying the truth.
[time=1284] Why? Because each slide will be application.
[time=1289] All these Proverbs are very applicable for us, and even though they were written about 3,000 years ago, they are applicable for us today.
[time=1299] As we walk through life, God has given us principles to live by how do you navigate the complexities of life?
[time=1309] The Book of Proverbs tells us.
[time=1311] And I want to challenge you to read the Book of Proverbs.
[time=1314] There are 31 Proverbs, 31 chapters in the Book of Proverbs.
[time=1319] One for every day of the month.
[time=1322] Even the month that has 31 days. So read one Proverbs, one chapter every day.
[time=1330] It will be really good for you.
[time=1334] According to the Bible, there are only two types of people.
[time=1339] There are wise people, and there are fools.
[time=1343] And we see here in the Book of Proverbs that the wise and the fool are contrasted.
[time=1351] Actually comparison is another one key element in the Book of Proverbs.
[time=1357] The wise man Solomon contrasts different types of people.
[time=1362] Now we're going to look this morning at the wise versus the fool, and I'll be all throughout the Book of Proverbs.
[time=1368] But if you want to open to chapter 1, it's in page 304 of your Pew Bibles.
[time=1375] So I'm going to look at the wise versus the fool from three perspectives.
[time=1382] From one's relationship with God, one's relationship with self, and one's relationship with one another.
[time=1391] Because all of us deal with these types of relationships.
[time=1395] First of all, in relationship with God, the wise has the fear of the Lord.
[time=1403] You've heard Curtis read, and it's again in chapter 9, verse 10.
[time=1408] The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
[time=1413] A wise person has the fear of the Lord, and what the fear of the Lord is not, or fear of the Lord is not paralyzing.
[time=1421] Have you ever been so such in fear that you couldn't move, you couldn't do anything?
[time=1427] That's not the fear of the Lord.
[time=1429] The fear of the Lord is one that draws us near to God in awe of Him.
[time=1437] That's the fear of the Lord.
[time=1439] It draws us close to Him in awe, and at the same time it draws us away from evil.
[time=1446] It's very, very, very practical.
[time=1449] It is not a paralyzing fear.
[time=1452] As someone wise said, Allen Ross says, and I quote, "The fear of the Lord has both aspects of shrinking back in fear and drawing close in awe."
[time=1464] It is not a trembling dread that paralyzes action, but it characterizes the true worshipper.
[time=1473] And as we read in the book of Proverbs, the wise person has this fear of the Lord.
[time=1479] As I said, it shows itself in the fact that the wise person moves away from evil.
[time=1486] Proverbs 8, 13.
[time=1489] The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil, pride and arrogance, and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate.
[time=1498] Proverbs 16, 6. "By steadfast love and faithfulness iniquity is atoned for,
[time=1504] and by the fear of the Lord one turns away from evil." So my dear brothers and sisters, if we say we are wise people, when confronted with evil,
[time=1516] the Bible says not only would it hate it, but we're going to turn away from it.
[time=1521] So let's evaluate ourselves this morning.
[time=1523] Are we wise?
[time=1525] Or are we fools?
[time=1527] Because you see, in contrast to the wise person who fears the Lord and turns away from evil,
[time=1533] the fool, the Bible says, "Mocks God's law." Proverbs 49, fools mock the guilt offering.
[time=1543] You see, it is very important to understand that the fool in the book of Proverbs is not a person with a low IQ.
[time=1550] The fool in the book of Proverbs is not academically challenged.
[time=1555] Rather than the fool in the book of Proverbs is morally deficient.
[time=1561] This deficiency prompts irrational and immoral behavior.
[time=1568] Fools mock at the guilt offering.
[time=1572] What's a guilt offering?
[time=1574] You see, a guilt offering in the book of Leviticus was an offering that you brought after you sinned.
[time=1581] God allowed for you to bring an offering so your sin could be forgiven.
[time=1586] So you didn't feel guilty about your sin anymore.
[time=1591] The guilt offering, as Leviticus 5, 6 says very clearly, provided restitution for sins like stealing, cheating, or taking false vows.
[time=1605] The fool is not interested in that.
[time=1608] Not only does he not fear God, but he mocks God's law.
[time=1612] The fool, we can say, doesn't take God seriously.
[time=1617] The fool doesn't take God's word seriously.
[time=1621] The two are clear, contrasted here.
[time=1625] Let's ask ourselves, my dear brothers and sisters, do we love God's word or do we mock it?
[time=1633] Do we turn away from evil or do we turn to evil?
[time=1639] Because if we answer those, we know if we are wise or if we are full.
[time=1645] What about in relationship with self and others?
[time=1647] This is kind of together.
[time=1648] That's why I didn't know where to classify this.
[time=1652] Is it a relationship to self or others?
[time=1654] Well, it's probably both.
[time=1656] That's why I put a slash there.
[time=1658] The wise is open to learning.
[time=1664] Proverbs 10.8, the wise of heart will receive commandments.
[time=1671] In relationship to self, that means I know I need more wisdom, so I'm going to try to learn more and more.
[time=1681] The wise always knows the needs to learn more.
[time=1686] The wise sees his or her need for teaching and welcomes it.
[time=1691] I see it all the time as I teach.
[time=1693] I see it in my students' eyes as they take notes.
[time=1697] They're hungry to learn.
[time=1699] They're ready.
[time=1700] They hang on every word of the teacher.
[time=1703] The wise always like to learn more.
[time=1707] Proverbs 18.15, an intelligent heart acquires knowledge and the year of the wise seeks knowledge.
[time=1715] The wise always likes to learn about new things, new cultures, maybe even new languages, whatever it is.
[time=1721] But we are hungry.
[time=1722] The wise are hungry for more knowledge.
[time=1728] Contrast that with the fool.
[time=1734] The Bible says despises instruction.
[time=1739] See, the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.
[time=1742] Contrast that with fools, despise wisdom, and instruction.
[time=1749] One scholar puts it like this.
[time=1751] The fool is so full of himself that instead of having the capacity to accept wisdom,
[time=1757] he dangerously praddles out his own clever opinions, which are devoid of true wisdom.
[time=1766] These considered fools, in contrast to the teachable wise, are fixed in the correctness of their opinions,
[time=1773] that they despise God's revelation.
[time=1778] Let's examine ourselves, my dear brothers and sisters, this morning.
[time=1783] When was the last time we read a book?
[time=1787] Any book?
[time=1790] Start with the Bible.
[time=1792] And when was the last time I said, "Hey, I want to learn something new?" Maybe about a new culture or maybe about a new language or a new people's group or whatever it is.
[time=1803] You see, the wise always want to learn something new.
[time=1806] And the fool says, "Oh, I know enough." Have you met people like that?
[time=1811] I'm not talking about teenagers, because they know it all.
[time=1816] If you are a teenager here, you know what I'm talking about.
[time=1821] The wise person is always hungry for more knowledge.
[time=1829] The fool despises instruction.
[time=1833] The wise in relationship to self always listens to a device.
[time=1839] The wise listens to advice.
[time=1843] The way of a fool is writing his own eyes, but a wise man listens to advice.
[time=1850] Proverbs 19, 20, Solomon puts it in the imperative.
[time=1854] Listen to advice and accept instruction that you may gain wisdom in the future.
[time=1863] When you listen to advice of godly people, your parents, your teachers, your elders,
[time=1871] whomever are wise in your life, when you accept advice from them, you show that you are truly wise.
[time=1881] When was the last time someone came and gave you advice?
[time=1885] Think about that.
[time=1887] And I want you to think about your reaction.
[time=1890] You say, "Ah, I already know that." Or did you accept that advice?
[time=1897] You see, because the wise listen to advice where the fools reject godly advice.
[time=1904] A fool despises his father's instruction, but whoever he's reproof is prudent.
[time=1911] You see, the idea that children are to obey their parents is part of God's educational system.
[time=1919] This was, by the way, children, young people.
[time=1923] This was not invented by parents.
[time=1925] This is God's law.
[time=1928] A fool despises father's instruction, but whoever he's reproof is prudent.
[time=1936] When your parents come to you and give you a godly advice, how do you react?
[time=1943] You see the Bible before that said that you should honor your father and your mother.
[time=1950] Part of honoring your father and your mother is listening to their advice and listening to what they have to say.
[time=1958] Subsequently, if you slam the door in your parents' face, you know what the hinges of the door are saying?
[time=1966] They're saying you are a fool.
[time=1972] So what are we? Are we wise or are we foolish?
[time=1977] Because the Bible is very clear which one is which?
[time=1981] What is my attitude towards advice?
[time=1986] Someone said the trouble with good advice is that usually interferes with your plans.
[time=1993] You already got your plans.
[time=1996] So don't give me no advice, right?
[time=1999] What about in relationship with others?
[time=2001] This is clearly in relationship with others.
[time=2003] The wise blesses others through his or her speech.
[time=2007] The book of Proverbs has a lot to do about, has a lot to say about how we speak to one another.
[time=2014] There is one whose rash words are like sword thrusts, but the tongue of the wise brings healing.
[time=2022] I hope all of you have a wise person in your life that you can listen to them all day long.
[time=2029] Because you know they're going to speak truth into your life.
[time=2032] You know they're going to speak words of wisdom into your life.
[time=2035] You see, the word lies to you all the time, all the time.
[time=2040] That's why you need to counter that with words of truth and words of wisdom.
[time=2045] And listen to those people that bless you when they speak.
[time=2049] The tongue of the wise brings healing.
[time=2053] As one scholar says and I quote, speech that serves others cannot aim at promoting one's public image.
[time=2060] Craving for admiration and serving one's own interests.
[time=2065] The wise is not primarily interested in winning debates.
[time=2070] And he avoids speech with creates bitterness and erect barriers between himself and others.
[time=2080] What does your speech produce?
[time=2083] What does your tongue produce? Does it produce healing when you speak?
[time=2089] See James in the book of James in his book in chapter 3 verse 17 says this, "But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason,
[time=2103] full of mercy and good fruits in partial and sincere."
[time=2110] Can we evaluate our speech this morning?
[time=2113] When you speak to your spouse, when you speak to your children, when you speak to your parents, when you speak to your friends, let's ask ourselves, is my speech pure?
[time=2124] Is my speech gentle? Is my speech full of mercy?
[time=2131] If so, the Bible says I am a wise person.
[time=2138] But if I'm not a wise person, I am a fool.
[time=2142] And the fool slanders.
[time=2145] While the tongue of the wise brings healing, the wise of the tongue of the fool slanders.
[time=2153] Whoever others slander is a fool.
[time=2158] The fool's tongue is like a knife who cuts deep and leaves behind deep wounds.
[time=2165] Some of you are here this morning and you are wounded because someone cuts deep into your heart.
[time=2173] Not with a knife, but with words.
[time=2177] But think about the other side.
[time=2180] When you speak to others, do you bring healing to them?
[time=2184] Do you encourage them or do you slander them?
[time=2190] As you walk through life, what words come out of your mouth?
[time=2196] Are you calling people who are overweight, humiliating names?
[time=2200] Then you are a fool.
[time=2202] Are you calling people of different ethnic backgrounds, demeaning names?
[time=2206] Then you are a fool.
[time=2209] Are you slandering people behind their backs?
[time=2211] Then you are a fool.
[time=2215] And God has some very interesting words about that.
[time=2220] Psalms 1015 says this.
[time=2223] Whoever slanders his neighbor secretly, this is God speaking, I will destroy.
[time=2232] Let's examine our speech this morning, my dear brothers and sisters.
[time=2235] Let's examine our lives.
[time=2237] Are we wise or are we fools?
[time=2241] Because see, the wise builds through their speech.
[time=2249] Heal, they heal.
[time=2251] The fools tear down.
[time=2254] I think it was the great theologian/comedian Dave Berry who said,
[time=2262] "The person who is nice to you, but is not nice to the waitress, is not a nice person."
[time=2271] I was kidding about the fact that he was a theologian, but that was true.
[time=2277] The person who is nice to you, but not nice to the waitress, it's not a nice person.
[time=2285] The wise you can tell in the way they speak, in the way they act, in the way they react.
[time=2292] And lastly, and I want to spend most of my time here this morning.
[time=2297] The wise says no to immorality.
[time=2302] The wise says no to immorality and you probably can guess the next point.
[time=2307] The fool says yes to immorality.
[time=2310] You see, we need to look at the relationships to the opposite sex.
[time=2316] Actually, chapters 5, 6, and 7 in Proverbs deal with this.
[time=2322] I encourage you to read again not just the whole book, but especially to focus on chapters 5, 6, and 7.
[time=2329] So if you have your Bibles, please turn it me to chapter 7.
[time=2334] I don't know what version you're using, but mine has even a title, "Learning Against the Adultress."
[time=2346] My son, keep my words and treasure up my commandments with you, keep my commandments and live.
[time=2352] Keep my teaching as the apple of your eye, bind them on your fingers, write them on the tablet of your heart.
[time=2358] Say to your wisdom, say to wisdom, you are my sister and call inside your intimate friend to keep you from the forbidden woman.
[time=2367] And again here, different versions will do different things without word.
[time=2372] From the adultress with her smooth words, "For the window of my house I have looked out through my lattice and I have seen among the simple.
[time=2381] I have perceived among the youths a young man lacking sense.
[time=2385] Passing along the street near her corner, taking the road to her house in the twilight in the evening at the time of night and darkness."
[time=2397] Notice it doesn't say here that the wise person doesn't get tempted. It doesn't say that, does it?
[time=2404] Sometimes we feel guilty when we are tempted. You shouldn't feel guilty for being tempted.
[time=2408] You should feel guilty for reelding to temptation. But see, it doesn't say here that the wise person doesn't get tempted.
[time=2418] No. Everybody gets tempted.
[time=2423] The question is, how do we respond to temptation? You see, the wise person says no to immorality.
[time=2431] The wise is not fooled by her smooth words. It says here, "To keep you from the forbidden woman from the adultress with her smooth words."
[time=2442] I want to talk to the men this morning. Men, wise men, treat women with respect.
[time=2452] A wise man doesn't treat a woman as an object of desire but as a gift from God.
[time=2461] If women are created in the image of God, treat them as the image of God.
[time=2467] If they are the daughters of the king, then you are to treat them how, royally.
[time=2474] Men, be men of integrity. You will be tempted.
[time=2483] There will be women who will come to you to commit immorality. You have to decide today that you will be wise and say no to sin.
[time=2493] You will say no to immorality. Wise men say no to temptation like Joseph.
[time=2503] The Bible says that his boss's wife came to him day after day, day after day, and day after day, Joseph said what?
[time=2512] No. No. If you learn anything, man, this morning, learn this one simple word.
[time=2520] No. And say no to immorality. Wise men say no to immorality.
[time=2530] Men, I want to ask you this morning to make a commitment to live as a wise man, as men of integrity.
[time=2540] Ladies, what about you? Women, a wise woman will treat men with respect.
[time=2548] A wise woman will also say no to temptation no matter how popular the guy is.
[time=2560] A wise woman does not treat a man as an object of desire but as the godly leader he was meant to be.
[time=2568] So ladies, can I ask you to make a commitment as well?
[time=2572] To live as women of integrity? To say no to temptation?
[time=2578] And to treat men like the leader's god intended them to be?
[time=2585] You see, the wise person says no to immorality. The fool says yes to immorality.
[time=2594] Look at the story here in chapter 7.
[time=2598] It shows us this young man who gives in to temptation.
[time=2604] Of course, I have the words here at the end, resulting in verses 22 and 23.
[time=2610] But look in verse 10, because he describes the seduction process.
[time=2616] And behold, the woman meets him dressed as a prostitute.
[time=2620] Wily of heart, she is loud and wayward, her feet do not stay at home, now in the street, now in the market, and at every corner she lies in weight.
[time=2628] She seizes him and kisses him and whips, and with bold face she says to him, "I had to offer sacrifices, and today I have paid my vows." Did you catch that? She's using religious language.
[time=2640] She's not saying, "Hey, let's commit a sin against the Lord." No, she uses religious language.
[time=2648] I had to offer sacrifices, and today I have paid my vows, so now I have come out to meet you, to seek you eagerly, and I have found you.
[time=2655] I have spread my couch with coverings, colored linens from Egyptian linen.
[time=2659] I have performed my bed with my arrows and cinnamon.
[time=2662] Come, let us take our fill of love till morning.
[time=2665] Let us delight ourselves with love, for my husband is not at home.
[time=2668] He has gone on a long journey.
[time=2670] He took a bag of money with him, and a full moon he will come home.
[time=2675] And here's the fool.
[time=2678] With much seductive speech, she persuades him with her smooth talk she compels him.
[time=2684] All at once he follows her as an ox goes to the slaughter, whereas a stag is caught fast.
[time=2691] Till an arrow pierces its liver, as the bird rushes into a snare, he does not know they will cost him his life.
[time=2701] Did you catch that?
[time=2703] You see, Satan doesn't just want to hurt you.
[time=2706] Satan wants to kill you.
[time=2708] That's very important.
[time=2712] All at once he follows her as an ox goes to the slaughter.
[time=2716] Most of us have not seen an ox go to the slaughter.
[time=2719] I'm not in that kind of business.
[time=2721] I mean, I grade papers, and I kind of do that.
[time=2728] My nickname is the assassin.
[time=2737] Till an arrow pierces its liver, as the bird rushes into a snare, he does not know that it will cost him his life.
[time=2744] And now, oh sons, listen to me.
[time=2747] And be attentive to the words of my mouth.
[time=2749] Let not your heart turn aside to her ways.
[time=2752] Do not strain to her paths.
[time=2754] For many a victim she has laid low, and all her slain are mighty thrown.
[time=2759] Her house is the way of, oh, that's another word for the place of the dead or hell,
[time=2766] going down to the chambers of death.
[time=2772] If you are living a moral relationship today,
[time=2778] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I urge you to leave that relationship today.
[time=2783] Make that commitment that you're not going to be a fool anymore.
[time=2791] Come back to the path of wisdom, and say no to immorality, and start anew.
[time=2802] See, the fun fatale here strikes, and her blow is lethal.
[time=2807] It will cost him his life.
[time=2811] The ox is happy as it goes into the house, one scholar says.
[time=2817] Not knowing that a violent end is at the end, the other end of its journey.
[time=2824] Another scholar says, and I quote, "sexual freedom has ripped the harvest of bondage and destruction.
[time=2830] Relationship severed, trust forever lost, families torn apart, and diseases spreading like as delicately but as deadly as a sunrise upon the Saharan sand."
[time=2844] Again the conclusion, "O Psalms, listen to me, and this can be for daughters as well.
[time=2850] Be attentive to the words of my mouth.
[time=2853] Let not your heart turn away to her ways, do not strain to her paths.
[time=2858] For many a victim she has laid low." So, how do we guard our hearts?
[time=2865] We need to guard our hearts.
[time=2867] Let not your heart turn aside to her ways.
[time=2871] The movies that we watch, the books that we read, the websites that we visit will feed the heart.
[time=2879] Do we guard, or do we let loose?
[time=2884] Keep away, do not strain to her paths, flee sexual immorality, Paul writes to Timothy,
[time=2890] and consider the consequences.
[time=2893] Her house is the way of Sheol.
[time=2898] You see, your sin affects not just you, it affects your family, it affects your community,
[time=2904] it affects your church, it affects everybody around you.
[time=2909] Remember what Paul wrote to the church at Corinth.
[time=2913] 1 Corinthians chapter 6, "Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?
[time=2920] Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never.
[time=2926] Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her?
[time=2931] For as it is written, the two will become one flesh, but he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him.
[time=2938] Flea from sexual immorality.
[time=2941] Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body.
[time=2948] Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you?
[time=2953] Whom you have from God, you are not your own, for you are bought with a price, so glorify God in your body.
[time=2965] Are you wise or are you a fool?
[time=2970] The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil.
[time=2974] The fear of the Lord one turns away from evil.
[time=2980] I am not very good at art, but I like art.
[time=2988] I discovered this painting, which is apparently a very famous painting that you can find in Paris at the Louvre.
[time=2996] It is called the Ship of Fools.
[time=2999] I thought it was an interesting painting.
[time=3003] The people who are art historians tell us that these people, they are having fun in the Ship of Fools.
[time=3013] They are partying, they are flirting, they are doing all types of things.
[time=3017] But the reason is called the Ship of Fools.
[time=3021] Why? Because look at the top.
[time=3024] You see that?
[time=3026] Who is the captain?
[time=3028] The captain is a skull.
[time=3030] The idea is that this ship is going where?
[time=3034] To death.
[time=3036] This ship is going to death.
[time=3039] There is a way which seems right to a man, Proverbs 14, 12 says, right?
[time=3044] But it's "A" and it's the way of death.
[time=3048] So the idea is that if you are in the Ship of Fools, I urge you this morning to jump ship and come to Jesus.
[time=3063] Who is the only one, as the Bible says, is what? The wisdom of God.
[time=3069] God allows you turns and allows you to jump from your Ship of Fools and to come to Jesus.
[time=3077] Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom.
[time=3081] But we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to the Jews and folly to Gentiles.
[time=3086] But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.
[time=3092] I love the song we sang at the beginning.
[time=3097] I love all the songs that we sang.
[time=3100] Especially the first one.
[time=3102] Wherever you've been, whatever you've done, come as you are to His open.
[time=3107] Can you imagine Jesus with open arms?
[time=3113] Come as you are, come find His love.
[time=3120] Let's bow our heads, close our eyes, and let's evaluate our lives.
[time=3129] Have we been living a life of wisdom or life of foolishness?
[time=3135] If Jesus Christ is your Lord and Savior and yet you have strayed from the path of wisdom, come back to the way of wisdom.
[time=3145] If Jesus Christ is not your Lord and Savior, make the first step and surrender your life to Him.
[time=3151] Let's pray, dear Father, thank you for your word.
[time=3155] That even though written was written 3,000 years ago, it still holds timeless principles for us.
[time=3162] We come asking for forgiveness for the many times we live, like fools, in relationship to ourselves, in relationship to others, in relationship with you.
[time=3172] And I pray that today will be the day of salvation for those who don't know you.
[time=3177] And I pray that today will be the day we get back on the path of wisdom if we have strayed.
[time=3183] Teach us what it means to be wise.
[time=3185] Fill out your Holy Spirit in the way we speak, in the way we act, in the way we think.
[time=3193] Not only may we be wise in your eyes, but may we lead others to the wisdom of God that's only in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3201] As we sing the closing song, I pray that all of us will commit again to live as men and women of integrity, as men and women of wisdom.
[time=3216] In Christ's name, the one who has made wisdom for us, in His name I pray, amen.
[time=3224] When we walk with the Lord, in the light of His Word, what a glory He sheds on our way.
[time=3243] While we do His good, He abides with us too, and with all who will trust and obey.
[time=3259] Trust and obey, for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus.
[time=3271] But to trust and obey.
[time=3277] Staying, trusting, and obeying together.
[time=3281] Not a bird that we bear, not a sorrow we share.
[time=3291] But our toil heat up between repaying.
[time=3299] Not a breathe nor a loss, not a frown nor a cross.
[time=3308] That is blessed if we trust and obey.
[time=3315] Trust and obey, for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus.
[time=3328] But to trust and obey.
[time=3333] Please help me to trust and obey.
[time=3340] Lord, I love you. Please help me to trust and obey.
[time=3354] Amen fellowships me, we will sit at His feet, or walk by His sight in the way.
[time=3371] What He says we will do, when He says we will go, never fear only trust and obey.
[time=3387] Trust and obey, for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus.
[time=3399] But to trust and obey.
[time=3404] Trust and obey, for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus.
[time=3416] But to trust and obey.
[time=3422] Please help me to trust and obey.
[time=3428] Lord, I love you. Please help me to trust and obey.
[time=3452] [AMEN] Good morning and thank you for watching the Bible Hour this morning.
[time=3457] As you saw, we are in the book of Proverbs and we'll be in what scholars call wisdom literature for a little bit.
[time=3465] Wisdom literature is that genre that informs one about God's moral universe.
[time=3471] A wise person then is one who lives in harmony with these principles.
[time=3476] So according to the book of Proverbs, there are only two types of people.
[time=3480] The wise people and there are fools.
[time=3484] The question is, for us individually, what kind of people are we?
[time=3489] Are we wise people that live in accordance to God's moral universe according to His law?
[time=3494] Or are we fools who reject and even mock God's law?
[time=3499] The first step to becoming a wise person is to accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior.
[time=3506] The Apostle Paul makes it clear that Jesus was made the wisdom of God.
[time=3511] In other words, we cannot be wise unless Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior.
[time=3516] And then we can grow in this wisdom first by asking God for wisdom, as James says.
[time=3522] If anyone lacks wisdom, let him ask and God gives generously.
[time=3528] And if you're like me, you need wisdom every day.
[time=3532] In your relationship with God, in our relationship with each other, and even in our relationship to ourselves.
[time=3540] So we need to pray that God will give us the wisdom.
[time=3543] And I challenge you to read the book of Proverbs.
[time=3545] There are 31 chapters in the book of Proverbs, one for each day of the month.
[time=3551] Read one chapter a day.
[time=3554] I can promise you, he will keep the devil away, but I can promise you that God, as he promises,
[time=3560] will give us wisdom to live our lives in the way he wants us to live.
