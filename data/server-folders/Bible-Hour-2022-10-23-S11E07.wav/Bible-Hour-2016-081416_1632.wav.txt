[time=30] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=90] Good morning, Black Hawk, what a great morning of worship.
[time=95] My name is Chad Birch, I'm the head for the last two years, I've had the great privilege and honor to lead the really an amazing team, the pastor discovery team or PDT.
[time=108] With me today, Matt Brandeberger, also a member of the PDT and Doug Crane, a member of the Elder Board.
[time=115] And since our time together, two weeks ago, when we gave an announcement, I know we had kind of teased that, if you will, a little bit, that it would be a big announcement.
[time=125] We felt that it was.
[time=126] That day, the PDT made a recommendation to the elders, who we believe God has chosen as our next lead pastor.
[time=135] We made the recommendation to the elders that day, and they prayed about it.
[time=144] For that week, and then just this past Monday, the elders unanimously
[time=150] approved our recommendation for our next lead pastor.
[time=154] [APPLAUSE]
[time=165] I'm going to hand the mic off in a little bit to Matt and then Doug.
[time=168] So I want to make sure I say this, because you don't know how much your response just meant to me.
[time=177] And because it's you folks out there, your patience over the last two years, I just want to say thank you so much.
[time=183] I mean, the body of Christ has really come together here in Black Hawk, and all the credit goes to him, number one, but to you, sitting out there.
[time=191] And I just thank you so much for your prayers.
[time=194] Thank you for your patience during all of this.
[time=197] And I'm very excited to introduce to you Kevin Rivers,
[time=204] and I think up on the screen will be a picture of Kevin and his family.
[time=208] That's Kevin and his wife, Jessica, and their son Caleb, who I believe is six years old and Callie, who is three.
[time=217] Kevin and Jessica have been married for over ten years.
[time=221] Currently, Kevin is the Executive Pastor of Midway Church in Villa Rica, Georgia,
[time=229] which is about an hour and a half west of Atlanta.
[time=233] He's been there, I think, for a little over ten years, but he's currently the Executive Pastor.
[time=239] We've got some more background information on him coming up on the screens, but there you can see, born and raised in West Georgia, about an hour from Atlanta, his father is a pastor, and he was saved at an early age, called the ministry at age 18.
[time=254] Kevin's 29 years old, but he is the most mature 29-year-old I've ever met.
[time=259] He is mature beyond his years.
[time=261] He's been in ministry really since age 18, married again to Jessica in 2006.
[time=267] They're two children.
[time=268] They're in the process of adoption right now, and I'm sure we'll hear that story later on.
[time=273] And as I mentioned, currently the Executive Pastor at Midway Church in Villa Rica, Georgia.
[time=278] With this education, you can see there, Bachelor of Arts in Christian Ministry and Biblical Studies at New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary.
[time=285] He went on to get his masters at Liberty Baptist Theological Seminary, and he's currently pursuing a doctorate of educational ministries, pastoral ministry and theology,
[time=295] again, at the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary.
[time=298] So he's currently in process of doing that.
[time=301] I'll just, you know, I won't read through that.
[time=303] You can read that, and again, in a little bit, Doug's going to tell you how you can find out more information, but Kevin is a leader.
[time=309] He is a leader of leaders.
[time=311] He currently preaches at Midway.
[time=314] I'm guessing probably their current pastor preaches about 60% of the time, and he splits the duties with three other pastors for the other 40% of the time.
[time=323] You'll be able to go out and listen to his sermons on a site here.
[time=326] But at this point, I'm going to hand the mic over to Matt, and he's going to tell you a little bit more kind of on a personal level about Kevin.
[time=334] We also have a video we'd like for you to watch, which is an introductory video.
[time=337] You can just get a little idea of Kevin and Jessica.
[time=340] So Matt?
[time=341] Thanks, Chen.
[time=343] First, I've just got a few PDT unofficial stats for you from the last two years.
[time=348] We've had roughly 100 meetings, mostly, on Wednesday nights that have totaled over 250 hours.
[time=355] We've vetted over 130 candidates between our team, Tom Felinger and Vanderblumen.
[time=361] And listen to well over 200 sermons conducted over 30 interviews and exchanged roughly 1,000 emails.
[time=368] All of that has led us to Kevin, and for that we could not be more thankful.
[time=372] I shared a verse with you last year from Lamentations 325 and 26.
[time=377] I want to read that to you here this morning.
[time=380] It says, "The Lord is good to those whose hope is in him.
[time=383] To the one who seeks him, it is good to wait quietly on the salvation of the Lord."
[time=389] I can tell you that as a PDT, I'm sure we had our missteps.
[time=392] We were not perfect, but I do believe that we held fast to this verse.
[time=396] We kept our hope in the Lord, and we did not compromise.
[time=399] We waited patiently for him, and he has exceeded anything that we could have asked or imagined.
[time=406] Over the last couple months, my wife, Abby, and I have had the pleasure of getting to know Kevin and Jessica a little more deeply, mostly through texting and Instagram, the girls do Instagram.
[time=417] We have gotten to know them, even hung out with them a few times.
[time=421] I just want to tell you a little bit more about them.
[time=423] The first time we met them, we felt an immediate connection.
[time=426] We do share a lot in comments that may not be surprising, but this is a theme that we heard over and over from the rest of the PDT, to the elders, to their wives, a very diverse group of people, but everybody had that same feeling of connection.
[time=440] They're just genuine people whose love for the Lord and their desire to see his kingdom built
[time=446] is just so evident.
[time=448] Kevin, he's much more than just a nice guy.
[time=450] He's smart.
[time=451] He's driven.
[time=452] He's a proven leader.
[time=453] His leadership style is collaborative.
[time=455] He's a team builder.
[time=456] He's the kind of guy that you want to follow.
[time=459] He loves the word of God.
[time=461] He won't compromise doctrine to be culturally relevant, something that a lot of younger pastors tend to do,
[time=468] and we're thankful for that.
[time=470] I think the one thing that I would say about Kevin that has impressed me and us as a team the most
[time=476] is just the way he walks by faith, and he even expressed that at the young age of 17
[time=483] when he walked away from a very promising future in baseball, because he felt the Lord putting something else in his heart, and just a year later was called into the ministry, even though he was a shy, awkward kid.
[time=495] Those are Jessica's words, not mine.
[time=497] Thankfully, he's grown, and you'll hardly even be able to tell that today.
[time=501] But it's by faith that he did that, and it's by faith that he and Jessica are now coming to Blackhawk.
[time=507] You have to understand that they are in a very comfortable, very just everything is going well in their lives right now.
[time=514] This is something that they are leaving a situation at Midway Church where they know everybody there,
[time=521] friends, family, that's really their hometown.
[time=524] But it's Isaiah 43 that Kevin references over and over that God is doing something new in their lives, something great, and we're just thankful to be a part of that.
[time=533] We just could not be more excited about this as a PDT, as the elders and everybody, and I just want to say this is a big transition for them as well.
[time=543] We kind of think of it from our end, but just want to encourage us as a body to keep them in our prayers.
[time=548] Even today, Kevin's standing down at Midway Church, sharing their great news, our great joy with the body at Midway,
[time=556] and they just need prayer. It's going to be a hard day for them emotionally, yet at the same time they're excited.
[time=563] So, lift them up in prayer over the next several weeks so that we can just be strong for them.
[time=570] So, we're going to share a video with you here in just a second, and I'll just tell you that they do have accents.
[time=576] They're from the south, so just bear that in mind.
[time=579] And just a real quick story. The very first night that Abby and I hung out with Kevin and Jessica,
[time=585] Jessica was talking about our horses. She's a horse enthusiast, and one of the horses' name was Bail.
[time=591] I thought, well, that's kind of an odd name for a pastor's wife to have for a horse.
[time=596] And I said, "Bail," and she's like, you know, pagan god? And she said, "No, Bail." And Abby thought she said, "Bill?"
[time=603] He said, "Bill? No, Bail. You know like you ring a bail." Oh, oh, Belle.
[time=611] Okay. So, hopefully you are better listeners than we were.
[time=615] But again, this is the video that they first gave to us at Vanderblumen as a way to get to know Kevin and Jessica,
[time=624] and we thought it would be appropriate to show it here this morning.
[time=628] Hello, Black Hawk Team. My name is Kevin Rivers, and with me is my lovely wife, Jessica.
[time=633] And I want to introduce my family to you. I remember early in seminary, a professor making the statement that family is always your first ministry. And it's truly that for us. Family's a big priority.
[time=643] And so I want to start by introducing them to you. We have two kids that are napping right now.
[time=648] That's why it's quite enough here in the house for us to make this video for you.
[time=651] So I'll let Jessica tell you a little bit about our family to start us.
[time=654] Well, we've been married for 10 years. We actually just celebrated in March or 10th anniversary.
[time=660] And like you said, we have two kids. One is five, and one is three, and it's Caleb and Cowie.
[time=666] There they are. They're kind of cute. We're a little biased, but as I said, we do a lot as a family.
[time=672] One of the new adventures that we are on is the process of adoption.
[time=677] We're actually at the end of the process. So fingers crossed, it's going to be winding down very soon.
[time=684] And some of the things that we love to do is we have horses and dogs and a hamster.
[time=689] And we like to be outside with them and spend time with them and be outside and go and ride bikes and go to the park.
[time=698] I'm just kind of normal things, but that's number one for us.
[time=703] And really a few things lie to fire under me or put a smile on my face more than getting to do ministry together as a family.
[time=710] We view ministry as a team effort, what God calls me to do.
[time=714] He's calling us to do, and he won't contradict himself, and that he calls us all to it together.
[time=718] And he's proven that all of these years we were high school sweethearts and moved into that area of ministry together from the get-go.
[time=725] And so a few things put a smile on my face more than that, but also I really have a great passion for preaching the gospel.
[time=731] I just love being an evangelist with my life, certainly with my preaching.
[time=735] Nothing really likes a fire under me more than seeing people saved and baptized, coming to know the Lord, whether that's in a corporate service or is in one-on-one conversations in life.
[time=746] And then even beyond that, I'd say another thing that really likes a fire under me is when I see people that I'm investing in, get it.
[time=754] And you know what I mean by get it, it's when they really own the mission, when they really own ministry and an investment that I've been able to make in them, turns into godly decisions in their family or godly decisions in their workplace.
[time=767] And I can think of a guy named Tony that I invested in, got to be a part of leading him to the Lord in the past couple of years, and eventually got to interview him on stage in our church to celebrate his life because of that, because he had led somebody to Christ for the first time.
[time=781] And so when people own ministry, you want Ephesians 4 where people are being equipped, the works of ministry are being poured into and equipped within God's people, that's what really likes a fire under me and just keeps me going in ministry.
[time=796] And when it comes to this position a little bit about where I am and where we are right now, Isaiah 43 verses 18 and 19 have kind of characterized a lot about what God's been doing in us.
[time=806] We're in a very comfortable place with ministry, but we feel like God is saying to us like he does in Isaiah 43, I'm going to do something new in you.
[time=815] I'm going to make a way in the wilderness, I'm going to make rivers in the desert.
[time=818] We haven't known really what that has meant, but we knew God's been up to something new.
[time=822] He's put a spirit of restlessness and drive for a new vision to be able to pursue and lead, and really truly to build on the foundation of leadership and ministry that God has blessed me with more than 10 years of okay.
[time=835] More than 10 years of vocational ministry in a way that multiplies it in a church setting where it's needed where vision is needed because I just breathe vision right now.
[time=844] That's really where I'm at.
[time=846] And so kind of within that a few things stood out to us about this role outside of just that kind of an opportunity with great potential in the Fort Wayne area.
[time=855] One is just that you're a mobilizing kind of church.
[time=858] She already mentioned to you Jessica did about our process of adoption, and I saw that you have a grafted ministries that is really centered around that really grabbed our attention because not just because it's something that we're a part of, but we really believe in.
[time=872] I'm really a proponent of the church being known in the community.
[time=876] I think that the community should know where the church is.
[time=879] Even if they don't like the church or agree with everything the church has to stand before or on, they know who they are because the church is loving and making such a difference in the community.
[time=887] And it seems like you're that type of a mobilizing kind of church in local ministry in your community, but then also global mobilization.
[time=895] I'm a big believer in an acts one eight kind of strategy sending people out.
[time=900] I heard a quote recently that the church should be more about sending capacity than seating capacity.
[time=906] And it seems like you're a sending kind of church and that's definitely the kind of setting that I will thrive in an acts one eight strategy that starts in our Jerusalem moves to Judea and Samaria.
[time=915] And Samaria and to the ends of the earth. And so those are a few of the things that have really stood out to us.
[time=920] But I just want to introduce ourselves and we want you to know that we are praying for you.
[time=924] I pray Proverbs three five and six one of my favorite discernment prayers and verses and all scripture that as you lean not on your understanding and we do the same, but in all our ways acknowledge him that he will direct our paths.
[time=937] And so no matter what that may look like for us and for you guys there at Black Hawk Ministries know that you have our prayers and we want to introduce ourselves and let you know that we'll keep praying on this journey with you guys.
[time=948] God bless.
[time=952] Well, on behalf of the elders, I can't tell you how thankful I was to be in that room last Monday night when we unanimously and enthusiastically voted to bring Kevin to you as our candidate for lead pastor.
[time=975] I just want to take a minute also as an elder to thank these guys and the rest of the PDT for all their.
[time=990] It's been really great to be at peace knowing that that group of that body of people was relying on God to lead them to our next lead pastor.
[time=1003] I'm here to tell you just a little bit about next steps. And so I'm going to tell you about three things that are that you're going to have an opportunity to get to know Kevin and his family better in the coming weeks.
[time=1015] First of all, you need to know that Kevin will be preaching here at Black Hawk on Sunday August 21st. That's two weeks from today.
[time=1023] So you'll all want to make plans to be here for that if you can. And then you also need to know that our church Constitution requires us to hold a vote. So we'll be having a special congregational meeting immediately following that service.
[time=1038] And so even though the PDT and the elder board have unanimously bring Kevin before you, our Constitution requires a 75% affirmative vote by all voting members that are present to elect our next lead pastor. So that's how that works.
[time=1057] The second thing that we'll be doing is providing you with some meet and greet opportunities so that you can get to know Kevin and his family in a smaller setting.
[time=1067] We don't have the details of that yet, but there will be several events held during the weekend that he's here. And so we'll make that available to you as soon as we can.
[time=1075] And you'll want to make plans to be part of at least one of those events.
[time=1080] The third thing is that we'll make some resources available to you today. For those of you that are on the church email thing by one o'clock today, you'll get an email with a link.
[time=1091] And if you're not part of that, you can go to the church homepage, the website, and you can get that link and we'll also make it available by other means.
[time=1098] But you'll be able to get a link to Kevin's website. And from there, you can listen to his sermons. You can read more about his lovely family.
[time=1108] And you can just get, I think, a real good idea of Kevin's passion for ministry.
[time=1113] Lastly, I just want to emphasize that if you want to be a part of determining who our next lead pastor will be, you do need to be a member.
[time=1123] So if that's something that you've not done, you've thought about doing it, maybe you've been postponing it, please call our church office as soon as possible, 4937400.
[time=1133] And make some plans to get that ball moving if you want to become a member.
[time=1139] I just want to thank you, our body, for your faithfulness again during this time.
[time=1145] It's been two years and you've been faithful and we appreciate it.
[time=1149] It's a great time to be part of this body, and I'm really excited not only for what God has done in our past, but for what he's going to do in the months and years to come.
[time=1160] Will you pray with me? Heavenly Father, we give you thanks this morning. You are good.
[time=1167] We sang it this morning already. You are good and your love endures.
[time=1171] And we see it now as we have waited on you to bring us a man who would help lead our church forward.
[time=1180] And we believe that we found that person. I pray for Kevin and Jessica today as they are standing in front of their church talking about a decision that they've made to follow you in obedience to come candidate here.
[time=1195] God, we just pray that you will preside over the entire process and we will be careful to give you all the thanks and the praise and the glory for everything that you'll do. In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1210] Good morning. Please open your Bibles to the Book of Proverbs.
[time=1215] Today we're going to talk about living wisely in a foolish world. We're going to start in chapter 6.
[time=1222] If you don't have a Bible, there are Bibles in your pews, page 306.
[time=1231] While you do that, I want to say that I'm very happy for you about the new developments.
[time=1239] For those of you who are new, my name is Tiberius and I am the interim pastor here at Blackhawk.
[time=1246] I've been interim since last September and I have a day job. I teach Hebrew and Old Testament at Grace College in Theological Seminary.
[time=1256] So if you want to send your kids to a good Christian college, please talk to me.
[time=1262] Or you might want to pursue seminary studies also, please talk to me.
[time=1267] I want to command the PDT and the elders for their hard work.
[time=1276] I became a pastor at the age of 26. So 28 is kind of old if you ask me.
[time=1285] I felt a goal to the ministry at 16. Kevin got his call at 18.
[time=1293] Now there's a problem with the accent.
[time=1300] I want you to know that I give English lessons.
[time=1306] So if you want to teach Kevin to put the accent on the right syllable,
[time=1314] you send them to me.
[time=1320] From what I've seen and what I've known of him, I think is the kind of man you need for the next step in your journey.
[time=1329] So I'm very, very happy for you.
[time=1333] So in my last Sunday at Blackhawk will be August 28.
[time=1341] So today I'm going to talk about Proverbs.
[time=1345] Next Sunday I'm going to talk about Ecclesiastes.
[time=1348] And then Kevin will preach, and then on the 28th my last sermon will be on the Song of Songs.
[time=1355] Isn't that good?
[time=1358] Because if I say something controversial, are they going to fire me?
[time=1364] Anyway, I thought since we're around Solomon we end with Solomon.
[time=1369] Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, the Song of Songs.
[time=1372] So today let's get back to Proverbs.
[time=1374] We started last week on Proverbs and we saw that the book is written as principles, not promises.
[time=1383] Sometimes we read Proverbs and we think, oh this is a promise for me.
[time=1387] These are principles that God put together for people to live in harmony with His moral universe.
[time=1397] And we saw that in the book of Proverbs there are only two types of people.
[time=1400] The wise, those who live in harmony with these principles, and the fool who rejects Godly principles.
[time=1409] Remember the fool in the book of Proverbs is not a person with a low IQ.
[time=1416] The fool in the book of Proverbs is not one who's academically challenged.
[time=1420] The fool in the book of Proverbs is one who knows God's principles and yet refuses to live by them.
[time=1430] So this morning I have something for everybody.
[time=1434] I have something for the children, I have something for the husband, something for the wives, something for the parents.
[time=1440] But I'm going to start with three key principles that are true for everybody.
[time=1445] First of all, the book of Proverbs teaches us that we need to be industrious.
[time=1453] The wise person works hard.
[time=1456] Look at me in chapter six piece of Proverbs.
[time=1460] Go to the end, O slugger, consider her ways and be wise.
[time=1465] Without having any chief officer or ruler, she prepares her bread and summer and gathers her food in harvest.
[time=1472] How long will you lie there, O slugger?
[time=1475] When will you rise from your sleep?
[time=1477] A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest, and poverty will come upon you like a robber and want like an armed man.
[time=1489] The principle of hard work is not an American invention.
[time=1494] It is a biblical principle.
[time=1497] In the Bible it is clear that we are instructed to work hard.
[time=1502] Remember in the Ten Commandments, even God says, "Six days you shall what?"
[time=1510] Now we have changed that, haven't we?
[time=1513] Think about that for a second.
[time=1515] The Bible said, "Six days you shall work and the seventh is for rest, right, and worship."
[time=1521] We, as a society, decided that we are smarter and we have reduced the six to exactly.
[time=1530] You never thought about it, have you?
[time=1532] No, but see, what we are doing for different reasons, we have decided to take that six and make it as small as possible.
[time=1544] I was in Romania this past summer and I saw a guy that I haven't seen in twenty years and he is in his thirties and he said,
[time=1555] "My goal is to retire in two years." And that was his goal, to retire so he doesn't do anything.
[time=1563] But the Bible teaches us the wise people work hard, they are industrious.
[time=1570] My dad instilled that into us at a young age.
[time=1574] I remember him telling us over and over again, "I have two older brothers." And he always told us and I'll never forget, he said, "It is not a shame to work."
[time=1584] He said, "It's a shame to steal, to cheat, but it is not a shame to work."
[time=1592] His dad died when he was six, so he was sent to an orphanage from the age of six to the age of ten.
[time=1599] When he got back home, he worked.
[time=1602] He entered the factory at the age of sixteen.
[time=1605] And he worked there until the age of forty-eight when he defected to come to the United States.
[time=1610] Do you know what he did when he came to the United States?
[time=1613] He did not stay on welfare, he went and he got a job.
[time=1618] And he retired from that very job and is now eighty years old.
[time=1624] And God has blessed him and he modeled for us what it means to be a hard worker.
[time=1632] Six days you shall work and the seventh is for the Lord.
[time=1639] You are God.
[time=1640] Avoid, my dear brothers and sisters, the sin of laziness.
[time=1645] And avoid its evil cousin procrastination.
[time=1649] You know him?
[time=1650] Procrastinators of the world unite.
[time=1656] Tomorrow.
[time=1660] That's the lazy person's favorite day.
[time=1664] Tomorrow.
[time=1665] You know what you need to do, but you'll do it tomorrow.
[time=1668] And please, please understand me right.
[time=1671] Some of you are sick and cannot work.
[time=1675] Some of you are moms who take care of kids, you actually work more than your husband, probably who works nine to five.
[time=1682] I'm not talking about you, but I'm talking about you that you can work and you don't want to work.
[time=1689] You can work, but instead of working you just eat pop tarts and watch soap pop for us.
[time=1695] According to the Bible, you are a fool.
[time=1700] And the Bible allows us to get back on the path of wisdom and get to work and work hard.
[time=1706] Actually, there is a verse in the New Testament.
[time=1708] You might say, Tiberius does the Old Testament, give me something from the New.
[time=1711] Okay?
[time=1712] You ready?
[time=1713] Paul writes, "The person who doesn't work should not eat." Uh-oh.
[time=1718] That's in the Bible.
[time=1720] That is not in the US Constitution.
[time=1722] That is in the Bible.
[time=1724] My dear brothers and sisters, we need to learn to work hard and to be industrious.
[time=1729] And there is a reason why I'm starting with this principle because it's true for all the other principles I'm going to talk about.
[time=1737] Second principles, second principle, be a good communicator, use good, use kind words.
[time=1745] I don't know about you, but I've heard a lot of people say, it doesn't matter what you say, it's how you say it.
[time=1751] Have you heard that?
[time=1752] That is not true and that's not biblical.
[time=1754] The Bible speaks about what we need to say and how we need to say it.
[time=1760] The Bible speaks about both.
[time=1763] Notice, please, it starts first with what to say.
[time=1766] The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.
[time=1775] When you speak, are people edified or are they brought low?
[time=1785] Are your words so kind and encouraging that people are better off for it or do you discourage them?
[time=1796] Someone wise one said there are only two types of people in this world.
[time=1799] Elevator people, those who lift you up and basement people, those who will drag you down.
[time=1805] Let me ask you, your words, do they elevate people or do they drag people down?
[time=1812] Because if you elevate people, if you give them life, that means your mouth is a fountain of life.
[time=1822] See, Proverbs 15 1 tells us not just what to say, but how to say it.
[time=1828] A soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.
[time=1844] Psalm 36 9 tells us that God is the source of life.
[time=1849] But the fountain of life springs up from the wise person and speaks softly.
[time=1855] A soft answer turns away wrath.
[time=1862] Do you know people who like to scream and yell, don't raise your hands.
[time=1866] Do you know people who like to scream and yell?
[time=1870] I want to tell you this morning that screaming and yelling is not a sign of power.
[time=1876] It is not a sign of strength, it is a sign of weakness.
[time=1881] The reason people scream and yell is because when they speak softly, their words don't have power enough to get their point across.
[time=1890] So then they scream and they yell, that is not a sign of power, that is a sign of weakness.
[time=1897] Next time someone yells at you, answer softly and tell them that.
[time=1905] Husband, if you like to scream and yell, I am inviting you this morning to repent of that sin and to learn how to speak softly.
[time=1917] Wife, if you like to scream and yell, kids, husband, dog, I invite you this morning to come back on the path of obedience and the path of wisdom and to speak soft words.
[time=1934] Amen? Okay, that was a week, amen, Michael, wasn't it? Or maybe you like this one next.
[time=1946] Be truthful. In a world that encourages lying, I am asking you what Solomon is asking all of us to tell the truth.
[time=1960] Proverbs 12, 22, lying lips are an abomination to the Lord, but those who act faithfully are His delight.
[time=1968] Honesty, according to the Bible, is the best policy.
[time=1981] Ephesians 4 puts it like this, "Therefore, having put away falsehood, let each one of you speak the truth with His neighbor, for we are members one of another."
[time=1995] Ephesians 6, 14, "Stand there for having fastened on the belt of truth." We are asked to be truthful in communication.
[time=2007] We need to emphasize truth-telling at home, at work, at church, whatever we are, not forgetting the previous principle.
[time=2016] Speak the truth in love. Speak soft words, words that are encouraged, words that build up.
[time=2027] Work hard. And sometimes we need to work hard to be truthful, right?
[time=2032] We need to work hard to tell the truth. We need to work hard even to say good words.
[time=2038] Sometimes you have to look up in a dictionary to see what word can I use.
[time=2042] I do that a lot. I just did that this morning. There are a lot of words that I still need to learn.
[time=2048] I look them up. I've got to work hard. But we live in a society not just lies, but encourages lying.
[time=2060] You ready for some of them? I'll just give you three. It's a choice, not a child. That's a lie.
[time=2069] It doesn't matter what you believe as long as you're sincere. That's a lie.
[time=2074] It matters what you believe. And my favorite one, one size fits.
[time=2081] One size fits all, really? One size fits all, that's a lie.
[time=2090] And yet it's printed everywhere. Three key principles, my dear brothers and sisters.
[time=2096] First of all, work hard. Use kind words and be truthful.
[time=2101] And now, for those of you who are children here and have parents, again, I said I'm going to have something for everybody.
[time=2108] For children, we have something for husbands and wives and then for parents.
[time=2112] Then I'm going to start with the children. First of all, and children, by the way, not just children.
[time=2117] Those of you who have parents, even if they're older, this is true for all of us.
[time=2121] First of all, be a good son or daughter, obey your parents.
[time=2125] That's how the book of Proverbs starts.
[time=2128] Here, my son, your father's instruction and for saying like your mother's teaching, for they are graceful garland, for your head and pendants, for your neck.
[time=2139] Proverbs 23, 22, listen to your father who gave you life and do not despise your mother when she is old.
[time=2147] By the way, this was not a new teaching. Solomon knows the law.
[time=2152] And he knows the first, the fifth commandment, honor your father and your mother.
[time=2158] He is just elaborating on that. And Paul picks it up in Ephesians 6.
[time=2163] Children, obey your parents in the Lord for this is right.
[time=2166] Honor your father and mother. This is the first commandment to the promise that it might go well with you that you may live long in the land.
[time=2174] So if you're here and you have a parent and you disobey your parent, you are living a foolish life.
[time=2182] If you want to be wise, you've got to listen to your parents.
[time=2187] Be a good son or daughter, listen to your parents, obey your parents and then honor your parents.
[time=2194] Notice, please, Solomon gives us two bad examples of what he means to dishonor your parents.
[time=2200] If one curses his father or his mother, his lamp will be put out in utter darkness.
[time=2212] If you call your parents names, you are a fool.
[time=2220] I hope none of you cursed your parents.
[time=2223] But if you have, the Bible says, you are a fool.
[time=2229] If one curses his father or his mother, notice, please, they will incur the judgement of God.
[time=2237] His lamp will be put out in utter darkness.
[time=2241] The economy, 27, 16, clearly states, cursed be anyone who dishonors his father and his mother.
[time=2250] Honor your parents by not cursing them and honor your parents by not robbing them.
[time=2257] Or we can put that in a positive way by helping them financially rather than robbing from them.
[time=2264] Whoever robs his father or his mother and says that is no transgression, is a companion to a man who destroys.
[time=2272] Now, I know some of you, sometimes rationalize this.
[time=2278] Look, I'm going to take for my parents and it's mine anyway because they're going to die one day.
[time=2285] We rationalize it.
[time=2289] Or we're going to take from my parents because they cannot manage their finances anymore.
[time=2295] I'll manage it for them.
[time=2298] Oh, we are all family, we do everything together.
[time=2303] One scholar puts it like this, children have no more right to their parents' property while they are living than a bandit from outside the family.
[time=2314] Another scholar puts it like this and I quote, "implicitly the Lord will see to it then the unconscionable son will be repaid in kind." Because he says here what?
[time=2327] Whoever robs his father or his mother and says there is no transgression, is a companion to the man who destroys.
[time=2335] Obey your parents, honor them by what you say about them, but you help them financially, honor them in the way you speak.
[time=2344] Do not mock them.
[time=2346] The eye, the mocks of father and scorn to obey, a mother will be picked out by the ravens of the valley and eaten by the vultures.
[time=2355] That's a scene from a horror movie and I don't need to elaborate on that.
[time=2362] But the Bible is very clear to distinguish between why sons and daughters who obey and honor their parents and those who don't, who are fools, who make fun of their parents in their old age, who steal from them, who mock them even.
[time=2381] I want to talk to you if you're here and you're a teenager or if you're young.
[time=2386] I want to encourage you not to use your teenage years as extension of your childhood.
[time=2396] But use your teenage years to get ready for your adult life.
[time=2401] And I want to encourage your parents to prepare your children for that.
[time=2407] What you do and how you raise them will make a difference, and I'm going to talk more about that towards the close.
[time=2416] Be a good son or daughter.
[time=2418] Obey and honor your parents.
[time=2426] What about husbands?
[time=2428] I have 11 minutes and 44 seconds.
[time=2431] I know some of you are counting.
[time=2433] Hey, I have a reservation for lunch, so I got to make it.
[time=2436] Okay, so I'm going to make it, I hope.
[time=2440] Be a good husband.
[time=2442] Be faithful.
[time=2443] Look to chapter 5, please.
[time=2445] If you're a husband here this morning, chapter 5 is very important because it starts by
[time=2456] describing the charm of the seductress, the forbidden, the immoral woman,
[time=2462] and it goes on to describe the price that the unfaithful husband pays.
[time=2470] See that the faithful husband is wise, says no to immorality.
[time=2475] But the foolish husband says yes to immorality, he's a fool.
[time=2480] So, starting in verse 8 of Proverbs 5, "Keep your way far from her and do not go near the door of her house,
[time=2490] lest you give your honor to others and yours to the merciless.
[time=2494] Let strangers take their fill of your strength and your labors go to the house of a foreigner.
[time=2499] And at the end of your life you've grown when your flesh and body are consumed and you say how I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof.
[time=2509] I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or inclined my ear to my instructors.
[time=2514] I am at the brink of utter ruin in the assembled congregation." So, what are you to do?
[time=2520] If you're not going to go there, where can you go?
[time=2523] And that's what Solomon emphasizes here.
[time=2526] A wise husband is faithful and invests in his wife.
[time=2531] Look in verses 15 and on.
[time=2533] Drink water from your own cistern, flowing water from your own well.
[time=2538] Should your springs be scattered abroad streams of water in the streets, let them be for yourself alone and not for strangers with you.
[time=2546] Let your fountain be blessed and rejoicing the wife of your youth.
[time=2550] A lovely deer, a graceful doe.
[time=2552] Let her breasts fill you all at all times with delight.
[time=2555] Being toxicated always in her love.
[time=2560] Derek Kindler explains in his commentary and I quote, "It is highly important to see sexual delight in marriage as God given, and history confirms that when marriage is viewed chiefly as a business arrangement,
[time=2574] not only is God's bounty misunderstood, but human passions seek other outlets."
[time=2583] And what he focuses on this expression at all times, which in some versions is translated always.
[time=2590] What does that mean?
[time=2591] He means, and I quote, "The blessed wife's love making should be always available to drench and intoxicate the thirsty husbands." So husbands, where do you invest your passions and your energy?
[time=2607] According to the Bible, your passions and your energy should be invested fully in your wife.
[time=2612] What about you ladies?
[time=2618] Be a good wife, be a hero.
[time=2621] Now you might say that doesn't fit, Tiberius.
[time=2624] Hero and wife, what's up with that?
[time=2627] You might say, Tiberius, you need more English words to learn.
[time=2633] Actually, I want to argue this morning that this is not a mistake.
[time=2640] I want to show from chapter 31 that true heroism is domestic.
[time=2648] Let me say that again.
[time=2650] True heroism is domestic.
[time=2654] Why do I say that?
[time=2656] Well, when we read these verses in chapter 31, an excellent wife.
[time=2664] By the way, that translation is Ify.
[time=2669] In the ESV says an excellent wife, and the NASB, the New American Standard says the same thing.
[time=2675] The King James version, a little closer, a virtuous woman, NIV, the wife of a noble character,
[time=2682] and I'm going to show how all those are probably wrong translations, but we're going to get there.
[time=2689] She's a precious woman for sure because it says she's far more precious than jewels.
[time=2696] She's a woman of integrity because the heart of her husband trusts her.
[time=2702] She's a doer of good deeds.
[time=2704] She does him good all the days of her life.
[time=2707] But the reason I describe this woman as a hero is because interestingly enough, if you read this in Hebrew,
[time=2715] she is not described by adjectives, but she's described with verbs.
[time=2721] Very interesting.
[time=2722] Only two adjectives are used of her, the rest are verbs.
[time=2726] And not only are they verbs, but they are verbs usually used in battle.
[time=2732] That's why I said true heroism is domestic, and I say here be a hero because the words used here.
[time=2741] Verse 11, the heart of her husband trusts in her and he will have no lack of gain.
[time=2750] That's what the ESV says, no lack of gain.
[time=2753] But actually, both the ESV and the NIV miss this because the literal translation is
[time=2761] the heart of her husband trusts in her and he lacks no plunder.
[time=2767] Plander is a term that comes from war language, battle language.
[time=2775] Plander is something once gets after winning a war.
[time=2780] She is described with a hero like language.
[time=2787] Verse 15, she rises while it is yet night and provides food for her household.
[time=2793] Again, in English it's just as food, that's not what it is.
[time=2797] Actually, in the Hebrew it's something like this.
[time=2801] She rises while it is yet night and provides prey, P-R-E-Y.
[time=2808] Another term used in battle, something you get from the spoils of war.
[time=2815] Verse 17, she dresses herself with strength, a word that's used of mighty warriors.
[time=2823] Verse 29, she surpasses them all.
[time=2827] It's actually a verse that describes victory in battle.
[time=2833] So in my humble but correct opinion.
[time=2839] The best way to translate those few words is a woman, a mighty woman of valor.
[time=2850] True heroism is domestic.
[time=2854] You want to be a hero?
[time=2856] Be a good wife.
[time=2858] And then go to chapter 31 and describe it.
[time=2862] The husbands, be faithful.
[time=2866] Ladies, be heroes.
[time=2868] And I'm going to close in the next four minutes for those of us who are parents.
[time=2874] Practice, Godly discipline.
[time=2878] I know this is not a new teaching for you, but our children are not born morally neutral.
[time=2888] The Bible says that our children are born in what?
[time=2892] Sin, you can say it.
[time=2895] Psalm 51-4, David affirms.
[time=2899] In sin, my mother conceived me.
[time=2903] Our children are not born neutral.
[time=2906] They are born in sin.
[time=2908] And we need to bring them to the path of wisdom and obedience.
[time=2914] And the way to do that, it is through discipline, but Godly discipline.
[time=2919] There's an ungodly type of discipline.
[time=2922] Some of you have experience that when your parents were angry and in their anger, they hit you.
[time=2928] That is not Godly discipline.
[time=2935] The child's problem is not information deficit.
[time=2939] The child's problem is that he or she is a little a sinner.
[time=2946] No amends on that one, right?
[time=2948] Because our children are perfect little people, right?
[time=2952] But that's not what the Bible says.
[time=2954] The Bible says that they are born in sin and they need to be brought to the path of obedience and wisdom via the rod of discipline.
[time=2963] Whoever spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is diligent to discipline him.
[time=2968] Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of discipline drives him far from him.
[time=2975] A.J. Aronside says the best, and I quote, "Family discipline should be patterned after the divine discipline of Hebrews 12.
[time=2984] It is not love, but the lack of it that leaves a child to himself to develop unchecked tendencies and propensities which shall result in future sorrow.
[time=2997] Hours is a day of great laxity on this point. The coming generation will reap the bitter fruit of the absence of restraint and the evident aversion of chastening, so manifest in the majority of homes."
[time=3011] A sickly sentimentality, supposedly wiser and more compassionate the God himself, has made it fashionable to decry the use of the rod as a relic of barbarous age.
[time=3023] But the difference in the character of children and the home is certainly in the favor of scripture as anyone may see who will.
[time=3032] You see, the rod has a function. The function of the rod is to give wisdom.
[time=3041] The rod and reproof give wisdom, but a child left to himself brings shame to his mother.
[time=3048] When the wicked increase, transgression increases, but the righteous will look upon their downfall, discipline your son and he will give you rest.
[time=3057] He will give you delight to your heart. I don't have time to expound this.
[time=3063] So if you'd like to read and if you are a parent, I highly recommend Ted Tripp's book, "Shepherding a Child's Heart," "Shepherding a Child's Heart" by Ted Tripp.
[time=3081] Parenting is hard work. Why did I start with hard work? It's because being a good father is hard work.
[time=3091] Being a good mother is hard work. Being a good husband is hard work. Being a hero wife is hard work. Being a good son or daughter is hard work.
[time=3100] So hard work is embedded in everything that we do as Christians.
[time=3106] But I want to close with this illustration. The last thing that you can do for your children is to affirm their abilities.
[time=3117] And I'll explain. It comes from Proverbs 22-6. You know the verse. "Train up a child in the way he should go. Even when he is old, he will not depart from it."
[time=3129] The only problem with the word "train" is not the word "train" in Hebrew.
[time=3134] So I looked it up and checked it and all explains it best, and I'm going to try to quote it.
[time=3142] The language used here, "train up a child," is the same with "affirm your children's ability early on."
[time=3153] Pictures the custom of a midwife dipping her finger into a pool of crushed dates in order to massage the palate and gums of a newborn.
[time=3163] Remember how when they're newborn you teach them how to suck, right? You guys know that if you had children, right?
[time=3170] This is the picture. The picture that you, in that time apparently, the midwife was dipping her finger into a pool of crushed dates in order to massage the palate and gums of a newborn.
[time=3182] This encouraged the baby's sucking instinct so the nursing could begin as soon as possible.
[time=3188] In other words, she stimulated the baby's gums in order to encourage the kind of behavior that would benefit the child.
[time=3197] She wisely and deftly utilized the baby's natural instinct to guide him toward what is best.
[time=3205] Swindol says, "The best parental training is accomplished when we opt for inspiration rather than coercion."
[time=3217] We do this by discovering the child's natural desires and unique abilities and by encouraging the behavior that will allow him or her to develop accordingly.
[time=3231] Here's the illustration. This painting is done by one Benjamin West.
[time=3237] Now, if you're an art historian, you know who he is. Benjamin West was hired to do portraits such of George Washington and Benjamin Franklin.
[time=3249] This portrait is of his wife and son.
[time=3255] And Aleister Beck tells this illustration, and I'm going to close with this illustration.
[time=3260] Benjamin West tells the story that when he was about six years old, he was instructed by his mom to watch his cousin Sally.
[time=3271] Sally was younger than six. He was six.
[time=3277] And as she left, she said, "Don't mess around while I'm gone. Look after Sally and I'll be back."
[time=3284] Now, as soon as the mom left, Ben, Benjamin, got into this coloring things and paint, and he decided that he's going to paint a little Sally.
[time=3296] So you can imagine when the mom got back, there was the canvas, which was supposed to be Sally.
[time=3303] Can you imagine where the rest of the collars were?
[time=3308] It was a mess. It was a mess. But his mom came home, and Benjamin explains.
[time=3320] She took the paper, she looked, and she said, "That's Sally."
[time=3329] And then bent down and kissed his forehead.
[time=3334] And Benjamin West says this, "That kiss made me a painter."
[time=3346] As I look around, at the canvas of your own life, I can tell you it's a mess.
[time=3356] I look at Darren, he's a mess. But you know what?
[time=3367] I imagine God bending down and kissing us with our foreheads and still saying, "That's Darren.
[time=3380] That's Sarah. That's Phil. It's a mess."
[time=3387] But his kiss makes us who we are. Affirm your child's abilities.
[time=3397] We'll close by praying. We'll sing our prayer. Darren, use your God-given abilities to lead us.
[time=3408] In one of my most famous hymns. Have dine own way, Lord. Have dine own way.
[time=3418] Thou art the potter, I am the clay.
[time=3423] Move me and make me after thy will, while I am waiting, yielded, and still.
[time=3433] Good morning, and thank you for watching the Bible Hour this morning.
[time=3437] Again, we're in the Book of Proverbs, and I challenge you to read the Book of Proverbs.
[time=3442] It's so practical because it teaches us how to live our lives every day.
[time=3447] Remember that in the Book of Proverbs there are only two types of people, wise people and foolish people.
[time=3454] The wise ones are the ones that live according to God's moral universe and principles.
[time=3461] Another thing to remember is that the Book of Proverbs contains principles, not promises.
[time=3468] And that is very, very important to remember.
[time=3472] And these principles are good, whether you live in the United States or abroad.
[time=3479] These are universal principles that are good for every day.
[time=3484] Again, some principles that we looked at this morning have to do with hard work.
[time=3489] Hard work is not an American concept.
[time=3492] It is a biblical concept.
[time=3494] Wise people work hard.
[time=3497] Foolish people are lazy.
[time=3500] Very important principles that will actually help us not just with our work.
[time=3508] When we go to our place of employment, but those are important principles when we deal with being a spouse.
[time=3515] We need to work hard at our marriages.
[time=3518] We need to work hard at being good parents.
[time=3521] And if you are young, you need to work hard at being a good son and a good daughter.
[time=3528] All these principles come together and help us to be Godly people, wise people.
[time=3535] And again, to walk on the path of wisdom, you first need to make the first step and accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.
[time=3543] As Paul wrote, God made Jesus Christ the wisdom of God.
[time=3548] You cannot be wise apart from a correct relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=3553] That's the first step.
[time=3555] And then we need to follow the principles as set in Scripture to be wise.
[time=3561] May the good Lord help us to be that every day.
[time=3573] You
