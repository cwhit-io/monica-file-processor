[time=582] Wonderful merciful Savior.
[time=588] Precious Redeemer and friend.
[time=594] Who would have thought that lamb?
[time=600] Rescue the souls of man.
[time=614] Counselor, comfort, or keeper.
[time=626] Spirit we long to embrace.
[time=632] You offer hope when our hearts have hopelessly lost our way.
[time=636] Oh we hopelessly lost our way.
[time=643] You are the one that we praise.
[time=649] You are the one we adore.
[time=655] You live the healing and praise.
[time=660] Our hearts always hunger for.
[time=675] Oh mighty infinite Father.

[time=743] You give the healing and praise.
[time=747] Our hearts always hunger for.
[time=760] Who has the power to raise the dead?
[time=779] And who can save us from our sin?
[time=785] He is our hope, our righteousness.
[time=792] Jesus only Jesus.
[time=799] And who can make the blind to see?
[time=805] Who holds the keys that set us free?
[time=810] He paid all to bring us peace.
[time=817] Jesus only Jesus.
[time=825] Holy King Almighty Lord.
[time=831] Saints and angels all adore.

[time=929] Yours is the name above all names.
[time=934] You stand alone, high stand the may.
[time=939] Jesus only Jesus.
[time=964] Ecclesiastes 2, 1 through 11.
[time=970] I said to myself, "Come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good."
[time=977] But that also proved to be meaningless.
[time=980] Laughter I said is madness and what does pleasure accomplish?
[time=985] I tried cheering myself with wine and embracing folly.
[time=990] My mind still guiding me with wisdom.
[time=993] I wanted to see what was good for people to do under the heavens during the few days of their lives.
[time=1000] I undertook great projects.
[time=1002] I built houses for myself and planted vineyards.
[time=1006] I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.
[time=1010] I made reservoirs to water the groves of flourishing trees.
[time=1015] I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house.
[time=1021] I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me.
[time=1028] I amassed silver and gold for myself and the treasure of kings and provinces.
[time=1034] I acquired male and female singers and a harem as well, the delights of a man's heart.
[time=1041] I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me.
[time=1046] In all this, my wisdom stayed with me.
[time=1050] I denied myself nothing, my eyes desired.
[time=1053] I refused my heart, no pleasure.
[time=1056] My heart took delight in all my labor and this was the reward for all my toil.
[time=1063] Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toiled to achieve,
[time=1072] everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind, nothing was gained under the sun.
[time=1082] Good morning.
[time=1084] Please open your Bibles to Ecclesiastes chapter 2.
[time=1092] Excited about what God is doing in your church's family and looking forward in two weeks to preach my last sermon here.
[time=1101] And before I do that, I want to invite you, I think it's going to be like from 915 to 1015 for donuts and coffee and bacon.
[time=1114] No, I don't know, no bacon, no bacon.
[time=1119] Donuts, donuts.
[time=1125] Back in 1965, the pagan British band, the Rolling Stones,
[time=1135] debuted with a song that quickly shot to number one in the charts.
[time=1141] The words go something like this.
[time=1146] I can't get no satisfaction.
[time=1150] I can't get no satisfaction because I try and I try.
[time=1156] I can't get no, no, no, hey, hey, hey, that's what I say.
[time=1165] They just don't write good lyrics anymore, huh?
[time=1174] We laugh, but that was the refrain of Israel's king Solomon.
[time=1183] The guy had everything and he comes to the end of his life and his refrain is the same.
[time=1194] I can't get no satisfaction.
[time=1198] What happened?
[time=1200] Well, we got to start at the beginning.
[time=1203] We got to look at this book in its proper context because I have many people who come to me and say, "Tiberius, Ecclesiastes is the most favorite book in the Bible for me."
[time=1214] Because of words like this, but I'm here to tell you that unfortunately many times we misunderstand the book.
[time=1222] See, the message of the book is this, apart from a correct relationship with God, everything is meaningless.
[time=1232] That's the message of the book.
[time=1234] Apart from a correct relationship with God, everything is meaningless.
[time=1241] That is not the song to be sang at Black Hawk on Sunday mornings.
[time=1247] That is not the song you want to sing as you drive to work.
[time=1251] That is not the song you want to listen to as you do your homework because that is not for those who belong to Jesus Christ.
[time=1259] How did Solomon get there?
[time=1261] Well, Solomon starts well.
[time=1265] Cohellet is the Hebrew word for what our versions translate as the preacher or the teacher in Ecclesiastes 1 and 1 and 12.
[time=1279] And this morning I'm using the NIV because it's one of the few times I prefer the NIV in translation, but I'll explain why.
[time=1287] It's because of the translation of the word meaningless.
[time=1292] But in the NIV, Ecclesiastes 1 and 1 says this, the words of the teacher or the ESV says the preacher, son of David King in Jerusalem.
[time=1304] To verse 12, I the teacher, NIV, preacher, ESV was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
[time=1313] Now there are some liberal scholars who say Solomon did not write this, but I'm here to argue that the only son of David,
[time=1321] who was king over Israel in Jerusalem, was Solomon.
[time=1327] What happened after Solomon?
[time=1329] God took the kingdom and divided it in to the king in Israel in the north, ruled from Shechem and Samaria, never from Jerusalem.
[time=1339] Jerusalem was for Judah after this.
[time=1342] So we know that this is Solomon who's writing this, the Targum, which is an Aramaic compilation, translation/commentary in Aramaic, compiled from between 500 and 1000.
[time=1361] 500 BC to 1000 AD has this at the beginning of the book.
[time=1367] I quote, "When King Solomon was sitting upon the throne of his kingdom, his heart became very proud of his riches, and he violated the Word of God.
[time=1375] And he married from foreign nations where upon the anger of the Lord was kindled against him.
[time=1380] And he roamed about in the allowing towns and the cities of the land of Israel, weeping and lamenting, and saying, I am cohelit,
[time=1389] whose name was formerly called Solomon, who was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
[time=1396] But Solomon started out well.
[time=1403] Before God appears to him, in 2 Samuel 12, 24 and 25, we're told how he was born.
[time=1411] Then David comforted his wife back.
[time=1413] She went into her and lay with her, and she bore a son and called his name Solomon.
[time=1418] And the Lord loved him and sent a message by an eight in the prophet, so he called his name Jedediah, which means beloved of the Lord because of the Lord.
[time=1433] Imagine God saying, your name shall be beloved of the Lord because I love you.
[time=1438] That's a great name.
[time=1439] Solomon starts out well.
[time=1440] God appears to him not once but twice.
[time=1443] And remember Solomon starts out well, he asks for the right thing, he asks for wisdom.
[time=1450] And the Bible says that God gave him wisdom.
[time=1455] God says, behold, I give you a wise and discerning mind so that none like you has been before you and none like you arise after you.
[time=1463] I give you also what you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that no other king shall compare with you all your days.
[time=1471] And God listens to him, and listen, part of his cv says, and God gives Solomon wisdom and understanding beyond measure and breadth of mind like the sand on the seashore.
[time=1482] He spoke 3,000 proverbs, and his songs were 1,005.
[time=1487] He spoke of trees from the cedar that is in Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of the wall.
[time=1492] He also spoke of beasts and of birds and of reptiles and of fish, and people of all nations came to hear the wisdom of Solomon.
[time=1500] And from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom, he was the first renaissance man.
[time=1510] What happened?
[time=1511] Well, in God's communication with Solomon, there were a few if clauses.
[time=1517] Remember that?
[time=1519] 1 Kings 3, 14, if you will walk in my ways, keeping my statues and my commandments.
[time=1526] 1 Kings 6, 12, if you will walk in my statues and obey my rules and keep my commandments and walk in them.
[time=1532] 1 Kings 9, 4, if you will walk before me.
[time=1536] And the Bible tells us that Solomon consistently and systematically disobeyed God.
[time=1544] 1 Kings 11, 1 through 3 is the peak of his disobedience.
[time=1553] Now, King Solomon loved Mary, 4, and women.
[time=1558] Along with the daughter of Pharaoh, remember that was back in chapter 3, right?
[time=1563] That was the beginning.
[time=1566] Morbite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sedonian, He-type women from the nations concerning which the Lord has said to the people of Israel,
[time=1576] "You shall not enter into marriage with them.
[time=1579] Neither shall they with you, for surely they will turn away your heart after their God." Solomon clung to these in love.
[time=1586] He had 700 wives, princesses, and 300 concubines, and his wives turned away his heart.
[time=1597] 1 Kings 11, 9, and 10, and the Lord was angry with Solomon.
[time=1604] 1 Kings 3, God is pleased with Solomon.
[time=1608] 1 Kings 11, the Lord was angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the Lord,
[time=1615] the God of Israel who had appeared to him twice, and had commanded concerning this thing that he should not go after other gods.
[time=1623] But he did not keep what the Lord commanded.
[time=1629] So Solomon arrives at the end of his life.
[time=1633] He is looking back, and he concludes, meaningless, meaningless.
[time=1640] Everything is meaningless.
[time=1644] I want you to imagine Solomon getting his crown on in the morning and his cowbell.
[time=1653] And he's singing, "I can get no satisfaction."
[time=1660] No, no, no, hey, hey, hey, that's what I say.
[time=1668] I want to thank Darren for loaning me his crown.
[time=1676] Sir, I've got to take this back. Don't let him wear it.
[time=1679] He likes to wear it around the house.
[time=1688] You see, Solomon's perspective is from under the sun.
[time=1695] This is an expression that appears over and over in the book, as I looked and I saw under the sun.
[time=1703] You see, when Solomon is writing this about 3,000 years ago, there were three religious groups in Israel.
[time=1710] There were the priests, the prophets, and the wise men, or the sages.
[time=1715] The priests had to do with things pertaining to the temple and the tabernacle.
[time=1720] The prophets had to do with God's communication to people.
[time=1724] But the sages, the wise men, had to go out and observe things under the sun, and what's under the sun, the earth.
[time=1732] What is going on on the earth? And then he would write about it.
[time=1737] And that's what Solomon does. He observes.
[time=1740] There's a time to kill. He says, "What?" He doesn't say, "You should kill." He says, "As I observe, people kill each other." He's not making moral pronouncements. He's just observing what's going on under the sun.
[time=1755] But as he's concluding his own life, he comes and says, "Everything is meaningless." So I want to draw a couple of timeless principles from all of us, for all of us this morning.
[time=1766] First of all, we want to see that Godless pleasures and work lead to emptiness.
[time=1775] See, there is a void in your life that only God can fill.
[time=1780] And when God doesn't fill that void, you're going to try to fill it with something else.
[time=1786] In Solomon's case, he tried pleasures and he tried work.
[time=1794] That's how he starts in chapter two.
[time=1797] I thought in my heart, "Come, now I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good, but also proved to be meaningless." What is he trying? He's trying laughter, looking in verse two.
[time=1809] I said of laughter, it is mad and of pleasure. What use is it? Don't get me wrong.
[time=1813] I love to watch good, clean comedy.
[time=1817] Like Tim Hawkins, Brian Reagan, right? Jim Gaffigan most of the time.
[time=1822] But if Jesus Christ is now Lord and Savior and you watch that show,
[time=1829] you're going to laugh for five, ten minutes and after that, what's going to happen?
[time=1834] You're going to feel what? Empty.
[time=1837] Because they did not fill the void that only God can fill.
[time=1842] So Solomon says to laughter, it is mad and of pleasure, what use is it?
[time=1849] That doesn't work. How about wine? Look in verse three.
[time=1853] I tried cheering myself with wine and embracing folly.
[time=1856] My mind still guiding me with wisdom.
[time=1859] I wanted to see what was worthwhile for men to do under the Heaven during the few days of their lives.
[time=1864] Have you ever tried to fill your void with wine? Don't answer that question.
[time=1869] I want you to ask all the people who have gone through AA.
[time=1877] I want you to ask all the people who are addicted to drugs, have the drugs that they take filled their void.
[time=1886] And I'm here to tell you no. See, Solomon tried it.
[time=1890] He tried maybe wine will fill my void and it doesn't.
[time=1895] I tried, he said. It didn't work. How about? Okay, I know.
[time=1900] I'm going to work 24/7. I'll become a workaholic.
[time=1905] I will fill, right? No, no, no. Looking verses 4 to 6.
[time=1908] I made great works. I built houses and planted vineyards for myself.
[time=1913] I made myself gardens and parks and planted in them, all kinds of fruit trees.
[time=1917] I made myself pools from which to water the forest of growing trees.
[time=1923] And his conclusion is what? I can get no satisfaction.
[time=1929] No, no, no. Hey, hey, hey. That's what I say.
[time=1937] We laugh, but that's what happens.
[time=1940] Apart from a correct relationship with God, everything will be meaningless.
[time=1946] Because nothing can fill that void, but a correct relationship with God.
[time=1953] Godless pleasures and work will lead to emptiness. Godless relationships lead to bitterness.
[time=1962] Okay, Solomon says, okay, all these didn't fill. I'm going to try sex.
[time=1968] That's going to fulfill. Isn't that what Hallelujah is telling us?
[time=1972] Isn't that what the world is telling us?
[time=1975] Let's do it, and it feels good, and you'll fulfill. And he tries that.
[time=1981] Starting in verse 8.
[time=1984] I am a silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces.
[time=1989] I acquired men and women, singers, and a harem as well, the delights of the heart of men.
[time=1995] What happened? What happened to Solomon? You see, in Proverbs, he says, "He who finds a good wife is a gift from whom?" From the Lord. He says that.
[time=2005] He actually writes it in Proverbs. He who finds a good wife is a gift from the Lord.
[time=2010] And then he gets to the end of his life. It was he asked his seven.
[time=2014] This is what Darren Helen is Valentine's Day card.
[time=2019] I find more bitter than death, the woman.
[time=2024] Is that what you're selling on a Valentine's Day card? I'm sure it didn't work.
[time=2030] Listen to, this is Solomon. I want you to see the difference between he who finds a good woman is a good wife is a gift from the Lord.
[time=2038] To at the end of his life, he says in Ecclesiastes 7, 25, 26.
[time=2043] I find more bitter than death, the woman who is a snare, whose heart is a trap,
[time=2049] and whose hands are chains.
[time=2052] The man who displeases God will escape her, but the sinner, she will ensnare.
[time=2058] What happened? What happened?
[time=2061] Is Solomon systematically disobeyed God? That's what happens.
[time=2066] Because apart from a correct relationship with God, everything will be meaningless.
[time=2071] Relationships will lead to bitterness. That's what he says, I find more bitter than death is the woman.
[time=2077] Is that true? No, that's not true.
[time=2080] It was true for him. He tried a thousand of them and did not fulfill him.
[time=2089] Let me ask you, are you in a Godless relationship?
[time=2096] Are you in a Godless relationship? If you are, get out.
[time=2103] If not, it will just lead to bitterness.
[time=2106] I'm not talking to married people. If you are married, they are in the right relationship.
[time=2110] I'm talking if you are not married.
[time=2112] But if you are in a Godless relationship, nothing good can come out of it.
[time=2117] Just learn from Solomon.
[time=2119] Learn from his mistakes. Learn from his mistakes.
[time=2124] Not only will these relationships not fulfill you, but they will leave you bitter.
[time=2130] You see what Solomon was trying to do is to build for himself a secular garden of Eden.
[time=2137] You remember the garden of Eden, right?
[time=2139] Adam and Eve in a perfect communion, perfect relationship, but there was one difference.
[time=2144] In the garden of Eden, there were two trees, one of which was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[time=2150] And God says, you shall not eat of it.
[time=2155] What Solomon tries to do is to build for himself a secular garden of Eden with no forbidden trees.
[time=2164] That's what he's doing, and that's what he says, looking verse 10.
[time=2168] Whatever my eyes desire, I did not keep from them.
[time=2171] I kept my heart from no pleasure, for my heart found pleasure, no my toil, and this was the reward for all my toil.
[time=2180] Ernest Hemingway, the great American playwright, had a role.
[time=2188] He had a role.
[time=2190] He went to bullfights in Spain.
[time=2194] He slipped champagne in France.
[time=2197] He went bear hunting in Alaska and went fishing in the Florida Keys.
[time=2203] He had a role, right?
[time=2208] But in 1961, he wrote a little note that simply read, "Life is just one thing after another."
[time=2218] Then pulled both triggers of a double-barrel gun and emptied it into his head.
[time=2226] Why?
[time=2228] Because he did not find satisfaction.
[time=2231] Because apart from a correct relationship with God, everything is meaningless.
[time=2237] It doesn't matter where you fish.
[time=2242] It doesn't matter where you play golf.
[time=2245] It doesn't matter what your country club says.
[time=2248] Apart from a correct relationship with God, none of those things will satisfy.
[time=2254] Learn from Solomon.
[time=2257] Learn from his mistakes.
[time=2259] Not only Godless pleasures and work to emptiness and Godless relationship to bitterness, Godless
[time=2266] knowledge leads to hatred of life.
[time=2268] Well, maybe if I get enough degrees, I'm going to go to college.
[time=2272] I'm going to get all these degrees.
[time=2274] That will do, right?
[time=2275] Wrong.
[time=2276] Godless knowledge leads to hatred of life.
[time=2281] What he says in chapter 2, starting in verse 12, "I turn to consider wisdom and madness."
[time=2288] Then I saw that there is more gain in wisdom than in folly, as there is more gain in light
[time=2294] than in darkness, verses 15-17.
[time=2296] Then I thought in my heart the fate of the fool will overtake me also.
[time=2300] What then do I gain by being wise?
[time=2303] I said in my heart, "This too is meaningless.
[time=2305] For the wise man like the fool will not be long remembered.
[time=2308] In days to come, both will be forgotten.
[time=2310] Like the fool the wise must too die." Must die.
[time=2315] So I hated life.
[time=2320] Think about that.
[time=2321] That's from the guy who had everything, who had everything except one thing, a correct
[time=2327] relationship with God.
[time=2331] Apart from a correct relationship with God, he says, "I hated life because the work that
[time=2337] is done under the sun was grievous to me.
[time=2339] All of it is meaningless at chasing after the wind." Bill Shakespeare in Macbeth writes about how Macbeth remember King of Scotland.
[time=2357] Remember how he got there?
[time=2359] Through treacherous means.
[time=2361] But he got to be the king.
[time=2365] And he looks back and he gained the kingdom and he fooled everybody and he deceived everybody
[time=2373] and gets to his end.
[time=2375] And will he say everything is meaningful?
[time=2378] No, this is what Macbeth said.
[time=2380] And I quote, "Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace.
[time=2386] From day to day to the last syllable of recorded time.
[time=2390] And all of our yesterday's have lighted fools the way to dusty death.
[time=2394] Out, out brief candle.
[time=2397] Life is but a walking shadow.
[time=2399] A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon stage and then is heard no more.
[time=2405] It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.
[time=2414] You can get a whole kingdom and it's still meaningless because it's apart from a correct
[time=2421] relationship with God." So, as we go home, can we go home and all get together around the table and seeing everything
[time=2431] is meaningless?
[time=2433] No, no, no, no.
[time=2436] You can see that if you choose to live apart from God, you can see that all day long.
[time=2440] You can put the Rolling Stones to sing along with you.
[time=2442] I can get no satisfaction.
[time=2445] But our perspectives, my dear brothers and sisters, our perspective is not to be under the Son, S-U-N.
[time=2452] Our perspective needs to be from under the S-O and after, under Jesus Christ.
[time=2457] He is the one who gives us meaning.
[time=2459] You see, Jesus Christ died to redeem us from the meaninglessness, solemn and experienced.
[time=2468] Our perspective is from under the Son.
[time=2470] What does he say about relationships?
[time=2472] Well, he says he tells us to have a godly attitude towards relationships.
[time=2476] And Jesus came to save us from the meaninglessness of godless relationships when he says, "For
[time=2483] this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and the two will become one flesh." That is God's design, not solemn and a thousand women, but a man and a woman in covenant
[time=2496] union of marriage.
[time=2500] That is God's design.
[time=2503] If you are a child here, you also need a godly relationship.
[time=2508] Children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right.
[time=2511] That is godly relationship.
[time=2513] That's what you need to have.
[time=2515] If you don't have that, then you can sing, meaningless, meaningless.
[time=2522] A godly attitude towards relationships.
[time=2524] A godly attitude towards work.
[time=2528] I saw that you guys are starting Awana.
[time=2530] I love Awana.
[time=2532] Both of my kids went through Awana and I encourage you if you have children of Awana age, please,
[time=2539] please, please, get them into this program.
[time=2542] I remember as I was going with my children when they were doing Awana that one of the verses that we had, the head to memorize them in the process I memorized as well is this one.
[time=2553] That tells us what it means to have a godly attitude towards work.
[time=2557] Whatever you do, work at it to tell your heart is working for the Lord, not for men.
[time=2562] A lot of us sing.
[time=2565] Take this job and you know, right?
[time=2571] It's a country music song.
[time=2573] Take this job and shove it.
[time=2576] How about if we change our view and take this job and love it?
[time=2581] How about if you go next tomorrow to work and you change your attitude towards your job and love it, not shove it, how will that change?
[time=2591] Well students, you start school, huh?
[time=2595] How about if you take that class and you love it?
[time=2600] And not just do what the teacher is asking you, but go above and beyond what the teacher is asking you.
[time=2605] Go and say, "Hey, can I do some extra credit?
[time=2607] What more can I do?" Christians should be the best workers out there and Christians should be the best students out there because they do it for the Lord, not for men.
[time=2620] That's a godly attitude towards work.
[time=2625] And then a godly attitude towards knowledge.
[time=2629] Not I hated my life, no.
[time=2632] Jesus says to all of us, "This is eternal life.
[time=2635] That they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent."
[time=2642] You see, if you don't know Jesus Christ and if you don't have a correct relationship with God, everything you do will be meaningless.
[time=2651] It doesn't matter what your friends say.
[time=2653] It doesn't matter what your boss says, it matters what God says.
[time=2661] After winning three Super Bowl rings, Tom Brady said, "Why do I have three Super Bowl rings
[time=2670] and still think there's something greater out there for me?" I mean, maybe a lot of people would say, "Hey man, this is what is."
[time=2681] And he said, "I mean, this isn't.
[time=2684] This can't be what it's all cracked up to be." When the interviewer asked him, "So what's the answer?" Tom Brady could only say, "I wish I knew, I wish I knew."
[time=2702] My dear brothers and sisters, we are called to tell the last world of Solomon's,
[time=2711] the last world of Hemingway's, and the last world of Tom Brady's that Jesus can satisfy.
[time=2720] That he's the only one who can fill that void.
[time=2723] And he will turn everything like real relationships.
[time=2726] Your work, your knowledge, everything will change.
[time=2730] And everything changes when you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior.
[time=2734] You see, when Jesus came, he said, "I came, that they may have life and have it.
[time=2739] How? Abundantly." That means meaning full, that's what that means.
[time=2748] I'm only 46 years old, but if I were to die tomorrow, I can tell you I lived a full and meaningful life.
[time=2758] Not because of me, but because of Jesus Christ who died for me.
[time=2765] When you get to the end of your life, what's the refrain of your life going to be?
[time=2771] Are you going to still sing, "I can't get no satisfaction," or are you going to take your crown
[time=2779] and lay it to the feet of Jesus and say, "I surrender all."
[time=2785] Even the cowbell.
[time=2788] We need more cowbell.
[time=2793] Everything that you have, you've got to put it to the feet of Jesus.
[time=2800] And that will give meaning to your life.
[time=2806] You will not have the riches Solomon had, maybe, I don't know.
[time=2816] But you will find meaning and fulfillment in satisfaction.
[time=2821] Kari Livgren, how many of you who Kari Livgren is? Anybody?
[time=2830] Anybody want to admit they know who Kari Livgren is?
[time=2834] Oh, wow, some of you do.
[time=2838] Kari Livgren was one of the founders and primary songwriters for the Progressive Rock Band, Kansas.
[time=2845] Now it's coming back to you.
[time=2848] I know it's coming back to you because he wrote a song in 1977 that took words from Ecclesiastes.
[time=2855] And he wrote these lyrics, "I close my eyes only for a moment and the moment's gone.
[time=2860] All my dreams pass before my eyes are curiosity, dust in the wind.
[time=2866] All they are is dust in the wind." Same old song, just a drop of water in an endless sea.
[time=2874] So we do crumbles to the ground, though we refuse to see, dust in the wind.
[time=2879] All we are is dust in the wind.
[time=2881] Now don't hang on nothing lasts forever, but the earth and sky.
[time=2885] It slips away, and all your money won't another minute buy.
[time=2890] Dust in the wind.
[time=2892] All we are is dust in the wind.
[time=2896] But Kari Livgren became a believer in Jesus Christ.
[time=2902] He turned his life around, he surrendered his life to Jesus Christ, and now Kari Livgren doesn't sing that song anymore.
[time=2909] He actually writes other songs, one of which says this.
[time=2914] "The rising of the sun is seen by everyone, and no one can deny that it's real.
[time=2919] And when you can hear the cold come crashing through the wall, you just can't doubt the feelings that you feel.
[time=2926] And give up everything to live for the King.
[time=2929] His life has meaning now, because he lives for the king."
[time=2936] What are you going to sing today as you live here?
[time=2941] Are you going to sing? I live for the king.
[time=2944] What are you going to sing? I can get no satisfaction.
[time=2950] Growing up in Romania, you know, I grew up in communist Romania, and people would smuggle all kinds of things.
[time=2956] They'd smuggle Bibles, they'd smuggle Bill Gates or music.
[time=2964] Elvis, music, thankfully I never heard of the Rolling Stones.
[time=2971] But one song, and I'm going to get the guys to come up, as they get ready to sing, this is a song that I knew growing up.
[time=2980] And they came to mind when I thought about Solomon.
[time=2985] So long I have searched for life's meaning.
[time=2990] And you know how they found it? It's a Bill Gates or song.
[time=2996] He found meaning only in the relationship with Jesus Christ, when Jesus Christ came in and freed the person from their sin.
[time=3006] So I asked the guys to sing that there's no cowbell.
[time=3012] Is that okay? No cowbell? I want you to think about these words.
[time=3017] And if Jesus Christ is not your Lord and Savior, surrender your life today.
[time=3021] He can free you from the burden of sin and the meaninglessness,
[time=3027] Solomon experienced.
[time=3032] At the end, there will be people here who would pray with you if you want, here or in the foyer. But don't leave here without Jesus Christ being your Lord and Savior.
[time=3065] So long I had searched for life's meaning.
[time=3076] And slaved by this world and my greed.
[time=3087] Then the door of my prison was opened by love.
[time=3099] For the ransom was paid.
[time=3104] I was free.
[time=3110] I'm free from the fear of tomorrow.
[time=3121] I'm free from the guilt of the past.
[time=3132] For I've trained my shackles for a glorious song.
[time=3143] I'm free, praise the Lord.
[time=3149] Free at last.
[time=3157] Oh, I'm free from the guilt that I've carried.
[time=3171] From this tall empty life I've been set free.
[time=3182] For when I met Jesus He made me complete.
[time=3192] He forgot the foolish man I used to be.
[time=3202] I'm free from the fear of tomorrow.
[time=3213] I'm free from the guilt of the past.
[time=3224] For I've trained my shackles for a glorious song.
[time=3235] I'm free, praise the Lord.
[time=3239] Free at last.
[time=3260] Good morning and thank you for watching the Bible Hour.
[time=3265] If someone were to ask you, do you feel meaningful or meaningless?
[time=3271] How would you answer?
[time=3274] Solomon at the end of his life concludes with the unfortunate word meaningless.
[time=3281] Everything is meaningless.
[time=3283] How can you say that after God appeared to you twice?
[time=3287] After God gives you wisdom more than anybody in the world.
[time=3292] How can you say meaningless?
[time=3294] Well, the answer is easy.
[time=3296] Solomon chose to systematically disobey God.
[time=3301] He married Pharaoh's daughter.
[time=3303] Then he married four in women.
[time=3306] And he went against God's law.
[time=3310] When he comes to the end of his life, he concludes everything is meaningless.
[time=3315] But is that really what the Bible teaches?
[time=3318] The answer is no.
[time=3320] The truth is that Solomon is correct in one sense.
[time=3324] Apart from a correct relationship with God, everything is meaningless.
[time=3329] But if Jesus Christ is your Lord and Savior, then your life is meaningful.
[time=3334] Jesus said to Solomon and he says to all the Solomon's of the world, "I came that my children have life and they might have it abundantly."
[time=3345] If Jesus Christ is your Lord and Savior, the refrain of your life cannot be meaningless.
[time=3352] Everything is meaningless.
[time=3354] But the refrain of our lives should be meaningful.
[time=3357] And to say that we are satisfied because of what Jesus Christ has done for us.
[time=3364] If Jesus Christ is not your Lord and Savior, maybe today is the day of salvation, surrender your life to Him and you will go from meaningless to meaningful.
[time=3377] [MUSIC]
[time=3407] To rescue the souls of man.
[time=3412] [MUSIC]
[time=3415] Counselor, comforter, keeper, spirit we long to embrace.
[time=3427] You offer hope when our hearts hopelessly lost our way.
[time=3437] Oh, we hopelessly lost our way.
[time=3444] You are the one that we praise.
[time=3450] You are the one we adore.
[time=3456] You live the healing and praise our hearts always hunger for.
[time=3466] Oh, our hearts always hunger for.
[time=3473] [MUSIC]
[time=3476] Oh, my infinite father faithfully love me your own.
[time=3487] Here in our weakness you find us falling before your throne.
[time=3498] Oh, we're falling before your throne.
[time=3505] You are the one that we praise.
[time=3510] You are the one we adore.
[time=3516] You give the healing and praise our hearts always hunger for.
[time=3526] Oh, our hearts always hunger for.
[time=3533] You are the one that we praise.
[time=3538] You are the one we adore.
[time=3544] You give the healing and praise our hearts always hunger for.
[time=3554] Oh, our hearts always hunger for.
