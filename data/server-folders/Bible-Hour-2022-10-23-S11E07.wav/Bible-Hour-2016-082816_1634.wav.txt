[time=830] Amen!
[time=834] So Christ Himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers to equip His people for the works of service so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ Then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth by the waves and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming Instead, speaking the truth in love we will grow to become in every respect mature body of Him who is the head that is Christ From Him, the whole body joined and held together by every supporting ligament grows and builds itself up in love as each part does its work Today is an exciting day at Black Hawk Amen! Amen!
[time=911] We have the privilege of sharing today with Pastor Kevin Rivers and his lovely family The PDT has unanimously recommended Pastor Rivers The governing elders have enthusiastically recommended Pastor Rivers and our staff, we hardly embrace that recommendation Our staff is excited for Kevin's unbridled passion for Jesus Christ We are excited for his unwavering commitment to Scripture We are excited that he proclaims Jesus and strives to make everyone complete in Christ We are excited for his dedication to his family We are excited for his commitment to leading well in all aspects of ministry We are excited for his deep desire to love and shepherd God's people here at Black Hawk We are excited that he is here today and ready to bring God's Word Brothers and sisters, it is my privilege to introduce Pastor Kevin Rivers
[time=970] [APPLAUSE]
[time=989] Is anybody excited today just to know that Jesus is alive?
[time=993] [APPLAUSE]
[time=994] It's worth getting excited about I love being a part of the body of Christ that is excited And we have no reason to not be excited when it comes to being the church And that's what I want to talk about today I want to talk about our journey of being the church And before I do that though, I know today is a little bit of a different day There's a vote coming up after the service and everyone's anticipating all of those things So I wanted to take a moment before we dive into Ephesians 4 and just address Some of the emotions, some of the questions, some of the thoughts that we all have Regarding that, today I want to ask you to do something a little different than maybe you anticipated When you think about the vote that's coming up, I want to ask you not to vote on me
[time=1037] I know that sounds a little weird, not to vote on me My personality or my preaching style, but to vote instead on God's vision for his church
[time=1047] As he has stirred it and revealed it in my heart as a pastor You know, a lot of times we may just share one of our best sermons in these kind of moments But I wanted to share a sermon with you today that shows you what my heart is when it comes to pastoring And leading God's church, something I do not take lightly I want to preach a message from Ephesians 4 that gives you a glimpse of God's vision for his church
[time=1070] And today when we vote, we can vote on how God aligns our hearts with that vision How does that sound? Everybody with me?
[time=1077] I'm an interactive guest, you've got to talk with me on that today If you think you need to know about me I'm going to just talk about myself, I'm going to talk about our journey And then we'll go into Ephesians 4 because God's Word always has the final say, amen?
[time=1091] What you should know about me is, yes, I am a pastor, but I'm also human And I give out grace very freely, but I also require a lot of grace as well I have a commitment to loving God and loving people unconditionally Where his grace is always first, because he has so much grace for me So I ask for that same grace, my pastoral anthem, I like to call it, comes from 1 Thessalonians 2 verses 6-13
[time=1116] We're not going to read any of that, but I want you to know a little glimpse of my heart from there Paul talks about how he has been a pastor, a shepherd, a leader in God's church
[time=1126] And how he loved the church, he loved those people he was addressing As a father who urges and encourages and pushes his children forward in life But also as a mother who loves and nurtures and cares for her children He talks in there about how he loved them enough to share not just the gospel but his life
[time=1148] That's my heartbeat and passion is to, yes, to share the gospel but to share with you my life as a pastor
[time=1155] It's who I am, it's what God has called me to do, it's what I want to be with all of my life Let me ask you a few things, tell you a few things that I would ask from you I would ask you to verse 13 of 1 Thessalonians chapter 2, Paul commends the people he's addressing
[time=1171] Therefore embracing his words not as words for men but as words from God My commitment is to preach God's word, its whole counsel and let it have the final say But as that happens, I ask that it be embraced as his words and not my own And to respond to those words, I would ask you to love my family, to love my wife and my kids
[time=1193] I'll earn that love and that respect for sure in the days ahead as God continues to lead But I want to ask you to unconditionally love my wife and kids They're my first ministry And I put great priority on them and they've made big steps and sacrifices to even be in this moment with me today
[time=1213] And they're excited to see what God has for them, so I ask you to love them unconditionally
[time=1219] As we look at the future together, I ask you to allow God just to open your heart to the new things that he wants to do
[time=1225] And hear me today, I don't know where you are, I know some of you, I just met most of us We haven't even met yet, but I know God wants to do something new in your life Isaiah 43 verses 18 and 19 have characterized this journey for Jessica and myself
[time=1240] And it says, God says, "Behold, I'm going to do something new" He says, "Don't get caught up in the past, behold, I'm going to do something new, will you not perceive it?" That word "perceive" doesn't mean will you not just see it, it means will you not embrace it on it
[time=1254] Let it penetrate your heart, God wants to do something new in your life today God wants to do something new in the life of Black Hawk Ministries today Will you open yourself up to receive it?
[time=1267] That requires change though, change, how many of you like change?
[time=1272] Those of you who raised your hand, you did so reluctantly I've often heard it said, "The only person that likes change is a wet baby and they even scream while you do it"
[time=1281] And it's true, but to grow into the body, to grow into the believer, to grow into the disciple that God has called us
[time=1290] To be, it requires us to be willing to change, so I ask for that openness as well Have you changed as exchange? Change is an exchange that we make as a body of believers
[time=1300] Where we trade in some things that are comfortable and normal to us for the better things that are more effective for the mission of the church
[time=1308] So that's a little about me, a little about what I would ask from you Since I know the nature of today, but the best way we can dig into that is to look at Scripture It's to look at what God envisions for His church Because being the church is quite a journey, it's not something that we do in a day's time It's something that we have to live out and walk out every single day So who's with me, who wants to look at Ephesians 4 and see what God has to say about it?
[time=1333] Let's look at Ephesians 4, and before we look there, I want to ask you a question It's just a real question, and I'm an interactive kind of guy, so you have to talk to me a little bit as we go through this Do you ever struggle with the gap that seems to exist at times between what you know God intends for His church
[time=1349] and what you experience as a part of His church?
[time=1352] Never been there, hmm, I know I've been there so many times So what's the answer to that struggle?
[time=1359] How do we answer that struggle?
[time=1361] And I would tell you, the answer to that struggle lies within you and me being the church
[time=1368] Look at your neighbor and say, "I think He just told me I'm the problem" You're right, I did, but I also am going to tell you that you're also the answer
[time=1378] You are called to be the church Who is the church?
[time=1385] Is the church these walls of black hulk ministries? No You are the church I am the church, say that with me I am the church And we learn to be the church We'll start to see that gap start to close, won't we?
[time=1401] We'll start to see the church looking like God intended for it to look like So let me give you the bottom line, I always try to give a bottom line This is really what today is all about The bottom line today, if you're taking any notes, is simply put Being the church is a journey worth taking Does anybody believe that?
[time=1418] You do because you're here You're here to learn about that journey, but it is a journey It's not something that we enter into lightly, it's not something that we accomplish easily But being the church is a journey, it's a struggle It's a daily battle that is worth taking For some of you, you may be here and you may say I don't even know if I want to be a part of the church I just came to see what this whole thing is all about I want to talk to you as well because I want to tell you the same thing Being a part of the church of Jesus is a journey that's worth taking It's a risk, it's a leap, it's a leap of faith That I want to challenge you to consider today and God's going to stir in your heart I do believe as we look at His Word together Today Jesus said it this way I love just going back to the words of Jesus He said I will build my church And the gates of hell will not prevail against it I like being a part of a winning team Anybody else like winning?
[time=1474] Well guess what, I've read the end of the book and we win Jesus is going to win and He said I will build my church A couple of things about that, first of all, it's not your church It's not my church, it's His church We get to be a part of His church, my friends The church of Jesus, the one who offers us the grace that we do not deserve Or we cannot attain on our own It's His church, He said I'll build it and the gates of hell won't prevail against it So if it's His church, what does He intend for His church?
[time=1506] That's what I want us to look at What does God envision for His church today?
[time=1509] I want to give us four things from Ephesians 4, 11 through 16 That you just heard read to you, Ephesians 4, 11 through 16 Paul is writing about just that, God's vision for His church And in the first verse, verse 11, you see that it's a team kind of a thing It's a team kind of a thing, you list out all the different roles within that Let's look again, starting in verse 11, the first thing That I believe God envisions for His church is that it's a releasing church Verses 11 through 13 God envisions for His church to be a releasing church Verses 11 through 13 says it was He who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets Some to be evangelists, some to be pastors and teachers To prepare God's people for the works of service So that the body may be built up Until we reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God And become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ
[time=1564] And I know that's a big part of Black Hawk's vision and mission is to reach To help people walk into that fullness that we find in Jesus You ever feel empty? Jesus wants to fill you up in this place today But it takes us being, and so when I talk about a releasing church I'm talking personally as well To be a releasing church, that means I've got to be a releasing person So what is it maybe that you need to release today? Let go of today It can mean a lot of things for you, but as we look at this, a few things A releasing church is one that equips the team It's one that equips the team, there's a team Church is a team sport, it's the way I would say it It takes all of us working together It doesn't take just one person doing all the work It takes all of us working together As a body does, the ligaments, the tendons all work together To make a body function well, that's the way the church was built The way it was intended How many of you have ever seen a starfish when you've gone on the beach before?
[time=1618] Yeah, I love a starfish Because as you do some reading about starfish You're going to find that a starfish, even if it's beaten and battered and bruised And cut, and even if it's sliced, many starfish, if it's sliced in two It will regenerate and become two starfish and then three starfish Some of you have seen that, I think that's a beautiful picture of what the church is supposed to look like Even when we, as a part of the body of Christ, get beaten and battered and bruised And we get sliced and cut up, you ever met any of those people?
[time=1648] You can say yes, it's alright They do go to church, the church is filled with people, last I checked It happens, we get hurt because people, I'll tell you, I'll hurt you I won't do everything perfectly because I'm human, that's why I require grace You require grace, but when that happens we get beat and battered and bruised And we get sliced into pieces, but what I love about the church is I believe we're called to be starfish disciples, that even when that slicing happens We just regenerate and multiply, and when I look at the church That Jesus is building and the church that Jesus has built Look at how many people throughout history have tried to do away with scripture Have tried to do away with the church But now look around, look at the full building in this place No one and nothing can tear down the work that Jesus is doing Because it continues to multiply And it's going to continue to multiply Releasing churches, you can jot this down if you're taking notes Well, releasing churches are always valuing sending capacity over seating capacity
[time=1711] I love that this place is full of seating capacity and you're sitting here and you're part of that today But what good is it if we just sit here and rose and don't do something Sending wise with what we're learning If it doesn't penetrate our hearts and enter into our lives, then what good is it going to do any of us?
[time=1728] We've got to be about sending capacity over seating capacity We've got to be about black talk, you send out a huge believer in equipping God's people to make disciples
[time=1738] Because that's what Jesus did and that's what He commissioned us to do Another thing about releasing churches, it becomes unified Because when you think about life and people as something that's not just all about me Then you start to realize that you know what, I can be unified in areas I didn't think I could be unified I love black talk's website One of the ways that you guys say this is that black talk ministries we long to see God establish a diverse community of disciples
[time=1762] I love that phrase Jesus imitators, I love that one too Jesus imitators who's ethnic, financial and personal differences disappear in our genuine love for God each other and our neighbor
[time=1775] Let me tell you why I love that statement I love that statement because I think the church should look a lot like Heaven's going to look
[time=1783] And Heaven's not going to look like what church often looks like where it's the most segregated place on the planet on Sunday mornings
[time=1790] I love looking around and seeing skin colors that are different Backgrounds that are different, income levels that are different Backgrounds that hurt backgrounds that are in a good place I love seeing diversity in God's church because let me tell you if you don't like diversity you all like Heaven
[time=1805] And unity comes from that kind of diversity No matter where you are in your life, let me speak directly into your heart for a moment I want you to know that God values a releasing church A releasing church that brings about unity Jesus had so much to say about unity John 17 is one of my favorite passages in all of scripture Maybe we can look at it together one day because there's so much there But one of his main most dominant prayers His father just as we are one helped them to be one
[time=1840] How's the world going to know that we're his disciples?
[time=1843] The book of John says, "Buy our what for each other?" I love for one another By our unity with one another, how we love in spite of differences That's what a releasing kind of church brings about A releasing church is also mature and complete First Peter 1-3 says, "His divine power" I'm glad it doesn't say Kevin's divine power because I have none His divine power has granted and given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness
[time=1875] You have that inside of you if you know Jesus today You got up this morning and perhaps you did not feel that way But you have that power living on the inside of you right now in this moment Like it or not, tap into it or not, it's there It's mature and complete Have you ever met an immature Christian?
[time=1894] Look at your neighbor and say, "He's not talking about you" I've met a few, probably been one, a time or two, or three, or twelve It happens, doesn't it?
[time=1906] But when we're in Christ and we're a part of a releasing church We learn what it means to be mature and complete in Him One of my favorite stories in seminary came From a guy named Dr. Stan Wilkins I was an undergraduate seminary with New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary And Dr. Wilkins was one of my first professors And Jessica went to seminary and did some core classes with me there We were in college and just getting started Just been called to preach and in ministry And I took this course on basically pastoral care How to care in times of crisis And man, I didn't know what I was getting into Because there's this, and you've got to understand about me I always said the one thing I'll never be is a pastor like my dad By the way, don't do that, never, don't tell God those kind of things So I ended up in seminary and I'll share some more about my story Maybe even toward the end and in the days ahead But I was the shy kid who never wanted to speak in public I wasn't supposed to speak in public The aptitude test in high school told me not to speak in public The list of things not to do, that was what I was not supposed to do But here I was in this class because God had sent me there And I was a youth pastor so I'm thinking, alright, well my crisis moment that I'm going to present on Because we had to present, here I was, I was shaking and nervous And I decided, hey, I can present on team suicide What was I thinking again, right?
[time=1989] And I got up and I remember that day, I was so nervous And my knees were shaking and I butchered that presentation It was terrible, terrible And not a humble kind of terrible, it really was terrible And I still remember getting out of that class as soon as he said, alright guys, you're dismissed And it was one of these things Get out of there as quick as possible But I remember a big 6'5" Stan Wilkins coming after me Hey, hey, he clapped, hold on Kevin, let me tell you something, come here son And he just looked at me and he said, today was kind of a tough day for you, huh?
[time=2024] So he even thought it was terrible (Laughter) But then he looked at me and he grabbed my shoulders, big, booming pastoral voice I still remember it He grabbed my shoulders and he looked at me in my eyes and said, son, God's got his hand on your life
[time=2041] Don't let anybody or any experience tell you different You're the complete package You're the complete package And I'll never forget that moment because I wasn't just walking to get out of that class I was going to find a way to get out of seminary Again, it just wasn't going to work in my head But I'll never forget Dr. Stan Wilkins grabbing me in that one simple phrase Being complete in Christ and telling me how complete of a package I was It walked with me, Dr. Wilkins actually passed away on November 29th of 2006
[time=2079] He was only 53 and he passed away by falling off of a 6' step ladder At his home, cleaning out his gutters Never got to have another class with him But I remember him And his legacy lasts in me It's going to be a part of my life forever because he looked me in the eye and said, you're the complete package
[time=2098] Let me have everybody's eyes for just a minute I don't know what you've been told, some of you may have been told all of your life that you won't amount to anything I want you to know that Jesus looks at you and says, you are the complete package
[time=2114] And we can attain that maturity and fullness in Jesus When we become the releasing church that he intends Let's talk about the second thing Not just a releasing church, but also a reaching church A reaching church Jesus said, I came to seek and to save that which was Lost, we've got to be about more than just me I've been a part of the church so many times where I've just wanted to know what the church could offer me And I want you to know the church blesses you When you are the church, you're blessed You're blessed, like when you go on a mission trip you're supposed to go to be a blessing But you come back more blessed Than you are a blessing to those you're supposed to bless Anybody with me, you know what I'm talking about That's what being the church is all about when we make it about reaching A reaching church, first of all, verse 14 is stable It talks about we won't be infants anymore Tossed back and forth by the waves and blown Here and there by every wind and teaching By the cunning and craftiness of men and they're deceitful scheming Instead speaking the truth in love verses 14 and 15 Tossed about speaking the truth in love We went all things grow up into him Who is the head that is Christ You feel like the world is unstable around you sometimes when you look around Well let me give you a great scripture verse to hang on your mirror Your dash, whatever you want to do Hebrews 13 8 tells us that Jesus Christ is the same Yesterday, today and forever But when we're a reaching church who has the same mindset that Jesus had We'll become about the lost, we'll become about those that are not ourselves And we'll reach out in ways that will offer stability to people who live in an unstable world And that's when the church starts to look like what God intended The church, I believe the church should be one of the most attractive things in the world I know it repels people and it should because the gospel is offensive in so many ways But when people see the church being the church, it becomes attractive People want some of that because there's something different There's something that reaches out when everybody else is looking inward God wants to do that in your life, He wants to use you as that reaching church Jesus is the ultimate example of that I've always said I love how Jesus was always comfortable around sinners You ever noticed that?
[time=2254] He always got in trouble for being around sinners at the wrong times, right?
[time=2258] But He did it on purpose, He was comfortable being around sinners But that's not the most interesting thing to me about how Jesus reached out The most interesting thing to me is not just how Jesus was comfortable around sinners Those sinners were always comfortable around Jesus They flocked to Him Why?
[time=2275] Because He was an open hands, open arms, a reaching church example for us
[time=2281] A reaching church is stable, it's also one that distinguishes between Write this down if you're taking notes, this is something I think that can help you Get a better picture of what God intends for His church to look like A reaching church is also one that distinguishes between theology and ministry
[time=2297] A church that distinguishes between theology and ministry Jesus showed us what it's like to hold to the never changing truths of theology The gospel, He was the gospel, He is the gospel So certainly we can trust that He showed us what it's like to hold to the never changing truths of theology while still liberating us to meet the ever changing needs of ministry Theology does not change The doctrine of the gospel of Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever And my friends, it's timeless and it applies today just as much as it did then But Jesus showed us what it's like to liberate ministry because the world around us is changing
[time=2337] And it has so many needs But when we live out the unchanging, never changing truths of theology, of scripture, of the gospel
[time=2345] Then it meets all of the ever changing needs of ministry around us in the world Jesus, when He went from town to town, one town He would heal The next town He would flip tables The next town He would tell stories, the next town He would just listen, the next town He would just eat dinner with people The next town He would have His feet wash Why?
[time=2363] Because there are ever changing needs of ministry all around us But He was the truth of the gospel and we would distinguish between those things Not equating them, I've been a part of churches at times, I've been the church at times Where I equate the two things where to meet the ever changing needs around me It means I have to sacrifice the truth and the gospel No, if you hold to the truth of the gospel, we meet the needs of the world around us And Jesus showed us what that looks like Verse 15, I would just say, a reaching church does what Jesus did We often say at the church where I'm at now That we love talking about what Jesus said without actually doing what Jesus did
[time=2403] And I'm guilty of that It's easy to get up here and preach a sermon and to nod and say, amen But then when it comes to going and doing the stuff that Jesus did, it's a little bit more challenging Can I get a name in?
[time=2415] But that's what a reaching church looks like Number three, verse 16, a relational church A releasing church, a reaching church, but also a relational church Jesus was all about relationships Verse 16 says from him, "The whole body joined and held together by every supporting ligament
[time=2435] Grows and builds itself up in love as each part does its work."
[time=2441] Now notice that word work, underline that in your Bibles, if you do that, I mark mine up I love having notes in the Bible just to remind me of things There's the word work at the end of verse 16, but there's also the word works at the end of verse 12 Works of service, those are two different words, and we're going to look at them in just a moment But just jot that down in your memory for a moment Because there's a big difference in those two words, I want us to see them Look at your neighbor when it comes to this relational church Look at your neighbor and tell them, say, you need me, like it or not Go ahead, like it or not, you need me We need each other Some of us need more help than others at times That's not really true though, is it?
[time=2482] Wait for the next season and you'll need them just as much as they needed you now We need each other, a relational church grows It grows because it's built up in love I like to call it one anothering A relational church, one anothers each other I love the one anothers, love one another Bear one another's burden, speak the truth in love How do we speak the truth in love?
[time=2506] Well it goes back to the reaching part We speak the truth in love when we distinguish between theology and ministry And the ways we talk about, but we do so through the lens of relationships like Jesus did Everywhere Jesus went he built relationships I want to be a relational person, a relational pastor, a relational leader Because Jesus was relational His church is relational because he was relational He always had time to slow down and talk to people on his way, didn't he?
[time=2534] And you think you're busy, try being the son of God on earth There goes that excuse for us, right?
[time=2541] He was busy but he always stopped And that diversity that we've talked about happens when we become relational too That unity that we've talked about happens then Jessica and I led a life group in our home a few years ago And we had in our mind what the life group was supposed to look like And it was going to be relational and all, but it was, you know, younger couples or whatever We had some parameters that we thought we had set But I want to tell you, that group became the most diverse group of people I've ever been a part of in my entire life We had a 74 year old couple We had different races that came in and out We had as young singles, as young as 22 or 3 And everything in between married couples, singles, college, whatever you name it They came to our house and I thought to myself, this is never going to work But I want to tell you, it became the best small group experience I've ever been a part of Because only the gospel, hear me, only the gospel of Jesus Can take that which feels so different and divisive And the different burdens of our lives that are so different And bring it all together for one single purpose Only the gospel does that And I saw that through a relational church Being relational with one another I value relationships because Jesus valued relationships And the last thing I want to tell you about this Ephesians 4 mentality What has God envisioned about his church is that it's a refreshing church Everybody say a refreshing church Who's hearing could use a little refreshment today?
[time=2634] Maybe you're like me and you've been burned in the church before I can remember one of my first opportunities to do ministry, it hurt I saw what the lack of unity can look like I'm guessing some of you are here and you've had some wounds too In the church, I know you have if you've been a part of the church very long because people go there But remember what the answer to that question was by the way?
[time=2661] Who's the problem? We had to look within I want to tell you the hardest person you'll ever lead is yourself You are the hardest person you'll ever lead I am the hardest person by far that I've ever led Everywhere I go, I always end up at the same place, I'm always there And I'm always in my way You know what I'm talking about, don't you?
[time=2683] I believe today is a time that God wants to bring some refreshing into a lot of lives here today
[time=2690] He wants to address the wounds that you've felt in church and life
[time=2696] And he wants to bring some refreshment as you hit the refresh button Some of you said I've been clicking the refresh button for years and the little will just sits there and spins
[time=2706] Jesus is bigger than that little will that sits there and spins And he wants to bring some refreshment into your life I told you about Isaiah 43, 18, and 19, he wants to do something new But what I didn't tell you is before he says behold, I want to do something new in your life He says forget the former things, don't remember the things of the past Move forward into the future and when we look at the future through the lens of the church Being the church as a journey together with Jesus as the head Hear me, when we do that, it becomes refreshing in your life You can celebrate that, that's where I'm celebrating God, go ahead, yeah I told you I wanted to tell you those two words
[time=2750] Verse 12 and verse 16, the works of service is the word ergon It literally means tasks, verse 12, works of service Sometimes churches get caught up in just the task of service Or they get caught up in just the organic calling of being servants of Jesus Verse 12 is tasks, ergon, works of service Verse 16, what's the last word there? Work As each part does its, that's not tasks, that's energama That word doesn't mean tasks, that word means the calling within That word means what God is doing inside of you It's bringing out to the outside, it's your gifts, it's your passions, it's your calling When those two things get merged, when the tasks that we're all called to do As a part of the body, each part of the body does its part That's the works, that's the tasks, that's the ergon of being the church But when it runs into it, it merges with the energama The calling within, the giftedness, the passion that verse 16 talks about The church always explodes And that's God's vision for his church, that's when church becomes refreshing That's when church becomes something that maybe you've never experienced it I believe that we work outwardly, whatever we're allowing God to do inwardly
[time=2825] You want to see an outward expression of what God's up to? Let him work inwardly in your life
[time=2832] Being the church, I believe this, takes just being willing to serve God To seek Jesus, not out of duty, but out of desperation As church ever felt like a duty, a responsibility for you, something that we just have to do Because, I don't know, mom and dad always said so Seeking God, being the church, should be something we do out of desperation Where we're on our knees and our face before God's saying God, I'm desperate for you to do something in my life When you seek God and you attempt to be the church out of desperation for Jesus
[time=2868] The duty, the responsibilities, those things that become so weighted down And so heavy on you, they start to slip away Starts to feel light and he starts to become Jesus And be Jesus in your life and through your life And he works outwardly through you, all the things he's done inside of you inwardly And it'll change your life Let me give you a challenge for the week You may say this was pretty good, sounds good on paper, the outline makes sense
[time=2898] Doesn't matter, unless it does something to your week And so I want to ask you to join me, and I'm not going to ask you to do something I'm not doing with you And every time I get a chance to preach, I want to come back and give you a report of how it's gone And I want to hear one as well, but the challenge for you this week is very simple Find one way, you probably have 25 ways that popped into your head Find one way that you can better be the church in your everyday life this week
[time=2925] So what does that mean, I don't know, but you do, he does If you don't, he does, so ask him And in a moment we're going to sing a song about how never once have we walked along Are you glad of that?
[time=2940] There have been times in my life where I've felt alone, but every time I look back at those moments I realize I was never alone He was there, I just didn't acknowledge him So acknowledge him today and realize you don't walk along as you find out how you can better be the church this week
[time=2956] It's a journey, I use that word journey for a reason because it doesn't happen by Monday morning after a sermon
[time=2962] It happens Monday morning and Tuesday morning and Wednesday morning and Thursday morning and Friday morning and Saturday morning
[time=2968] It'll happen to happen next Sunday morning and then you'll have to do it all over again But it's a journey that's worth taking With that in mind, I just want to ask you just to close your eyes from it, just reflect on what that one thing might be
[time=2981] What is that one thing that God is calling you to do?
[time=2985] What is that one thing that will help you better be the church in your life
[time=2991] No matter where you are in your life, no matter what you're experiencing, God has something for you And he wants to refresh you, you do not walk along, he's faithful even when you are faithless
[time=3002] And I want to tell you today, you may feel like you're fighting for victory, you're not You're fighting from victory if you know Jesus Because he's already won the victory Some of you are here and you may say I would love to be a part of the church, but I understand that means having a relationship with Jesus And I just don't know that I have that nailed down and figured out I want to talk to you for a moment If you're here and you know Jesus, pray for those who don't in this moment Pray for God to reveal to you what it is he's trying to teach you How you can better be the church in your everyday life this week But if you don't know Jesus, what I love about the gospel, the word gospel just means good news Good news is, if you watch it very often, you realize it's already happened I love that about the gospel, it's good news because it already took place Jesus already died, Jesus already won the victory Jesus already paid the price for your sin Jesus is bigger than your sin Where your sin has increased grace has abounded all the more It's done, it is finished Some of you just came today because God needs to tell you to stop striving To get things right before you give your life to Jesus and to just take that leap today If that's you the gospel makes it so clear Scripture says anyone who calls on the name of the Lord can be saved If you're not sure you've taken that step, I'm not going to leave you in a prayer Because your heart's already screaming it It's as simple as simply crying out to God that you know you're separated from Him That Jesus died, that He's alive And that you turn away from that old life that you thought you were good enough to a new life that only comes from Him
[time=3100] It's really that simple Your own words, would you take a moment and just cry that out to Him if that's you?
[time=3132] That's all over you here and I believe you've taken that step If that's you, nobody's looking around just between you and me and God for a moment There's something about just acknowledging it If you did take that step today, nobody's going to get you and pull you out of the service I just want to give you an opportunity to say Jesus I did that today If that's you, would you slip your hand up for a moment to say I prayed to receive Jesus I see you sir, I see you man, God bless you Keep it up for a moment, I see you sir Oh wow, I see you sir, keep them up Who else?
[time=3160] I see, God bless you You can put your hands down
[time=3168] God is just so humbling to watch you work
[time=3176] For those who've prayed to receive Jesus today, I thank you
[time=3184] That salvation is real and in Jesus But I pray that this would be only the beginning For those who have entrusted you as their Savior in this place today And even for those of us who have been walking in that relationship for a long time I pray we would walk differently this week because of the work you've done inwardly inside of us You're on the throne, you're still saving souls You built your church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it And I thank you Jesus that in so many lives across this building today, you won the victory
[time=3220] For their souls We praise you for your church and that we get to be a part of it And I thank you for what you're going to do in our hearts and lives As we sing in a moment, I pray we would respond That we would hit our knees, that we would go to the prayer walls That we would do whatever we need to do to take that first step of just trusting you and following you Prayerless and the powerful, holy, matchless name, the name of every name, the name of Jesus And everybody said, amen Let me talk to you and then we're going to kick off from this song As we kick off from this song, never once will you walk alone If you prayed to receive Jesus, you've got something when you came in that just gives you the opportunity To write down and check a box saying I prayed to receive Jesus I want somebody to walk with me in my new journey And I want to tell you, your life has just now begun In Jesus And as we sing this, I want to ask everybody to stand with me As you do, as we sing, I want to challenge you to respond The altar is open, you can come pray I'm going to join you right down here and I'm just going to spend some time praying There are prayer walls on each side here and you can come right down Something that God is teaching you, something that God is doing in your life Whatever you need to do, if you need to hit your knees, if you need to fill out that card and take it somewhere Will you do that right now as we sing?
