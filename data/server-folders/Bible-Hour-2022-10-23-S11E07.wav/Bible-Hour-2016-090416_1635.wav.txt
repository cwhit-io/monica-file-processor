[time=280] Psalm 72, 6 and 7 says this.
[time=285] May he come down like rain upon the moon, grass.
[time=289] Like showers that water the earth.
[time=292] In his days, may the righteous flourish, and abundance of peace till the moon is no more.

[time=346] The father's love for us, how vast beyond no measure,
[time=358] that he should give his only son to make the righteous treasure.
[time=371] It was my sin that held him there, until it was a comeback.
[time=385] His dying breath has brought me life, I know that it is singing.

[time=580] I will boast in Jesus Christ, his death and resurrection.
[time=593] Should I gain from his reward, I cannot give an answer.
[time=606] But this I know without my heart is true to pay my ransom.
[time=619] My soul longs for you.
[time=626] Titus chapter 2 verses 11 through 14.
[time=630] For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people.
[time=634] He teaches us to say no to ungodliness in worldly passions and to live self-controlled
[time=640] lives upright and godly lives in this present age while we wait for the blessed hope, the
[time=647] appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave Himself for us
[time=654] to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for Himself of people that are His very own
[time=662] eager to do what is good.
[time=667] Good morning, please open your Bibles to Titus chapter 2.
[time=676] And while you do that, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for allowing my
[time=683] family and I to serve you for the past 11 months or so.
[time=690] Thank you for loving us, for inviting us into your homes, and for taking us out to eat,
[time=700] for taking us to some great places, especially for all the bacon.
[time=709] This morning as we were saying goodbye, there was bacon and then people would come and say, hey, I don't like bacon, so here's some bacon.
[time=717] They actually handed me fresh bacon that was done just this morning.
[time=725] So I'm going to go on an old bacon diet starting tomorrow.
[time=734] Thank you, Darren, for allowing me to pick on you, but I have a lot of material.
[time=742] It's easy, it's easy.
[time=746] I will miss you, bro, but you'll miss me more.
[time=757] It is kind of bittersweet, you know, I don't know if to laugh or to cry, but I hope to
[time=765] come back.
[time=766] This, by the way, is my last Sunday as your inner own pastor.
[time=770] So next time I come, I will be coming as the guest of your new pastor, Kevin Rivers.
[time=777] That wonderful to hear?
[time=782] Yeah.
[time=783] 99%, huh?
[time=784] I think the only time I got 99% was in a PE class, and that's because there was extra
[time=792] credit given.
[time=796] This morning I want to talk about my favorite subject, Grace.
[time=801] If you have your babbles, again, open to Titus chapter 2, that the church on the Isle
[time=808] of Crete, here's a picture, a map, of one of Paul's missionary journeys.
[time=815] At some point he ends up on the Isle of Crete, and he plants a church there, but you know,
[time=823] Paul didn't stay in one place, right?
[time=824] He went from place to place.
[time=827] So he had to leave people to leave the church, elders, pastors, and he, in this case, leaves
[time=837] Titus to be the pastor at Crete.
[time=841] Now Titus is young and unexperienced, so Paul is writing him a letter that we know the
[time=847] epistle of Paul to Titus.
[time=849] He would be kind of like Rick Hawks writing a letter to Kevin Rivers.
[time=854] Rick Hawks is getting ready to retire in a few years, Kevin is basically kind of just getting started.
[time=861] But basically every Titus needs a Paul, amen?
[time=867] Every Titus needs a Paul.
[time=869] Every Timothy needed a Paul.
[time=872] Every Wednesday I get together with my, one of my Paul's.
[time=876] He's 90 years old.
[time=879] Dr. Homer Kent, taught New Testament for, I don't know, 50 years of grace, was the president.
[time=887] And there is a reason I'm meeting with him because he's 90 and I'm 46.
[time=892] I need to learn.
[time=894] My other mentor is 85 years old.
[time=896] His name is Tom Julian.
[time=899] He was a missionary to France.
[time=900] He learned under the teaching of Francis Shafer.
[time=907] I need to learn from people like that.
[time=909] Every Titus needs a Paul.
[time=912] Every Kevin Rivers needs a Rick Hawks.
[time=917] Come alongside your pastor and love him and love his family so they can do the work of
[time=924] the ministry well.
[time=926] Paul is writing a letter to Titus telling him how to do church basically because he doesn't
[time=932] know when he looks like this church and we think about this.
[time=936] This church didn't have elders.
[time=938] Think about that.
[time=940] So Paul is writing to Titus, hey make sure you point some elders in the church.
[time=947] Straighten out what was left unfinished Paul is writing to Titus and appoint elders in every town and then in one long sentence what David just read is one sentence in Greek.
[time=959] It's a nightmare for Greek scholars basically verses 11 through 14 that's one long sentence.
[time=968] Talk about bad grammar but I'm here to tell you there's some great theology there.
[time=975] The first thing we learn is the rescue of grace.
[time=980] For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people.
[time=988] Listen to the whole sentence.
[time=990] For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people.
[time=993] It teaches us to say no to ungodliness and worldly passions and to live self-controlled
[time=999] upright and godly lives in this present age.
[time=1002] While we wait for the blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great god and savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself
[time=1013] a people that are his very own eager to do what is good.
[time=1017] This morning I want us to learn two things about the rescue of grace and the requirements of grace.
[time=1024] That's the second point the rescue of grace and the requirements of grace but the grace of God the Bible teaches us that it saves us.
[time=1033] By the way that was not a new teaching for Paul, Paul wrote to the Churchill Ephesus for by grace you have been saved through faith and that none of yourself it is the gift
[time=1045] of God not as a result of works that no one should boast.
[time=1051] My dear brothers and sisters if we are saved is because we are saved by grace.
[time=1057] Grace saves us, God is giving us this unmerited favor.
[time=1065] I like this, this acrostic, grace spells God's riches at Christ's expense isn't that good?
[time=1074] We are not saved because of what we do, we are saved because of what Jesus Christ has done for us actually looking verse 14 because Paul continues to this idea that grace saves
[time=1085] us.
[time=1086] Jesus God save us through grace through our great God and Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself the people that
[time=1097] are his very own eager to do what is good.
[time=1101] We are saved because of what Jesus Christ has done for us.
[time=1105] I love C.S. Lewis's British humor and his book The Great Divorce.
[time=1115] He talks about a field trip that the people from hell could take and go to heaven.
[time=1123] They board this bus from hell and they go on a field trip to heaven and obviously you
[time=1129] can't get off the bus but they get to see the streets of gold, they get to see people
[time=1135] walking and all of a sudden on the bus there is a guy that sees one of his former friends
[time=1143] walking on the streets of gold but when they were alive they both committed the same sins.
[time=1150] What he didn't know is that that guy gave his life to Christ and was saved and I was in heaven but he was still in hell.
[time=1157] He didn't know that so he started to bang on the windows and say, "Justice, justice,
[time=1165] I want justice." The commotion was so big that the people from heaven heard and they
[time=1175] looked at each other and they said, "Poor guy." He doesn't know that we're not here
[time=1181] because justice was done to us. We're here because grace was imparted to us.
[time=1189] That is the rescue of grace. We are saved by grace.
[time=1195] We are not saved because of what we do. We're saved because of what Jesus Christ has done
[time=1201] for us who gave his life for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself
[time=1209] for people that are his very own eager to do what is good.
[time=1214] The grace of God not just saves us. The second point is that the grace of God teaches us.
[time=1220] Notice, please, what the grace of God teaches us. After we are saved it teaches us to say no to ungodliness and worldly passions. A better translation is worldly lusts and to live
[time=1234] self-controlled upright and godly lives. In this present age while we wait for the blessed and hope the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, grace not only saves us, but grace teaches us. So this morning I want us to think about how are we doing
[time=1251] in the school of grace. If there would be an exam today, a self-exam, a self-evaluation,
[time=1258] what grade would we get in the school of grace? The grace of God teaches us to say no to ungodliness
[time=1267] and worldly passions. Now you might say Tiberius, what is that ungodliness? That can mean so
[time=1274] many things. Well, the Bible helps us. That word translated ungodliness is only used in
[time=1284] that form one other time by the Apostle Paul, in Romans chapter 1. And in Romans chapter
[time=1292] 1, Paul, the Apostle Paul actually enumerates and lists all the things that are ungodliness.
[time=1301] You ready for this? You don't have to open there. I'm just going to enumerate them for you. Romans 1 starting in verse 21. Listen to what Paul considers ungodliness and things
[time=1310] that we are to say no to. This is Romans 1 starting in verse 18. For the wrath of God
[time=1318] is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness. That word appears here in Titus 2, the only
[time=1325] other word, the only other time that appears in that form. The wrath of God is revealed
[time=1331] from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness.
[time=1336] And then Paul goes on to list what is ungodliness? Listen to this. Verse 21, "Although they knew
[time=1343] God, then neither glorified him as God, nor gave thanks to him." People who are ungrateful.
[time=1351] Verse 23, "They exchanged the glory of the immortal God, for images made to look like mortal men and birds and animals and reptiles." Verse 26, "The women exchanged natural relations
[time=1362] for unnatural ones." Verse 27, "Men committed in decent acts with other men and receiving
[time=1368] themselves a due penalty for their perversion. To summarize, not glorifying God, not thanking
[time=1377] him, not worshipping God, homosexuality are all considered and classified. And Godless
[time=1383] and Paul says, "You are to say no to these things." Did you catch that? It doesn't say
[time=1389] maybe. It doesn't say, "Let's talk about it." It doesn't say, "Hey, what does the government say about it?" No. It says to say no to these things. Then how then some churches say yes?
[time=1401] How then there some people say, "Well, I'm going to do it my way." When the Bible clearly
[time=1407] says that the grace of God after it saves us, it teaches us to say no to ungodliness.
[time=1416] Dietrich Bonhoeffer was the pastor who died being killed by the Nazis. And he writes,
[time=1425] "And he distinguishes between cheap grace and costly grace." When he writes, "Cheap
[time=1432] grace is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church
[time=1439] discipline, communion without confession, cheap grace is grace without discipleship,
[time=1446] grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ living incarnate." That's cheap grace.
[time=1453] Costly grace calls us to follow Jesus Christ. It is costly because it costs the man his life,
[time=1461] and it is grace because it gives the man the only true life. It is costly because he condemns
[time=1467] sin and grace because he justifies the sinner. Above all, it is grace because God did not
[time=1473] reckon his son too dear a price to pay for our life, but delivered him up for us.
[time=1478] Costly grace is the incarnation of God. You see, when we say yes to ungodliness and worldly passions,
[time=1485] all we do is preach a cheap grace. But God teaches us after he saves us to say no
[time=1494] to ungodliness and worldly passions. What else does grace teach us? Grace also teaches us to live
[time=1500] self-controlled upright and godly lives in this present age. Live self-controlled. What does that
[time=1507] mean? To live a life without self-control is basically like a car without brakes.
[time=1514] Have you ever heard a car such a dad like that? No, Tim goes, "Yeah, I had that car."
[time=1521] Okay, a car without brakes is an accident waiting to happen, right? That's what a life without
[time=1528] self-control is, an accident waiting to happen. We need to learn to say no to live self-controlled
[time=1538] without self-control is living dangerously. Upright and godly are synonymous and they stand in
[time=1547] stark contrast with ungodliness and worldly passions or worldly lusts. You see, you can say,
[time=1555] "Oh, I'm saved by grace. I can do whatever I want." That's not biblical. Being saved by grace means
[time=1561] that after you are saved, you learn to say no to ungodliness and worldly passions and lusts, and you are to say yes to being self-controlled upright and godly lives. There is something of
[time=1572] growth that happens after we are saved. That's the message. When you say to people, all you need to
[time=1579] do is believe and don't worry about anything else. That's cheap grace. Costly grace is right here,
[time=1585] what the Bible teaches. The grace of God saves us, but then the grace of God teaches us lose certain things. But why does he have to put in this present age? I believe he puts that there because
[time=1599] a lot of us like to live in Mayberry. You've been to Mayberry, right?
[time=1606] I think I drove to it coming from Warsaw. Don't get me wrong. I love Mayberry. I love the idea of
[time=1618] having Andy as my sheriff and dealing with a problem she dealt with a few years ago, right?
[time=1627] Those are not problems anymore. Barney Five, huh?
[time=1631] Otis, I would have loved to slap Otis around the tongue to stop getting drunk.
[time=1638] By the way, I heard that he actually, in your life, became a believer. Did you know that?
[time=1643] That's a little trivia pursuit for you if you ever end up on Jeopardy.
[time=1647] But you know what? God is not asking us to live in the Mayberry of yesterday.
[time=1658] He's asking us to live in a fortuene of today and to live in the Warsaw Winona Lake of today.
[time=1664] Wherever God is calling you, stop living in the past. I have many people who have come to say me,
[time=1671] "Oh, I used to be this and that 30 years ago, 20 years ago." Well, let me ask you, what are you
[time=1677] doing for God now? A lot of you are excited. You get a new pastor and you're wondering,
[time=1683] "What will this pastor do?" But my question is for you, what are you going to do? That's the question.
[time=1689] Ask not what your pastor can do for you.
[time=1697] But ask what you can do for the kingdom of God.
[time=1708] To live self-controlled upright godly lives in this present age.
[time=1715] By the way, if you have never seen the Andy Griffith Show, I encourage you to go google it
[time=1722] and watch at least one episode. There's one episode when there's this guy who comes out of the woods
[time=1730] throwing rocks. Erneste? Bass.
[time=1734] What? You guys know your TV history. Good. Erneste Bass, for younger people, you guys, I got to hear this because you love this. His way of courting this certain lady who's already
[time=1745] married, by the way, is by coming and throwing rocks and breaking windows.
[time=1749] But I love Sheriff Andy. Why? Because Andy the Sheriff knows how to handle stone throwers.
[time=1765] Some of you are expert at stone throwing. You might need a Sheriff Andy.
[time=1772] I love Sheriff Andy because he knows how to handle stone throwers.
[time=1781] You see, the Bible teaches us what to do and what not to do, but also what the Bible teaches
[time=1787] us is to wait for the blessed hope, the glorious appearing of our great god and savior, Jesus Christ. In other words, waiting for Christ's second coming is not a passive waiting.
[time=1797] It's got to be an active waiting. We got to wait for Christ's second coming.
[time=1803] Our waiting is to be an active waiting. I read about a house in Wisconsin. It's called
[time=1813] Shepherd's house. Shepherd's house is a house for children with mental handicaps.
[time=1823] And someone did a study and asked them at Shepherd's house, what's the greatest challenge?
[time=1829] What's the greatest challenge of these handicapped kids who actually every day learn about Jesus
[time=1835] and they learn about his birth and they learn about his life and they learn that Jesus is coming back again. And someone asked the staff there, what is the greatest challenge at Shepherd's house?
[time=1849] And they told him, he says, the greatest challenge is dirty windows.
[time=1854] Because every morning, when the kids get up, they go to the window to see if Jesus is coming back
[time=1867] that day. I wish you dirty windows. The faith like the child that's waiting for Christ to come back.
[time=1880] Because that's what the Bible says. Grace not only saves us but teaches us to say no to ungodliness
[time=1888] and worldly passions and to live self-controlled upright and godly lives. In this present age,
[time=1895] how? Waiting for the blessed hope, the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=1901] Doing what? Eager to do what is good. I like one translation that says, zealous for good deeds.
[time=1911] Zealous for good deeds. Ephesians 2, 10, for we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for
[time=1919] good works which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them. In other words, you don't have to ask yourself, hey man, what kind of good deed do I have to do today? The Bible says that as
[time=1932] you walk in faithfulness in obedience, God will bring you the opportunities to do good. Isn't that
[time=1939] wonderful? You don't have to look for it. Just walk in the path of obedience, just walk in the path
[time=1947] of faithfulness and God will bring you opportunities to do good. All you have to do is walk in them.
[time=1955] Be eager to do what is good. Christians should be the ones that do most work around the world
[time=1962] and the best work around the world. A lot of times we're considered, you know, Bible thumpers
[time=1968] but we're not doing anything. No, we should be on the front lines of doing good. Eager to do what
[time=1974] is good. Black on one, when they talk about black, I pray that they will say, man, those guys are eager to do what is good. Full of good works, yellows to do good works. You want someone to do good,
[time=1985] go to Blackhawk. The grace of God saves us but the grace of God also teaches us to do what is good.
[time=1993] So as we are self-evaluating ourselves, can I ask you how you're doing in the school of grace?
[time=2003] Are you saying no? To ungodliness and worldly passions or you say yes sometimes, maybe sometimes,
[time=2013] no sometimes. How are you doing with living self-controlled, upright, godly lives? How are you doing
[time=2019] waiting for Christ to come in? How are you doing with doing good things, doing good works for other people? How are you doing? There's a story in the New Testament that I love. It's in the gospel of
[time=2032] John. If you have your Bibles, turn with me there, please. In John chapter 8, it's the woman caught in adultery story. I believe this story brings what I'm talking about together. The grace of God who
[time=2047] teaches us and the grace of God who saves us and the grace of God who teaches us. In John chapter 8,
[time=2057] I'm sure most of you know the story. Jesus is teaching at the temple and all of a sudden
[time=2065] imagine teaching the Bible and all of a sudden being interrupted by this mob of people who's
[time=2073] bringing you this woman. Moses commanded us to stone such one. Why? This one was caught in the
[time=2081] very act of adultery. Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?
[time=2092] Oh, it's a good question, by the way. Don't get me wrong. It's a great question.
[time=2096] But Jesus could have asked them if you caught this woman in the very act of adultery,
[time=2102] tell me where is the man? Have you ever asked yourself that?
[time=2108] I thought both of them are guilty. Why just single out the woman? But Jesus doesn't do that.
[time=2115] But he could have. But verse 6 tells us that these guys are not honest people. They're not
[time=2125] really asking a question because they want to know the answer. They were using this question
[time=2131] as a trap, the Bible says, in order to have a basis of accusing Jesus. But Jesus bent down and
[time=2137] started to write on the ground with his finger. And then he says, if any of you is without sin, let him be the first one to throw a stone at her. And you know the rest of the story, right?
[time=2150] They began to go away one at a time, the older one first, until only Jesus was left with the woman
[time=2157] still standing there. Max Lucado writes, Jesus told the woman to look up. Is there no one to condemn
[time=2166] you? He smiled as she raised her head. She saw no one. Only rocks. Each one, a miniature tombstone
[time=2176] to mark the burial place of a man's arrogance. Maybe she expected him to scold her. Perhaps she
[time=2183] expected him to walk away from her. I'm not sure, but I do know this, what she got, she never expected.
[time=2188] She got a promise and a commission. The promise neither do I condemn you. The commission go and
[time=2194] say no more. Isn't that beautiful? The grace that saves us neither do I condemn you. But then the
[time=2202] requirement of grace go and sin, no more. Verse 9 in the NIV just says, left to the woman still
[time=2213] standing there. That's a bad translation. In the Greek actually says this, Jesus was left alone
[time=2219] with the woman standing in the midst. What do you mean in the midst? All the people were gone.
[time=2226] What was left? What was left were the rocks that were supposed to kill her.
[time=2233] See, Jesus, the woman surrounded by the rocks that the men have dropped. The rocks that were
[time=2241] supposed to kill her. I brought this morning three rocks with me. I want to ask you this morning,
[time=2252] do you ever bring your church, your rocks at church?
[time=2258] I named these rocks. The first one is the stone of criticism. It's smaller, you can palm it,
[time=2268] put it, ladies, you can put it in your purse, you can put it in your shirt pocket even.
[time=2274] It's called a stone of criticism. Have you ever been hit with such a stone?
[time=2282] Don't raise your hand. Have you ever been hit with such a stone?
[time=2287] Kids get hit by parents. You spilled your milk, you always spilled your milk.
[time=2298] Spouses get hit by other spouses. You burn the food, you always burn the food.
[time=2304] Worship pastor get hit. That song goes too high.
[time=2309] Pastors get hit. The sermon was too long. I got something good yesterday from a friend who said,
[time=2320] if you like everybody to like, you don't be a pastor. Go sell ice cream.
[time=2328] Things starting tomorrow, I'm going to start selling ice cream.
[time=2330] Have you ever been hit with such a stone? But let me ask you, have you ever hit people with this
[time=2338] stone? Some of you think criticism is a spiritual gift. I'm here to tell you it's not.
[time=2345] Then there's this rock called the rock of bitterness. It's got layers. You see,
[time=2356] because every time you can't forgive someone for what they said to you, it adds another layer.
[time=2361] It's the stone of bitterness and another layer. I teach Hebrew and every time I have people who
[time=2367] said, oh, Tiberius, I can't memorize like I used to. I'm not young anymore. It is interesting that
[time=2375] these same people, they cannot memorize another language. Remember what someone said to them 20
[time=2382] years ago, and they can quote it to me word for word. These are people who are bitter people.
[time=2390] And then I have a third rock, a third stone. I'm going to name it unnamed. I want you to name it.
[time=2398] What is something you hit people with? Is it racism? Is it legalism?
[time=2408] Is it fundamentalism? Whatever is it? Name your rock this morning. How do you hit people with?
[time=2418] See, I love this story because the only person in this story that had the right to hit the woman
[time=2426] with rocks was Jesus, and he doesn't do that.
[time=2434] Do you want to hear the sound of grace this morning? This is the sound of grace. Listen.
[time=2441] That's the sound of grace. You have a rock, you can hit people with it,
[time=2455] but you said, I'm not going to do it. It's not the grace of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
[time=2462] It's the grace of Jesus who says, neither do I condemn you. Go and sin no more.
[time=2470] Calvin Miller writes, remember this. If you are torn between doing what you know to be right,
[time=2481] and what you know to be loving, do what is loving first. If you are torn between your convictions
[time=2490] and your compassion, be compassionate first. If you can't tell whether you should throw stones
[time=2497] at a sinner or embrace her, ask yourself how it was God first greeted with you with rocks or with love.
[time=2507] Think about that.
[time=2520] [MUSIC]
[time=2533] Time measured out my days. Life carried me along.
[time=2548] In my soul, I yearned to follow God, but knew I'd never be so strong. I looked hard at this world
[time=2566] to learn how heaven could be gained. Just to end where I began, where human effort is all
[time=2586] in vain, were it not for grace? I can tell you where I'd be, wandering down some pointless road
[time=2610] to nowhere, with my salvation up to me, and I know how that would go.
[time=2626] The battles I would face, forever running but losing the race, were it not for grace?
[time=2651] So here is all my praise, expressed with all my heart. Offered to a friend who took my place
[time=2671] and ran a course I could not start, and when he saw in full just how much his love would cost.
[time=2690] He still went the final mile between me and heaven, so I would not be lost.
[time=2702] Were it not for grace? I can tell you where I'd be,
[time=2719] wandering down some pointless road to nowhere, with my salvation up to me, and I know how that would go.
[time=2738] The battles I would face, forever running but losing the race, were it not for grace?
[time=2761] Were ever running but losing the race, were it not for grace?
[time=2791] The woman turns around and walks into anonymity.
[time=2804] She's never seen or heard from again. Max Lequiero writes, "But we can be confident of one thing.
[time=2818] On that day in Jerusalem she saw Jesus, and Jesus saw her. And if we could somehow transport her to
[time=2827] Calvary and let her stand at the base of the cross, you know what she would say, that's him,
[time=2835] should whisper, that's him. She would recognize his hands, the only hands, the held no stones that
[time=2843] they were his, and on this day they still hold no stones. She would recognize his voice, it's
[time=2851] raspier and weaker, but the words are the same father, forgive them, and she would recognize his
[time=2859] eyes. How could she ever forget those eyes, clear and tear filled, eyes that saw her, not as she was,
[time=2868] but as she was intended to be. I read that some museums and universities
[time=2876] have a day called the Ernest T. Bass Day. What do they commemorate?
[time=2888] Apparently if you have a rock or a stone that you cannot name, you don't know what it is,
[time=2896] you take it to the lab and they can tell you.
[time=2898] It wouldn't be great today to identify all the rocks in our lives and to leave them here behind.
[time=2909] I have a feeling you know what your rock is. I have a feeling you don't need a university
[time=2919] professor to tell you how you're hitting people. I have a feeling you know.
[time=2927] "Believe your rocks," said the altar. After all, it's very hard to put your hands on the window and
[time=2937] look for Christ coming if you have rocks in your hands, isn't it? Drop your rocks and drop your
[time=2947] stones and go every morning to the window to see if Jesus is coming again. And while you do that,
[time=2955] do some good things. Do some good things. Start at home, continue to work and do a church.
[time=2966] I'm sure there's people who need help in the nursery. I'm sure you need there's place for
[time=2973] you to teach Sunday school. I'm sure that there is room for some or to serve with Alana, Alana
[time=2979] starting, "Oh, I know people need help with Alana," just to sit there and listen to Bible verses.
[time=2985] It doesn't take a rocket scientist, trust me, I know I've done it.
[time=2996] Remember the rescue of grace. Neither do I condemn you, but the requirements of grace.
[time=3006] Go and sing no more. Say no to ungodliness and worldly passions.
[time=3016] Live self-controlled upright and godly lives in this present age. Waiting
[time=3025] for the blessed hope God's glorious appearing eager to do what is good.
[time=3031] When I hear about Blackhawk in the future, I pray that I'll hear that is a gracious church.
[time=3041] That is a grace filled church. They're full of doing good works and people come to the saving
[time=3047] knowledge of Christ and the church is growing, I pray that that will be Blackhawk.
[time=3052] And I'm going to hear the sound of grace all the way to Winona Lake because God has been working
[time=3061] in you. Let's pray. Dear Father, thank you for this wonderful place where we can come together
[time=3073] and love you and love each other. Thank you for the wonderful way you've worked in their lives.
[time=3080] Over many years since the inception of this church, I pray this church will be a place where
[time=3088] Jesus Christ will be accepted as Lord and Savior. Pray this will be a place where the church will be edified, but above all, I pray that this will be a church where your name will be glorified.
[time=3098] I pray they will forgive us for the many times we held down to our stones and our rocks.
[time=3106] And we had a reason for having them and we told everybody about it.
[time=3115] I pray that today we will hear the sound of grace. We will hear your words, neither do I condemn you.
[time=3122] But I pray that we will also enter the School of Grace learning
[time=3128] to say no to ungodliness and worthy passions, to live self-controlled upright lives in this
[time=3135] present age, waiting for the blessed hope, the glorious appearing of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. And while we wait, may it be not a passive waiting but an active waiting eager to do what is
[time=3148] good. In Christ's name I thank you for your grace. Help us to be gracious as we respond to your love
[time=3161] and grace. In Christ's name I pray. Amen.
[time=3178] Please stand with us and say there's a place where mercy rains and never dies.
[time=3189] There's a place where streams of grace flow deep and wild.
[time=3207] All the love I've ever found comes like a flood comes flowing down.
[time=3219] At the cross at the cross I surrender my life I'm in all of you. I'm in all of you
[time=3236] where your love ran red and my sin washed white. I owe all to you. I owe all to you, Jesus.
[time=3258] There's a place where same and shame are powerless.
[time=3271] My heart has peace with God and forgiveness.
[time=3280] When all the love I've ever found comes like a flood comes flowing down.
[time=3296] At the cross at the cross I surrender my life I'm in all of you. I'm in all of you
[time=3308] where my love ran red and my sin washed white. I owe all to you. I owe all to you.
[time=3323] Here my hope is found here. I'm holy ground here. I've got love here. I've got love here. I've got love here.
[time=3340] You say bye-bye here. I've got love here. I've got love here. I've got love at the cross at the cross
[time=3351] I surrender my life I'm in all of you. I'm in all of you where your love ran red and my sin washed white.
[time=3367] I owe all to you. I owe all to you. At the cross at the cross I surrender my life I'm in all of you.
[time=3382] I'm in all of you where your love ran red and my sin washed white. I owe all to you.
[time=3395] I owe all to you. I owe all to you. To you. To you. To you.
[time=3418] You're love ran red. You're love ran red.
[time=3432] Good morning and thank you for watching the Bible Hour. Today is my last day as interim pastor at Black Hawk and
[time=3446] I want to thank you for welcoming me in your homes, in your hospital rooms, in your nursing homes.
[time=3452] It's been a blessing to be with you. But as I conclude I want to ask you about the grace of God.
[time=3461] Have you experienced the grace of God? For by grace you have been saved through faith.
[time=3467] There's no other way of salvation except through the grace of God through Jesus Christ.
[time=3473] That's all separates Christianity from all the other religions of the world.
[time=3477] All the other religions make you do something to be saved. Christianity is the only religion where you are saved because of what Jesus Christ has done for you. But as Paul said to Titus,
[time=3490] the grace of God saves us. But the grace of God also teaches us to say no to ungodliness
[time=3498] and worldly passions. The grace of God teaches us to wait for Christ's second coming. So
[time=3504] let me ask you, how are you doing in the school of grace? Are you growing? Are you obeying God?
[time=3511] Are you waiting for your second coming? Doing good works? The Christian who is saved
[time=3517] is full of good works. And that is possible only because of the grace of Jesus Christ.
[time=3525] Remember the acronym GRACE. God's riches at Christ's expense. That's what grace is.
[time=3533] And I pray that God will richly bless you. It is grace as you walk day by day in obedience
[time=3541] to Him. And may people know around you know that you are a gracious person, a grace full person,
[time=3549] a grace filled person. And they will show that in the way you speak, in the way you think,
[time=3555] and in the way you act. And may many people come to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ
[time=3561] as a result of you being grace filled.
