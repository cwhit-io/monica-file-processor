[time=0] You
[time=30] [MUSIC]
[time=60] Hello Black Hawk family. I just wanted to take just a couple of minutes to tell you how truly excited my family and I are to be starting this new journey with you at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=88] I've been thinking a lot about that word journey over the last couple of weeks especially since August 21st when I got to preach there about our journey of being the church.
[time=98] I've been thinking a lot about my own journey and all of the people that God has placed in my path to have me prepared and ready for this new season.
[time=106] A big part of that has been my family and in fact I'm standing in the church that my father planted here in our hometown area to make this video.
[time=115] And as you're watching this video today I'm going to have the opportunity to preach at the very first church where my father was a pastor.
[time=123] Be able to reminisce and remember all the great times there where I actually got to serve as a staff member.
[time=128] It's the church where Jessica and I got married. It's the church where I was ordained into ministry and so just thinking about that path.
[time=135] Thinking about that journey is such a special thing to see how God aligns things in our paths on our journey of faith.
[time=142] One of my favorite verses about that comes from Proverbs chapter 3 verses 5 and 6.
[time=147] It says trust in the Lord with all of your heart and lean not on your own understanding but in all of your ways acknowledge him and he will direct your paths.
[time=158] God has surely directed our paths and we are so excited to know that our paths have paralleled with yours.
[time=165] I want to ask you in closing to do three things for me. How can you help us? Here are three ways you can help us.
[time=171] Number one, consider those verses in your own personal life.
[time=174] Consider how you can lean not on your own understanding but in all of your ways acknowledge God and trust him in your own personal life and then go for it this week.
[time=184] Number two, as you know my family right now is preparing to move from Georgia to Indiana so I want to ask you to continue praying for us as we get ready to sell our home.
[time=193] Pray that our home will sell and also just pray for me right now as likely while you're watching this video.
[time=198] I'm preaching at this very moment so pray for me on that journey also.
[time=203] Number three, October the 9th is coming quickly.
[time=206] October the 9th will be the first Sunday where we'll be there and my family and I kicking off a new series.
[time=211] So mark your calendars for October the 9th and make sure you make plans to join us there as we're going to kick things off and see God do some amazing things ahead.
[time=220] See you then.
[time=223] [MUSIC]
[time=246] Here in this morning we're at land a million dream half time.
[time=254] So like a drink planted by the water we never will run dry.
[time=259] It's kind of hard to focus right now.
[time=262] [MUSIC]
[time=290] And I, we know we were made for so much more than ordinary life.
[time=302] It's time for us to more than just survive.
[time=308] We were made to fight.
[time=320] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[time=328] Into the world we're bringing deep to know our fathers come.
[time=335] Into the world we're reaching out to show who you are.
[time=343] Living water flowing through God we thirst for four of you.
[time=351] Fail our hearts and flood our souls with one desire.
[time=359] Just to know you're meant to make you know we live your name on high.
[time=368] We know we were made for so much more than ordinary life.
[time=385] It's time for us to more than just survive.
[time=391] We were made to cry.
[time=421] Just to know you're meant to make you know we live your name on high.
[time=450] We know we were made for so much more than ordinary life.
[time=459] It's time for us to more than just survive.
[time=466] We were made to cry.
[time=512] [AMEN]
[time=518] 1 Thessalonians 5.23 says this.
[time=521] Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=551] When sorrows like sea villos roll.
[time=566] Moreover my Lord, thou hast taught me to say.
[time=576] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=587] In the Lord it's for me, for like coming we weigh.
[time=598] The clouds be all there, like a stronger.
[time=609] Oh, child, by the angel, the voice of the Lord.
[time=619] Blessed home, blessed rest of my soul.
[time=630] It is well, with my soul.
[time=640] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=651] It is well, with my soul.
[time=662] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=673] You are the rock on which I stand by your grace.
[time=682] It is well, my hope is sure.
[time=687] In Christ my Savior is well with my soul.
[time=697] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=718] You are the rock on which I stand by your grace.
[time=727] It is well, my hope is sure.
[time=733] In Christ my Savior is well with my soul.
[time=740] You are the rock on which I stand by your grace.
[time=749] It is well, my hope is sure.
[time=754] In Christ my Savior is well with my soul.
[time=770] You are the rock on which I stand by your grace.
[time=780] In Christ my Savior is well with my soul.
[time=795] You give life, you are love.
[time=800] You bring light to the darkness you give hope.
[time=807] You restore every heart that is broken.
[time=818] That great are you, Lord.
[time=825] It is your breath in our lungs.
[time=830] So we pour out our praise.
[time=835] It is your breath in our lungs.
[time=840] So we pour out our praise to you only.
[time=855] You give life, you are love.
[time=860] You bring light to the darkness you give hope.
[time=867] You restore every heart that is broken.
[time=878] Great are you, Lord.
[time=885] It is your breath in our lungs.
[time=890] So we pour out our praise.
[time=893] Pour out our praise to your breath in our lungs.
[time=899] So we pour out our praise to you only.
[time=905] It is your breath in our lungs.
[time=909] So we pour out our praise.
[time=913] Pour out our praise to your breath in our lungs.
[time=919] So we pour out our praise to you only.
[time=925] [MUSIC]
[time=1061] You may be seated.
[time=1067] Today's scripture comes from two Psalms.
[time=1070] Psalm 1 and Psalm 100.
[time=1073] If you didn't bring your Bible with you, the Bible we provided for you right in front of you.
[time=1077] It starts on page 254.
[time=1080] And in fact, if you don't have a Bible of your own, we would invite you just to take that Bible home with you as our gift to you today.
[time=1087] Psalm 1, "Blessed is the man who walks not in the council of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers.
[time=1097] But his delight is in the law of the Lord.
[time=1100] And on his law he meditates day and night.
[time=1103] Like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season and its leaf does not wither.
[time=1110] And all he does, he prospers.
[time=1113] The wicked are not so but are like chaff that the wind drives away.
[time=1117] Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment.
[time=1120] Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous, for the Lord knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish." And now Psalm 100.
[time=1134] Psalm 100, "Make a joyful noise to the Lord all the earth.
[time=1139] Serve the Lord with gladness.
[time=1141] Come into his presence with singing.
[time=1144] Know that the Lord he is God.
[time=1146] It is he who made us and we are his.
[time=1149] We are his people and the sheep of his pasture.
[time=1153] Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise.
[time=1157] Give thanks to him, bless his name.
[time=1161] For the Lord is good, his steadfast love endures forever and his faithfulness to all generations." I thought Kevin was going to preach, but apparently not,
[time=1184] so I guess I get to.
[time=1187] Wow, fantastic.
[time=1189] Welcome to today.
[time=1190] We just sang some beautiful, beautiful songs.
[time=1192] Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, your perfect love is casting out fear.
[time=1198] Even when I'm caught in the middle of the storms of this life, I won't turn back.
[time=1201] I know you are near.
[time=1203] God is with us all the time.
[time=1206] Before we get started, I want to talk just a little bit about Wednesday nights.
[time=1209] I hope that you are planning to be with us on Wednesday nights.
[time=1212] If you not, take a look at your calendar.
[time=1214] Here's what I did.
[time=1215] I stopped and thought to myself, if I wasn't at Wednesday night church, what would I be doing?
[time=1219] I mean, really, I would sit there.
[time=1221] What would I be doing if I wasn't here?
[time=1224] And that didn't seem like a good enough reason to not be here.
[time=1227] And so maybe your situation is different and that's fine, but we have a lot of really good things going on on Wednesday night, so I would encourage you to come out and give it a shot.
[time=1236] We've got some great Bible teaching.
[time=1238] We've got some great opportunities for service.
[time=1240] We're going to have good food.
[time=1241] We've got good groups that are meeting.
[time=1243] We're going to sing a little bit and that's exciting.
[time=1246] So if you have the opportunity, just take a look.
[time=1249] What's Wednesday nights look like for you and then decide maybe you want to come and join in with your brothers and sisters here at Blackhawk?
[time=1257] Are you righteous?
[time=1260] Do you feel righteous before God?
[time=1263] When God looks at you, does he see righteous?
[time=1267] Psalm 1 is a passage of Scripture that compares for us the wicked person and the righteous person.
[time=1274] So those are questions that we need to ponder.
[time=1276] So today we're going to talk about what it's like to be righteous before God.
[time=1280] Righteousness is being right with God, having everything cleared out between you and the Lord.
[time=1287] That's what righteous is.
[time=1289] See, every person has a desire to be loved and respected and accepted.
[time=1293] Counseling junior high kids for many, many years, one of the things that we would always dig into problems that they would have and interactions with other students and this particular group was casting them out
[time=1306] or this person was being a bully or something like that.
[time=1309] And it all comes down to one thing.
[time=1311] They wanted to feel accepted.
[time=1313] They wanted to feel a part of a group.
[time=1315] They wanted to be significant.
[time=1317] It's built inside all of us.
[time=1320] Many times the response would be, I don't care if anybody likes me.
[time=1325] You know what, maybe for a decision or a circumstance that's true, but by and large as human beings we are relational beings and we desire to be valued.
[time=1334] We desire to be accepted and then we serve a righteous God.
[time=1340] And we say to ourselves as human beings, how can God love me?
[time=1345] How can I be good enough for a perfect God?
[time=1348] How can that happen?
[time=1350] We ask ourselves and oftentimes we even have family members that reject us.
[time=1356] Y'all know some of your situations are that way where your family doesn't accept you.
[time=1360] So you say to yourself, if my family doesn't accept me, then how can God accept me?
[time=1367] Ah, but here's the deal.
[time=1369] Here's the deal.
[time=1371] When you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, you become righteous through Jesus Christ.
[time=1379] When you repent of your sin and turn and call on the name of Jesus Christ,
[time=1385] you become righteous because God now looks at you through a lens of mercy,
[time=1392] a filter of grace and a veil of the blood of Jesus Christ that was shot on Calvary on your behalf.
[time=1399] And so when he looks at you, he doesn't see all the shortcomings, the pitfalls and all the problems that you have.
[time=1406] He looks at you and he sees perfection.
[time=1409] He sees righteousness.
[time=1414] You, if you have accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior, are righteous before God.
[time=1422] I think the first part of the outline, you accept Jesus Christ as your Savior, then you are righteous before God.
[time=1430] But righteousness is a gift from God.
[time=1432] None of us can do it on our own, right?
[time=1434] We all fall short.
[time=1436] We were all born in sin.
[time=1438] Sin came into the human race through the act of Adam.
[time=1442] We cannot become righteous on our own.
[time=1446] We had to have a way for that to happen, and that was through Jesus Christ.
[time=1450] And the Bible confirms that when it says in Romans 3, 23, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." That all is all the people.
[time=1459] All of us have sinned.
[time=1461] It doesn't leave anybody out for all of us have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[time=1465] And since I've sinned, I cannot be in harmony with God without something repairing that state.
[time=1472] That's Jesus Christ.
[time=1475] In Isaiah 64, verse 6, it talks about our human righteousness.
[time=1478] It says, "All of us have become like ones who are unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags."
[time=1486] We sin far too often to be righteous before God.
[time=1490] Praise God for His wonderful gift of righteousness.
[time=1494] [AMEN] Praise the Lord Jesus who died to pay for our sins so that they would not be counted against us.
[time=1502] It is our sins that make us unrighteous before God.
[time=1505] But Jesus Christ paid that penalty and allows us to stand righteous before God.
[time=1510] [AMEN] Now that we as Christians know we are righteous, how then shall we live?
[time=1520] How should we then live?
[time=1522] That was a book written by Francis Shafer back in 1976.
[time=1525] He was talking about the rise and decline of Western culture and thought.
[time=1528] He wasn't the first one to give directions, ideas on how we should live.
[time=1534] And that's what we're going to talk about today in Psalms.
[time=1539] First of all, we're going to talk about the conduct of the righteous.
[time=1541] If I'm righteous, how should I live?
[time=1543] My conduct.
[time=1544] What's my conduct if I'm righteous?
[time=1546] Well, first of all, we'll start in Psalm 1.
[time=1549] It says, "Blessed are the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers.
[time=1556] As a righteous person, I should avoid the ways of the wicked."
[time=1562] I should avoid the ways of the wicked.
[time=1564] Now notice it doesn't say avoid the wicked.
[time=1566] That's really important.
[time=1567] It doesn't say avoid the wicked because we are still to be salt and light in our world, correct?
[time=1572] It's not that we should avoid them, but we should avoid their ways.
[time=1576] Which means that their decisions and choices for life and the way you live life should not impact the way that our decisions and choices are made.
[time=1585] We should avoid the ways of the wicked.
[time=1587] Avoid the counsel of the wicked.
[time=1591] We should not stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of scoffers.
[time=1596] Once again, the verbiage used there implies a relationship that reflects in each other's lives.
[time=1605] That I would sit.
[time=1611] That I would counsel.
[time=1614] We are still to be among the wicked because what is wicked?
[time=1619] We're not talking about leaven-worth-type wicked here.
[time=1628] Wicked are those who live their life without regard to God.
[time=1633] Basically, those who are unrighteous.
[time=1637] That's a harsh thing because I know some people who are not Christians who by the world standards are pretty good people, don't you?
[time=1645] They're hard to God, they are wicked.
[time=1652] Next in verse 2, it says, "When the light is in the law of the Lord and on His law He meditates day and night, meditating on Scripture."
[time=1660] Now, meditating isn't just reading or even memorizing Scripture.
[time=1664] I wrote in your notes active pondering.
[time=1668] "Pondering" means thought, so I should be actively thinking about Scripture.
[time=1675] Now, we all have this in our lives.
[time=1676] We're going through our day-to-day and our moments-by-moments and we're doing things and we're involved in things.
[time=1681] But we have those times when our mind is kind of wandering off from what it ever is.
[time=1686] Maybe I'm driving down the road or mowing the grass or that kind of thing.
[time=1692] What do you engage your mind in?
[time=1697] It says that we should meditate.
[time=1699] That's a great time to meditate, actively ponder on the Lord Jesus Christ, actively ponder on His Word.
[time=1705] Spend your time doing that.
[time=1709] That's what meditation means, not just reading and memorizing, but actively pondering.
[time=1716] Another conduct of righteous we'll find in Psalms 100 verse 1.
[time=1723] It says, "Make a joyful noise unto the Lord." That could have been translated, "Shout for joy."
[time=1734] This weekend, if you don't know this, is the opening of the NCAA football season.
[time=1740] A team that I particularly follow yesterday, two times the defense intercepted the ball and ran it back for a touchdown.
[time=1748] Now I'm going to tell you right now, my wife will tell you, I wasn't sitting in my chair and saying, "Oh, that's good."
[time=1755] Nice job.
[time=1757] No!
[time=1758] I was like, "Yes!" Texted my son, he was at the game, I'm like, "Yes!
[time=1764] Way to go!" Right?
[time=1767] That's what we do.
[time=1768] What do you do when your favorite team scores a significant point or does something really well?
[time=1776] How do you respond when a sinner comes to Christ?
[time=1781] You know, I'm just really thankful that you accepted the Lord as your Savior.
[time=1785] That's fantastic.
[time=1786] You're not going to spend eternity in hell now, isn't that awesome?
[time=1789] My team scored yes!
[time=1791] You know, it's just great that you're going to be a part of the family of God.
[time=1794] I'm just so thankful, right?
[time=1799] When people accept the Lord as their Savior, this is what they do.
[time=1803] They have signed, Jesus signed, sealed, delivered their life so that they can spend eternity in heaven, not separated from Jesus Christ.
[time=1811] That ought to fire you up!
[time=1814] Hey man, that ought to get so excited about that.
[time=1821] When Pastor Kevin was here, I'm going to tell a story.
[time=1825] When Pastor Kevin was here, we had had a person that had recently been baptized.
[time=1831] And you know what?
[time=1832] Pastor Kevin did?
[time=1833] Here's what he didn't do.
[time=1835] I'm just really glad you got baptized.
[time=1837] Thank you.
[time=1838] That was awesome.
[time=1839] Way to go.
[time=1840] You know what he did?
[time=1841] He goes, "Man, I heard that!
[time=1842] He ran over, shook the hand and hugged the guy!
[time=1844] I'm so excited that you took that step of baptism!" And it was really cool because he's kind of a reserved guy and he was just kind of standing here and when he found out who that was, he just immediately went over and shook his hand and hugged him and said, "Thank you for doing that, that's great!" That's excitement.
[time=1862] That's what make a joyful noise means.
[time=1865] Make a joyful noise.
[time=1868] Come into his courts with singing.
[time=1871] We sing a lot of Blackhawk.
[time=1873] And I know some people who say, "Why do we sing so much?" They do.
[time=1879] Y'all know them.
[time=1880] Who does that?
[time=1881] But here's the thing.
[time=1882] The Bible says, "Come into his courts with singing." That's what he tells us.
[time=1889] Singing is so important to God.
[time=1891] He dedicated an entire book to it.
[time=1894] Plus, there are songs written from all over the Bible because God knew that singing was
[time=1900] a good thing.
[time=1902] Stop singing.
[time=1903] Singing changes your brain.
[time=1905] Did you know that?
[time=1907] Group singing has been scientifically proven to lower stress, relieve anxiety, and elevate
[time=1913] endorphins.
[time=1916] Darren did not pay me to say this.
[time=1920] Stacey Horn was writing for the Time magazine back in August 16th of 2013.
[time=1925] Listen to what she says about singing from the research.
[time=1929] When you sing, musical vibrations move through you, altering your physical and emotional landscape.
[time=1936] Group singing, for those who have done it, is the most exhilarating and transformative of all.
[time=1941] It takes something incredibly intimate, a sound that begins inside of you, shares it with a room full of people, and it becomes back to something even more thrilling, harmony.
[time=1951] So if you sit in that pew and you say, "I don't sing very well, I'm not going to sing." Here's what I got to tell you.
[time=1956] You need to stand right here one time and listen to that, because when you all sing,
[time=1964] it is a beautiful thing, and we can't tell if you sing well or don't, regardless of what
[time=1970] Darren says about trying out in three people and all that stuff he couldn't tell, okay?
[time=1975] He can't, because it all comes together and it creates this harmony that is just a beautiful
[time=1981] thing to the Lord.
[time=1982] She continues.
[time=1984] So it's not surprising that group singing is on the rise.
[time=1987] According to chorus America, 32.5 million adults singing choirs up by almost 10 million over the past six years.
[time=1993] As a popularity of group singing grows, science has been hard at work trying to explain why it has such a calming and energizing effect on people.
[time=2002] Researchers are beginning discoveries that singing is like an infusion of the perfect tranquilizer, the kind that both suges your nerves and elevates your spirits.
[time=2014] God says enter his courts with singing, because God knows what singing does to us physiologically
[time=2022] and emotionally.
[time=2024] So at the end of the service today, we're going to sing a song, it's got a little bit of hop to it, okay?
[time=2029] Praise the Lord, sing.
[time=2031] Nobody's going to judge you, whether you can sing or not, nobody's going to do that because
[time=2038] you're singing to the Lord, and that will connect your heart.
[time=2042] I get excited about that.
[time=2045] Darren, thanks for not picking me for one of those three.
[time=2049] He actually did, but Chad Burch took the hit for me, thanks, Chad.
[time=2052] Appreciate that.
[time=2053] All right, serve the Lord, chapter 100 verse two, serve the Lord with gladness.
[time=2058] Our Savior, Jesus Christ willingly gave his life for you on Calvary.
[time=2063] In the garden of Gethsemane, he said, "God, if this cup impasse before me, let's do that." And God said, "No, no, son, you're going to do this." And he willingly did that for you.
[time=2072] He willingly did that for you.
[time=2074] Use that as a filter when it comes to serving.
[time=2079] Serve out of gratitude.
[time=2082] Don't serve because it's, you have to.
[time=2084] I'm like, "Oh, I've got to go serve tonight." Man, Taverini put together this Wednesday night thing, and now I've got to go serve more kids.
[time=2091] No, serving is a blessing.
[time=2096] So ask this question, or say this in your heart when that happens.
[time=2100] Jesus, thanks for going through that horrible stuff and dying on the cross for me.
[time=2103] I'm glad to go serve.
[time=2106] Not because we want a program to be successful at Blackhawk.
[time=2109] That's not what you need to serve for.
[time=2111] You need to serve because that's an expression of your gratitude to Jesus Christ.
[time=2116] As a church, we have a responsibility to provide opportunities for you to serve so that you
[time=2122] can exercise your gifts.
[time=2124] They're like, "Well, I don't like kids.
[time=2127] I don't want to work with kids." I can't sing.
[time=2133] I don't like to sing.
[time=2134] There are other ways to serve.
[time=2137] If there's some passion you have and we don't have an opportunity for that of the church, you come see me.
[time=2142] We'll figure it out because it's our responsibility as a church to provide opportunities for you to serve.
[time=2150] Enter his gates with thanksgiving in verse 4.
[time=2153] A couple of quotes for you here, "Harry, I are inside." If you don't know him, he was a American Bible teacher, pastor, and author.
[time=2159] Some dad would like to share my favorite story about him.
[time=2161] I can't do it today.
[time=2163] But this is what he says, "We would worry less.
[time=2166] We would worry less if we praised more.
[time=2169] Thanksgiving is the enemy of discontent and dissatisfaction." Wow.
[time=2174] 19th century American evangelist and reformer Hannah Whitall Smith said, "The soul that
[time=2180] gives thanks can find comfort in everything.
[time=2185] The soul that complains can find comfort in nothing."
[time=2191] You know what I really want to do?
[time=2193] I forgot to do this, but I want to take the rock of complaining out of my pocket and drop it.
[time=2199] Remember last week?
[time=2201] Take the rock of complaining and drop it.
[time=2204] I have a challenge for you.
[time=2206] I have a challenge for you, every day for a month, pray to the Lord and truly thank Him
[time=2214] for loving you and for your salvation and for the provisions He's given you.
[time=2218] Not just, "Hey, thanks, man," but really thank Him.
[time=2222] Do that for a month and see if that doesn't change your world life view, your outlook on things.
[time=2229] I've always said there are two types of people, those who are thankful and those who complain.
[time=2236] Those who are thankful and those who complain.
[time=2238] Let us be a thankful of body because of what Jesus Christ did.
[time=2246] I believe that we can deeply and truly, be deeply and truly thankful when we understand
[time=2252] the magnitude of what Christ has done for us.
[time=2256] So join me in thought here.
[time=2258] Think of your most difficult and painful time in life, multiply it, multiply it by billions
[time=2267] and realize that being condemned to an eternity apart from Christ in the eternal lake of fire is incomprehensibly worse than that.
[time=2279] No matter what you have experienced in life, no matter how bad it's been for you, spending
[time=2285] eternity in the lake of fire apart from Jesus is incomprehensibly worse than that and you
[time=2291] would never get reprieve.
[time=2294] Some of you don't like your jobs, but you get home every day, right?
[time=2301] When you get condemned to the lake of fire because you are unrighteous or you are a wicked person or you do not accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior and you get to the judgment and you get sent to the eternity apart from Jesus, it is incomprehensibly worse than
[time=2318] anything you could ever imagine.
[time=2322] And when we understand that, then we can truly be thankful and pour out our hearts and thanks
[time=2330] giving to our Lord.
[time=2336] Know that the Lord is God and that His steadfast love endures forever.
[time=2343] Know that.
[time=2346] Own that.
[time=2347] He is God.
[time=2349] In a declining world, He is still God.
[time=2352] He's still calling the plays and He loves us and that will never change.
[time=2358] It will never change.
[time=2361] Can I get an amen?
[time=2363] I'm just training you for heaven.
[time=2367] That will never, ever change, never.
[time=2376] What are the results of being righteous?
[time=2378] If I live life righteously, what does that mean?
[time=2380] How does that look?
[time=2382] What are the results of that?
[time=2383] First of all, productivity in Psalms 1, verse 3.
[time=2387] Talk about the tree by the water, bears its fruit in season, right?
[time=2394] At my home when I grew up, just south of the house, we have a big pond, about an acre plus pond, and just up from that, probably 25 feet or so, maybe 50 feet is a great big
[time=2405] walnut tree, huge walnut tree, and it would drop walnuts all the time.
[time=2409] Why is that a big deal?
[time=2410] I had to go pick them up when I was a kid.
[time=2414] And this is how smart I am.
[time=2416] I never once thought to take gloves and I always complained about stains on my hands.
[time=2422] Every year I did that.
[time=2424] But you know what?
[time=2426] Even during the droughts, even when the ground was drying up or the fields weren't producing
[time=2432] because of the lack of rain, that tree produced tremendous amounts of walnuts because it
[time=2441] was always nourished, always nourished, because its roots would go down and it would pull from the pond and it was always nourished, no matter what was happening around it, that tree would produce, it would always be lush, it would always be green.
[time=2456] When you live a life of righteousness, that's how you are.
[time=2461] That's how you are always being productive.
[time=2463] Now it doesn't necessarily always mean material production, right?
[time=2469] You can be producing in somebody else's life through serving.
[time=2480] Prosperity in verse 3, now this is not prosperity theology.
[time=2484] This doesn't mean that if you live righteous, you're going to have a big bank account.
[time=2487] That's not what this means.
[time=2489] When a righteous person prospers, it's not for himself but for others.
[time=2494] When that walnut tree would produce walnuts, it wasn't the walnut tree never ate one walnut in all the years I lived there, ever.
[time=2504] When it produces walnuts, that was for me to pick up and get stains on my hands.
[time=2512] Or I'd go up to Rex Young's orchard where I picked up apples, all those trees of apples would drop apples on the ground or be on the tree and I'd pick them and that was for nourishment.
[time=2521] So when you prosper as a righteous person, it doesn't always mean that it's going to be financial.
[time=2527] It could mean that you are producing good in the lives of others and then receiving good
[time=2533] because that's just a real joy.
[time=2537] Benefit to others.
[time=2538] Then the last thing, you are known by the Father.
[time=2541] Look at verse 6, it says that you are known by the Father.
[time=2544] Now that word known is not I know you, like I know Darren and I know Bill and I know John.
[time=2551] That's not what that means.
[time=2552] It's a much more intimate term than that.
[time=2555] It means knows with affection and approval such as prefers.
[time=2560] God looks at you and says, I prefer that person.
[time=2564] I love that person, yeah, that's a teammate.
[time=2568] That's what that means.
[time=2570] All right, so we know what the righteous do, how about the wicked?
[time=2575] The wicked.
[time=2576] Those who live apart from God, those who are unrighteous, number one, they will not.
[time=2583] The wicked are not so but are like chaff that the wind drives away.
[time=2585] They will not be approved and that doesn't mean like you're applying for a scholarship and it doesn't get approved.
[time=2590] That means God will look at you and say, depart from me, I never knew you.
[time=2594] You are now going to the lake of fire.
[time=2597] That's what not approved means, okay?
[time=2601] Secondly, they will not be allowed in the congregation of the righteous.
[time=2607] Not be allowed in the congregation of the righteous.
[time=2608] When we talk about the congregation of the righteous, all the righteous come together.
[time=2612] That's probably a reference to the end times.
[time=2615] They don't get to be a part of that because where are the righteous going to be?
[time=2621] Where are they going to be?
[time=2623] Heaven, right?
[time=2625] Wicked don't get to do that.
[time=2627] No ticket.
[time=2631] Therefore the wicked will not stand in judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
[time=2634] And then verse six says that the wicked will perish.
[time=2637] Now we use the word perish for death.
[time=2640] It's not necessarily what it means here, it doesn't mean that they'll just die.
[time=2643] It means that they will end in destruction and spend eternity in hell.
[time=2650] That's where the unrighteous or the wicked will end up, apart from God for eternity.
[time=2657] Think about that, wow.
[time=2661] Lessons for life.
[time=2664] Number one, if you've not turned your life over to Jesus Christ, please consider that today.
[time=2671] When you accept Jesus Christ as your Savior, when you repent of your sin and turn from your wicked ways, when you do that, you become righteous.
[time=2678] Please consider that today.
[time=2681] First John 1/9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." So if I am cleansed from all unrighteousness, what do I become?
[time=2694] Righteous.
[time=2696] Please consider that today.
[time=2697] If you're a Christian, know that you are righteous through Jesus.
[time=2702] The only way it can happen.
[time=2704] When God looks at you where you see faults, He sees faultless.
[time=2709] Where you see brokenness, He sees wholeness.
[time=2712] He sees you through a lens of mercy, a filter of grace and through a veil of Jesus' blood
[time=2718] that makes you as white as snow, flawless, perfect and righteous.
[time=2724] Romans 3.22 says, "The righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ is for all who believe." If you are a Christian, know you are righteous.
[time=2736] Repeat after me if you're a Christian.
[time=2737] I am righteous because of Jesus Christ.
[time=2742] [AMEN] This looks like a dog coming up here, by the way.
[time=2748] This little shadow on the ground kind of freaks me out.
[time=2752] I got a little ADHD in me.
[time=2754] Well, a lot of it.
[time=2755] So every once in a while, I look over here and I'm thinking something's coming for me.
[time=2760] I'd like to restate, number three, avoid the wicked ways of this world.
[time=2766] Make a conscious decision.
[time=2768] I am going to step away from the wicked ways of the world.
[time=2772] If you're involved in something that's not God-honoring, say today, I'm stepping away from that.
[time=2778] I'm leaving it.
[time=2779] No more.
[time=2780] I'm living and serving for the king.
[time=2782] Proverbs 15, 9 says, "Listen to this.
[time=2785] The way of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord.
[time=2789] He loves him who pursues righteousness." Do you know what abomination means?
[time=2794] Abomination means exceptionally loathsome.
[time=2798] Not just loathsome.
[time=2800] He doesn't just loathsome, but exceptionally loathsome.
[time=2803] That's what abomination means.
[time=2805] So when we are pursuing the wicked ways of the world, we are exceptionally loathsome to God.
[time=2811] Do you want that?
[time=2813] Man, that would be a horrible epitaph on your grave marker.
[time=2818] Really loathsome to God.
[time=2821] But isn't that what all unrighteous people should have on their tombstone?
[time=2827] Avoid the wicked ways of the world.
[time=2829] Surround yourself with Christ followers.
[time=2831] You can't just walk away from something.
[time=2833] You have to replace it with something, because if you walk away from something, you're going to go back to it if you don't replace it, okay?
[time=2844] Surround yourself with Christ followers.
[time=2848] Surround yourself with...look at what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15, 33, "Do not be deceived.
[time=2854] Bad company ruins good morals or good character depending upon the translation.
[time=2860] Bad company ruins good morals.
[time=2865] Surround yourself with Christ followers.
[time=2868] Meditate on Scripture.
[time=2869] We talked about that quite a bit earlier, but Isaiah has something to say about that.
[time=2873] You keep Him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on you because He trusts you.
[time=2879] When your mind is stayed on God, then you start to experience peace.
[time=2890] When you start to feel the undercurrents and rumblings of the yuckiness of life, tune your
[time=2897] channel to God immediately, sing a song, maybe a piece of Scripture, maybe a quote, maybe
[time=2904] call a fellow Christ follower, okay?
[time=2907] Actively go after that.
[time=2915] Number six, give thanks through praising and worshiping God, not just on Sundays.
[time=2919] Fill your moments with praise.
[time=2921] Colossians 3, 17 says, "And whatever you do in word or deed, whatever you do in word or deed, whatever you do in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus,
[time=2932] giving thanks to God the Father through Him.
[time=2935] You are who you are, you are where you are, you have what you have because of God, because of Jesus Christ.
[time=2942] Recognize that in your life.
[time=2945] Number seven, be still before our great God.
[time=2947] Temptation is to put Psalm 4610 up there because I always write that on the bottom of my emails and everything correspondence.
[time=2953] I always write 4610, be still and know that I am God.
[time=2955] But take a look in 1st Samuel 12, 16, Samuel, these are his final words to the people.
[time=2961] Now therefore stand still, be still, and see this great thing that the Lord will do before
[time=2967] your eyes.
[time=2970] When we run around, we're hustle-bustling it, we oftentimes don't get to see and appreciate what God has done, rest, be still, find time to be still in your life.
[time=2983] And number eight, proclaim Him, glorify Him, give thanks to Him, bless His name and speak
[time=2992] of Him often.
[time=2995] There ought not to be a question in anybody's mind in your world, in your sphere of influence that you are a Christ follower.
[time=3002] This ought to never happen, wow, you go to church, I didn't know you went to church.
[time=3007] Do you know you went to church?
[time=3010] That should never happen.
[time=3013] People should rather look at you and say, Mike, there's something about you and I want
[time=3020] that.
[time=3022] I want that.
[time=3023] I don't know what it is about you, man, but I want that because you just reflect something
[time=3029] awesome and I want that, proclaim Jesus, glorify Him, give thanks to Him, bless His name and
[time=3037] speak of Him often.
[time=3043] I toyed with writing a conclusion today, I didn't.
[time=3049] And here's the reason I didn't because I couldn't do any better than Psalms 145.
[time=3053] So I'm going to read that to you as our conclusion today and listen to the praise and we're going
[time=3059] to sing after this.
[time=3061] Just let it cut loose and let it out.
[time=3066] This is a song of praise by David.
[time=3067] I will extol you, my God and King, and bless your name forever and ever.
[time=3072] Every day I will bless you and praise your name forever and ever.
[time=3078] David is the Lord and greatly to be praised and His greatness is unsearchable.
[time=3083] One generation shall commend your works to another and shall declare your mighty acts.
[time=3090] On the glorious splendor of your majesty and on your wondrous works I will meditate.
[time=3096] They shall speak of the might of your awesome deeds and I will declare your greatness.
[time=3101] They shall pour forth the fame of your abundant goodness and shall sing aloud of your righteousness.
[time=3108] The Lord is gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding and steadfast love.
[time=3113] The Lord is good to all and His mercy is over all that He has made.
[time=3119] All your works shall give thanks to you, O Lord, and all your saints shall bless your name.
[time=3123] They shall speak of the glory of your kingdom and tell of your power to make known to the
[time=3129] children of men your mighty deeds and the glorious splendor of your kingdom.
[time=3134] Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and your dominion endures throughout all generations.
[time=3140] The Lord is faithful in all His words and kind in all His works.
[time=3143] The Lord upholds all who are falling and raises up all who are bowed down.
[time=3148] The cries of all look to you and you give them their food and do season.
[time=3152] You open your hand and you satisfy the desire of every living thing.
[time=3156] The Lord is righteous in all His ways and kind in all His works.
[time=3160] The Lord is near to all who call on Him, to all who call Him Him in truth.
[time=3165] He fulfills the desire of those who fear Him.
[time=3169] He also hears their cry and saves them.
[time=3172] The Lord preserves all who love Him but all the wicked He will destroy.
[time=3179] My mouth will speak the praise of the Lord and let all flesh bless His holy name forever
[time=3185] and ever.
[time=3186] Let us stand and worship.
[time=3197] [MUSIC - 208 seconds]
[time=3410] Our message today was about righteousness before God.
[time=3413] Righteousness means to be right with God.
[time=3416] Within each one of us is a desire to be right with God.
[time=3419] It's very deep and deeper in other people, in some other people, but it's still there.
[time=3425] The one thing that keeps us from being right with God is sin.
[time=3429] Paul tells us in Romans 3, 23, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." The great news is that that sin that so plagues us from being right with God has been covered and forgiven by the blood of Jesus Christ on the cross at Calvary.
[time=3445] You just have to ask to receive that free gift.
[time=3450] You know, if you haven't turned your life over to Jesus Christ, we would encourage you to consider that today.
[time=3456] Listen to John 1-9.
[time=3457] If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[time=3464] Jesus will cleanse your sin and make you right with God.
[time=3469] If you'd like to talk somebody about that, talk about turning your life over to Jesus Christ, please call our church, the numbers at the bottom of your screen.
[time=3477] Please call today.
[time=3478] We would love to help you with that.
[time=3480] And if you'd like to join me, I'd like to pray for you.
[time=3483] Our Heavenly Father, thank you for this day and thank you for your son, Jesus Christ, who died on the cross to save us from our sins and make us righteous before you.
[time=3492] Please help anyone who may be watching the broadcast today, that they would like to turn their life over to you, that they can do that today and be able to spend any time with you in heaven in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3504] [MUSIC - 80 seconds]
