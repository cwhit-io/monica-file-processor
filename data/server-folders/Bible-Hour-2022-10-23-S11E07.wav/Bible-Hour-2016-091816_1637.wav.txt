[time=40] Today's Bible Hour is sponsored by the family of Hazel Dagates in honor of her 97th birthday.
[time=47] [MUSIC - 16 seconds]
[time=84] We have a very exciting service for you today for this family day.
[time=93] We're going to take just a few moments today in our service and we're going to talk about and you're going to hear stories from those whose lives have been renovated.
[time=102] The title of our message today is "Renovated" and Jesus Christ has the power and the ability to take a broken down life and to completely renovate it and to make it something brand new.
[time=114] And that's what our service is about today. So be encouraged. You're going to hear testimonies from people.
[time=120] Be encouraged that Jesus Christ can make a renovated project of your life also.
[time=126] I come from a non-Christian family but I was so blessed because I had an aunt and uncle who picked me up every Sunday and took me to church and I loved being there even though I was the only kid my age.
[time=139] And I remember at age 12 I went to the altar and I knelt and I asked Jesus to forgive me of my son and become my savior and he did that.
[time=150] And I began praying for my parents and my family to do the same.
[time=154] About a year later a Youth for Christ Bible Club came to my school and that was so exciting because I discovered other kids my age who were also interested in spiritual things and that was a great time for me.
[time=168] And I continued to pray for my parents and my family to know Jesus.
[time=172] I attended multiple events with Youth for Christ and I remember one night a speaker suggested that we commit everything we know about ourselves to everything we know about God and to do it every single day.
[time=188] And I began doing that and I noticed that my faith just grew really big and I kept praying for my parents and my family to come to know Jesus.
[time=199] And then I heard something that was kind of like you may be the only Bible someone reads.
[time=208] And I thought only goodness Lord please let my family see Jesus and me.
[time=213] And it was kind of a big pressure also.
[time=217] When Stephen and I were married we continued to pray for my family.
[time=221] And one day my dad called and he asked us to go to Butler and to visit as soon as we could.
[time=226] And so the following week we got there and dad ushered us to the kitchen and he poured coffee and he just stood there and kind of shifted from foot to foot and then he just awkwardly just blurred it out.
[time=238] Honey your mom and I have become Christians.
[time=241] And I couldn't believe it.
[time=243] We prayed for so long but I couldn't believe it.
[time=246] And I think it was because I thought if I was the Bible my dad was reading that I had to be perfect.
[time=253] But dad didn't need me to be perfect.
[time=255] He needed to find the perfect to Jesus.
[time=258] He needed to watch and he did watch as Jesus walked with us through our failures and our weaknesses.
[time=266] And also that the Lord led us to back off.
[time=272] I was constantly pressuring my dad about spiritual things and I decided it's time I just let God do it.
[time=278] I continue to try to influence others through caring and through prayer but not by trying to be God for them.
[time=288] But by surrendering day by day to the God who wants to see Jesus in us.
[time=296] Though I am tired of the struggle,
[time=306] fighting in my own strength to be like you.
[time=313] Walking unarmed into battles I never should go through
[time=321] all because I hadn't listened to you.
[time=328] So I resolved to set my eyes on you and live each day just as close as I can be.
[time=339] And I'll trust you to take care of all the things that I can see.
[time=347] So as I walk with you, will you live your life through me?
[time=353] Let the world see in me all that one can be.
[time=365] Let them see Jesus.
[time=371] Let me fade from the view till all that is left is you.
[time=380] Let them see Jesus, Jesus in me all.
[time=388] The Lord help me to surrender.
[time=392] The more that I fight, the more I feel alone.
[time=399] I can't afford to be running ahead on my road.
[time=406] On the hand in hand will we make the journey home.
[time=413] And Lord the world is wandering in darkness, blinded by master lives and misery.
[time=425] If only they could see the truth that sets them free.
[time=432] Oh Lord I pray let them see the truth in me.
[time=441] Let the world see in me all that one can be.
[time=450] Let them see Jesus.
[time=456] Let me fade from the view till all that is left is you.
[time=465] Let them see Jesus, Jesus in me.
[time=478] Let the world see in me all that one can be.
[time=487] Let them see Jesus.
[time=493] Let me fade from the view till all that is left is you.
[time=502] Let them see Jesus, Jesus in me.
[time=516] Hello, I'm Tate and this is Ali, my wife Tate and Ali studio.
[time=526] I've been here for 31 years, I'm 31 years old, so born and raised through Blackhawk.
[time=531] Whether I was attending school here or going to church here or working here, I've always been here.
[time=538] This place is like a home to me.
[time=543] I also remember praying at the foot of the bed with her and I kind of grasped what that meant then,
[time=549] but it wasn't until later through youth group here at Blackhawk and Rick Vance that I recommitted my life on November 6, 1998.
[time=557] Rick's message to us at that camp was imagine Fort Wayne as a sharpening stone and a bird comes once a year to sharpen its beak on the stone every year until it's gone.
[time=569] And he relayed to us that that's not even one day in heaven and the reverse of that is it's not even one day in hell.
[time=574] So, you know, a little scared, a little excited for what heaven could be.
[time=578] I recommitted my life with Rick there.
[time=581] So, you know, after that junior senior high school, things were going good, always involved in the youth group.
[time=588] I was working here through high school, even in a couple small groups and things were going really well.
[time=596] And then after I graduated, there wasn't too much here for me at Blackhawk.
[time=602] A lot of my friends started going away to college or switching churches or some even just stopped going.
[time=608] And I switched churches.
[time=611] I looked other places and, you know, eventually I kind of just stopped going.
[time=616] I was living a lukewarm life.
[time=618] I could tell you God the advice.
[time=622] I knew how to pray. Most people probably didn't know how, you know, my me being lukewarm.
[time=630] But, you know, in God's perfect timing, I met Ali.
[time=634] And we tried coming to Blackhawk, but due to us not really getting involved and not really trying putting any effort to it,
[time=641] we kind of fizzled out.
[time=642] But lucky for us, Ryan and Jen Mead invited us to Pine Hills.
[time=647] And we loved it with it.
[time=649] We got involved.
[time=651] But unfortunately for us, after about a year or two, they decided to leave.
[time=656] But before they left, I should back up, Pine Hills actually helped me.
[time=660] I got, God used me to lead Ali to Christ.
[time=663] And that was the most exciting thing I've ever done.
[time=666] And still this day, I just, when I think about it, I get excited.
[time=669] We were just, you know, out on the back patio and having a fire and when that all happened.
[time=674] And then shortly after that, that's when Ryan and Jen left for Denver to start a church.
[time=679] And everybody that we kind of knew through them went to Denver with them.
[time=684] So it was almost like being a stranger in our own church after that.
[time=688] And it was a constant reminder every week that our two best friends had now left.
[time=692] So we kind of gave it a go.
[time=695] And eventually we even kind of fizzled out going.
[time=698] And then Mark and Jesse Hannah had been asking me to pray about coming back.
[time=705] And I wasn't feeling it too much.
[time=707] I was here every day of the week anyways.
[time=709] And Ali said, you know, Tate, I feel like we need to go back to Blackhawk.
[time=714] And we need to do it differently.
[time=715] We need to sit down low.
[time=717] We need to get involved.
[time=719] And she certainly did that.
[time=722] So we came back and she got into choir.
[time=725] And we eventually invited two of our really good friends.
[time=729] Mandy and Reese come with us and that has been a huge blessing for us to be a part of their journey.
[time=735] They were going through some rough times.
[time=737] And, you know, they're getting through it.
[time=740] And we get to be a little bit a part of that.
[time=742] And just to see their growth has really excited me.
[time=745] And just coming back to Blackhawk, seeing Ali get involved, doing a couple of ministry things.
[time=752] I volunteered to help paint the restrooms.
[time=756] And I'm not bragging on myself.
[time=758] If you get involved in this church, it grows you as a person, as a Christian.
[time=763] And through all of that, this is what has led me to wanting to take this step of obedience by baptism.
[time=770] So that's really kind of why I did it.
[time=773] And it was a long time coming, but I guess better late than never.
[time=776] Tate told part of my story there.
[time=780] So that'll help speed this up a bit, I suppose.
[time=783] I had never, my whole life, been in church, anything like that.
[time=787] My parents never took us, never made it a priority.
[time=791] Pretty much the only teaching I had was from Mrs. Beer in a little trailer in the parking lot of Lincoln Elementary School.
[time=798] One day we would walk out there, rain or shine, and go to religious ed in this little trailer.
[time=804] And right about that same time, fourth grade is when it started.
[time=808] I found choir, and I was part of choir at Lincoln.
[time=811] And then that love grew for choir all the way through high school.
[time=816] Never really went back to church.
[time=818] Never was really part of anything. My life was really show choir until I graduated high school.
[time=824] And I absolutely loved it, and I could tell that there was something special there, but it wasn't always, it was always a priority, more so than other things in my life.
[time=835] And, you know, I did a lot on my own. I moved out right when I turned 18.
[time=840] I got apartment after apartment, and then I finally built the house, and I became very independent.
[time=846] Everyone asked me, "Why are you building a house by yourself? Why do you need that? It's just you?" I had no answer, but then I met Tate.
[time=854] So, when date I met, we started at Black Hawk for a while.
[time=857] It really wasn't a good fit then for us. We weren't involved. We didn't do much.
[time=862] And then, Ryan and Jen asked us to go to Pine Hills, and that was life-changing for me.
[time=868] And it was just a normal night. In July, two years ago, we were sitting out by our fire and just talking.
[time=875] And I decided, like, that was my moment. That's when I was ready.
[time=879] And since then, things have not been easy, but it will never be easy. You have to work at it.
[time=886] And by God's grace, I have grown so much.
[time=892] We started coming back to Black Hawk in the end of February, and shortly after that started choir, that was my moment where I had my first practice.
[time=901] I came home, and, like, a missing piece of the puzzle had been fit.
[time=906] I felt like, finally, I knew why I had that love required. It was to worship the Lord.
[time=911] There's no other reason for it. That's what it is.
[time=915] And taking the step of baptism was just one more thing to complete my story.
[time=921] And it's just the beginning. It's just another chapter, and I'm ready to embark on it.
[time=927] I'm Stephanie Bisser. We moved to the Fort Wayne area in the summer of 2012.
[time=933] It was the year that had everyone talking of the severe drought.
[time=937] Having lived in the deserts of Southeastern New Mexico for the past 18 years, it didn't look like a severe drought to us.
[time=944] In fact, we joked in our family that it actually looked like the Garden of Eden compared to what we were used to in the barren deserts of Roswell, New Mexico.
[time=955] But the corn crop that year told a different story.
[time=959] When we would drive through the fields out to the farm, we'd drive past the miles of the stented dry plants, and they showed the real effects of the lack of rain.
[time=972] Blackhawk Christian School was a big reason why we moved to this area. We had enrolled our kids here, and so we figured we'd start our church search at Blackhawk Ministries,
[time=983] hoping that our kids could meet some classmates before the school year began, and it became like home instantly.
[time=992] So much so that we went to the Welcome to Blackhawk gathering within the first few weeks, and then that fall we picked up a membership packet and read over it.
[time=1004] And in all honesty, the hesitation for me was the baptism requirement. I'd been baptized as an infant, and I attended Christian schools my entire life, and had gone to church my entire life, and that's what stopped me from membership.
[time=1022] So we just attended. Looking closely, I had to admit the effects of the lack of living water in my life.
[time=1031] There was fruit, but when you grow fruit apart from scripture, it can manifest itself in self-righteousness, a critical spirit, and a judgmental heart, just to name a few of the things.
[time=1046] I'd worked hard to be a law follower my whole life, and we were invited to be in a small group, and that year, and John Bars was leading it with his wife Katie, and we went through Romans.
[time=1061] I remember reading Romans 3, 20. Therefore, no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law. Rather, through the law, we become conscious of sin.
[time=1076] And then he referenced Galatians that a man is not justified by observing the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ, and the law was actually put in charge to lead us to Christ that we might be justified by faith.
[time=1091] I'd spent many years hoping that God graded on a heavenly curve. I knew I couldn't attain perfection, but I tried really hard, and hoped really hard, that I would be good enough, or that I would even be better than you can just fill in the blank.
[time=1113] So, week after week from that point, I would sit, I would stand as we read, and I would sit in the pews for the next 45 minutes, just soaking in the truth.
[time=1125] That was faithfully and truthfully proclaimed here in this place.
[time=1130] John Ten Ten says, "The thief comes only to kill still and destroy, but I have come that you would have life and have it to the full."
[time=1142] In my experience, the most fullness of living comes in living with an open Bible.
[time=1150] So, with the fall of 2013 came news that my dad had fourth stage cancer of his liver and lungs.
[time=1168] That would certainly be a health crisis or a health drought. He proclaimed to be a flood, one of God's grace, and God's mercy.
[time=1181] One of my dad's favorite verses was a familiar one. It was Jeremiah 2911, and I'm sure some of you, most all of you know it.
[time=1191] For I know the plans I have for you declares the Lord plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope in the future.
[time=1197] I love Jeremiah 2911, but I fell in love even more with the words that follow that.
[time=1204] It says, "Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all of your heart.
[time=1214] I will be found by you," declares the Lord.
[time=1218] So, in that time, I called. We called as a family. We prayed. We were seekers and still are, and we found God's faithfulness and God's mercy.
[time=1233] And we found that flood that he had declared.
[time=1238] So I guess all this to say and all quote are famous and beloved Romanian theologian.
[time=1247] In my humble, yet correct opinion, it is necessary for me to be rebaptized.
[time=1253] And it's with joy and with great privilege that I'll be part of that baptism here at Black Hawk on September 11.
[time=1263] But me, he is Lord, he is Lord, he is risen from the day, and he is Lord.
[time=1293] Every knee shall bow, every tongue confess, that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=1317] Father, thank you for the privilege of bowing our knee and declaring that Jesus is Lord while we still have life and breath while we still live on this planet.
[time=1331] Thank you for the privilege. Thank you for drawing us to yourself and revealing to us the truth of who you are and of who Jesus is.
[time=1340] Thank you for the privilege of belonging to you. Thank you for giving us your spirit who resides in us.
[time=1347] And Father, I pray that each of us, daily, more and more, will be aware of your constant presence in us.
[time=1359] The empowering of your spirit through us to rise above beyond all of our limitations, even the gifts that you've given us, even our strengths.
[time=1370] But Lord, we want to be conscious of your presence doing what only you can do.
[time=1378] I pray that you will help us to fill our vision, our eyesight with Jesus.
[time=1387] Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[time=1396] Lord, fall in His wonderful face, and the things of earth will grow strangely dear.
[time=1417] In the light of His glory and grace, turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[time=1438] Look, fall in His wonderful face, and the things of earth will grow strangely dear.
[time=1460] In the light of His glory and grace.
[time=1474] Proverbs says, "A man plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps."
[time=1481] Recently, that really hit true in my life.
[time=1485] I went for a regular scheduled mammogram. I do it every year.
[time=1490] When I got there, she said, "Now, do you want the 3D mammogram or the regular?"
[time=1496] And I'm like, "Well, the 3D is better, correct?" And she said, "Yeah."
[time=1503] And I said, "Fine, let's just do that." And she said, "Okay, that'll be $60."
[time=1509] And I'm like, "I never paid $60 before, so I don't think I did have the 3D mammogram."
[time=1517] She said, "Well, let me check. Maybe you did." Insurance was paying for it last year, but this year they're not.
[time=1524] So she came back and said, "You know, you did have the 3D last year."
[time=1530] And I was thinking, "Okay, I don't have breast cancer. Nobody in my family has breast cancer."
[time=1538] And while I was thinking these thoughts and just getting ready to say no, a thought imploded in my mind that was not my own and said, "What you really want is comparison." And I was so shocked by the whole thing.
[time=1552] I looked at her and said, "You know, what I really want is comparison." So I got the 3D.
[time=1560] During the mammogram, she kept saying the radiologist wanted to see another view,
[time=1566] was having trouble, so I got several different views.
[time=1570] And I wasn't even that concerned about it because sometimes there's a shadow or something like that.
[time=1576] But when she came back and said, "The radiologist now wants an ultrasound," it was a little unnerving.
[time=1584] So we went and did that.
[time=1586] Then the radiologist came in and he said, "Lori, I see a growth that wasn't there last year."
[time=1595] It looks like it could have some properties of cancer.
[time=1599] But we really won't know until we take the biopsy.
[time=1603] But I do want to tell you this.
[time=1606] I want to thank you for getting the 3D mammogram because if you hadn't,
[time=1612] I'm not sure we would have ever seen it on the regular mammogram.
[time=1616] And as fast as this is growing, you wouldn't want that to grow for a whole year.
[time=1623] Well, I was completely unnerved.
[time=1626] I couldn't hardly get my breath.
[time=1628] I'm like, "Oh, I have cancer. Surely this couldn't be." So we were to get a biopsy to make sure.
[time=1636] And of course, I kept praying that God's will would be done, but I would prefer that it not be cancer.
[time=1643] Well, when the results came back, I had fear and anxiety and guilt and shame.
[time=1650] All the things that you get when you find out that you have cancer.
[time=1655] But that's not the end of the story.
[time=1658] He did direct my steps and he has provided for me good care.
[time=1663] And it was found early.
[time=1666] And all I can say is that he has been faithful and true to me all the way.
[time=1672] I wouldn't want to walk this path without him.
[time=1675] The Bible says in the New Testament that he abides with us and walks with us and we with him.
[time=1682] And this is an example of how that really happened for me.
[time=1705] But you're pleased in that I'm never alone.
[time=1711] You're a good good father.
[time=1714] It's who you are.
[time=1720] And I'm loved by you.
[time=1722] It's who I am.
[time=1730] Oh and I've seen many searching for answers far and wide.
[time=1739] But I know we're all searching for answers.
[time=1745] Only you prove I 'cause you know just what we need before we say a word.
[time=1756] You're a good good father.
[time=1759] It's who you are.
[time=1765] And I'm loved by you.
[time=1767] It's who I am.
[time=1773] You are perfect in all of your ways.
[time=1806] Oh this love so undeniable I can hardly speak.
[time=1815] Please so unexplainable I can hardly think as you call me.
[time=1825] Deeper still as you call me.
[time=1833] Deeper still into love.
[time=1836] Love love.
[time=1839] You're a good good father.
[time=1842] It's who you are.
[time=1848] And I'm loved by you.
[time=1850] It's who I am.
[time=1856] You're a good good father.
[time=1858] It's who you are.
[time=1864] And I'm loved by you.
[time=1866] It's who I am.
[time=1872] You're a good good father.
[time=1874] It's who you are.
[time=1880] And I'm loved by you.
[time=1882] You're perfect in all of your ways.
[time=1884] It's who I am.
[time=1888] You're a good good father.
[time=1890] It's who you are.
[time=1896] And I'm loved by you.
[time=1898] It's who I am.
[time=1920] God is a good good father.
[time=1922] And the team, we decided that I would share my path to Christ with you today.
[time=1930] And I only do that for two reasons.
[time=1932] One is to teach and the second is to encourage.
[time=1935] I have spoken this, what I'm going to share with you, to many high schools, junior highs, FCA groups and youth groups.
[time=1943] And even church groups.
[time=1945] But I've never done it with my own family.
[time=1947] So here's what I want to tell you.
[time=1949] When I'm done, often times people will come up and say something to me like, "I'm so sorry that happened to you.
[time=1956] I'm so sorry." Please understand that's not what today is for.
[time=1960] So please don't do that today.
[time=1962] I'm going to share what God has brought me out of with you.
[time=1966] It is for glorifying him and giving him the praise and the glory.
[time=1971] So if you'll extend that to me, please don't do that today.
[time=1975] God is a good good father.
[time=1977] The message today is entitled "Renovated." I don't know if you've ever watched a show called "Fixer Upper." Have you seen that show?
[time=1986] That's a show that's done on television and Chipping Goanna Gaines are a part of that.
[time=1991] And they take old, dilapidated houses.
[time=1993] We might have a picture of one for you.
[time=1995] My favorite one is "Pau Paz House." I don't know if you're familiar or that or not.
[time=1999] But "Pau Paz House," that's what it looked like when they got a hold of it.
[time=2003] And when they went through it, I mean, the floors, the holes in the floor, the place is destroyed on the inside.
[time=2010] Most people would look at that and say, "Just knock it down." And as a matter of fact, Chipping Goanna thought the very same thing.
[time=2016] But the owners, they really wanted to redo that house.
[time=2019] And so Chipping Joanna renovated that house.
[time=2022] And we have a picture of the finished product there.
[time=2025] It is beautiful.
[time=2026] It is beautiful. Inside is so appealing and so beautiful.
[time=2030] And it hardly even looks like the same structure.
[time=2033] And oftentimes people will say, "It's not the same house." Well, it's kind of the same house.
[time=2039] It's got the same footprint for the most part.
[time=2041] But it's been completely renovated.
[time=2045] And that's what Jesus Christ can do in our hearts today.
[time=2047] We've heard stories about that renovation.
[time=2049] Okay?
[time=2050] And oftentimes people, we come into churches and we say, "Well, I'm not good enough for God." Let's take a look at Matthew 1.
[time=2056] And Matthew 1, and I'm not going to read this to you, but it is the genealogy of Jesus Christ.
[time=2062] The history of His family.
[time=2064] And I hope we have it.
[time=2066] Did we put that up there?
[time=2067] I think we did.
[time=2068] There are a lot of characters in Jesus' family.
[time=2071] The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ.
[time=2073] I'm not going to read it to you, but if you take a look down through there, I've highlighted a few names.
[time=2076] First there's Abraham.
[time=2078] Abraham, of course, is considered the father Abraham.
[time=2082] God told him that he was going to give him a son through his wife Sarah.
[time=2086] Abraham wasn't patient.
[time=2087] And you know what?
[time=2088] Abraham did.
[time=2089] We all know this.
[time=2090] Him and his wife got together and they developed a plan.
[time=2092] And Abraham had a child through Sarah's maidservant.
[time=2096] He didn't.
[time=2097] He needed to help God out.
[time=2098] That's what he thought.
[time=2099] He's in the genealogy.
[time=2101] Then there's Jacob.
[time=2102] Jacob lied to his dad, tricked his dad, and stole his birthmark, birth that right from his brother.
[time=2109] So that's not a good behavior.
[time=2110] That's what Jacob did.
[time=2111] And then there's Judah.
[time=2114] Judah had a son, and the son got married to Tamar.
[time=2119] Tamar is the next one there.
[time=2121] And Judah and Tamar got together.
[time=2124] Okay?
[time=2125] Tamar became a pain to herself up as a prostitute.
[time=2128] And then she got Judah drunk, tricked him, and they had children.
[time=2131] Okay?
[time=2132] So that's another person that is in Jesus' genealogy.
[time=2135] Then we have Rahab.
[time=2136] Rahab was a harlot.
[time=2138] That's a prostitute.
[time=2139] Then we have Ruth.
[time=2141] Ruth was not even an Israelite.
[time=2143] She was a Moabite and worshipped idols.
[time=2146] Then, of course, we have David.
[time=2148] And we all know David.
[time=2149] David committed adultery with Bathsheba.
[time=2152] And David actually murdered someone.
[time=2154] He murdered Uriah.
[time=2156] You'll notice Bathsheba's name is there, but kind of.
[time=2159] It says, "By the wife of Uriah," that's Bathsheba.
[time=2162] They are in the lineage.
[time=2164] There are good people.
[time=2165] Jehassafat was, he was kind of a good guy, so that's a good thing.
[time=2168] And let's move to the next one.
[time=2170] I think there's one more slide here.
[time=2172] Manasseh.
[time=2173] Manasseh, just, I mean, one of the writers said he's just a personification of evil.
[time=2177] And these people were in Jesus' lineage, so they were good people and they were evil, bad people.
[time=2183] And that tells us that Jesus can use anybody in any state that he wants to to do amazing things.
[time=2190] Because that's what he did.
[time=2191] He brought through that lineage his son, Jesus Christ.
[time=2197] And we have one more verse up here.
[time=2200] 2 Corinthians 5 verse 17 is the verse that we're going to focus on today.
[time=2205] And that, it tells us that all things, old thing, the old, therefore, if anyone is in Christ, if you're saved, if you're saved, he's a new creation.
[time=2213] The old is passed away, and behold, the new has come.
[time=2217] I was born in 1964 in Portland, Maine.
[time=2221] I was, at that time, the youngest of three boys.
[time=2224] Shortly after that, my mother and father divorced and my mother married another man, and within two months had another child.
[time=2231] And I was the middle, ultimately, the middle child of two older full brothers and two younger half sisters.
[time=2238] Of those five children, I was the only one that was given away for adoption.
[time=2242] How many of you know somebody who's adopted?
[time=2248] How many of you know somebody who's been adopted three times?
[time=2252] You now know somebody who's been adopted three times.
[time=2255] I was given up for adoption.
[time=2257] I was the only one of five children.
[time=2259] The reason I was given up for adoption is because I was a violent, destructive and pretty mean, aggressive child.
[time=2267] Don't really know why, why those things happened.
[time=2270] I'm going to share some stories so that you will understand when I say that I was this way.
[time=2276] I can recall waking up in the middle of the night, running through the house.
[time=2280] I required just minimal sleep, running through the house and destroying things.
[time=2284] I would climb up in the bathroom on the sink, and we used to have vanities with the doors on them, and I would hang on the door until it broke off the wall.
[time=2290] And then I would take everything out of it, make up and things, and I'd paint the walls in the bathroom.
[time=2295] I was always, for a little guy, I was always fairly strong for that age.
[time=2301] I took a chair and beat against the wall until the wall busted, busted through the plaster.
[time=2309] In our house, just outside there was a playground.
[time=2312] We must have lived near a park, and I could still recall being on the playground.
[time=2316] My older brother would be on the teeter totter with me, and you know that trick where you'd get on the bottom, and you'd jump off and they'd fall down.
[time=2323] I would do that all the time.
[time=2324] I would knock kids off swings.
[time=2326] I would get in fights on the playground.
[time=2329] And I would be banished to the attic of our home, and I would be upstairs in the attic, and I'd be looking out the window wondering why I couldn't be on the playground.
[time=2338] Probably a couple of the worst things that made my parents decide that they didn't want me anymore
[time=2344] was I had a little sister and a high chair, and my mother would always stand at the door jam, and she would be leaning against the wall, talking on the phone, drinking a bottle of Pepsi.
[time=2352] Kids, phones used to have cords on them, so you couldn't wander.
[time=2355] She would stand there, and she would drink a bottle of Pepsi, and the bottles were always glass at that time if you recall,
[time=2361] and she would set it down on the high chair.
[time=2364] And it was always fascinating, and I've always been a very ethereal person mentally.
[time=2368] I would always think and try to process and try to figure things out.
[time=2371] So I ran over to the high chair, and I would take the high chair with both hands, and I would tilt it.
[time=2375] And then I would tilt it until it would fall down, and I would study how long that pop bottle would stay connected to that tray.
[time=2380] That was important to me.
[time=2381] What was not important to me is that my little sister was in that chair, and I would do that on a number of occasions.
[time=2387] My older brother and I, we would get in tremendous fights, and even though he was a year older,
[time=2394] I was much more aggressive than he, and one time I took a curtain rod.
[time=2399] I think it was a shower curtain rod, and I shoved it in his throat because I wanted to win, win the battle.
[time=2407] There were some other things that happened in that home that are kind of difficult to share, and so we won't do that today.
[time=2415] But at some point in time, my mother decided I could no longer live there.
[time=2419] And so of the five children, I was the only one that was given away for adoption.
[time=2423] I spent some time in adoption.
[time=2426] I was in 15 school districts from kindergarten to third grade, and I skipped first grade.
[time=2432] That's an interesting story.
[time=2434] When I was young, I was very street smart.
[time=2437] When you live on the streets, because I spent some time on the streets, you could become street smart.
[time=2442] And I was sitting at the school, I remember this is kind of funny, my foster mother was taking me to school to enroll me, but I had bumped around to so many schools so long and so fast that the records couldn't keep up, right?
[time=2451] You know, they couldn't keep up because one of the schools was in Texas, and if you try to get records from Texas, it can take six months.
[time=2457] And so I was there, and I was sitting in the front of the school, and I heard the secretary say to the foster mother,
[time=2464] "Well, just ask him, he'll tell you what grade he's supposed to be in." And I had just finished kindergarten, so she came over to me and she got down in front of me and said, "Rich, now what grade are you supposed to be in?" Second.
[time=2476] And so if you check out my transcripts, it has all these beautiful report cards in kindergarten and second,
[time=2482] third, and fourth grade, and in first grade it says P.
[time=2485] That's all it says on there.
[time=2487] So I moved on it, but I was gifted academically, so they didn't move me back when they finally got my records,
[time=2494] so that's how I completely skipped first grade.
[time=2497] I finally went into foster care, and that was difficult.
[time=2503] The abuses were phenomenal.
[time=2506] I have been beaten with boards.
[time=2508] I've been beaten with wooden spoons in bulk.
[time=2512] I've been beaten with chains, garden hoses, a chair.
[time=2517] I was assaulted with a car.
[time=2520] I have been pushed down flights of stairs, shoved down flights of stairs, and at least one of the flights was cement.
[time=2528] That didn't feel so good.
[time=2529] You don't bounce very well.
[time=2531] There's no give when you're going down those stairs.
[time=2534] One time I was a father who just absolutely hated me,
[time=2540] threw me into the side of a table, and I got a cut about in here.
[time=2544] And now that life has pulled my hair back for me, it's starting to show.
[time=2548] And I bled everywhere, if you've ever been hitting the head or had a haircut,
[time=2554] you know that that happens.
[time=2556] The mother was screaming, "We've got to get him to the hospital.
[time=2560] We've got to get him to the hospital." And the father said, "I'm not spending a dime on that, such and such and such and such." So they just put tape over it, and eventually it did stop bleeding.
[time=2573] They shoved me in it.
[time=2574] They put me in a trash compactor, and they turned it on.
[time=2577] And somebody, I'm guessing the mother, got guilty, felt a guilty conscience,
[time=2584] and screamed, and they finally shut the trash compactor off and took me out.
[time=2588] I do have sustained back issues because of that, even today at 52.
[time=2595] And then I got mean, and then I got violent.
[time=2599] One of the foster homes I went to, we walked up to the door and knocked on the door.
[time=2603] The door opened, and there's mom and dad, daughter and son.
[time=2607] And the son was approximately my age, and he stuck his tongue out at me.
[time=2612] Apparently didn't want me there.
[time=2613] And so I just, this here, and I just nailed him, knocked him down.
[time=2619] Social workers said, "This is probably not going to work.
[time=2621] I'm going to take him back." And so off we went.
[time=2627] One of the foster homes that I was, it was particularly violent.
[time=2632] I ran away 14 times, and I know that I ran away 14 times, because the father screamed at the social worker, and he said, "This is the 14th time he's run away." The reason I would run away is because I was constantly abused in that family, beaten.
[time=2647] And I would run away because I knew, at least for that time, I could have peace.
[time=2652] I was approximately six years old at the time.
[time=2656] And I was running, and one time I ran away, and I specifically remember this one, and the reason I ran away was because we had had spaghetti for supper, and I love spaghetti.
[time=2667] But I was required to get up at four o'clock in the morning at the age of six and do work that a six-year-old shouldn't have to do ever, let alone at four o'clock in the morning.
[time=2678] And then I would be kept up really late.
[time=2680] I was kind of a slave, and so I was just really tired, and I fell asleep in my spaghetti.
[time=2686] And the father just blew a head gasket and started hitting and beating, and all that, and I said, "I'm leaving." And I just ran out the door, and I ran away.
[time=2694] And I knew they'd find me, I knew that, and I knew I'd get beat again, but I knew for that moment in time I'd be okay.
[time=2699] And so I'm running, and I sat down behind this garden woodshed, and I was looking up in the sky at the age of six, and I see stars, and I see a bright, clear sky, and I said to myself, "I can remember it as sure as I am standing here today." I said, "There's got to be more to this.
[time=2714] This can't be everything.
[time=2716] People can't live this way.
[time=2719] There's got to be someone up there." And I believe that's the day, the moment when God revealed himself to me.
[time=2727] I didn't know his name.
[time=2729] I didn't know anything about him.
[time=2730] I just knew he had to be there, because he was there at that moment.
[time=2735] All of our politically correct people in our culture were not there at that moment, but God was there.
[time=2741] I was brought back to the family.
[time=2743] They finally found me.
[time=2745] The beatings continued.
[time=2746] The social workers would come over and people would say, "Well, why didn't you tell the social workers?" Well, they didn't believe me when I would tell them.
[time=2754] Unless I got a really bad bruise.
[time=2756] And here's the sad thing.
[time=2758] I don't bruise.
[time=2759] Is anybody else in the room that doesn't bruise?
[time=2761] I don't bruise.
[time=2762] And so it was really hard for them to understand.
[time=2766] The last straw in that house was, I was outside, and I don't know who did it because I wasn't.
[time=2773] You'll understand why I didn't know who did it.
[time=2775] But somebody came up behind me with a big rock and smashed me in the head right here and knocked me out.
[time=2781] I still have a flat spot on my head up here.
[time=2784] Kind of funny, though.
[time=2785] When my kids were little, I lay on the floor.
[time=2787] They'd roll dice on my head.
[time=2789] So that was kind of cool.
[time=2792] But I was knocked out and I didn't come back for a while.
[time=2799] And when I finally did, I think the mother decided at that point in time that we probably need to stop this, so that's when the social worker came and took me out of that particular home.
[time=2809] And I still continue to be violent.
[time=2814] I was in two gang feeder programs.
[time=2817] Do you know what a gang feeder program is?
[time=2819] I moved in to Port Huron, Michigan, was one of the places.
[time=2822] And a gang feeder program is they'll take little kids that are five, six, seven, eight years old and they'll try to indoctrinate them into what the gang wants to do.
[time=2831] And that way, when they grow up, they're connected.
[time=2833] And I was in up two of those.
[time=2835] And the one in Port Huron, Michigan, I recall one of the things that we had to do is we had to vandalize a school.
[time=2841] So we went and we were throwing rocks, busting windows, hitting the windows with bats and things like that.
[time=2847] And so that was when the police came.
[time=2852] Several times when I was little, but the police came.
[time=2854] And this was a family that probably was higher enough on the social ladder that the police coming to their house is not a good thing.
[time=2862] And so that went, that I stopped living there.
[time=2867] They were no more.
[time=2869] The last foster home that I was in, well, the second-class foster home I was in.
[time=2874] And like I said, I became violent.
[time=2876] I learned to gamble.
[time=2877] And so I would hustle kids on the bus to steal their money because the social working, the way that foster care works is that you get money to foster a child and you're supposed to spend the money on the child.
[time=2888] I never once had a school lunch in my foster existence.
[time=2892] I never once had school lunch.
[time=2894] And so I would learn to gamble and hustle kids and steal their money
[time=2900] so I could eat lunch because that was only meal that I would get often.
[time=2904] I mean, I would eat once in a while, but not real often.
[time=2907] And so that's, I figured the eating thing out.
[time=2910] So I'm all good there.
[time=2912] But probably one of the things that just breaks my heart to give you an idea of where I was.
[time=2920] I was in one of my foster homes right near the end and this sweet lady was a foster mother.
[time=2926] And I was playing with Silly Putty.
[time=2928] How many of you remember Silly Putty?
[time=2930] It's a great thing.
[time=2931] And I was seven years old at the time and I take the Silly Putty and you spread it out over a newspaper and peel it up and it would transfer the image.
[time=2937] And that was so exciting.
[time=2938] Wasn't that fun?
[time=2939] That was fun to do.
[time=2940] And I was always, always thinking.
[time=2942] So I'm like, how does that work?
[time=2944] Well, while I was doing it, she stole it from me.
[time=2947] She took it from me.
[time=2948] I don't know why I probably deserved it.
[time=2949] She took it from me and off we went.
[time=2951] And I started screaming.
[time=2952] I said, I want it back.
[time=2953] And she said, no.
[time=2954] And I started to chase her.
[time=2955] Now I'm seven.
[time=2956] She's a grown adult.
[time=2957] I started to chase her and knocked her down.
[time=2962] And I took a belt and I beat her until she gave it back to me.
[time=2966] That's the state that I was in.
[time=2969] As a child.
[time=2971] Mom and Dad came and got me in 1972, July 22nd.
[time=2974] It was right after this event it occurred.
[time=2977] And they were going to adopt me.
[time=2978] Mom and Dad, my dad was here last week.
[time=2980] He's an awesome guy.
[time=2981] And they were going to adopt me.
[time=2983] And the social worker said, I don't think we want you to let you have him.
[time=2986] And they said, well, why not?
[time=2988] My dad's a marine.
[time=2989] My mom's an Irish farm girl, right?
[time=2991] And they said, you have another son.
[time=2993] And my mom said, he's three years older.
[time=2997] And the social worker said, you have no idea what this kid can do.
[time=3000] And I'm concerned for your other child's safety.
[time=3003] That's who I had become because of the existence of the way things that happened in all of the abuses.
[time=3011] In my very last foster home, my very last one will be the one thing that will always remind,
[time=3018] I will never forget.
[time=3019] All of those other things getting hit with this and hit with that and knocked down here and all of this.
[time=3024] That stuff goes away, but you know what never healed was the time when my last foster mother knocked me down on the ground.
[time=3031] She was a big lady.
[time=3032] She knocked me down on the ground.
[time=3033] And she just started kicking me and screaming, I hate you.
[time=3036] I hate you.
[time=3040] And would kick and kick and kick and kick to the point that I would curl up in the fetal position and just try to get through it.
[time=3045] Just try to get through it.
[time=3046] And those are the things that still resonate with me in my mind.
[time=3051] I got out of that foster home mom and dad, adopted me in 1972.
[time=3055] They're great people and they fought the battles and we went through things together.
[time=3060] And I played baseball and that was, you know what I learned in baseball?
[time=3064] If you hit something really hard in baseball, that's a good thing.
[time=3067] And so that's why baseball has always been really important to me because if you hit a school window or you hit another child or another adult,
[time=3075] they don't like that.
[time=3076] But if you hit a baseball really hard, they praise you and pat you on the back and so that's what I did.
[time=3080] All that time, I was eight years old when mom and dad adopted me.
[time=3086] And eight years old and I didn't even know.
[time=3090] By the way, I didn't know how old I was.
[time=3092] And one day mom and dad, they get in the car and we drive to Myers up in Michigan.
[time=3097] Myers started up there so it's been there a long time.
[time=3099] And they say, "You sit out here." So I'm sitting out in the front of Myers and mom and dad and my brother Randy go into the store and they buy stuff.
[time=3105] I don't know what they're doing and they come out and they cash out and they take me home.
[time=3109] And they sit me down in the kitchen table and they say, "We sorry, we didn't know today was your birthday."
[time=3115] I had no idea what birthday was.
[time=3117] I had never gotten a birthday present.
[time=3120] Never seen any of those kind of things.
[time=3122] So mom and dad created some normalcy in my life.
[time=3126] And all of a sudden we're doing things that normal families do and I had never done that before, including going to church.
[time=3133] I had a couple of other church experiences earlier, but we went to church and it was a beautiful thing.
[time=3138] I learned who Jesus was and I finally knew what his name was.
[time=3142] I finally knew who he was.
[time=3144] And so I accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as my Savior and I was baptized on June 3rd, 1973.
[time=3150] And so that was exciting.
[time=3152] Now my personality had already been developed.
[time=3156] So it wasn't still good.
[time=3157] I still fought a lot during school, mostly with kids, no adults anymore.
[time=3162] I fought a lot.
[time=3163] And then on April 17th, 1982, and I'm running out of time.
[time=3168] So April 17th, 1982, I was in youth group.
[time=3173] Dick Baldwin was my youth director and Dick said, "I want you to write your testimony down." And so I sat down and I'm ready to go because I had been a leader in youth group, not just a 10 in a tender.
[time=3181] I was a leader.
[time=3182] And I sat down and I didn't have a testimony because even though I knew Jesus and I loved him and I had been saved and I truly believed I was saved,
[time=3190] I was not living for him.
[time=3194] And so on April 17th, 1982, I rededicated my heart and life to Jesus Christ and I said, "I'm going to live for you, Jesus."
[time=3200] Went away to college, went to a Bible college, got a degree in mathematics and secondary education.
[time=3207] I also have a Bible degree and life got just renovated me.
[time=3214] I don't have an angry bone in my body.
[time=3218] People call me a big teddy bear.
[time=3221] I don't think I'm ever mean.
[time=3224] I don't hit people.
[time=3227] I don't do any of that stuff because Jesus completely changed me.
[time=3231] Just like Chippin' Joanna changed Pawpaw's house.
[time=3234] Jesus Christ changed who I am and who I was.
[time=3238] If I were to go back and talk to some of those other people, I think they probably wouldn't even answer the door.
[time=3244] I wish I could meet that little boy that I hit.
[time=3246] I would love to apologize.
[time=3248] I wish I could talk to the mother that I beat and some other things I didn't share with you, but I can't.
[time=3253] So I just have to leave that in Jesus Christ's hands.
[time=3256] But ladies and gentlemen, I'm standing before you telling you that Jesus Christ can renovate your life completely.
[time=3263] And it's only because of Jesus Christ.
[time=3265] It's not because of some politically correct who said this and who did what.
[time=3270] None of that changed me.
[time=3272] If that was what I had relied on, I would have never changed, and I would have been, like my teacher said,
[time=3279] I would have been in prison because that's where they thought I was headed.
[time=3285] But Jesus changed me.
[time=3288] He used other people, Mrs. Pack was my middle school math teacher, and they started a new math program, and I was going to be in it because I was really intelligent in math.
[time=3296] And she gave us this packet, and this will be my last story, but she gave me this packet, and I looked at the packet and I'm like, "What's this for?" She goes, "Well, Rich, we're starting a new math program, and we think you're really good at math.
[time=3307] Nobody had ever told me, ever told me, ever told me that I was good at anything." I looked at her and I thought, "Well, that's kind of strange." So I took the packet home and I laid it on my desk and said, "I'm too good to math.
[time=3317] I don't need to do that packet. If they want me in that math class, by golly, they'll just put me right in it." Went to school the next day, Mrs. Pack said, "You get it done. No, I'm not doing it." A few days go by, and all of a sudden all my friends, some of my classmates are gone.
[time=3330] Mrs. Pack, where'd they go? "Well, they went to the math class.
[time=3332] I want to be in the math class. You didn't do the packet." So I'm at home and I got sent to my room. I don't know why. I'm sure I deserved it, but I'm sitting up there. I'm walling all over the bed and all over the desk and everything because ADHD kids do those kind of things.
[time=3344] And so I'm sitting there and I see that packet and I thought, "Oh, I'm good at math like math.
[time=3347] Do that." So I did it.
[time=3349] Took it in and gave it to Mrs. Pack and triumphant said, "Here, I did it." Mrs. Pack said, "Thank you." The next day, I guess where I went to the math class.
[time=3357] And here is one of the most life-changing moments for me that ever happened.
[time=3363] I walk into the math class. I'm a sixth grader. I walk into the math class.
[time=3367] And I went and I picture it now. I sat in the second row in the last seat.
[time=3371] In the third row in the last seat was Darcy Miller.
[time=3375] Darcy Miller looked at me when I sat down, another student.
[time=3379] She could have said anything, right? She could have said nothing. She was shy.
[time=3383] And she looked at me and she said, "It's about time."
[time=3389] And I understood right then, other people saw something in me.
[time=3395] When you see something in someone, acknowledge it.
[time=3399] You never know.
[time=3400] When something you do or say can change the life of someone forever,
[time=3407] you have no idea. So don't hold on to it. Encourage them.
[time=3415] I'm so thankful that Jesus Christ renovated my life.
[time=3419] Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, He is a new creation.
[time=3422] The old has passed away. Behold, the new has come.
[time=3429] Nothing will happen to me today. Nothing good. Nothing bad.
[time=3436] Nothing will happen to me today without passing through my father's hands.
[time=3443] Nothing will happen to me today. Nothing good. Nothing bad.
[time=3450] Nothing will happen to me today without passing through my father's hands.
[time=3473] Nothing will happen to me today. Nothing good. Nothing bad. Nothing will happen to me today without passing through my father's hands.
[time=3486] Then there was Daniel who prayed every day. The decree of the king he just could not obey.
[time=3493] When they decided to put him away above the roar of the lions you could hear Daniel say.
[time=3500] Nothing will happen to me today. Nothing good. Nothing bad. Nothing will happen to me today without passing through my father's hands.
[time=3557] Nothing will happen to me today without passing through my father's hands.
[time=3587] Nothing bad. Nothing bad. Nothing bad. Nothing bad. Nothing bad. Nothing bad. Nothing bad. Nothing bad. Nothing bad.
