[time=30] Today's Bible hour is sponsored by the family of Hazel Dagates in honor of her 97th birthday.
[time=60] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=106] My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[time=117] I dare not trust the sweetest friend but holy trust in Jesus' name.
[time=131] My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[time=143] I dare not trust the sweetest friend but holy trust in Jesus' name.
[time=155] Christ alone corners stone, weak made strong in the Savior's love through the store.
[time=170] He is Lord, Lord of all.
[time=180] When darkness seems to hide his face, I rest on his unchanging grace.
[time=192] In every high storm he gave, my anger holds within the mail.
[time=203] My anger holds within the mail.
[time=210] Christ alone corners stone, weak made strong in the Savior's love.
[time=221] Through the store he is Lord, Lord of all.
[time=232] He is Lord, Lord of all.
[time=244] Christ alone corners stone, weak made strong in the Savior's love through the store.
[time=259] He is Lord, Lord of all.
[time=267] Christ alone corners stone, weak made strong in the Savior's love through the store.
[time=281] He is Lord, Lord of all.
[time=297] He shall come with trumpet sound.
[time=309] Dressed in his righteousness alone, far less to stand before the throne.
[time=329] Dressed in his righteousness alone, he is Lord, Lord of all.
[time=397] Christ alone corners stone, weak made strong in the Lord of all.
[time=436] Dressed in his righteousness alone, he is Lord, Lord of all.
[time=464] Christ alone corners stone, weak made strong in the Lord of all.
[time=583] I will kneel in the dust at the foot of the cross where mercy paid for me.
[time=598] Where the wrath I deserve, it has gone, it has passed, your blood has hit me.
[time=613] Mercy, mercy has endless as the sea.
[time=627] I'll sing your hallelujah for all eternity.
[time=641] We will lift up the cup and the bread we will break.
[time=648] Remembering your love.
[time=654] We were falling from grace, but you took on our shame and nailed it to a cross.
[time=667] Mercy, mercy has endless as the sea.
[time=679] I'll sing your hallelujah for all eternity.
[time=692] Oh, mercy, mercy has endless as the sea.
[time=705] I'll sing your hallelujah for all eternity.
[time=722] May I never lose the wonder for the wonder of your mercy.
[time=744] May I sing your hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=751] [AMEN] May I never lose the wonder for the wonder of your mercy.
[time=763] May I sing your hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=771] [AMEN] May I never lose the wonder for the wonder of your mercy.
[time=783] May I sing your hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=791] Amen, may I never lose the wonder for the wonder of your mercy.
[time=802] May I sing your hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=820] I will kneel in the dust at the foot of the cross where mercy paid for me.
[time=843] Hi, my name is Rich Taverni, I'm the Executive Pastor here at Blackhawk.
[time=848] I want to take just a few minutes today to share with you some exciting events that are happening this fall at Blackhawk.
[time=854] First of all, we have our Welcome Back Wednesday program.
[time=857] We haven't had Wednesday night programming here in quite some time at Blackhawk, but we brought it back this year.
[time=862] We have some really exciting offerings for you, beginning with simple suppers.
[time=866] Every Wednesday night from 5 o'clock to 6 o'clock, you can come to Blackhawk and for just $3 a person or a family cap of $15, you can have a wholesome, healthy, homemade meal each Wednesday.
[time=879] You can spend some time fellowshipping with other people as you have many people who have participated in this.
[time=884] It's just been a real big event for the first two weeks that we've run it.
[time=888] We're going to continue to do that and we invite you to join us.
[time=891] After dinner, we have many offerings for the entire family, beginning with little ones.
[time=895] We have child care from birth until age 3, and then we also have a WANNA programming.
[time=901] WANNA programs are for children who are age 3 up through grade 5, and they'll spend each week learning more about Jesus Christ,
[time=909] learning to memorize verses, and share within a group setting.
[time=912] It's just a great growing opportunity for these little ones.
[time=915] They even have recreation time, so WANNA is a great program for little kids.
[time=920] Maybe your child is a little bit older than that.
[time=922] We have our junior high and high school ministries, Liquid and 212, and those are for students in grade 6 through grade 12,
[time=929] and they meet in the Asylum on the north side of the street.
[time=932] Great programming for them.
[time=934] If you're an adult, and you come, we also have adult programs here.
[time=938] We have our Bible study each week.
[time=940] Right now, we're studying the soon coming King.
[time=943] Brother Mark flaggy is teaching on the End Times.
[time=946] What does the Bible say about the End Times?
[time=948] How should we be preparing for that?
[time=950] Mark flaggy covers that in our program.
[time=952] He has about six more weeks in that program.
[time=954] You're welcome to join that at any time.
[time=957] We also have marriage matters.
[time=959] We believe that marriage is important here at Blackhawk, and so we have a program called Marriage Matters and to support those marriages from all walks of marriages.
[time=967] Maybe you're considering marriage all the way up through.
[time=971] People have been married for many, many years.
[time=973] Maybe your marriage is wonderful.
[time=975] Maybe your marriage needs some help and support.
[time=977] That's what our marriage matters ministry is here for.
[time=980] And all of our evening programs are from six thirty to eight o'clock.
[time=983] Maybe you like to sing in the choir.
[time=985] We have choir practices from six thirty to eight.
[time=987] Maybe you play an instrument.
[time=988] We have band practices.
[time=989] It starts at eight o'clock until they're finished.
[time=991] We also have several small groups that meet here on Wednesday nights.
[time=995] We also have a program called Logos, which is college level biblical instruction.
[time=1000] All of that's happening every Wednesday night here at Blackhawk.
[time=1003] Simple suffers from five to six, and then our program's from six thirty to eight o'clock.
[time=1008] Another thing that we're very excited about here at Blackhawk for the fall is we have a new pastor coming.
[time=1013] Pastor Kevin Rivers will be joining us.
[time=1015] He's coming here from Georgia, and he will be his first week in the pulpit.
[time=1020] We'll be on October the ninth.
[time=1022] If you get on our website, you can find this card that tells about the new series that he's going to begin.
[time=1029] You can also pick one up here at the church.
[time=1031] On the back of the card, it says, are you ready for something new in your life?
[time=1035] We have good news for you.
[time=1036] The gospel is all about new.
[time=1038] Jesus wants to do something new in your life, too.
[time=1041] Maybe it's time for a new chapter in your story, a fresh start, or a new day that only he can ignite.
[time=1046] The new is here.
[time=1047] Please join us in welcoming our new lead pastor, Kevin Rivers, on October 9th, 2016, as he kicks off a six-week series titled "New."
[time=1055] So we're really excited about that.
[time=1057] Today, we're going to be challenged by Brother Steve Longbreak from Colossians 3, 1-4 to set your mind on things above, and not on things on the earth.
[time=1065] I know that sometimes that's difficult.
[time=1067] We have so much going on in the world, and so many things to do, and so many responsibilities.
[time=1071] But, you know, we, as Christians, need to live our lives with our minds set on Jesus Christ.
[time=1077] So I hope you enjoy the service today.
[time=1079] Thank you.
[time=1080] [MUSIC - 62 seconds]
[time=1150] [MUSIC] Let me sing all for love [MUSIC] And we'll join the angel's song [MUSIC] Ever holy is the Lord [MUSIC] King of glory, King of all [MUSIC] Oh, how many times have I broken your heart [MUSIC] But still you forgive [MUSIC] If only I ask [MUSIC] And how many times have you heard me pray [MUSIC] Draw near to me [MUSIC] Everything I need is you [MUSIC] My beginning my forever [MUSIC] Everything I need is you [MUSIC] Everything I need is you [MUSIC] My beginning my forever [MUSIC] Everything I need [MUSIC] Everything I need is you [MUSIC] Always gives you love [MUSIC] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh [MUSIC] Everything, everything I need [MUSIC] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
[time=1272] [MUSIC]
[time=1295] One, two, three!
[time=1297] Hi!
[time=1299] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1301] And hello to you, my Black Hawk family.
[time=1303] It really meant a lot to Jessica and myself just to hear from you last Sunday on what was such a special day at Black Hawk.
[time=1310] As you may be able to tell, I'm here at my home in Georgia.
[time=1313] In the middle of boxes, we're in the process of moving.
[time=1316] You may have heard by now that God has provided us a place to go and to live in Fort Wayne, so God is just continuing to do exceedingly abundantly above all we could ask or think according to his power as it worked in us.
[time=1329] And so, Jessica wanted to be here to say hello to you with me, but she's actually out and about right now getting things ready for our move.
[time=1335] I wanted to say a personal congratulations to 22 people that followed Jesus in baptism last Sunday.
[time=1343] Thank you for following Jesus.
[time=1345] We are so excited to walk alongside of you in the days ahead and I want to tell you, Black Hawk family, we have some exciting days, some more new things that God wants to do ahead of us.
[time=1354] And speaking of new, I want to let you in a little bit on the new series that's coming up that I'll be kicking off when I'm with you on October the 9th.
[time=1362] The series is called new, and we're going to look at the new story of the gospel because really new is the story of the gospel.
[time=1370] The goal of the series is to tell that story, the new story of what Jesus wants to do in everyone's life as we see in Scripture, but also to look at the new chapters, the new stories that God wants to begin in your life.
[time=1383] And here's how you can help us build momentum for this series as October 9th approaches.
[time=1388] You are given some invite cards as you came in.
[time=1391] Now here's the thing, we have printed up 5,000 of these invite cards.
[time=1395] That's a lot of cards, but if each of us, every single one of us, will give out three of those cards every week for three weeks.
[time=1402] We've got three weeks to get all 5,000 of these cards out.
[time=1405] If you'll give out three per week, then we will be able to say we gave out 5,000 invitations to this new series that we'll be kicking off.
[time=1413] I want to ask you to continue to give those out, but think of people you can invite to join you for this special season at Black Holocaust New Day that we'll be experiencing together.
[time=1421] Continue to pray for life to be changed, for Jesus to be made known and made famous in Fort Wayne and around the world because of what we are going to be able to accomplish together.
[time=1431] You're in for a treat today as Steve Longbrake shares with you as you worship together, and your prayer life is going to be challenged.
[time=1437] I believe like never before.
[time=1439] Continue to let Jesus do a work in you, and we'll experience new things together.
[time=1443] Talk to you soon.
[time=1444] Well, you'd think they could find a picture of me about 30 years ago when I looked better than that.
[time=1451] Remember that Jay?
[time=1455] I used to look better than that.
[time=1457] Wow.
[time=1460] Nancy and I prayed, and now you have a new pastor, and you've prayed and prayed and prayed, and the energy that comes with that is just so much fun.
[time=1477] I just, just watching the video, I thought, "He's ready to get here, and you better be ready because there's going to be some action." I love all that energy.
[time=1489] I wonder what God's going to do next.
[time=1494] Well, that was really good music.
[time=1499] Now, Jonathan and Doug and Kevin and Choir and Ben,
[time=1505] that number was amazing, but in honor of Tiberius, I want to say in spite of the fact that Darren was leading that.
[time=1512] I've enjoyed him ripping on you, man.
[time=1517] That has been so much fun.
[time=1525] Wow.
[time=1526] I have a different job now,
[time=1534] not different than when the last time I was here, but I haven't told you much about it.
[time=1538] The job I have is with Sylvius Insurance Group in Warsaw, Indiana, and we sell crop insurance to help farmers manage their risk.
[time=1546] But I went to work there because the brand that they want to establish, and they want me to help establish, is that our crop insurance business exists to honor God and influence and enrich people
[time=1566] that we come into contact with as we offer risk management to the American farmer.
[time=1577] So I want to honor God and build a platform so that we can tell them the truth about why we're in business when we bump into people.
[time=1587] And I get to work for some fine people that are very intentional about that and care a lot about it, and I get to wave the banner and help all of our employees and agents remember that we exist to honor God first.
[time=1604] And we do that in lots of different ways to try to help everybody remember.
[time=1607] It's been great fun.
[time=1610] But this summer, you know, I'm a person, I don't really do this much.
[time=1618] I kind of live pretty much here.
[time=1622] But this summer, like I've experienced some other times, I just kind of went down and stayed flat, and I wasn't energized, I didn't have the joy I usually have, and I started to analyze that, and Nance helped me.
[time=1639] And I just thought through what in the world is going on?
[time=1643] Where is my joy?
[time=1645] Where's my energy?
[time=1648] And as I reflected on that and prayed about it,
[time=1654] I realized that what had happened to me this summer was that I'd turned 65 this spring.
[time=1665] And I wasn't really conscious of it, but more than any other time in my life, I started thinking about and dwelling on things like,
[time=1677] "What kind of house are we really going to be able to live in?"
[time=1683] What cars, like, do I need to get ready to down-grain maybe?
[time=1691] What kind of vacations are we really going to be able to take?
[time=1697] Are we going to be able to visit the kids as much as we want to?
[time=1699] They live all over the place.
[time=1702] Phoenix, Athens, Georgia, up here.
[time=1706] Am I going to get to play as much golf as I want to?
[time=1710] And the places I want to play?
[time=1714] And then, just in general, the thought, "Are we really going to have enough?
[time=1721] Or are we going to live under this pressure that I've experienced in the past but not experiencing so much now?"
[time=1731] As I think about not working and reducing income, and I just got fixed on things below.
[time=1741] And I dwelled on that way too much.
[time=1744] I've experienced that in the past.
[time=1747] I've experienced dwelling on things below, but not for the reasons that I just explained.
[time=1755] Different form, same problem.
[time=1760] Any time in my life that I've got fixated on things below, earthly things, I just lose my joy, I lose my focus, I lose my energy, I'm not productive for the kingdom, and that's where I was.
[time=1779] The sad thing is I've recruited seven interns from four different schools to come and intern with us, and I was responsible for that, and I had a great opportunity to invest in them for the kingdom, and I did share the gospel, I did do the things, I kind of did it, but I wasn't energized by it.
[time=1799] And I don't want to be like that anymore.
[time=1803] Have you ever been there?
[time=1806] You just lose the energy.
[time=1810] And so I started thinking and praying and begging God.
[time=1814] I don't want to have this summer of despair again.
[time=1818] So what's my problem?
[time=1821] And I went to Colossians 3 like that.
[time=1828] Colossians chapter 3 verses 1 through 4.
[time=1837] Since then you have been raised with Christ, this is the NIV, set your heart on things above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
[time=1847] Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.
[time=1854] For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.
[time=1860] When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.
[time=1870] There is no one.
[time=1874] The ESV says seek.
[time=1877] The NIV says set your heart.
[time=1879] Since then you have been raised with Christ.
[time=1881] Because of the position I have in Christ.
[time=1887] Because I'm born again and raised up from the dead.
[time=1893] Because I'm in that position, he says.
[time=1898] Set my heart on things related to me being born again.
[time=1905] Set my heart, place my affection on things above.
[time=1913] Isn't it interesting?
[time=1915] It says, since then you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
[time=1923] Set your heart on the place where he's seated.
[time=1931] You know, he's seated there because he deserves to be.
[time=1938] He never, ever disobeyed the Father.
[time=1944] He never sinned.
[time=1947] He died and took on our sin.
[time=1949] And the Bible says that he ascended into heaven and was seated at the right hand of God the
[time=1955] Father.
[time=1956] He's the first born over all creation.
[time=1958] He has the position above every single human that's ever been a human.
[time=1963] He's been a human.
[time=1966] He's in a position that he deserves.
[time=1969] And God wants me, Paul says to the Colossians.
[time=1973] He wants me to focus my attention on him there.
[time=1979] It says things above and then it talks about the fact that he's there.
[time=1983] And I should give him my attention.
[time=1988] My position and my affection.
[time=1991] I'm raised with Christ.
[time=1993] I have a position with him.
[time=1995] In verse 4 we'll talk about it in a little bit.
[time=1998] I'm going to be realized someday in a different way.
[time=2004] My affection, things above where Christ is seated.
[time=2008] Am I really thinking about him?
[time=2010] Am I intentional about setting my heart, my affection, the love and passion that I have
[time=2020] for people and things?
[time=2022] Am I intentional about setting my affection on him?
[time=2025] That's what Paul says I need to do.
[time=2027] I wasn't.
[time=2032] I still read the Bible some and prayed some.
[time=2036] But my heart was not set on things above this summer.
[time=2043] Verse 2.
[time=2046] I call this position and possessions.
[time=2049] Verse 2 says, "Set your minds." Okay? Mind.
[time=2055] Everything I think about.
[time=2058] Set my mind on things above.
[time=2062] And instead of saying set my mind on the person of Christ, it says this is how you set your mind on things above.
[time=2070] You stop setting it on things below.
[time=2076] I needed to quit spending my time.
[time=2078] When I started to get immersed in that, I needed to back out of that again.
[time=2081] And set my mind on things above.
[time=2084] Stop setting it on these earthly things.
[time=2087] Don't let myself go down that path.
[time=2089] I don't belong there.
[time=2094] I'm an alien.
[time=2097] That's what Peter, 1 Peter says.
[time=2099] I'm an alien in this present world, chapter 2.
[time=2104] So set my mind on things above.
[time=2106] Not on things on earth.
[time=2109] I've died.
[time=2113] I've been raised again.
[time=2117] And that reminded me of 2 Corinthians 4, 18.
[time=2119] Let's look at that.
[time=2120] 2 Corinthians 4, 18.
[time=2126] Says, "So we fix our eyes." Paul again, this time to the Corinthians.
[time=2131] "So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen."
[time=2138] So Colossians 1 says that Jesus created everything.
[time=2142] The invisible and the visible both.
[time=2147] We need to give our attention to the things not seen.
[time=2155] He says, "So fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen." For what is unseen is temporary.
[time=2161] I don't treat it like that.
[time=2163] That's the problem.
[time=2167] For what is seen is temporary.
[time=2169] But what is unseen is eternal.
[time=2172] If I give the eternal the attention that the eternal deserves, you know why it deserves that?
[time=2177] It's forever.
[time=2179] It deserves attention.
[time=2182] Jesus is forever.
[time=2184] He's the same yesterday, today and forever, always.
[time=2189] And when I focus my attention on things that are forever,
[time=2199] instead of things that are temporary, my joy comes back.
[time=2205] My energy comes back.
[time=2207] His spirit fills me up.
[time=2209] His spirit doesn't fill me when I'm thinking about which golf course I'm going to play in retirement.
[time=2217] I don't think he minds that I'm going to play some golf, but he's not real interested in it either.
[time=2227] Verse 3.
[time=2236] Colossians 3-3, "For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God." Do I realize I'm dead to those things?
[time=2250] If I do, I can enjoy them.
[time=2253] If I realize I'm dead to all that stuff, I can enjoy it as it shows up.
[time=2259] If I'm pursuing it, I'll never enjoy it, because the Bible says there's a continual lust for more, and I'll never, ever have enough.
[time=2271] I've died.
[time=2273] I'm born again in Christ.
[time=2275] I'm hidden with Christ in God.
[time=2279] Mom took us kids to Sunday school.
[time=2282] Dad worked at a steel foundry.
[time=2286] Sunday was really his day of rest, and I always felt like Dad wasn't that welcome to enter the churches that were in our town.
[time=2294] It may not be true.
[time=2296] Dad smoked.
[time=2298] Not many people felt real comfortable going to church there when you smoked.
[time=2303] But I remember he used to wait for us, and he'd wait for our Sunday school papers, and every Sunday morning, Dad would take the Sunday paper, put it down when we walked in, and we'd hand him five different Sunday school papers.
[time=2315] My brother, myself, my two sisters, and my mom, we all were different ages, and we had different papers.
[time=2320] I've told you this before from David C. Cook Publishing Company, and Dad would read all those all the way through.
[time=2327] And I knew it was really important to him, but we didn't talk about it.
[time=2333] But mom faithfully took me, and those Sunday school teachers faithfully told me the truth.
[time=2338] And I don't know which of those 80 or 100 times I prayed to receive Christ.
[time=2344] I don't know which of those was the one that actually happened.
[time=2347] I do know at 15 at Church Camp in Lakeside, Ohio, Dr. Pennington was the speaker, and I do know that counselor that night asked me, he asked me this question, "Do you hold in your hands or see what is most important to you?"
[time=2363] And I thought, "Wow." He points at me, he goes, "Like a basketball?"
[time=2372] I knew I gave most of my attention to balls, footballs and basketballs and baseballs.
[time=2380] And I knew that.
[time=2381] So that may be the time that I thought, "Oh, Lord, I want you to be the Lord of my life." I flip flopped around from 15 to 23 back and forth, trying to grow and fall falling and messing up.
[time=2394] And then at 23, I met some people that really just taught me
[time=2400] and loved me and discipled me.
[time=2404] And after that, I still flip flopped, messed around.
[time=2406] Paul said he struggled with his flesh.
[time=2410] Romans 5, 6, and 7.
[time=2412] I struggled with mine, I still do.
[time=2415] And I can get in a funk doing that.
[time=2420] I'd repent, confess, repent, confess.
[time=2428] I've been doing that all of my life.
[time=2431] It's important for us to repent and confess.
[time=2437] I'm full of regret for all those things I had to repent for.
[time=2443] I don't even like to think about them.
[time=2445] When my mind goes to somebody or something I've done, I hate it.
[time=2450] I'm full of regrets.
[time=2453] But I'm not guilty at all because he took all that away.
[time=2459] I'll be regretting those things for the rest of my life, I believe.
[time=2465] But he removed the guilt.
[time=2470] My sin still creeps in.
[time=2472] I have a friend who's got his doctorate in psychology.
[time=2475] He told me this.
[time=2477] Can we put that slide up there if it works?
[time=2480] I gave him one that might not work because I build it.
[time=2483] So, oh my, there it is.
[time=2488] He said about 75%, around 75% of us, the root of our sinfulness is bound up in security.
[time=2498] He said we're fear-driven.
[time=2501] And next slide.
[time=2505] And from fear, we get angry and frustrated because things don't go the way we want them to
[time=2513] so we can maintain our security.
[time=2516] And so we act out.
[time=2518] And then we feel bad about that and we run over to despair.
[time=2522] And we repent.
[time=2525] And we go back to fear again in our flesh.
[time=2527] Now this is about our flesh.
[time=2529] This is not about our spirit.
[time=2531] In Christ, I can continually work against that
[time=2537] and diminish it.
[time=2540] Next slide.
[time=2542] Around 25% of us, I'm one of them, the root of our sinfulness is rooted in our pleasure-seeking.
[time=2552] And he said, Steve, you're not afraid of much.
[time=2556] You just use people for your own good.
[time=2559] I thought, man, I hate that.
[time=2561] I do.
[time=2564] And then I act out.
[time=2566] I get frustrated when I can't do what I want to do.
[time=2569] I get frustrated when I can't smell the smells I want to smell.
[time=2572] Touch the things I want to feel.
[time=2575] Eat the things I want to taste.
[time=2580] Here are the things I want to hear because I like pleasure today.
[time=2584] My sinfulness is rooted in me being happy today.
[time=2588] And I know that about me.
[time=2592] My wife's sinfulness is rooted in security issues.
[time=2597] She's thinking about the future and I just want to enjoy today.
[time=2601] So let's spend it today so I can enjoy it rather than save it for tomorrow.
[time=2607] Anybody connect with that?
[time=2616] I don't want to be a person who's rooted in pleasure-seeking here.
[time=2624] I want to be a person who's rooted in things above.
[time=2631] Those of you that are afraid and you live life planning for what might happen?
[time=2639] Planning against it because either you've experienced something in the past that you think might happen again.
[time=2646] And so you're worried about that and you get focused on that?
[time=2650] Or you're wondering what might happen in the future that would steal away what you have now?
[time=2656] It's okay to plan.
[time=2657] It's healthy to plan.
[time=2658] The Bible's clear about that.
[time=2660] It's not healthy to be focused on that.
[time=2664] To have that be the driver in your life.
[time=2668] Pleasure seekers like me.
[time=2671] It's good to enjoy the things that God gives us.
[time=2674] He says He gives those to us.
[time=2677] In 1 Timothy 6, it's clear.
[time=2680] He gives us all things for our enjoyment.
[time=2683] When I'm not focused on those, when I'm not seeking those, when they don't have all of my attention, I get to enjoy those fully.
[time=2693] Thanks, you can take that off.
[time=2696] 1 John 2, 16 came to mind too.
[time=2702] 1 John, chapter 2, verse 16.
[time=2710] He says, "For everything in the world," John writes.
[time=2719] The cravings of simple man, lust of the flesh is how I read that when I was little.
[time=2728] The lust of his eyes and the boasting pride of life, of what he has and does comes not
[time=2738] from the Father, but from the world.
[time=2744] The cravings of simple man, lust of the flesh.
[time=2751] That's about my pleasure.
[time=2757] The lust of the eyes.
[time=2760] That's about what we see that we want.
[time=2762] Now get this.
[time=2764] Some of us see and want things for our pleasure today.
[time=2769] Some of us see and want things for our security tomorrow.
[time=2773] It's still the same thing.
[time=2775] It's a lust after.
[time=2777] It's envy after.
[time=2779] It's a desire for.
[time=2781] It draws us.
[time=2783] The lust of the eyes we all have in common, some people want to make a lot of money so they can buy a boat today.
[time=2792] Some people want to make a lot of money so they can store it up in a house, a barn.
[time=2801] And I'll tell you, if that's what you're trying to do, it'll never be enough.
[time=2808] It won't satisfy.
[time=2811] And some of us, that's about possessions, lust of the eyes, and then pride of life or, as
[time=2818] it says here in the NIV, boasting of what he has and does, pride, that's about my position
[time=2826] in life.
[time=2828] And some of us are focused on a position that we're longing for.
[time=2836] When I get focused on position or possessions or pleasure, whether it's about my pleasure
[time=2849] or my security, I'll zero in on that and it will hold me captive and I'll never have
[time=2857] enough of it, ever.
[time=2861] The Bible says he gave them over to a continual lust for more, says we also gave ourselves
[time=2872] over to a continual lust for more, our passions, whether it's a bank account or a boat.
[time=2884] It's the same thing.
[time=2888] Like I said, I'm full of regrets, and I regret this summer.
[time=2897] I regret the fact that I did not engage with those interns at a greater level.
[time=2904] I did okay.
[time=2905] A lot of people would say, "Steve, don't beat yourself up." No, I know.
[time=2908] I know me.
[time=2910] I know my heart.
[time=2911] I know how much energy I gave to that.
[time=2914] It wasn't enough.
[time=2919] Those things aren't from the Father, they're from the world.
[time=2924] Verse 4 of Colossians 3.
[time=2932] When Christ who is your life appears, are you looking up, are you anticipating that it
[time=2943] might be while we're still here?
[time=2948] When Christ who is your life?
[time=2952] My life is not house, cars, property, barn, golf, he's my life.
[time=2966] When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.
[time=2980] Wow.
[time=2982] That took me to Hebrews 12.
[time=2986] Let's go back there.
[time=2987] Hebrews 12, 1 and 2.
[time=2993] Hebrews 11 is that long list of faithful people.
[time=3002] Hebrews 12 begins by saying, "Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders in the sin that so easily entangles
[time=3015] and let us run with perseverance, the race marked out for us.
[time=3020] Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy
[time=3031] set before him endured the cross.
[time=3035] Have you ever thought about the fact that we can endure what we're enduring here?
[time=3045] Then if I give up some stuff that I want, I can endure because there's joy set before
[time=3052] me.
[time=3054] He wanted to please the Father.
[time=3057] He endured even the cross.
[time=3059] He endured taking on all of the sin that I repent of, all the sin of the world."
[time=3074] He's the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, squirming its shame and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
[time=3088] Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.
[time=3094] I need to be mindful of him.
[time=3095] I need to make sure I'm intentionally considering him so that I won't be like I have been.
[time=3103] You know what?
[time=3104] Next summer I'm going to struggle again.
[time=3109] I hope it's not as flat.
[time=3112] I hope I fight it off earlier.
[time=3116] Next summer, the summer after that, as long as I'm alive, I'm going to be engaged in this struggle because in our flesh, walking on this earth, we are surrounded by enticement and
[time=3131] we cave and I hate it.
[time=3138] So set your heart on Christ.
[time=3147] Set your mind on Christ.
[time=3154] We're hidden with Christ in God until He comes.
[time=3161] And when He comes, you'll appear with Him in glory.
[time=3175] Look up and imagine what will it be like when He's actually coming back?
[time=3186] What will it be like on a new heaven and a new earth when He's reigning and we get to
[time=3193] walk with Him in glory?
[time=3200] And all the glory goes to the Father, that's what He said.
[time=3205] Philippians 2 says, "Every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ
[time=3211] is Lord to the glory of God the Father." I hope you know Christ because He's coming back.
[time=3223] And those of us who know Him will be caught up with Him and we're going to appear with
[time=3229] Him forever in glory.
[time=3236] Amen?
[time=3238] Father in heaven, we are guilty and guiltless.
[time=3251] Our sinfulness is reality.
[time=3257] Through the blood of Jesus, we have been made clean and we don't have to think on things
[time=3266] below.
[time=3268] We don't have to think on earthly things.
[time=3271] We're empowered by your spirit and when we feed your spirit, when we get in your Word, when we pray, when we fellowship with people and we get energized the right way, Lord.
[time=3282] Our joy is complete, it's incredible.
[time=3287] I thank you for Christ.
[time=3289] Thank you, Jesus, for coming here.
[time=3291] Thank you for dying on the cross for my sins.
[time=3293] Thank you for rising again from the grave.
[time=3296] Father, thanks for raising Him up so that we can have real hope.
[time=3304] Thank you for the hope that we have knowing that you're coming again.
[time=3309] We long for it.
[time=3312] We love you.
[time=3313] We praise you.
[time=3315] You deserve our attention.
[time=3316] You deserve our fixing, our eyes.
[time=3318] You deserve our setting, our hearts.
[time=3321] You deserve our setting, our minds on you and on things above.
[time=3326] And we long for that.
[time=3327] Would you please empower us as a whole body to do that?
[time=3331] In Christ's name I pray, amen.
[time=3348] Beautiful God, laying your majesty aside, you've reached out and loved to show me life.
[time=3361] Lifted from darkness into light, oh, King for us, love, trading your righteousness for
[time=3377] shame, despite all my pride and foolish ways.
[time=3385] God in your infinite embrace, oh, and I find myself here on my knees again, caught up
[time=3403] in grace like an avalanche, nothing compares to this love, life, life, burning in my heart.
[time=3422] Can you stand with us and sing this next verse, Savior and Friend?
[time=3427] Say your end, friend, breathing your life into my heart, your word is the weapon to
[time=3439] my back, forever I'm humbled by your love, oh, and I find myself here on my knees again.
[time=3457] Caught up in grace like an avalanche, nothing compares to this love, love, love, burning
[time=3473] in my heart, take my life, take all that I am with
[time=3502] all that I am, I will love you, take my heart, take all that I have, Jesus how I adore you,
[time=3519] take my life, take all that I am with all that I am, I will love you, take my heart
[time=3532] take all that I have, Jesus how I adore you and I, find myself here on my knees again,
[time=3551] caught up in grace like an avalanche, nothing compares to this love, love, love.
