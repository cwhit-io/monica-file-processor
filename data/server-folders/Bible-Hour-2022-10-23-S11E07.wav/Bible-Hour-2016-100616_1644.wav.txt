[time=187] Hello Black Hawk family, I have here with me Joel Baus, and I know Joel has some family and friends here today as well, I want to recognize that.
[time=197] Anybody that's here, just lift your hand for a second, let's say thank you, can we thank them for being here and celebrating this with Joel?
[time=202] [APPLAUSE]
[time=206] Awesome, I've gotten to hear some of Joel's story, recently Joel, is it true, you've just surrendered your heart and life to Jesus?
[time=212] Yes, sir. Over the last several months, he's nailed that down, he's given his life to Jesus and wants to profess that publicly today, in front of all of us together, his church family.
[time=222] So Joel is an honor to get to baptize you today, my friend, my brother, and so thank you for giving me this privilege today.
[time=228] It's because of your profession of faith and our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and His great command that I have the privilege to baptize you now, my brother, and the name of the Father, the name of the Son, the name of the Holy Spirit.
[time=241] Bared with Christ and baptism, raise to up with Him in a new life.
[time=246] [APPLAUSE]
[time=249] Let's celebrate together.
[time=251] [APPLAUSE]

[time=468] Great are you, Lord, it's your bed in our lungs, so we pour out our praise, pour out our praise, it's your breath in our lungs, so we pour out our praise, you only.
[time=518] [MUSIC - 25 seconds]
[time=554] You call me out upon the waters, the great unknown, where feet may fail.
[time=569] And there I find you in the mystery, and oceans deep, my faith will sing.
[time=584] And I will call upon your name, and keep my eyes above the wings.
[time=597] The oceans rise, my soul will rest, and your embrace, where I have rose.
[time=608] You are mine.
[time=613] [MUSIC]
[time=624] Your grace abounds the deepest waters, the sovereign hands will be my eye.
[time=639] And where feet may fail, and fear surrounds me, you never fail, and you won't start down.
[time=654] And I will call upon your name, and keep my eyes above the wings.
[time=667] And oceans rise, my soul will rest, and your embrace, where I have known.
[time=678] You are mine.
[time=689] [MUSIC]
[time=709] Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders, let me walk upon the waters, wherever you would call me.
[time=724] Take me deeper than my faith could ever wonder, my faith will be made stronger than the presence of my Savior.
[time=739] Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders, let me walk upon the waters, wherever you would call me.
[time=754] Take me deeper than my faith could ever wonder, my faith will be made stronger than the presence of my Savior.
[time=768] Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders, let me walk upon the waters, wherever you would call me.
[time=783] Take me deeper than my faith could ever wonder, my faith will be made stronger than the presence of my Savior.
[time=798] Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders, let me walk upon the waters, wherever you would call me.
[time=813] Take me deeper than my faith could ever wonder, my faith will be made stronger than the presence of my Savior.
[time=834] [MUSIC]
[time=857] I will fall upon your name, keep my eyes above the waves, and oceans rise, my solar rays, for I have those.
[time=883] You are mine.
[time=888] [APPLAUSE]
[time=895] [MUSIC]
[time=905] I won't deny the worst you could say about me, but I'm not defined by mistakes that I've made because God says of me.
[time=922] I am not who I was, and being remade, I am new.
[time=931] I'm chosen and whole and I'm dearly loved, I am new, I am new.
[time=943] [MUSIC]
[time=950] Who I thought I was, and who I thought I had to give.
[time=958] I had to give them both up, 'cause neither were willing to ever be.
[time=966] I am not who I was, I'm being remade, I am new.
[time=975] I'm chosen and whole and I'm dearly loved, I am new, I am new.
[time=984] Too long a violent in the shadows of shame, believing that there was no where could change.
[time=993] But the one who is making everything new, doesn't see me the way that I do.
[time=1002] He doesn't see me the way that I do.
[time=1007] [MUSIC]
[time=1013] I am not who I was, I'm being remade, I am new.
[time=1022] I'm chosen and whole and I'm dearly loved, I am new, I am new.
[time=1031] I'm not who I was, I'm being remade, I am new.
[time=1040] I'm dead to the old man, I'm coming alive, I am new, I am new.
[time=1053] [MUSIC]
[time=1068] Forgive and beloved, hidden in Christ, made in the image of the giver of life.
[time=1077] Righteous and holy, reborn and remained, accepted and worthy.
[time=1083] This is our new name, given, beloved, hidden in Christ, made in the image of the giver of life.
[time=1094] Righteous and holy, reborn and remained, accepted and worthy.
[time=1101] This is our name.
[time=1106] This is who we are now.
[time=1136] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=1178] Is anybody else just excited today after everything you've seen already?
[time=1182] I just love what we've got to do here today at Black Hawk.
[time=1185] Yeah, how about the baptism and Joel?
[time=1187] I love, by the way, I don't know if you got our church-wide email, but the number one thing I said in our email this week was, we have a baptism and I expect you to be loud and you are loud.
[time=1197] I love celebrating baptism for what it truly is.
[time=1200] It's the newness in our life, behold, all things have become new.
[time=1204] If you're a guest with us, I want to say welcome.
[time=1207] My name's Kevin, the pastor here, and it's so great a privilege to just be able to share God's word with you every week.
[time=1212] We're in the fourth week of a message series simply entitled "New." If you're new with us, then I want you to know you're still going to jump right in at a great spot.
[time=1220] Today's topic is new memory, new memory.
[time=1223] Any forgetful people in the building?
[time=1226] All right, I'm not alone. I'm not alone.
[time=1229] Those of you who didn't raise your hand, you said, "I don't know, I forgot what I'm not sure." We're so glad that you're here to celebrate with us whether you're watching online or on television.
[time=1237] Thank you for being a part of what God's doing here at Black Hawk.
[time=1240] He is just getting started.
[time=1242] So today, if you've got your Bibles, look at the book of Ezekiel as our starting place.
[time=1246] We're going to be all over the Bible today.
[time=1248] Is everybody okay with that? Can we jump around and look at a lot of Scripture today?
[time=1251] I'm excited just to jump through Scripture and look at this concept because we're going to look at several different things.
[time=1256] But in Ezekiel chapter 11, it's in your Old Testament, so I'm going to give you a minute to use your table of contents.
[time=1261] It's needed, but find that place there.
[time=1263] We're going to start there. God's talking about our heart.
[time=1265] He's talking about Israel and how he wants to do something new.
[time=1268] He wants to put in them a new kind of heart, a new kind of spirit.
[time=1273] And so with that, we're also going to look, for those of you who already found Ezekiel, we can also mark your place in John chapter 14.
[time=1280] And over, I'll say it again, but I want to give you a glimpse ahead of time.
[time=1283] We're going to be all over the Bible.
[time=1285] So before we get there as you're finding your way, we're going to say our memory verse, which is 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 17.
[time=1293] Just checking verse 17.
[time=1295] And so we're going to say that together.
[time=1297] This week's our fourth week.
[time=1298] We've looked so far at new meaning.
[time=1300] We've looked at new mercies.
[time=1304] We've looked at how it all starts with how we see.
[time=1306] How we see determines how we be.
[time=1308] We've gotten to how God's mercies are new every single morning.
[time=1311] We moved last week to how God will do the things that you can't expect through the ways you would never expect to do them.
[time=1317] That his ways are always better than ours.
[time=1319] Last week we touched on the past just a little bit.
[time=1321] If you're here last week, I told you we would revisit that.
[time=1324] And so here we are today talking about new memory.
[time=1327] So let's say our memory verse together today, our theme verse of the whole series.
[time=1332] 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 17.
[time=1335] Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[time=1341] The old has gone.
[time=1344] Uh oh.
[time=1346] The old has passed away.
[time=1348] I'm going to the old version.
[time=1349] Behold, the new has come.
[time=1351] Leave it to the pastor.
[time=1353] I was doing a different version.
[time=1354] You look it up.
[time=1355] It's in a different version, okay?
[time=1358] Thank you for digging into that.
[time=1360] I've had several of you test me this last week.
[time=1362] I love that.
[time=1363] And I've tested a few of you.
[time=1364] I won't do that to you that often.
[time=1365] Yeah, because I obviously don't do very well myself.
[time=1367] So we don't feel new a lot of times.
[time=1370] A few things we've looked at is because of our history, our hurts, and our habits.
[time=1373] Our history of the things that I did, I just can't get past.
[time=1376] We're going to dig into that a little more today.
[time=1378] Our hurts, something somebody did to me that I just can't let go of.
[time=1382] And then the habits, those things.
[time=1383] You have any of those bad habits that you just keep doing, right?
[time=1386] Those are the things that hold us back from the new things God has for our lives.
[time=1390] But today we're going to look at the new memories.
[time=1392] Look at Ezekiel with me.
[time=1394] Let's go on and read that.
[time=1395] And then I'll give you the bottom line.
[time=1396] We're going to go with a little different order today.
[time=1398] Starting verse 19 of Ezekiel, chapter 11.
[time=1401] Again, this is a prophet speaking to the nation of Israel.
[time=1405] So there's a much bigger context here that's a whole other sermon.
[time=1408] But there are a few things that paves the way into the topic of the Holy Spirit and into the New Testament, which is where we'll jump to in John 14 in just a moment.
[time=1416] But you need to know it's a prophet speaking truth to a nation that often hardens their hearts.
[time=1421] Start with verse 21 in fact.
[time=1422] Let's go there and then we'll back up.
[time=1424] We'll read it backwards.
[time=1425] Today I'm a backwards kind of guy sometimes.
[time=1427] Verse 21.
[time=1428] "But as for those whose heart goes after their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their deeds upon their own heads, declares the Lord." If you've ever been in that boat, would you just raise your hand?
[time=1441] You just kept going after your own things and your own deeds came back to you.
[time=1445] You reaped what you sowed.
[time=1447] I've done that.
[time=1448] But I love that before that.
[time=1449] I love that before all of my mistakes.
[time=1452] God's grace is still there and He's still desiring to do something new in my life.
[time=1456] Verse 19.
[time=1457] "And I will give them one heart." And a what?
[time=1462] A new spirit.
[time=1463] And a new spirit I will put within them.
[time=1466] I will remove the heart of stone.
[time=1468] I know I've had one of those so many times.
[time=1470] From their flesh and give them a heart of flesh that they may walk in my statues and keep my rules and obey them.
[time=1477] And they shall be my people and I will be their God.
[time=1482] We're all forgetful at times.
[time=1484] We forget the things that we need to remember and remember the things that we need to forget.
[time=1487] Can I get a name in?
[time=1489] We just hold on to those things that God says, let go and let me have those things.
[time=1494] And then we remember the things that we just got to get rid of.
[time=1497] God today wants to do some new reminders in your life.
[time=1500] And so I've forgotten things plenty of times.
[time=1502] I was thinking this week.
[time=1503] What could I share just to let everybody know that I'm a pretty forgetful God just like you perhaps.
[time=1508] And I think one of the worst forgetfulness mistakes I made was I'm not sure maybe my second or third wedding that I performed.
[time=1516] And I completely forgot in my notes, I'm talking in my notes and everything.
[time=1520] I always take notes in my Bible because you don't mess up somebody's wedding day.
[time=1524] That's a bad thing.
[time=1525] And I completely forgot the vows completely doesn't have them in.
[time=1529] It was not in my mind at all.
[time=1531] I don't know how that happened.
[time=1533] I don't know.
[time=1534] And we went through it and the couple was so sweet.
[time=1536] It was a very smooth wedding, but it was kind of glaringly obvious at one point.
[time=1539] It's like in this usually where we say I do and stuff, but they came to me after the wedding.
[time=1544] So sweet.
[time=1545] I felt so bad.
[time=1546] It was terrible.
[time=1547] And said, hey, we never really did those vows.
[time=1551] And I went, oh my gosh, I forgot.
[time=1554] And I said, hey, do you want to do them right now?
[time=1556] What do you say?
[time=1557] So I said, do you want to do them right now?
[time=1559] And so we stood there and did the vows right there after the wedding.
[time=1562] It was kind of a sweet moment.
[time=1563] God kind of took my mess and made something kind of sweet.
[time=1566] I'm sure they'll remember that forever.
[time=1568] But yeah.
[time=1569] Yeah.
[time=1570] But don't laugh.
[time=1571] You forget too.
[time=1572] If you did as many weddings and stuff as I've done, you'd forget it too.
[time=1575] I'll never forget that moment.
[time=1577] But a lot of times the bottom line is that our memories are often selective.
[time=1582] Selective memories and defective.
[time=1585] Selective defective memories, right?
[time=1588] That's what we work with.
[time=1589] But let me give you the real bottom line of the scripture though today.
[time=1592] That's our bottom line.
[time=1593] But the bottom line of our truth we're digging into today is simply this.
[time=1596] My memory manages how I multiply.
[time=1605] The call of Christianity is to multiply.
[time=1607] Jesus said, go into all the world making disciples.
[time=1610] It's about multiplication.
[time=1612] We're called to be multipliers of our faith.
[time=1615] We're not called just to sit on what we have, but to go out and make disciples of all nations.
[time=1620] And so we are called to multiply.
[time=1622] And here's what I submit to you.
[time=1623] You're multiplying something right now in your life.
[time=1626] Maybe it's negativity.
[time=1627] Maybe it's positivity.
[time=1629] Maybe it's things of the past.
[time=1633] I don't know what you multiply, but I know as a human being we're always multiplying something because we're not just sitting still.
[time=1640] I've heard it said before the only way you can coast.
[time=1642] A lot of times we say, well I'll just coast through life.
[time=1644] I'm not multiplying anything.
[time=1646] The only way you can coast is going downhill.
[time=1650] You don't coast on flat land.
[time=1652] You only coast going downhill.
[time=1654] And so we're always multiplying something.
[time=1656] We're always going into life and multiplying the things around us.
[time=1659] And so here's the thing.
[time=1660] How you choose to harness and use the memories of your life.
[time=1664] And I'm not just talking about that memory of the beach.
[time=1666] I'm talking about the memories that God wants to implant in you.
[time=1669] Not just the things that have happened, but even the memory, the things you call to mind and the times you need them most.
[time=1675] Your memory is really your multiplication manager.
[time=1679] What you're multiplying, what you're putting out, the product you're living out in your life ends up in some way, one way, shape, or form, getting managed by your memories
[time=1689] and by what you're calling to mind on a daily basis.
[time=1692] And so the Holy Spirit has a lot to do with that, and God sent His Son so that we could be indwelled by His Holy Spirit today.
[time=1700] So that the Holy Spirit could work in us right now.
[time=1703] We're going to talk about the Holy Spirit a lot today, because I think He is so misunderstood.
[time=1709] But He is in your life, if you know Jesus, to remind you of the things you need to remember
[time=1715] and help you forget the things you need to forget instead of the other way around.
[time=1719] And so let's go through some Holy Spirit reminders today.
[time=1722] Look at John 14 with me.
[time=1724] We just talked about how Ezekiel said, "Hey, I want to give you a transplant here.
[time=1730] I want to give you a transplant of heart from stone to a heart of flesh, and I want to give you a new spirit." I'm so glad that everything in the Old Testament just points to Jesus.
[time=1740] Did you know that?
[time=1741] This is before Jesus came in, many, many years before Jesus was on the scene, but it all points to who Jesus is, to the new story of the gospel.
[time=1751] That's the theme of our series is that the story of the gospel is new.
[time=1756] God wants to do something new in your life is the second part of that.
[time=1759] And that's where the Holy Spirit comes in.
[time=1761] John 14, this is an often-used passage of funerals where it talks about Jesus preparing a place for us.
[time=1768] But in John 14, verse 25, Jesus continues and wants to look there together.
[time=1773] And if you find your place there, we're moving into Halloween tomorrow, and I'm just going to go in and let you in.
[time=1778] A lot of people call the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost.
[time=1781] If you do that, I don't hold it against you, but I'm not a fan of that phrase, because I think it denotes this mindset that the Spirit of God is this ghost that's hovering over us, ready to come and pounce on us.
[time=1792] But in fact, the Holy Spirit is the Son of the living God who is living inside of us.
[time=1798] John 16 and verse 7, Jesus said, "Hey, it's to your advantage." The disciple, he kept saying, "Hey, I'm going to leave you.
[time=1804] I'm going to leave you, disciples." And they said, "No, we want you to stay.
[time=1806] We like having Jesus in our presence walking with us every single day." But he said, "No, it's to your advantage that I go so that I, me, Jesus, the Son of God can be multiplied and spread out among you.
[time=1819] The believers and the church will be formed." And can you imagine hearing this for the first time?
[time=1824] We get it now because we're looking back.
[time=1826] But they didn't get it.
[time=1827] But he said, "It's to your advantage that I go so that the Holy Spirit could come." That's why we have the third person of the Trinity.
[time=1833] The Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit.
[time=1836] The Holy Spirit is here so that the grace, the love, the mercy, the church and the purpose of God can multiply throughout all of the world, through how, through us, as we be the church together.
[time=1851] And that's why the Holy Spirit has come.
[time=1853] And in John 14, Jesus talks a little bit about that.
[time=1856] But he reminds us of certain things.
[time=1858] Let's look at John 14 starting in verse 25.
[time=1861] Anybody ready for some more of the word this morning?
[time=1864] These things, the words of Jesus, I've spoken to you while I am still with you, but the helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name.
[time=1873] He will teach you all the things and bring to your, what?
[time=1878] Remembrance, all I have said to you.
[time=1881] Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you, not as the world gives, do I give it to you, let not your hearts be troubled.
[time=1889] Neither let them be afraid.
[time=1892] Now a lot of times in life we're reminded of things a lot.
[time=1895] Anybody have some good reminders around you?
[time=1898] You know what I'm talking about, people that give you those reminders.
[time=1901] Sometimes they're unnecessary reminders.
[time=1903] In fact, I'll go in and let you know a little, a church secret, a church world secret.
[time=1906] Can I do that?
[time=1907] Next week, the clocks change, right?
[time=1910] And a lot of times we talk about, hey, we need to remind everybody to set their clocks back.
[time=1914] The response to that, this time when it goes back is, no, you don't.
[time=1918] Don't tell them, trick them into coming on time for once.
[time=1923] That's an unnecessary reminder, right?
[time=1926] Now you know my secret, right?
[time=1928] Now you're going to set them back and be here late anyway.
[time=1930] But anyway, I kind of gave that away.
[time=1932] But we set our clocks back and those are unnecessary reminders because sometimes they help us out.
[time=1936] Sometimes they're annoying reminders.
[time=1938] How many, how many kids in school right now?
[time=1941] Yeah, okay.
[time=1942] Have you ever been in class?
[time=1944] Because I was this guy a lot and I had maybe forgotten homework or I just didn't do it.
[time=1948] And there's that one kid.
[time=1950] The bell's fixing a ring and the teacher didn't ask for the homework.
[time=1954] She forgot.
[time=1955] And they go, and you go, and they say, "Teacher, weren't we supposed to kind of turn in that homework?"
[time=1965] And they go, "No!" But they do it anyway.
[time=1968] And it's that annoying reminder that you just wish, wouldn't have come your way.
[time=1972] But I'm so glad that today, I believe all of those kind of reminders aside, there's some saving, life-changing reminders that the Holy Spirit wants to bring about in your life.
[time=1980] So let's talk about a few things that the Holy Spirit wants to remind you of today.
[time=1984] And the first thing is remember who He is.
[time=1988] Look at somebody say, "Remember who He is." Tell them.
[time=1992] Remember who He is.
[time=1995] So many times I forget, if I'm honest, the God that I truly serve.
[time=1999] I forget who He is, how timeless He is.
[time=2002] I box Him into my little world and forget how big He is.
[time=2006] And let me tell you, if you've been trying to box Him in, some of you are here and you're seeking out who is God today.
[time=2012] And I want to tell you, we are so glad that you are here.
[time=2015] I'm so glad that you're here.
[time=2016] I've always been the guy who tried to think out of the box.
[time=2019] I've always been the inquisitive guy who asked a billion questions that people would say, "Accept it for what it is." And I'd be like, "No, I can't accept it for what it is because it doesn't make logical sense." And you're here and you're that way today.
[time=2030] But let me give you an encouragement if that's you because I understand.
[time=2033] I've been that guy.
[time=2034] I still am that guy so many times.
[time=2036] You will never hear me.
[time=2038] You will never, ever, ever, ever be able to box God into your intellect, your reasoning,
[time=2046] and your rationale.
[time=2047] He's way too big to fit inside that box.
[time=2051] He's way bigger than our way of thinking.
[time=2054] His ways are so much higher than our ways.
[time=2058] But yet he will.
[time=2059] Scripture makes it clear.
[time=2061] Jesus said it.
[time=2062] "He who knows me knows the Father." If you want to see God and understand Him for who He is, just look at Jesus.
[time=2070] That's why He came so we could get a glimpse of Him.
[time=2073] Now today, here's what I'd submit to you.
[time=2075] A lot of times we think, "Well, we're doing in this series called News, so you came today hoping you would hear something new." I hope the preacher says something I've never heard before.
[time=2083] And that's fine.
[time=2084] You might get that from one week to the next.
[time=2086] You may not.
[time=2087] I would submit if you've been in church for a long time.
[time=2089] It's very likely that you may come and not get a lot of things that maybe you haven't heard, but here's what I want to challenge you with.
[time=2095] What the Holy Spirit, I believe, wants to do in our lives.
[time=2097] A lot of times it's not this scavenger hunt for all these new things, but maybe it's an excavation.
[time=2103] A digging up of the timeless truth because guess what?
[time=2106] Scripture, Jesus, God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit.
[time=2110] It existed long before you and I ever came into the picture.
[time=2113] It's timeless.
[time=2114] He is a timeless God that we serve.
[time=2117] And so maybe it's not as much of a scavenger hunt of picking out, "Ooh, I've never seen that before.
[time=2121] There's nothing wrong with that." But maybe it's an excavation.
[time=2123] And today the Holy Spirit wants to do something in your life and dig some truth up that maybe you've covered up with layer after layer after layer of life today.
[time=2132] To just maybe simply remember who He is in your life.
[time=2137] Think about a time in your life where God was exactly what you needed Him to be in your life.
[time=2142] Can you think of a time like that?
[time=2143] Or I just needed God to be my counselor.
[time=2147] I needed some guidance and He gave you some guidance.
[time=2151] You just needed a little peace and God gave you some peace that passes understanding perhaps.
[time=2157] You just needed a friend, no one was in sight, but you found He was right there.
[time=2162] That's the God that we serve.
[time=2164] That's who He is.
[time=2166] Maybe God brought you here today not to hear something new, but to dig up something timeless.
[time=2171] It's going to do something new in your life because it's timeless, because of who He is.
[time=2177] Second thing is remember what He has done.
[time=2179] Not just remember who He is.
[time=2181] Remember what He has done.
[time=2186] Those of you who aren't taking notes, by the way, your memory is not that good.
[time=2189] You better write that down.
[time=2191] I still remember a high school teacher.
[time=2193] I was thinking about this this week and just my memory, and I still remember a high school teacher who would always say, "You better write that down, boy.
[time=2200] You better write that down, boy." And he would always follow it up with the dullest pencil.
[time=2205] Now, and we go, "Oh, he's good.
[time=2207] He goes again." The dullest pencil is sharper than the sharpest mind.
[time=2215] And you know what?
[time=2216] As much as that drove me crazy every week hearing that, "He was right." Don't you hate when that happens?
[time=2222] So I've learned to write things down.
[time=2223] That's why we give you a lot of throughout our app, by the way.
[time=2225] You can take notes in our app if you don't use that.
[time=2227] If you're a digital person, we've got the Bible link there.
[time=2229] It's got places you can actually fill in the blanks, just like you see in the bulletin.
[time=2232] We try to give you tools to remember, because here's the thing the Holy Spirit will bring up these truths.
[time=2237] It's not because I'm saying them.
[time=2239] It's because they're straight from the Bible, straight from Scripture.
[time=2242] Remember what he's done, those, what we'll look at.
[time=2244] Now, some of us, I believe in this room today, hear me.
[time=2247] When you think about the things God has done, think about that on an individual level.
[time=2252] What has God done for you lately?
[time=2254] Some of you may seriously say nothing.
[time=2257] I'm here just to see if he will do something.
[time=2259] Well, I would tell you he wants to do something.
[time=2261] He will do something.
[time=2262] He may be waiting on you just to open yourself up and put those things at the past.
[time=2266] Those memories that you keep holding on to just say, "I'm going to put them aside.
[time=2269] God, long enough to let you do what you want." It's been my way so far.
[time=2273] My way of the highway is over.
[time=2275] It's your way.
[time=2276] All right, here we go.
[time=2277] And God will do something if you will take that step.
[time=2280] But I believe some people in the room today are so caught up in the things that are happening around our life.
[time=2285] The election that's coming up, the government, whatever it may be, that it causes us to forget how faithful.
[time=2292] Hear me.
[time=2293] I know things are in a mess in our nation.
[time=2295] You're right.
[time=2296] There's a mess anywhere you look.
[time=2297] I know things are a mess in your family.
[time=2299] I've got one of those, too.
[time=2300] It gets messy.
[time=2301] I know.
[time=2302] I get it.
[time=2303] But here's what I know to a greater level than what I know as reality today.
[time=2308] Yes, the world around us is messy and there's a mess everywhere we turn.
[time=2313] But here's what I know.
[time=2314] God has worked throughout history in the biggest of messes.
[time=2318] When you look at the nation of Israel, when you look at the story of Scripture, how Jesus came onto the scene, every generation and century that went by, every nation's been messed up.
[time=2329] But every single generation saw the faithfulness of God because even though everything around us goes like this,
[time=2336] it's up and it's down.
[time=2337] We serve a God who is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and he's still on the throne.
[time=2344] You can take hope in who he is and remember what he has done because when I look at history,
[time=2350] he has this history of taking messed up people just like me and doing things that only he could do,
[time=2356] in settings that it seemed impossible for him to do him in.
[time=2360] He's just getting started.
[time=2361] He doesn't need our nation to be in great shape to do his work.
[time=2365] He's never needed the approval of anyone to do what he's going to do and he never, ever will because he's on the throne.
[time=2373] I believe our role in that then is to trust in him to know that, to operate in light of that fact,
[time=2379] and to yes, that does that mean we shouldn't vote?
[time=2381] No, go vote.
[time=2382] Go affect the nation, the world around us in every way that you can, but don't let that consume you and your memory
[time=2389] and what consumes your memory manager, your multiplication manager, which is your memory.
[time=2394] Don't let that consume your life so much that it drives you.
[time=2397] It defines your next steps.
[time=2399] Let God define those things and affect the world around you in the ways that only he can do.
[time=2405] That's what happens when we remember who he is and remember what he's done.
[time=2409] Look at Psalm 103, put back with me in the Old Testament.
[time=2413] Love this passage.
[time=2415] Psalm 103 verses 1 through 5.
[time=2420] Great passage here.
[time=2422] Tell us about the benefits of God.
[time=2430] There's a lot of benefits to doing things his way.
[time=2432] There's a lot of peace that passes understanding that we only get when we follow him.
[time=2437] The Psalmist, I like to read this because if you read the contents, kind of read the whole Psalm here, it's almost like he's in a funk a little bit.
[time=2444] He's in one of those seasons, those dry wilderness periods of his life, but he's being reminded.
[time=2450] How does that happen?
[time=2451] Because God's spirit reminds us of truth.
[time=2454] And I think this is an exact picture of what we're talking about today.
[time=2458] Psalm of David here.
[time=2459] David went through a lot of valleys, didn't he?
[time=2462] Imagine he had a lot of dry spells.
[time=2463] Here's what he writes.
[time=2464] Psalm 103.
[time=2465] "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me.
[time=2468] Bless his holy name.
[time=2470] Bless the Lord, O my soul, and underline this part.
[time=2473] And forget not all his benefits.
[time=2477] Who forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases, who redeems you your life from the pit,
[time=2484] who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy, who satisfies you with good so that your youth is renewed like the eagles."
[time=2494] Some of you needed that passage today.
[time=2496] And he wants to renew your youth.
[time=2498] What does that mean?
[time=2499] Make you young again?
[time=2500] No, to give you that energy, that passion that you have not had in such a long time.
[time=2506] Some of you, I just feel in a room this size, some of you have been hurt by a church before.
[time=2512] And I don't know why I just feel like I need to speak to you.
[time=2514] You've been hurt by the church world.
[time=2516] And I want to tell you, if you say I'm only going to go to church when all the people act like the church, you'll never go to church.
[time=2524] Because here's what I found.
[time=2525] I've been in a lot of churches and there are people in every single church.
[time=2529] And as soon as I go to the perfect church, it's not perfect anymore.
[time=2533] Because I got there and I believe some of you have been held, hear me.
[time=2537] I don't know who this is for.
[time=2538] I know I've been in the spoke many times.
[time=2540] You've been held back by what's happened in the past in a church setting.
[time=2543] And it was maybe a really big deal for you just to sit here today.
[time=2547] I want to speak into your heart and tell you that today, the God who created the church and made it to be what it is, that still loved those very people that hurt you and did all the wrong things that they shouldn't have done that made you feel about the church the way that you do right now.
[time=2562] The same God who created them, the same God who created you, still loves you, still loves them, still loves his church just the same.
[time=2570] And my challenge, my heartbeat, my cry to you today is learn what it means to go to church and be a part of the church, not because of how good the people there are, but because of how good he is, because it's his church.
[time=2586] It's not their church anyway, it's not my church, it's not your church, it's his church.
[time=2592] Remember who he is, remember what he's done and when we do that, we can experience what the church is truly all about.
[time=2601] Forget not all his benefits.
[time=2603] And you know, I think of Blackhawk and I think of the last couple of years, the journey that you've been on, trying to find God's next leader here.
[time=2610] And here I am and God put pieces together and I love that story because I'll tell you, we've talked about it over and over a couple of years ago.
[time=2617] You say, well, why did it have to take two years? Why was the journey have so many ups and downs?
[time=2621] I know it did, I know how those journeys can go.
[time=2624] Well, I can tell you a couple of years ago where we were, you know, God was still doing some things in us that would have us at a place where this would be possible, where we would take a step like this.
[time=2632] His timing has worked it all out, but here's what I want to say to you as you look back at the journey we've been on here at Blackhawk.
[time=2639] Don't allow the ways that maybe you've been heard.
[time=2642] Don't allow the things that you didn't like.
[time=2644] Don't allow the things that you wish were done differently to hold you back from what God wants to do in the future.
[time=2650] Because what he's done over the last several years, what he's done throughout the history of this church, because it's his church, he knew we would be here in this moment.
[time=2659] The day Blackhawk ministries began.
[time=2661] He knew all of those things.
[time=2663] Here's what I want to tell you.
[time=2664] The God that God you hear will get you there.
[time=2667] The God that brought you to this moment will take you to the next.
[time=2671] He's just getting started.
[time=2675] Remember what he has done.
[time=2678] You know, a lot of times our kids, they'll say things like, "Never." I don't like that word.
[time=2684] We work on that word in our house.
[time=2686] Well, we've never done that before, right?
[time=2689] And I remember we took my little boy.
[time=2691] He was our first, and we took him to the beach when he was real little.
[time=2694] I think his first trip was when I was in Africa, right?
[time=2697] Yeah.
[time=2698] Okay.
[time=2699] And then we took him back to the beach.
[time=2700] So he'd been to the beach twice.
[time=2701] That makes my story even better.
[time=2702] All right.
[time=2703] So yeah, he'd been to the beach twice.
[time=2704] But I remember the next time we went to the beach, he was old enough to kind of, you know, see what's going on.
[time=2708] He said, "Dad, I've never been to the beach before." I sat him down.
[time=2714] I don't care how little he is.
[time=2715] I sat him down.
[time=2716] I wasn't mean.
[time=2717] I'm just kidding here.
[time=2718] I sat him down.
[time=2719] I said, "No.
[time=2720] Mommy and I've taken you to the beach.
[time=2721] We spent a lot of money to take you to the beach." You've been to the beach.
[time=2725] Not yet.
[time=2726] You've been to the beach boy.
[time=2730] But we'll say things like never.
[time=2732] And I've told you the one thing I always said I would never do is be a pastor like my dad.
[time=2737] Yeah.
[time=2738] We've been there.
[time=2739] We've seen that story.
[time=2740] Be careful with your nevers.
[time=2742] Be careful that you don't hold on to those things that God wants you to let go of and let the memories and certainly a young little child.
[time=2749] But it's a great representation of what we do, isn't it?
[time=2752] We forget the things that God has already done.
[time=2755] I didn't blame my three-year-old son for forgetting that he'd have been to the beach.
[time=2759] But shame on us when we forget how faithful God has been in the times we've needed him the most.
[time=2765] Let's remember what he has done.
[time=2767] And I believe this, the more you remember all God has done, the more you can focus on what he will do.
[time=2774] Write that down if you're taking notes.
[time=2775] The more we remember what God has done, the more we can focus on what he will do.
[time=2781] What he will do.
[time=2783] Gosh, so many times I get held back from the new things God wants to start in my life.
[time=2789] Because I'm so hung up on the things that didn't go the way I thought they should go.
[time=2793] My challenge to you today is let those things go.
[time=2796] Let those things stay in the past.
[time=2797] Move forward into the future because God's got new things in store for you.
[time=2803] Number three, remember who he has made me.
[time=2805] Remember who he is.
[time=2806] Remember what he's done.
[time=2808] Remember who he has made me.
[time=2811] Our memory verse.
[time=2812] 2 Corinthians 5, 17.
[time=2814] I'm a new creation.
[time=2816] Anyone who's in Christ is a new creation.
[time=2818] The old has passed away.
[time=2820] The new has come.
[time=2822] I'm a new creation.
[time=2824] You know, I used to think that God would convict me of my sin.
[time=2828] We're talking about the Holy Spirit today.
[time=2829] One of his jobs is to convict.
[time=2831] I used to think that God would convict me of my sin by reminding me of my shame.
[time=2836] By showing me my sin.
[time=2838] But it changed everything the day I realized the Holy Spirit convicts me of my sin.
[time=2842] By reminding me who I am in Jesus.
[time=2845] The Holy Spirit convicts me of my sin, of all the things that I'm doing wrong in my life.
[time=2850] By reminding me how righteous I am.
[time=2852] And when I see how righteous I am in the eyes of God that when God sees me and I know Jesus, he sees the blood of Jesus and his perfection in spite of my weaknesses.
[time=2861] Then I start to see all the things that don't fit in with the perfection and the righteousness of Jesus.
[time=2865] Those things stand out all the more.
[time=2867] And that's why a lot of people have asked me for, why don't you preach on sin more?
[time=2871] Here's my answer to that.
[time=2873] I do every week.
[time=2875] Do you not listen?
[time=2876] It's like, no, you don't.
[time=2877] You don't call people sin out.
[time=2878] Here's what I've learned.
[time=2879] I don't need to do that.
[time=2881] You brought that stuff in.
[time=2882] Just find on your own.
[time=2883] You don't need a preacher's help to bring that up, do you?
[time=2885] You looked in the mirror this morning.
[time=2887] Some of you, right?
[time=2889] Here's what I found.
[time=2892] The Holy Spirit uses who God is, what he has done and who he has made us to be.
[time=2900] That's the mirror.
[time=2901] That's why scripture becomes that mirror.
[time=2903] And as we preach and as we learn and as we dig into who he is, what he's done in our lives, we start to see us differently.
[time=2911] We preach about the righteousness of God that he has put on us, the imputed righteousness.
[time=2916] That's what that means, the theological term where he puts his righteousness on us in the filthiness that we are.
[time=2921] He puts it on us.
[time=2922] And when we see that, all the sins, all the problems that we have in our life, they stand out just fine, don't they?
[time=2929] We see those things just fine.
[time=2931] And so a lot of times you come to church and you just try to avoid the religious roosters.
[time=2936] I like to call them.
[time=2937] You ever met a religious rooster?
[time=2939] Look at this guy on the screen.
[time=2941] You ever met a religious rooster?
[time=2943] They just crow at you.
[time=2945] Well, you should have done this.
[time=2947] Shame on you for that.
[time=2949] You do that to yourself just fine, don't you?
[time=2951] You did not need my help.
[time=2952] And I'll tell you, my goal is not to be another religious rooster.
[time=2955] Jesus was not a religious rooster who went around crowing at people how terrible that they are.
[time=2960] He went and met them where they are.
[time=2962] He sat down at the wells of their life and said, "I know where you are." And he said, "I know the things that are going on in your life, but let me tell you who I am." And when we meet the "I am," it changes everything about how we see ourselves and our actions
[time=2976] and how we live out through the memories and through the steps that we take in our lives.
[time=2982] And so my role is not to be a religious rooster in your life.
[time=2986] Screaming at you all the things you've done wrong because you know you're here for those things.
[time=2991] When you look at the word, when you look at the scripture, it's a mirror and it points those things out, just fine.
[time=2997] And so my rooster is pretty hard on me, just so you know.
[time=3001] My religious rooster, it even uses bad language at me sometimes.
[time=3004] Your rooster is probably a Christian rooster, right?
[time=3007] No, you don't have those either.
[time=3010] Now I want to challenge you today.
[time=3013] Hear me.
[time=3015] I want to challenge you to forget your defeat so that you can bask in his victory.
[time=3022] Forget your defeat.
[time=3024] Remember where you've come from.
[time=3026] Remember what God's done.
[time=3027] I'm not saying you just forget it.
[time=3028] It's going to be there.
[time=3029] It's going to be a part of who you are.
[time=3030] But forget living in the defeat so that you can just live in light of the victory he's already won.
[time=3035] Because here's the thing.
[time=3036] I've read the end.
[time=3037] I've read through this a few times in my life.
[time=3039] And every time I get to the end, I realize he wins.
[time=3043] He wins.
[time=3044] Actually, the best way to say it is he won.
[time=3048] It is finished.
[time=3050] And because it is finished today, you don't have to fight for victory.
[time=3054] You fight from victory because you know Jesus.
[time=3059] That will change your memory.
[time=3060] That will change how you look at the world around you every single day.
[time=3064] And to wrap this up, look at 2 Peter.
[time=3066] We're going to put this on the screen for you.
[time=3068] 2 Peter, chapter 1.
[time=3070] I love this passage because it's about Peter.
[time=3072] I talked earlier in the series about how after Peter denied Jesus and the religious rooster.
[time=3077] The rooster crowed Peter denied Jesus.
[time=3080] And in Luke, it talks about the look that Jesus gave to Peter.
[time=3084] And I talked about that a little bit.
[time=3086] It doesn't really spell it all out for us.
[time=3089] But I love that passage says that Peter locked eyes with Jesus.
[time=3093] The look of Jesus caught him.
[time=3094] And he remembered.
[time=3095] A lot of people say, yeah, he remembered that he was a loser.
[time=3098] He remembered that he had denied Jesus.
[time=3100] Yeah, I'm sure he remembered that.
[time=3102] But there was something else there.
[time=3103] Because what do you think the look of Jesus was like?
[time=3104] You think it went something like this?
[time=3111] I don't think so.
[time=3113] I think it went something like a look of love.
[time=3117] A look of, I'm going to restore you, Peter.
[time=3120] I'm still going to do all those things I promised I was going to do through you.
[time=3123] Yes, you blew it and you blew it big time.
[time=3126] But you're still going to be that rock that I've renamed you to be.
[time=3130] And it's that same Peter who on the day of Pentecost, the Spirit came down and did through him things that a fisherman of his liking could never, ever, ever do.
[time=3140] And it's that same Peter at the end of his life when he was crucified.
[time=3144] When he was crucified for his faith and living it out that he wrote this toward the end of his life in 2 Peter chapter 1 verse 2, he knew his life was coming to a close at this point.
[time=3154] He said, may grace and peace be multiplied.
[time=3156] I love that because we're talking about how our memory manages the multiplication in our life.
[time=3162] May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge, listen, whole of the series.
[time=3165] That word for knowledge means a whole lot more than just head knowledge.
[time=3169] And we'll talk about that maybe another time.
[time=3171] It's the heart knowledge.
[time=3172] But anyway, the knowledge of God of Jesus, our Lord.
[time=3174] Here's what I want you to hear as we wrap up today.
[time=3176] In verse 3, his divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness
[time=3184] through the knowledge of him who calls us to his own glory and excellence by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises so that through them you may become
[time=3195] partakers of the divine nature having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.
[time=3205] That same Peter who saw the look of the Lord in his darkest moment was reminded that God
[time=3213] was not done with him yet.
[time=3215] And because of that at the end of his life, he finished well and wrote those words to tell
[time=3221] you and me that you have, you have, you have everything you need for life and godliness.
[time=3229] Not because you have it, but because Jesus has had it long before you ever came to be.
[time=3235] And he's inside of you through his spirit reminding you of things right now.
[time=3240] I'm going to ask you just to bow your heads and reflect on that.
[time=3242] I want to challenge you with two questions.
[time=3245] Two questions, two challenges for your week.
[time=3248] They're in your bulletin so you don't have to write them down if you want to take them home and look at them.
[time=3252] But I think you'll remember them just fine.
[time=3253] The first question is this, just close your eyes and reflect on this for a moment.
[time=3257] What reminder did the Holy Spirit place on your heart today?
[time=3262] What did he remind you of?
[time=3265] Like I say, it may have been an excavation of something you've known all of your life, but today it carries a new meaning.
[time=3271] What reminder did he place on your heart?
[time=3273] And secondly, how can that reminder multiply this week?
[time=3276] How can that reminder multiply?
[time=3278] In other words, what does it look like to walk out that reminder and live it out in your life?
[time=3283] I challenge you to reflect on that right now.
[time=3286] I want to speak to those of you who may not know Jesus.
[time=3289] We're just going to give you a moment at the end of this service.
[time=3292] I'm not going to sing another song.
[time=3293] I'm just going to give you a moment in your seats just to reflect, just to let God work,
[time=3299] just to be reminded of who he is, of what he's done, and of who he wants to make you in your life.
[time=3307] Some of you would say, I just don't know that I have a personal relationship with Jesus today.
[time=3312] Maybe you came in and you were wanting to find out who he is.
[time=3316] My challenge to you is don't make complicated what God has made so simple.
[time=3322] Don't make complicated what God has made so simple.
[time=3325] Salvation is not about works, not that you can get there on your own because if we could do that, we could boast about it and it would be about us.
[time=3332] No, it's by grace through faith that we have been saved.
[time=3336] And that can be you today. It really is that simple.
[time=3339] And if you wait until you get your life cleaned up, until you get things in order that day of salvation will never come.
[time=3347] Start with Jesus and he'll start chiseling away at the layers of your life with you.
[time=3352] You can go a lot farther when he's a part of your life.
[time=3354] Salvation is not about a prayer. I don't want to lead you in a prayer.
[time=3357] I want to lead you and facilitate just a moment for you to cry out to God what your heart is already saying to him now.
[time=3363] If he's convicting you, if the Holy Spirit is prompting you, cry out to him saying, Jesus, I do need you.
[time=3369] Please save me and forgive me.
[time=3372] I believe you died for me. You did that for me.
[time=3377] I believe your life and because you live, I can live too.
[time=3383] Will you cry that out to him in your own words straight from your heart if you don't know him today?
[time=3387] If you don't know that you spend eternity with him, will you cry now?
[time=3392] Thank you so much for watching today and I pray that God has done something new in your life.
[time=3402] Maybe I've been talking to you. Maybe God has been pouring into your heart today and today is that day of salvation for you.
[time=3408] A lot of times we try to make complicated the simple truth of the gospel.
[time=3412] And maybe today is the day where you stop complicating something that God made to be so simple.
[time=3417] And it's time for you to take that step of accepting Jesus as your Lord and as your Savior.
[time=3422] It's not really about a prayer. It's really about the cry of your heart as we've discussed today.
[time=3426] And so I challenge you, even as you watch this at home wherever you may be right now, I challenge you to just simply reach out to Jesus and say,
[time=3433] "Jesus, I do need you to save me. I do believe that you died for me. I do believe that you're alive today."
[time=3440] And today, even though it feels so complicated, I just trust the simple truth of the gospel and I give you me.
[time=3447] I lay my life down at your feet saying it's no longer mine, but it's all yours.
[time=3452] Will you save me? And scripture promises and God looks at you all of the mess that you see when you look in the mirror.
[time=3459] God looks at you and says, "I have saved you." You can trust that today. And I'm so glad that we can trust that together.
[time=3467] And that's our heart here at Black Hawk Ministries and through the Bible Hour. We want to pray with you.
[time=3472] We want to walk alongside of you. And so will you give us that opportunity.
[time=3475] One of the things that we would like to do to help you in that journey is to get a booklet in your hand.
[time=3479] The booklet looks just like this. It's called Beginning Steps, a Growth Guide for New Believers.
[time=3483] We want to either mail one of these to you. If you're not close by or if you want to come by Black Hawk Ministries, we'd love to get one of these in your hands. So there's going to be an email address and a phone number on your screen.
[time=3492] And we would love to hear from you, even if you have questions, concerns, comments, encouragement for us.
[time=3498] Just want to share your heart and what God's doing in your life. Let us know that so that we can walk on this journey right alongside of you.
[time=3504] And so to wrap things up today, I just simply ask you, how's your memory? In a message like today, we've looked a lot at old memories.
[time=3510] We've looked a lot at how we often forget the things we're supposed to remember and remember the things we're supposed to forget.
[time=3515] But how the Holy Spirit is not just this ghost that hovers around us seeking us out to stalk us.
[time=3522] He's the Holy Spirit of God. He's the presence of God in our life.
[time=3526] He's how God dwells with us and walks with us on a daily basis.
[time=3530] And so my prayer is today, our prayer for you is that His Holy Spirit has reminded you of some of the things you needed to hear.
[time=3537] A lot of times walking in your faith and growing in Jesus isn't really about learning and uncovering new things.
[time=3543] It's really more about the timeless truths of the gospel.
[time=3546] It's more about that excavation where the Holy Spirit reminds you of those things that maybe you've just forgotten.
[time=3551] I pray you've been reminded of some things that will radically change your life and your week.
[time=3555] Let us know how we can serve you, and thank you so much for watching. Thank you for being a part of all this going on here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=3562] And thank you for letting us into your lives. God bless you, and I'll see you soon.
