[time=61] Hi, I'm Ed, and this is a story about our family and how the Lord can bring new meaning into our lives even though our circumstances don't change.
[time=73] My daughter, Audrey, was born in 1986 for those of you Bears fans the day that they won the Super Bowl.
[time=80] When she was born, she was normal, and for the first six months or so, she progressed normally.
[time=86] Then at six months, she began to have seizures, and as that started to unfold, she had more and more of those, and finally we had to put her on medication.
[time=98] The hard thing for us was, you know, understanding that, accepting that, and it was especially hard on my wife, Marcia.
[time=108] She began to lose weight, she couldn't eat, when she'd get up every morning, she'd have a piece of toast and throw up and maybe drink some milk, and that was all she could eat.
[time=121] And she's not very big anyway, but she got down to under 100 pounds, and it got so bad that one day she said to me, I'm going to go home, I'm leaving.
[time=133] And I remember thinking, I'm not sure what I'm going to do, and I even, I called my father out in California, and he said, well, you might need to prepare yourself, she might not be coming back.
[time=146] And I don't think he thought any less of her, he just knew how bad it was.
[time=153] So she got on the airplane, and the day that she got on the airplane, she was ready to go, I was going to take her to the airport, and that very day, Audrey had another seizure, this time a really long one, maybe 10, 12 minutes.
[time=168] And the ambulance came, and I had to leave and go to the hospital while she went to be with her parents.
[time=175] But the Lord used her father, who loved the Lord, and when she got there, he picked her up from the airport, they drove by the store and picked up two six packs of insurer.
[time=187] And he brought her home, and he sat her down, and he said, here, take your insurer, drink this, and now listen to this.
[time=194] And he opened his Bible, and he shared with her, and he did that every day for three weeks.
[time=200] And I'm so thankful, because after about two and a half weeks, her mom made a big dinner, and she was able to eat something.
[time=209] And I'm thankful for a man who loved his daughter that much, and who loved the Lord that much, that he would spend time with her like that.
[time=219] She finally came home after three weeks, and when she did, she was not the same person, and she's never been the same person.
[time=226] It's still hard. We still go through a lot of difficult times with Audra. She still has seizures every seven to ten days, but we don't look at them in the same way.
[time=238] Marcia wrote a letter to Audra for a project that my daughter Hillary was doing in college, and I wanted to read that for you right now.
[time=248] My dear sweet Audra, I love you. Your mental disability with your seizures was frightening to me at first.
[time=256] I have grown in emotional strength in caring for you. You have been given to your dad and I by God to give all the special care God knows we could give.
[time=267] When I wash your hair, God gave you curl and wave, like your dad's, so when it dries, it looks so pretty.
[time=276] On your good days, I enjoy seeing your pretty smile when you sit in the rocker and watch your favorite DVD.
[time=284] When you and I go to the grocery store, you march like a little soldier behind the cart because you're happy. I never mind the looks.
[time=294] Jesus washed the feet of His disciples, so in a small way, as I get on my knees to change your pull-up diaper, I have the opportunity to serve you.
[time=306] Having you in my life has brought pain, but also blessing. God wasn't asleep when He made you.
[time=314] He knows our struggles with you, but it has softened my heart, changed my perspective, and helped me to be an advocate for you in this world.
[time=325] I can't wait to hear you call me mom in heaven and all the great walks and talks we will have.
[time=333] Till then, I will dress you, bathe you, feed you, and tuck you in bed.
[time=341] I will sing words of Jesus over you. I love you very much, mom.
[time=351] You're scarlet thread, woven in my life, the only thing I find that's holding me.
[time=363] You're crimson flood, poured out on my life, the only thing I find that covers me.
[time=379] You mercies every day.
[time=385] New reasons that I can't say.
[time=393] I am weak, but you are able. I have failed, but you are faithful.
[time=400] Jesus, you are holding on to me.
[time=407] You are beyond regret and sorrow, every sin is washed, and I know that Jesus, you are holding on to me.
[time=429] And help your hands, fading in my life, the only thing I find that's holding me.
[time=443] Precious blood, poured out on my life, the only thing I find that covers me.
[time=457] You mercies every day.
[time=462] New reasons that I can't say.
[time=471] I am weak, but you are able. I have failed, but you are faithful.
[time=478] Jesus, you are holding on to me.
[time=485] You are beyond regret and sorrow, every sin is washed, and I know that Jesus, you are holding on to me.
[time=499] Oh Jesus, you are holding on to me.
[time=506] Oh the precious blood, the precious blood, that takes away my sin.
[time=566] You are beyond regret and sorrow, every sin is washed, and I know that Jesus, you are holding on to me.
[time=595] I am weak, but you are able, I have failed, but you are faithful.
[time=602] Jesus, you are holding on to me.
[time=611] Yes, sorrow, every sin is washed, and I know that Jesus, you are holding on to me.
[time=624] Jesus, you are holding on to me.
[time=639] Skyd red, old and in my life.
[time=652] The only thing I find, it's holy.
[time=669] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=730] Well today has been an overwhelmingly special day already.
[time=736] I pray that you fill the joy and the excitement of just all the things that God has in store.
[time=743] And if you haven't noticed, there's a theme that runs through today, and it's the theme of just simply new, new.
[time=751] It's a new day here at Black Hawk, we're starting a new season, yes, but there's a little more to that theme
[time=757] than it just being a new day here at Black Hawk.
[time=760] What we want to do in this six week series, what I want to pour into your life through the power of God's Word
[time=766] is a couple of key things in this series.
[time=768] Number one, the fact that new is the story of the Gospel.
[time=773] Jesus came to make all things new.
[time=777] But here's the best part, we're going to look at that in this six week series, but we're also going to look at the fact that God wants to do something new in your, yes, your life.
[time=788] He's got a new plan, a new season, he wants to turn a new page in some way in your story.
[time=794] And you know, I'm so excited about the new day that's here at Black Hawk, and I want to thank you.
[time=799] I want to just take just a moment to say thank you to my Black Hawk family for being a family.
[time=805] I was thinking about family a lot this week, we had our whole family as you heard and seen both of my parents,
[time=811] both of Jessica's parents, and both of my sisters are all here with me.
[time=816] They're here to celebrate, they're here to affirm, they're here to be a part of all this new that's coming into our life,
[time=823] and for that we're so grateful and I don't take for granted how special it is to have a family that way.
[time=829] I was thinking about that just last night.
[time=831] And you know, here's what I know though, when I was thinking about that, some of you have that kind of family, some of you have that kind of blessed assurance of God circling around you
[time=841] through the lens of your family, but here's what I also know.
[time=844] I also know that some of you may not, and for some of you family looks a little bit different than my dynamic.
[time=851] And then I got to thinking about the family that I've experienced here at Black Hawk, and then I started thinking about you.
[time=857] Many of you received one of the 5,000 invitation cards that were given out over the last three weeks by all of us here at Black Hawk.
[time=866] And you're here maybe to check out this new pastor, see how bad he really is or how good he is, do I like him or do I not like him.
[time=873] I'm fully aware of that, but here's what I know.
[time=876] I know that you're here because you're desiring something that's more than what you found in life.
[time=882] Thank you for all of us, we can all say, that's me.
[time=886] And so you're here, whatever you're here for today, I know that just as I've thought about what family really means,
[time=892] and what I've experienced from you, my Black Hawk family, you too hear me, you too can experience that, that community, that love, that embrace.
[time=903] Why? You say you don't know me, you're right, I don't, but Jesus does, and Jesus put us together in this place
[time=910] so that we could be a family, and here's what families do, especially the family that Jesus established and called the church,
[time=917] and said I will build my church and the gates of hell won't prevail against it.
[time=921] That one, that winning team, here's what that looks like.
[time=924] It looks like us locking arms facing outwardly, facing a world that's broken, a world that needs something new.
[time=933] You're a part of that today, even if you don't feel like it now, I trust you're going to by the time you leave this place today.
[time=939] That's the kind of family that Jesus came to establish.
[time=943] That's the kind of newness that we can establish as a church, and so we're going to kick off this new series.
[time=949] Six weeks we're going to be looking at this concept, the story of newness in the gospel.
[time=953] Today's all about new meaning, new meaning.
[time=956] Some of you came looking for some meaning, some purpose today.
[time=960] Second Corinthians chapter 5 is our passage, you've got your bibles, look there with me.
[time=963] Second Corinthians 5, we're going to look at verses 14 through 21.
[time=969] And as you turn there, I want to challenge you to think about why at times you don't feel new.
[time=976] You ever gotten a new pair of shoes, a new car, moved into a new house?
[time=981] There's a lot of new in my life right now, a lot of new things, and it feels good in a lot of ways, but it can also feel kind of uncomfortable in a lot of ways too, can it?
[time=990] But we love when the newness of life is upon us.
[time=993] We love when we enter a new season.
[time=996] A lot of times we just get to itching for something else that is new.
[time=1000] And so here's the question, why do we not feel new?
[time=1003] I want to submit three reasons why we don't feel very new at times in our life.
[time=1008] Maybe you can identify with some, if not a couple, if not all of these.
[time=1011] Number one, history.
[time=1013] We don't feel new sometimes because of our history, what I did.
[time=1017] That's what I did.
[time=1019] The scars of the past.
[time=1021] We get stuck there, and we camp out there, and we don't feel very new.
[time=1025] Number two, hurts.
[time=1026] Not just history, but hurts.
[time=1028] Not what I did, but maybe what someone did to me.
[time=1032] And we get stuck there.
[time=1033] The hurts of our past hold us back and help us feel like nothing's new in our life.
[time=1038] Maybe habits.
[time=1039] Number three, habits.
[time=1041] The stuff that I continue to do.
[time=1043] And if you're honest, can you identify with me and say I've got a few bad habits?
[time=1048] And those bad habits will hold you back every single day from the new things God wants you to experience unless they're purposed towards what He wants them to be purposed towards.
[time=1057] I want my life to be all about His agenda and not my agenda.
[time=1061] That's what put us together because God has an agenda that's way bigger than mine.
[time=1067] So maybe you can identify with me, and maybe it's your history, maybe it's your hurts, maybe it's your habits.
[time=1071] But something in your life is holding you back from embracing the newness that God wants to bring about.
[time=1076] You may say, I don't know what's holding me back.
[time=1078] I don't know what the newness is that God wants to bring about.
[time=1081] I just need something.
[time=1083] Well, you're in the right place.
[time=1085] That seems really confusing, really overwhelming.
[time=1088] But I want to challenge you just to take a breath with me.
[time=1091] Can you do that with me?
[time=1092] Just take it in.
[time=1093] Just let it out.
[time=1096] Sit back and rest in this moment knowing that God's Word, knowing that the power of Jesus Christ is bigger than how overwhelming your life feels, knowing that the power of Jesus Christ is bigger than your history, is bigger than your hurts,
[time=1112] and is bigger than your habits.
[time=1114] And it's confusing as it feels to you to know how to walk through all of that as a journey, as confusing and overwhelming as it is, Jesus is bigger.
[time=1124] And He wants to do something new.
[time=1127] Will you allow Him to do just that?
[time=1130] New starts within you.
[time=1132] But a lot of times we look for the newness to start around us.
[time=1136] Not within me, but around me.
[time=1138] Anybody heard about this election thing happening soon?
[time=1142] Okay, just checking.
[time=1144] Some of you look for your security.
[time=1146] Look for the newness that maybe you feel like this country needs, and you're probably right.
[time=1151] But your security is tied up in that.
[time=1154] And you wonder what's going to happen is so uncertain.
[time=1157] What's going to happen with our country?
[time=1159] But your newness and how you feel about your life and your security and your meaning often gets tied to things like the government, things like elections.
[time=1168] I want you to know something.
[time=1169] I want to put you at ease.
[time=1170] Are you ready?
[time=1171] You're saying, I didn't think you'd start with a political rant.
[time=1173] Well, here's why I am.
[time=1175] I want you to know that it doesn't matter who sits in any chair in this nation or any other chair.
[time=1180] The one chair that matters is the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords, and it will always be Jesus Christ.
[time=1187] (Applause) And it's the same Jesus who sits in that chair who knows the chair that you sit in right now.
[time=1198] That chair may be of brokenness, of searching, of pain.
[time=1203] He knows where you are.
[time=1205] I want to challenge you.
[time=1206] Don't find your meaning.
[time=1208] Don't find your security and the stuff that's happening around you.
[time=1212] And even in your relationships or your circumstances, the government, the election.
[time=1217] Don't find your meaning.
[time=1218] Don't find your hope.
[time=1219] Don't find your security.
[time=1221] Don't find your purpose in anything that's going on around you.
[time=1224] Find it all from what's going on within you because God's doing something new.
[time=1230] We've got a theme verse, the second Corinthians 5, 17.
[time=1233] And every week for these six weeks, I want us to say it together.
[time=1236] It's going to be on the screen for you.
[time=1237] And I hope by the end of six weeks, we're going to memorize this verse together.
[time=1241] And as I walk through the hallways, I'm going to be testing you.
[time=1243] Are you ready?
[time=1245] And you can test me too.
[time=1246] All right.
[time=1247] So we're going to memorize this together.
[time=1248] You ready?
[time=1249] Let's read it together.
[time=1250] Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[time=1256] The old has passed away.
[time=1258] Say this with heart and meaning.
[time=1259] Behold, the new has come.
[time=1262] The new has come.
[time=1264] Say that again.
[time=1265] The new has come.
[time=1267] It's here in your life.
[time=1270] And it's welling up on the inside of you.
[time=1272] Even though all that's true though, do you ever find it hard to see clearly on a spiritual
[time=1278] level?
[time=1279] It's still hard sometimes because there's so many meaningful, purposeful directions that we could go with our life and where our focus and our perspective could be taken.
[time=1287] And it's still so hard to see clearly.
[time=1290] But here's what I'll submit to you.
[time=1292] How you see will always determine how you be.
[time=1301] In other words, how I live my life gets directed by what lens I'm looking through.
[time=1307] My perspective, how I see the world around me is going to determine how I live out my life, how I see is going to determine how I be.
[time=1314] I remember when I got contacts.
[time=1316] Anybody else were contacts in the building?
[time=1318] I wouldn't see you if I didn't have those contacts.
[time=1321] But I remember I had to get contacts because I had worn glasses for several years.
[time=1325] I was playing baseball.
[time=1326] Baseball is a big part of my story.
[time=1327] You'll hear more and more about some of my story.
[time=1330] But I needed to get contacts because my glasses were fogging up and it was holding me back.
[time=1334] And so I got these contacts and my parents are here and I will never forget in their bathroom.
[time=1339] I'll still remember being scared.
[time=1341] I've got this phobia of something getting my eye.
[time=1343] So if you really want to freak me out, come out like you're going to poke my eye.
[time=1347] But be warned, you may get knocked down.
[time=1350] My parents know that really well because I remember getting those contacts.
[time=1354] We couldn't put them in at the office.
[time=1356] It was kind of against their rules.
[time=1358] But we said, let's just do it at home.
[time=1361] And we went home and I remember standing with my back against the wall.
[time=1364] Why did I share this story on my first Sunday, right?
[time=1367] I don't know.
[time=1368] Here we are.
[time=1369] I've got to finish it now.
[time=1370] I remember standing with my back against the wall.
[time=1373] My parents holding my eye open.
[time=1375] Here it comes.
[time=1377] And after I don't know how long we got it in.
[time=1382] And I've worn contacts ever since and man did it help me play baseball better.
[time=1387] It helped me see more clearly.
[time=1389] It helped me be a better guy, a better ball player in the same way as painful as it is
[time=1395] to put in the contacts, the lenses that God wants you to look through.
[time=1399] If you will go through the pain of seeing things God's way, he's going to change how you be
[time=1406] in your life, how you see will determine how you be.
[time=1410] Write this down if you're taking notes.
[time=1412] This is really the bottom line.
[time=1413] I'm going to try to give you a bottom line every week.
[time=1415] We will learn each other as we go.
[time=1416] But this is what I hope you can remember.
[time=1418] The bottom line is that new starts with your view.
[time=1421] Look at somebody and say new starts with a view.
[time=1423] Tell them.
[time=1424] Your perspective is going to define your purpose.
[time=1428] Let's look at 2 Corinthians 5.
[time=1430] There's a few pieces of meaning that I believe we can find from this awesome passage.
[time=1434] Let's start by reading verses 14 and 15.
[time=1437] And so there's three new views that I want to challenge you with today from this passage.
[time=1441] The first one is a new view of he.
[time=1443] A new view of he.
[time=1445] And I'll ask you, as I read this passage, verses 14 and 15, what does he mean to you?
[time=1453] What does Jesus mean to you?
[time=1457] Now you would say, well, we're in a church.
[time=1459] Everybody would say the same thing.
[time=1461] Now, some of you, he's just a good man, just a good teacher.
[time=1466] Some of you, he lived a good life and maybe we can learn a few things from him.
[time=1470] Some of you, he's the king of kings and the Lord of lords.
[time=1473] Some of you are in between those things.
[time=1475] Some of you don't know.
[time=1476] But I believe that scripture is going to help us shape.
[time=1478] I believe that God is going to work in your heart and give you a new view of he.
[time=1482] A new view of what he wants to do in your life.
[time=1484] Verses 14 and 15, for the love of Christ controls us.
[time=1491] I love that word.
[time=1492] The love of Christ controls us.
[time=1494] Some virgins will say compels us because we have concluded this or we have been convinced
[time=1502] of this.
[time=1503] We've concluded this that one has died for all, therefore all have died.
[time=1508] And he died for all that those who live, that's you and me, by the way, might no longer live for themselves, but for him who for their sake died and was raised.
[time=1519] That's the new story of the gospel.
[time=1522] But here's the beautiful part about the new story of the gospel is this old news because it already happened.
[time=1528] I'm so glad that the newness we get from knowing Jesus comes from something that happened centuries ago.
[time=1534] Something that has been finished.
[time=1536] Something that he did and completed and finished a long time before you and I came to
[time=1542] be.
[time=1543] It's done.
[time=1544] It is finished.
[time=1545] And because of what he has done, we can live in light of that in a way that changes everything about who we are, everything about how we live our lives.
[time=1553] That word controls, let's talk about that for a minute.
[time=1556] The love of Christ controls us.
[time=1559] That word controls really, I love this.
[time=1561] I love this.
[time=1562] I'll just love the Bible.
[time=1564] I love the intentionality of Scripture.
[time=1567] If you look at the meaning of that Greek word, it really means to hold together.
[time=1571] To hold together.
[time=1574] Anybody ever feel like your life's fallen apart?
[time=1577] Ever feel like you could just use somebody to hold you together?
[time=1581] Well, guess what?
[time=1582] The love of Christ was built just for that.
[time=1584] To hold you together when you feel like things are crumbling around you, to control, to compel,
[time=1591] to drive, to push, to nudge, and even to knock you down sometimes when you need it the most.
[time=1598] It's the love of Jesus ever knocked you down, thrown you for a loop.
[time=1603] I know every time I look in the mirror and think about who I am in light of who He is, it does just that, if I'm honest.
[time=1610] But the love of Christ controls us.
[time=1613] Because we're convinced, because we know, is what he's talking about.
[time=1617] Some of you came in today as a guest trying to find out, can I be convinced?
[time=1621] I wonder if this new preacher heard Black Hawk aren't folded.
[time=1624] I heard Black Hawk got a new preacher.
[time=1626] We'll see if he can convince me.
[time=1628] Nobody else could.
[time=1629] And I'll have no problem telling you I am here to convince you.
[time=1633] And I hope I do a good job.
[time=1635] But here's what I also know.
[time=1637] I'm not going to do a good enough job.
[time=1639] I can't change you.
[time=1640] I can't lead you into the newness of your life.
[time=1643] I can point you in the direction of the one who can, and His name's Jesus.
[time=1646] That's what I'm here to do.
[time=1648] Every single week is point you to Jesus.
[time=1652] Because He will convince you.
[time=1654] You say, "Well, I haven't been convinced.
[time=1656] We'll open your heart to Him.
[time=1657] Ask Him to show you." And I know He'll do just that.
[time=1660] You don't know that.
[time=1661] I know it because He's done it in my heart and in my life.
[time=1664] And I've watched Him year after year, do it in the hearts and lives of so many people.
[time=1668] I know it because when I look at this world, I see a world that has tried to shut Jesus out of everything.
[time=1673] I see a world that's tried to do away with Scripture, with the Bible.
[time=1677] But I know Jesus is still alive and Scripture's not going anywhere.
[time=1682] That's why you can be convinced.
[time=1684] The best way you can be convinced though is to let Him do something new in your heart.
[time=1688] My testimony is the most convincing thing that I have.
[time=1692] This is a relationship that compels a response.
[time=1695] A relationship for the love of Christ.
[time=1697] That's the relationship.
[time=1699] It controls us.
[time=1700] That's the response.
[time=1701] We're supposed to do something with that life.
[time=1704] Number two, new view of we.
[time=1708] If you talked about a new view of He, hopefully He means something a little different to you now, now that you've seen this Scripture and we've learned from it.
[time=1715] Verse 16 shows us how we should look at other people, a new view of we.
[time=1719] What does we mean to you when it comes to the church, when it comes to your life, when it comes to other people?
[time=1725] We means the same to everybody.
[time=1728] No, same thing as Jesus.
[time=1730] We may mean, well, you know, we can lean on those people that the staff and the elders to do the ministry of the work,
[time=1737] and I just get to come and sit, or I get to write a check, or whatever it may be.
[time=1742] I want to challenge you to know that we mean so much more than that kind of a shallow kind of mindset.
[time=1748] Here's what it means.
[time=1749] It means all of us together, locking arms like I talked about, looking outward at the world that Jesus came to seek and to save.
[time=1757] Why did you come, Jesus, to seek and to save that which was lost?
[time=1761] Well, how are you going to do that?
[time=1762] Jesus is the hope of the world then.
[time=1763] Well, how do we get the hope of the world out?
[time=1765] Because I'm going to build my church, and the gates of hell won't prevail against it.
[time=1770] We are in this together, and we can look at other people.
[time=1773] We can look at the church differently, and also the world around us, because of what we know about Jesus.
[time=1778] Verse 16, 2 Corinthians 5, "From now on, therefore." When you see a "therefore" in the Bible, it's "therefore" a reason.
[time=1786] It means this is there for you to do something with.
[time=1789] From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh.
[time=1794] It's getting real, isn't it?
[time=1797] The first part was pretty good.
[time=1798] Well, I can look at Jesus a little differently.
[time=1800] Now I've got to look at other people differently.
[time=1802] It gets real.
[time=1803] It gets hard.
[time=1804] I don't regard anyone according to the flesh.
[time=1807] He continues, "Even though we once regarded even Jesus Christ according to the flesh, we regard Him thus no longer."
[time=1813] We see He differently, and there now we can see We differently.
[time=1818] When we see Jesus, when we collide with Jesus, it changes everything.
[time=1823] Even how you look at the world around you.
[time=1827] Even how you look at that person in your life.
[time=1831] Yeah, I knew you had that person in your life.
[time=1834] I got him too.
[time=1836] You can laugh.
[time=1837] You know you have him, right?
[time=1839] That person, that person that you see in the grocery store, and you jerk right on over to the next aisle, so you don't have to see him.
[time=1846] That person that just gets under your skin more than anybody else.
[time=1849] That person, I need to keep going.
[time=1852] I can.
[time=1853] Okay, you got it, don't you?
[time=1855] We all have that person in our life, or those people, perhaps, in our life.
[time=1861] But I want to challenge you to know that even those people, you start to see them differently when you collide with Jesus.
[time=1866] When you see He properly, we look a lot different.
[time=1870] It starts to include even those people in your life.
[time=1876] That person that you thought of, what qualities characterize them, please don't say it out loud.
[time=1883] It may be somebody in the room.
[time=1886] What is it that makes them that person?
[time=1893] You're listening some things in your head, and what I would submit to you, and this is going to be painful.
[time=1896] Are you ready?
[time=1897] Everybody brace yourself just a little.
[time=1898] Hold on to the seat.
[time=1900] You have the same qualities.
[time=1904] All of them, everyone.
[time=1906] Well, not as bad, maybe not, but they're there.
[time=1909] And when God looks at you, if He really just looked at you, He would see those qualities, and you would be that person to God, and He would want nothing to do with you.
[time=1919] But the beauty of the new life that God gives us, the beauty of the gospel of Jesus, is that when God looks at you, if you have a relationship with Jesus,
[time=1928] He doesn't see those qualities that you just listed, that yes, even you have, He sees the blood of Jesus, His perfection, the finished work of the cross when He looks at you.
[time=1941] Wow.
[time=1944] That will change the new approach to life.
[time=1947] That will change how you see the world, and here's what I'll challenge you with today.
[time=1952] God's going to finish what He started.
[time=1955] If you look at Scripture, you see in Isaiah, you see in 2 Peter, you see in Revelation, the new heavens and the new earth that are coming, because in Scripture, in the beginning, Genesis chapter 1,
[time=1967] God created everything new and perfect. Something happened.
[time=1970] Now, what happened?
[time=1972] Sin entered the world.
[time=1974] Yeah.
[time=1975] And the new plan that God had was no more.
[time=1979] But I'm so glad that He came up with a new plan to reconcile us back to Him.
[time=1985] He came up with a new way for us to be in relationship with Him.
[time=1989] And here's the thing, all of those scriptures in Isaiah, all the prophecies in 2 Peter and Revelation, when you read the end,
[time=1996] all of that that He started, He will finish.
[time=1999] God does not stop what He starts.
[time=2002] But in the same way, God also has no obligation to finish what He didn't found.
[time=2007] Some of you are like, "Why won't God just give me that paycheck or give me that job?
[time=2011] Why won't God finish what He started?" Well, maybe He didn't start it.
[time=2015] God has no obligation to fund what He didn't found.
[time=2018] God has no obligation to finish what He didn't start.
[time=2021] And that doesn't mean He didn't start that thing that was coming into your mind.
[time=2024] It may just be that He's saying, "Wait a minute.
[time=2026] You've got a lot more to learn before we get there." But two things that I want you to know very clearly today, when we look at we, we look at the world around us,
[time=2035] and God will finish what He started in creation, the new heavens and the new earth.
[time=2039] Everything is going to be made new one day.
[time=2041] And oh, what a day that will be.
[time=2047] When my Jesus eye shall see, I'm going to see Him.
[time=2051] Are you going to join me as a question?
[time=2054] I can't get you there, but He's going to get you there just like you got me there.
[time=2057] If you put your faith in trusting Him because He is going to finish what He started in creation.
[time=2062] But here's where it gets personal.
[time=2064] You've also finished what He started in your life.
[time=2066] Philippians 1, verse 6.
[time=2068] One of my favorite verses, Paul writes, "And I'm sure of this." Remember how convinced was in the early part of this scripture?
[time=2075] The same Paul wrote this one too.
[time=2077] He was pretty convinced.
[time=2078] He was pretty convincing as well.
[time=2080] "For I'm sure of this," Philippians 1, 6, "that He who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ."
[time=2091] Look at your neighbor and with all of your might tell them, God's not done with you yet.
[time=2099] And if nobody told you, I'm going to tell you, God's not done with you yet.
[time=2104] Some of you thought He's finished with me, but He is not done.
[time=2108] He is just getting started.
[time=2115] Will you not allow Him to keep pouring into your life?
[time=2118] Will you not open yourself up to the new things that He has for you?
[time=2123] Number three, the rest of the passage, verses 17 through 21, is a new view of me.
[time=2131] We talked about how we see Him differently.
[time=2133] We see us differently.
[time=2134] Now how do I see me differently?
[time=2136] Verse 17.
[time=2138] This is our memory verse.
[time=2140] "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, He's a new creation.
[time=2143] The old has passed away. Behold, the new has come."
[time=2149] All this is from God.
[time=2151] I love that.
[time=2152] Underline that.
[time=2153] All this is from God.
[time=2154] You didn't do it.
[time=2156] He did.
[time=2157] All this is from God who through Christ reconciled us to Himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation.
[time=2163] That is in Christ, God was reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses, their sins against them.
[time=2170] And entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.
[time=2174] So He gave us two things there.
[time=2176] The ministry of reconciliation and the message of reconciliation.
[time=2180] If something's repeated in Scripture, and even especially when it's repeated but said with a different word and a different meaning, there's probably something to it.
[time=2187] It's probably therefore a reason.
[time=2189] There's probably a "therefore" attached to it.
[time=2192] And we're going to look at that "therefore" because look here.
[time=2195] Verse 20.
[time=2196] "Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ." I do not deserve that title, folks.
[time=2204] An ambassador for Christ.
[time=2206] And then it continues.
[time=2208] God making His appeal through us.
[time=2213] Wow.
[time=2214] We implore you on behalf of Christ.
[time=2216] Be reconciled to God.
[time=2218] For our sake, He made Him to be sin who knew no sin.
[time=2223] So that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.
[time=2229] Oh, there's so much there.
[time=2231] You got another two hours?
[time=2232] Okay, no, I'm just kidding.
[time=2234] We'll go through it a little more quickly.
[time=2235] But I guarantee you, if you'll spend two hours on those verses this week, you'll find a whole lot more than I can give you here in a few minutes.
[time=2241] Let's talk about the new view of me.
[time=2244] I love verse 18 that all of this is from God.
[time=2247] I want to go back to that source question.
[time=2249] Is it the election?
[time=2250] Is it your relationships?
[time=2252] Is it your circumstances?
[time=2254] What's the source of newness in your life today?
[time=2257] Well, verse 18 says all of this is from God.
[time=2260] All of this is from God.
[time=2263] Circle the word us in verse 18 because that includes you and you are the target of reconciliation.
[time=2269] What does reconciliation really mean?
[time=2271] That could mean a lot of things to a lot of people.
[time=2273] Well, I love what it means in this passage.
[time=2277] I love it.
[time=2279] It means to make compatible.
[time=2284] The words there mean three things, restore, change, or exchange.
[time=2290] Exchange is my favorite one.
[time=2292] When you look at the meaning of that word, it means to exchange.
[time=2295] It means that something that's not compatible with something else gets exchanged.
[time=2300] It gets changed.
[time=2301] It gets made over again so that it can be compatible.
[time=2304] Think about a lock and a key.
[time=2306] Have you ever seen a key made before?
[time=2308] It starts with just the straight path and it's supposed to fit in this hole and it doesn't fit in the hole but they run it through the machine.
[time=2314] It gets changed and made over.
[time=2315] You stick it in and it works.
[time=2317] You know the drill.
[time=2318] That's what happens to us when we're reconciled to God.
[time=2321] We're not compatible with God.
[time=2323] We can't fit with God and His new kingdom, the new heaven and the new earth.
[time=2327] We're not good enough for that.
[time=2331] But Jesus came to make us compatible with a God that we could never be compatible with.
[time=2337] He will restore and change and exchange.
[time=2340] I love the exchange because what this scripture talks about, the righteousness we'll get there in a minute, is my righteousness gets traded in for His righteousness.
[time=2348] Who's His?
[time=2349] Jesus.
[time=2350] It doesn't get any more righteous than that.
[time=2352] That's the exchange that happens.
[time=2354] That'll help you see yourself a little different when you look in the mirror.
[time=2358] We chuckle when we talk about looking in the mirror, but there are some of you who really do struggle to look in the mirror because of your history and your hurts and your habits.
[time=2367] Those things that hold you back from the new things God wants to do.
[time=2371] But when you see yourself the way God sees you, it changes everything.
[time=2375] You are reconciled.
[time=2377] The beautiful thing about reconciliation is He does this and not us.
[time=2382] Reconciliation, hear me, does not happen because of you.
[time=2386] Reconciliation happens in spite of you.
[time=2390] Reconciliation happens in spite of what you bring to the table because it's not enough.
[time=2396] And I'm sure glad of it.
[time=2398] I can't do enough to be reconciled to God.
[time=2402] Here's what this really means for us.
[time=2404] I heard a statement this last week and I thought it was good.
[time=2406] I hope I'm storing up some truth in the silence of the moment that we call church today so
[time=2413] that when the storm comes it comes back around.
[time=2416] As I heard the statement that the truth you store up in silence comes back to you in the storm.
[time=2421] That's good.
[time=2422] So I hope now you store up this truth in the silence of this moment.
[time=2428] This new view of yourself in the silence of this moment because either you're in a storm or you're going to a storm and you're going to need the truth that you soak up in those moments.
[time=2438] What does all this mean to be reconciled to God, to have the ministry and the message of reconciliation entrusted to us?
[time=2444] What does that look like?
[time=2445] This is where it starts to get personal.
[time=2447] It really just means what you got you give.
[time=2450] What you got you give.
[time=2454] I got some pretty amazing things from Jesus.
[time=2458] My challenge is not to hoard those things but to give them out.
[time=2464] Here's what verse 19, he doesn't count your sins against you.
[time=2469] There should be a lot of amends in the building.
[time=2473] He doesn't count your sins against you.
[time=2475] He removes sin from the table.
[time=2478] But here's what that often looks like for us.
[time=2480] If we're honest, it looks like God saying, hey, I fixed this, this being our relationship with him.
[time=2486] I fixed this so you can be in a relationship with me.
[time=2489] We're fine with that.
[time=2490] But then it looks like this for us to other people, especially when those hurts and habits and the history comes back into play.
[time=2496] We say, you can't be in a relationship with me though until you fix this.
[time=2500] God says, I fixed this so you can be in a relationship with me.
[time=2503] That doesn't give us the right to say, you can be a relationship with me when you fix this.
[time=2508] I figured there'd be some less amends with that part.
[time=2512] I call this the angry bird Christians.
[time=2516] Anybody ever played angry birds before?
[time=2519] Some of you said, no, not going to happen.
[time=2521] Some of you know what it's all about though.
[time=2523] It's the little bird that he gets in a slingshot.
[time=2525] You pull him back.
[time=2526] I haven't played it personally.
[time=2528] My kids just do, you know.
[time=2531] I have.
[time=2532] Okay.
[time=2533] You pull him back in the slingshot.
[time=2535] The little angry bird is on your phone.
[time=2537] You let him go and he goes and hits the pigs.
[time=2539] Why pigs?
[time=2540] I don't know.
[time=2541] But it downloaded millions and millions of times, games, right?
[time=2545] But here's the thing.
[time=2546] The bird gets shot off and some of you, you're like the angry bird.
[time=2550] Okay?
[time=2551] And I've got a friend here.
[time=2552] I want to show you.
[time=2553] This is you.
[time=2555] Now you know what they are, right?
[time=2558] All right.
[time=2559] This is an angry bird Christian.
[time=2561] You ever met one?
[time=2565] The angry birds are angry because the pigs have stolen their food and so you launch them into the air to tear down the structures and get rid of the pigs so that you get the points and get your food back.
[time=2576] A lot of times we're just like angry birds with our relationships.
[time=2580] We launch ourselves out at people.
[time=2583] We hurt other people.
[time=2585] We launch at them.
[time=2586] But here's the thing.
[time=2587] What happens if you've played that game, the three of you who played that game?
[time=2592] What happens to the bird once he lands, once he's launched?
[time=2598] He explodes.
[time=2602] And you know, that's exactly how it is when we are the angry bird type of Christian that launches ourselves out in anger, in pain, without the joy of the Lord directing us.
[time=2614] We launch ourselves out thinking we can knock down walls, thinking we can make our point, and maybe we do.
[time=2620] But then all that happens is it blows up in our face.
[time=2624] Just like the angry bird game.
[time=2626] I don't want to walk around looking like this guy.
[time=2629] How about you?
[time=2631] Some of you say I'm sitting by him right now, all right?
[time=2635] There he is.
[time=2639] I want to challenge you not to be the angry bird Christian this week.
[time=2643] The ministry of reconciliation starts with you being willing to reconcile yourself with those that maybe you've alienated.
[time=2650] Those that have hurt you.
[time=2652] Those that you have hurt.
[time=2655] Those you want nothing to do with.
[time=2660] A name's already come to mind, I'm guessing.
[time=2662] If not, I want to challenge you to pray and ask for God to show you what reconciliation means for you this week.
[time=2668] So you don't have to be the angry bird Christian.
[time=2671] So you don't have to be that person who says, "God, I know you fixed our relationship so we could be together, but I'm not fixing my relationship with them until they do this.
[time=2681] I'm so glad God didn't look at me and say, "When Kevin, when you get that squared away, we can be in a relationship."
[time=2689] So the ministry and the message of reconciliation, even though it's painful, means putting aside all of the history, all of the hurts, all of the habits that hold us back and being reconciled to those around us.
[time=2701] When we see him differently, we cannot see ourselves the same.
[time=2705] Because of verse 21, you're an ambassador.
[time=2708] God is making his appeal to the world through you.
[time=2711] You are God's weapon of choice.
[time=2717] You say, "Well, if he was God, he sure could have done better than me." I agree.
[time=2721] Believe me.
[time=2722] But he's smarter than I am, so I'll go with his choice.
[time=2725] He chose me and he chose you.
[time=2727] You're an ambassador for Jesus.
[time=2730] You're his weapon of choice.
[time=2732] And you don't feel equipped.
[time=2733] I've lived by the motto that God does not call the equipped, but he equips the called.
[time=2739] Some of you have already heard some of my story.
[time=2741] I could not speak in front of people in high school.
[time=2743] If my grade depended on it, several times it did.
[time=2746] Several times it didn't make very good grades.
[time=2748] I hid in the back of the class.
[time=2750] I can't preach.
[time=2752] Well, that's what God wanted to do.
[time=2754] And I've been a living testimony of the fact that God doesn't call people who are equipped, but he equips the people he calls.
[time=2760] And if you don't feel very equipped, verse 21 is going to change that.
[time=2763] I believe it in your heart and in your life.
[time=2765] Verse 21 tells us that he made him who knew no sin to be sin.
[time=2770] That's Jesus.
[time=2771] Why?
[time=2772] So that you could become the righteousness of God.
[time=2777] That word become does not mean experience.
[time=2781] Live it out every now and then.
[time=2783] Taste it and then realize you're not good enough for it.
[time=2786] To become means to produce or grow or exist by creation.
[time=2792] Exist by creation.
[time=2794] He created.
[time=2795] He grew inside of you.
[time=2797] Not your righteousness, but his.
[time=2799] Jesus looks at you, yes, even after that weekend where you made all those mistakes.
[time=2804] If you know Jesus, he looks at you and he sees the blood of Jesus.
[time=2810] Even after your biggest mistakes.
[time=2812] That's why we could never fathom the love of God.
[time=2814] You have become the righteousness of God.
[time=2819] Do you see yourself a little differently?
[time=2822] I promise you will if you can let that soak.
[time=2825] Let that truth absorb into your life.
[time=2828] And then guess what?
[time=2829] How you see is going to challenge and change how you be.
[time=2834] How you live.
[time=2835] I'm going to ask you just to bow your heads for a moment.
[time=2838] Nobody looking around.
[time=2839] If you know Jesus today, we're going to sing beautiful things in just a moment.
[time=2843] I love that song because it says you make beautiful things out of the dust.
[time=2847] Some of you feel like your life is that dust.
[time=2850] Some of you know Jesus, but you're not looking at yourself properly and therefore you don't see the world around you the way that God wants you to.
[time=2858] Some of you had someone placed on your heart that you need to reconcile with.
[time=2863] You need to apologize too.
[time=2865] And apologize doesn't mean like hey, if I made you mad then I'm sorry.
[time=2870] No, apologize is hey, I hurt you when I did this and for that I am sorry.
[time=2878] Some of you are waiting on someone to apologize to you, but you need to take the step just to forgive them anyway, even though they may or may not do that.
[time=2886] There's God's part of their part and my part.
[time=2889] Don't get so caught up in them doing their part that you just neglect your part and forget that God is doing and has done his.
[time=2896] He always will.
[time=2898] Now I want to speak to those of you for just a moment who maybe you don't know Jesus today.
[time=2902] You just don't know that out of the dust you've called your life, God has made beautiful things.
[time=2909] You just don't know that if you were to die today you would spend eternity with Jesus in Heaven.
[time=2915] You just don't know but you'd like to.
[time=2917] Maybe you fought with that being way more complex than what these preachers tell me it is.
[time=2924] I want you to know today that the gospel truly is simple.
[time=2928] So simple that a five-year-old little boy, how do I know I was that little boy, could understand it and embrace it.
[time=2935] The gospel is as simple as saying Jesus you did die for me.
[time=2939] You are alive.
[time=2941] You rose from the dead.
[time=2943] I can't save me but you can.
[time=2946] This life has been mine Jesus but now I lay it at your feet.
[time=2949] That's really what salvation is all about.
[time=2951] It's saying it's not my life anymore, it's yours.
[time=2954] Just as Jesus you laid your life down for me, I lay mine down at your feet.
[time=2959] You say do I have to say it that way?
[time=2961] Nope, it has nothing to do with words, it's all about your heart.
[time=2964] I know if you were here and today is that day for you.
[time=2966] I want to give you a moment just to pray and give your life to Jesus.
[time=2969] In your words to him, I'm not going to lead you in a prayer because your heart is screaming that prayer, that verse, that chorus right now is screaming it to God.
[time=2977] Would you take a moment and just lay your life at the foot of Jesus if you don't know him today?
[time=2987] All this pain, I wonder if I'll ever find my way.
[time=2997] I wonder if my life could really change at all.
[time=3012] All this earth could all that is lost ever be found.
[time=3023] Could a gun come up from this ground at all?
[time=3037] You make beautiful things, you make beautiful things out of the dust.
[time=3068] Fall around, hope is made enough from this old ground.
[time=3079] Out of chaos, life is being found in you.
[time=3093] You make beautiful things, you make beautiful things out of the dust.
[time=3147] You make me new, you are making me new.
[time=3189] You make beautiful things, you make beautiful things out of the dust.
[time=3254] I want to thank you so much if you've watched us on TV online.
[time=3257] I just want to say a special word to you if you are considering making a decision based on this new journey that we've talked about today.
[time=3264] Maybe you already know Jesus and you're really praying through what it means for you to go on a new journey, take a new page, a new chapter in your journey, to be an ambassador for Jesus as we've talked about, to be one that truly has become the righteousness of God.
[time=3280] If you know Jesus and that's been on your heart today, I'm going to pray for you in just a moment.
[time=3284] But I want to speak especially to those of you who maybe have decided today may be that day, that God has really been working in your heart and tugging on your life to say, today's the day for the new day to begin, the new journey with Jesus to start,
[time=3300] the new chapter in my story where I truly do lay down my life at the foot of Jesus.
[time=3305] I've heard about him for a long time, maybe I've been skeptical of the gospel for a long time, maybe that's you.
[time=3311] I want to talk to you for just a moment, today can be that day.
[time=3314] And I know what goes through your mind with these kind of moments is all of my past, all of my failures, all the skeletons in my closet.
[time=3321] If I just get that cleaned up just a little bit, then maybe I can take that step, but maybe it's not today.
[time=3326] I want to challenge you with the thought that if you wait for that moment, it'll probably never come.
[time=3331] In fact, I'll go as far as to say, it will never come.
[time=3333] We're never good enough to lay our life at the foot of Jesus and for him to love us and accept us
[time=3339] the way that we are, but that's the beauty of the new story of the gospel, is that God does know exactly where you are right now.
[time=3347] God cares exactly where you are right now.
[time=3349] He cares about you in every step of the way, every moment.
[time=3352] And in this moment, you can take a moment and you know the thing about salvation is it doesn't come through a prayer.
[time=3357] It doesn't come through words.
[time=3359] It comes from your heart to his, where you just cry out from your heart.
[time=3363] And I believe some of you right now, I think God is working in your heart and is screaming that prayer, that heart cry at this moment.
[time=3370] But it goes something like this, and if your heart's screaming it, use your own words, because your words don't save you, it's the condition of your heart.
[time=3376] Jesus, I need you today.
[time=3379] I need you to save me.
[time=3380] I know that I am a sinner and I'm as lost as can be because of my sin.
[time=3384] I'm separated from God.
[time=3386] But I know Jesus died for me.
[time=3388] I know that he rose again three days later.
[time=3391] Jesus, this life so far has been mine.
[time=3394] It's been all about me, but today I lay my life down at your feet.
[time=3399] At the full of the cross, my life is yours.
[time=3401] Will you save me?
[time=3402] Will you forgive me?
[time=3403] Will you give me that new life that we've talked about today?
[time=3407] And the beauty is, if you have cried that out to Jesus from your heart today, Scripture promises you, promises that you will be saved.
[time=3417] If that's you today, I just want to say a prayer for you.
[time=3419] I also want to pray for those of you who maybe have found some ways.
[time=3422] You need to be a better ambassador for Jesus.
[time=3424] You need to become the righteousness of God, which you have if you know Jesus.
[time=3428] But there's some new ways that God wants you to live that out in your life.
[time=3431] Let's pray together over whatever decision that you've made today.
[time=3434] God, I thank you for everyone who has listened and watched today on television, online,
[time=3440] as we all study your Scripture together, as we all study about Jesus together.
[time=3444] God, I pray for every person, for the broken person who's listening right now, who's still skeptical, who still doesn't know if this could apply to them.
[time=3454] I pray for them right now in this moment.
[time=3456] God, I pray for anyone who has given their life to Jesus today.
[time=3460] I pray for anyone who knows Jesus but has some special steps they need to take to just live out the true life that they're called to live.
[time=3468] I thank you that God, you know each of us, you know every hair on our head is numbered.
[time=3473] God, you know us from the inside out.
[time=3476] And Lord, we thank you for that.
[time=3477] I pray for each person now that Lord, you would empower us.
[time=3480] You would equip us to be the followers of Jesus that you've called us to be.
[time=3485] And Lord, I thank you that ahead of time, you already knew this prayer was coming.
[time=3489] You already knew the needs that we're going to face today and the ones that we will face tomorrow.
[time=3493] And Lord, in the uncertainty of life, I thank you that you are the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[time=3499] We put our faith in that, we put our trust in that.
[time=3501] And Lord, I pray that we could live differently because of what we've learned today.
[time=3505] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3507] I want to thank you for just allowing God to work in your heart, to work in your life.
[time=3512] And I want to challenge you to tune in every single week.
[time=3515] And if you have made a decision, we want to hear from you.
[time=3518] That's the thing we want to partner with you.
[time=3520] We want to walk with you on your journey every step of the way.
[time=3524] And so if you did make a decision, especially if you gave your life to Jesus, we've got a book.
[time=3528] We'd like to get into your hands. We've got some information we want to give to you.
[time=3531] We want to show you what's next and walk with you on this journey.
[time=3534] And so there's a phone number and an email address on your screen that you can call or email so that we can hear from you and so that we can walk with you moving forward.
[time=3543] We'd love to have you at Blackhawk Ministries every Sunday at 9 or 1030 as our services.
[time=3548] On Wednesday evenings, we also have several activities.
[time=3550] We'd love to hear from you as well.
[time=3552] You can watch us live online at blackhawkministries.org.
[time=3555] And you can get all that information there.
[time=3557] My name's Kevin Rivers again. I'm the lead pastor here.
[time=3559] And I am honored to be a part of your journey, your story, and can't wait to see what God has ahead for you.
