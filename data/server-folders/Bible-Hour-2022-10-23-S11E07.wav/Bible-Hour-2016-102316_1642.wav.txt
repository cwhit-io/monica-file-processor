[time=40] The Bible hour is sponsored today by the family of Hazel Daggetts, who went home to be with the Lord on October 18th, 2016.
[time=48] [MUSIC - 5 seconds]
[time=83] You give me hope, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[time=96] You're taking me deeper, you're making me whole.
[time=104] With grace you redeemed me, yeah, you restored my soul.
[time=111] Now I made you, because of you.
[time=118] And you hold my head up, you remind me who I am.
[time=127] You hold my head up, I'm alive in you again.
[time=133] I made you whole.
[time=137] I made you whole, you're making me stronger.
[time=145] You're giving my heart, with your hands you hold me in.
[time=152] You set me apart, now I made you, because of you.
[time=162] And you hold my head up, you remind me who I am.
[time=171] You hold my head up, I'm alive in you again.
[time=177] I made you whole, I made you whole.
[time=183] [MUSIC]
[time=193] You are my salvation.
[time=196] I will not fear no, you're the strength of my life.
[time=203] I won't fear you.
[time=207] You are my salvation.
[time=210] I will not fear no, you're the strength of my life.
[time=217] I won't fear you.
[time=220] You hold my head up, you remind me who I am.
[time=228] You hold my head up, I'm alive in you again.
[time=235] You hold my head up, you remind me who I am.
[time=242] You hold my head up, I'm alive in you again.
[time=249] I made you whole.
[time=257] You hold my head up, you hold my head up.
[time=264] You hold my head up, you remind me who I am.
[time=807] You look nice today, tell them.
[time=813] You enjoy that a little too much there, all right.
[time=815] If you brought your Bibles, look at Lamentations.
[time=819] The book of Lamentations chapter 3, Lamentations chapter 3.
[time=823] I guess you guys look really nice today, right?
[time=826] Lamentations chapter 3, we're going to look at verses 21 through 26 today.
[time=831] Lamentations is one of those books in the Old Testament.
[time=833] It may take you a minute to find, so I'll give you a few moments to do that.
[time=836] But so in this series, last week, we looked at how new really begins with your view.
[time=841] We looked at new meanings.
[time=842] So we go today from new meaning, the purpose, the hope, the meaning that we have in Jesus.
[time=847] We go from new meaning to new mercies.
[time=849] So today's really all about this question.
[time=852] Do you have any waves in your life?
[time=854] Any troubles that you brought in the door with you?
[time=857] They're not in your purse or in your pockets.
[time=859] They walk with you and they cloud your vision everywhere that you go.
[time=863] Let me tell you this, if you don't have some of those waves in your life, one's coming.
[time=868] And that's why scripture has a lot to say.
[time=870] God has a lot to say to you and to me about the waves of our life.
[time=874] Last week, though, we looked at reconciliation, the ministry, the message of reconciliation.
[time=879] And I've heard several stories of how God has radically changed some relationships in your lives.
[time=885] In fact, one of the stories, I won't mention names, but the gentleman just shared with me.
[time=889] I love this story, this is why we do what we do so that scripture, so that God's plan, so that his love and grace for his world that he created goes into our life.
[time=899] It's not just something we sit and hear about and soak up on Sundays, but it goes out into our life and it changes who we are.
[time=905] How we see determines how we be.
[time=907] You remember that from last week if you were here?
[time=909] Well, it happened in this one gentleman's life.
[time=911] He just said he had to apologize to somebody that he had wronged in the past and years had gone by, but he just called up and said, "Hey, you know what, we had a message about reconciliation at church, and I need to tell you." And he did the right kind of apology.
[time=923] You remember from last Sunday?
[time=925] It's not if I offended you, you know, then maybe I'm kind of sorry for that.
[time=929] No, it's, "Hey, I know I offended you when I did this." That was wrong, and here it is, the hard part, the excruciating part of the apology.
[time=935] "I am sorry." Look at somebody say, "I am sorry." Why was that so much quieter than you look so nice today?
[time=944] But here's the beautiful part of that story as he said, "I just love this."
[time=950] He said, "I said I'm sorry, and I got my friend back." That is the new power of the gospel.
[time=958] It can restore things that are broken even your life today.
[time=962] And so as we look at new mercies today, let's go ahead and look at our theme verse.
[time=966] We'll remember us.
[time=967] Anybody got it memorized?
[time=968] We're going to bring you a microphone.
[time=969] I'm just kidding.
[time=970] We won't do that.
[time=971] We'll look at our verse, but before I do, my little boy is in Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=976] And he is memorizing this same verse.
[time=978] I'm guessing that's no coincidence because we work hard to mesh things together.
[time=982] But Caleb, my little five-year-old, has memorized this verse.
[time=985] And I love, I wish I had a recording.
[time=987] I could just let you hear him say it because he'll say it so much better than me.
[time=990] But aren't you glad we're a part of a church that pours into our little ones?
[time=994] Aren't you glad?
[time=995] Can we thank all of those in our children's ministry and our school to do that?
[time=997] Just say thank you to them.
[time=998] Yeah.
[time=1003] In fact, let me show you a picture.
[time=1005] I had the privilege on Friday of being here for grandparents today.
[time=1009] Any grandparents in the building?
[time=1010] Okay.
[time=1011] Some of you are here.
[time=1012] I had a privilege.
[time=1013] Look at this picture on the screen.
[time=1014] This is not even all of the grades.
[time=1016] Some of them are over on the sides and you can't even see them.
[time=1018] But this, I just think this is our school.
[time=1020] This is just the elementary part of our school.
[time=1022] We had kindergarten thing in the morning.
[time=1024] Then there was middle school and high school, lots of other programs.
[time=1027] Here's what I see when I see this.
[time=1029] When you combine this with our children's ministry, the fall mini camp that you saw, we had 70 kids a few weekends ago that Kathy and all the children's team lead, I see an army of people, an army of God's little warriors being raised.
[time=1041] And I love being a part of that.
[time=1044] And it excites me to memorize Scripture.
[time=1046] These kids memorize Scripture so much better than I think I ever have.
[time=1049] I feel like I'm not much of a scholar.
[time=1051] It's like you're supposed to be the seminary guy, right?
[time=1053] I think these kids are getting such a great education, such a great ministry each and every week.
[time=1058] And I got this little card.
[time=1060] Where's Brennan?
[time=1061] Brennan has a little prayer wall.
[time=1063] There he is.
[time=1064] I'm going to call him out.
[time=1065] I asked permission from Dad for this.
[time=1067] Brennan is nine and he has a prayer wall in his house.
[time=1071] And I think that's awesome.
[time=1073] And he prays for things.
[time=1074] But in June, he wrote that he wanted to pray for the church to get a pastor.
[time=1080] And his mom brought this and gave this to me today.
[time=1089] I want you to know that God hears your prayers because you're just one of his kids.
[time=1101] God cares about you where you are and it doesn't matter what post-it notes you would place on your wall today.
[time=1107] God hears you and he wants to do something new.
[time=1111] Will you let him?
[time=1112] Let's talk about that today.
[time=1113] Second Corinthians, let's say our verse together today.
[time=1116] Second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 17.
[time=1118] Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[time=1124] The old has passed away.
[time=1127] Behold, the new has come.
[time=1130] Hey, I'm impressed.
[time=1131] I saw a lot of eyes looking at me instead of down at Scripture.
[time=1134] But it's maybe because of screens right there, but I'm going to say it was a little lower.
[time=1137] Right?
[time=1138] I'm impressed.
[time=1139] We'll go with that.
[time=1140] I'm a positive guy, right?
[time=1141] Okay.
[time=1142] Good stuff.
[time=1143] Keep pouring into that and memorizing that because it is true.
[time=1145] A lot of times we don't feel new, just a little review from last week because of our history, our hurts and our habits.
[time=1150] History, what someone did to me.
[time=1153] My hurts, maybe what we're doing to me are history, things that I've done and the habits.
[time=1158] They're the things that we keep going with.
[time=1160] What I did, what somebody did to me, those hurts.
[time=1162] And then the habits that continue to haunt us.
[time=1165] But today I'm guessing that some of those things are really heavy on your heart because we're talking about new mercies.
[time=1170] And so here's the thing.
[time=1171] I'm not a very good artist, but I want to draw something for you.
[time=1177] When we start out in our journey in life, it goes something like this.
[time=1180] We have plans, right?
[time=1181] We have plans.
[time=1182] And the plans look like this.
[time=1183] Life's supposed to go like this.
[time=1185] We're supposed to grow.
[time=1188] It's supposed to be smooth.
[time=1191] Can't I get a name in?
[time=1194] That's what it's supposed to look like, right?
[time=1197] Well, then life happened to you, didn't it?
[time=1200] And it started to look more like this.
[time=1202] It was going and then we got, you know, a few years down the road and then this happened.
[time=1211] So I keep going.
[time=1212] Okay, yeah.
[time=1213] Some of you need a lot of mercy.
[time=1215] Okay, now.
[time=1216] And here's the thing.
[time=1221] Here you are.
[time=1223] I'll give you a smile even though it's the church smile.
[time=1226] It's not the real kind.
[time=1227] Here you are.
[time=1228] You are here.
[time=1230] Can I get another amen?
[time=1233] Life doesn't always go like we plan.
[time=1235] Life doesn't always go like we map it out to go.
[time=1239] A lot of times it ends up looking like the mess that we find ourselves in.
[time=1243] Life often involves all of the waves and the things that we just feel like are going to overwhelm and crash into our life in ways that we just can't overcome.
[time=1252] That is why we need God's new mercies every single day.
[time=1257] That is why, because we're in that mess.
[time=1259] We're in the middle.
[time=1260] We're in the heart of this thing that we call life and it's full of waves and all those things that overwhelm us.
[time=1265] And you say, you are here.
[time=1268] I am here.
[time=1269] Now, what do I do?
[time=1271] So today, that's what we're going to look at.
[time=1273] Today's content really is all about God's grace.
[time=1276] Today's challenge is to let God's grace lead you to some growth.
[time=1279] So let me give you the bottom line.
[time=1281] The bottom line, if you're taking notes, is that waves are -- because we all had those, right?
[time=1285] Just checking more time.
[time=1286] Okay, waves are overcome as grace produces growth.
[time=1293] The content of Lamentations 3 is really about the new mercies, the new grace that God renews for you every single day.
[time=1300] But those things do us no good unless we allow it to transform us and to become growth in our
[time=1306] life.
[time=1307] But when grace produces growth in our life, those waves, here's the thing.
[time=1310] You hear a lot of preachers say, the waves go away.
[time=1313] No, they don't.
[time=1314] They're not going away.
[time=1316] If you thought you were going to come to church and check that off the spiritual checklist and those waves were going to go away, I'm here to tell you, they're going to still be waiting on you when you get home.
[time=1325] They're still going to be in the car.
[time=1326] That argument that you started earlier this week that you carried into the car right until the moment you get out because we don't carry it out of the car because we're at church, right?
[time=1335] It's still going to be there.
[time=1336] You're probably still going to have to finish that argument.
[time=1338] Probably you're going to have to end with, "I am sorry." The waves are going to come.
[time=1343] That's not the point here.
[time=1344] The point is that when God's new mercies overwhelm and flood your soul, the waves within start
[time=1350] to overtake the waves without.
[time=1353] The waves within start to settle down because of God's grace, and His grace leads you to grow through the challenges and the waves and the pain in your life.
[time=1362] You'll still have it, but it starts to look a whole lot different.
[time=1366] So that's what we're going to look at today.
[time=1368] Mercy, I've heard it said, is not getting what you deserve.
[time=1372] While grace is getting what you don't deserve, and I'm here to tell you, my friends, that we have both of those in Jesus Christ.
[time=1380] That should just make you excited today.
[time=1382] If you are in the middle of the waves, if you're in the middle of the mess, and you are here, that should at least encourage you today.
[time=1388] I'm going to give you two points from Lamentations 3.
[time=1391] Let's look at Lamentations 3.
[time=1393] Starting with verse 21, we'll go to verse 24 to start with.
[time=1395] And the point here is recurring grace.
[time=1399] Recurring grace.
[time=1400] And that word recurring is very important because we're talking about the new mercies of God, because the mercies, the grace of God keeps on giving and keeps on going when
[time=1410] we have nothing left to give.
[time=1413] Anybody living in that today?
[time=1415] Just glad that God's mercies are in you, and He does keep giving when you have nothing left to give.
[time=1419] Well, that's what we will look at.
[time=1421] And before I read it though, I think I've talked to you about the church smile.
[time=1425] We're going to talk about the church smile a lot because I don't like it.
[time=1428] But I have a good one.
[time=1429] I know how to do the church smile.
[time=1433] Confessions of a pastor, I'm good at doing the church smile.
[time=1437] And so when you see me, you have permission to ask me, is that a church smile or a real one?
[time=1442] I may or may not tell you the truth, but you'll probably get your answer by how I tell you the truth or not.
[time=1447] So I want it.
[time=1448] The church smile is, remember that argument we were talking about where it's a knock-down drag-out until you get out of the car, but you step onto the pavement of the church parking lot and dang.
[time=1459] How are you, brother and sister?
[time=1461] So look at somebody giving me your best church smile.
[time=1463] Go ahead.
[time=1464] Best one you've got.
[time=1465] Don't be shy.
[time=1466] Don't ask them if it's real or not.
[time=1469] We'll save that for another time.
[time=1472] Here's what I know God wants His church to be.
[time=1475] Here's what Black Hawk Ministries is going to be every week, no matter what.
[time=1480] I want you to know it is okay to not be okay in here.
[time=1485] It's all right not to be all right.
[time=1487] If somebody says, how are you doing today and you're not doing okay, you can hopefully not be the big Debbie downer, but you can say, I'm having a bad week and I'm here to get some encouragement.
[time=1496] Here's what I'm guessing.
[time=1497] Have you ever tried that?
[time=1499] Probably not.
[time=1500] I'm having a bad week and I'm here just to get some encouragement.
[time=1503] If you try that, here's what I'm guessing you'll get back.
[time=1506] You too?
[time=1507] Wow.
[time=1508] I was feeling the same way.
[time=1509] I didn't think I could say that.
[time=1510] Well, me too.
[time=1511] Let's go and get encouraged together, and I'm guessing you'll feel encouraged anyway.
[time=1514] So we're going to experience that recurring grace together.
[time=1517] Let's read verses 21 through 24 of Lamentations chapter 3.
[time=1522] You ready for the Word this morning?
[time=1525] Verse 21, "But this I call to mine, therefore I have hope."
[time=1531] That's pretty good already, but it keeps going.
[time=1533] Verse 22, "The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases." His mercies never come to an end.
[time=1541] They are what?
[time=1545] They are new every morning.
[time=1549] Great is your faithfulness.
[time=1551] "The Lord is my portion," says my soul, "Therefore I will have hope in Him."
[time=1558] His grace is recurring, his mercies, his compassion, his love, his ability to carry you through
[time=1564] what you're going through is they're new every single day.
[time=1568] Every morning you wake up, he's still the same God.
[time=1572] That life of yours is still that same life of yours, but his mercies are new because we
[time=1578] require new mercies.
[time=1579] We require every single day walking through the mistakes that we make, walking through the troubles that we bring about in our lives.
[time=1587] And so I want to give you a couple of questions that maybe you could ask yourself when it's hard for you to stick it out, when you'd rather just give up.
[time=1594] What if we started asking ourselves when pain comes our way?
[time=1598] When we need that recurring grace in our life that we know we get, but life still feels like that.
[time=1603] It still feels so heavy.
[time=1604] What if we started asking God not, "God, what did I do wrong?" Have you ever asked that before?
[time=1611] I must have done something wrong for me to be in this place.
[time=1614] God, what did my parents do?
[time=1616] It's got to be Mom and Dad's fault, kids in the room.
[time=1618] Mom and Dad had to do something wrong for me to be here.
[time=1621] What if we stopped asking God when the waves of life came, "God, what did I do wrong?" And started saying, "God, here I am," you are here, "God, here I am."
[time=1631] What do you want to do to bless other people and to make Jesus known because I am here?
[time=1637] What would happen if we started asking that question?
[time=1641] I don't know.
[time=1642] You want to find out with me?
[time=1643] It would be a good thing to find out.
[time=1645] I think it would change how we go through those things.
[time=1647] A lot of times we pray for God to do new things, but then sometimes for Him to do those new things, He needs us to walk through some waves.
[time=1655] And so my challenge is, what if we stopped asking God to take away this week what we prayed for last week?
[time=1661] What if we said, "God, this probably has something to do with the new stuff you're trying to do, and as much as it pains me, I'm okay with it because you are with me?"
[time=1671] God will often walk you through times of pain so that you can better trust His promises.
[time=1676] I found that out the hard way many times in my life.
[time=1680] And I want to share with you one of my favorite scriptures from the book of Psalms.
[time=1684] Because any word, let's just get this out of the way.
[time=1687] Any warriors in the room?
[time=1690] You know who you are.
[time=1691] You were worried if you raised your hand though, right, so you didn't.
[time=1695] If we're honest, some of us tend to do that a little more than others.
[time=1698] But if we're honest, we all tend to worry.
[time=1700] We all tend to get anxious about things.
[time=1703] I want to share one of my favorite scriptures about bad news.
[time=1706] And I want to ask you, what bad news are you afraid of getting today?
[time=1711] Maybe you've gotten some bad news and you're hoping it doesn't get worse.
[time=1714] But I'm guessing you're probably afraid of some bad news.
[time=1716] Well, I'm just going to let scripture answer that for you.
[time=1719] Psalm 112 verses 6 and 7 says, "Surely, the righteous will never be shaken."
[time=1725] They will be remembered forever.
[time=1726] Here it is.
[time=1727] They will have no fear of bad news.
[time=1732] Their heart is steadfast, trusting the Lord.
[time=1737] A lot of times God's intent is not necessarily to deliver you from adversity, but to deliver
[time=1743] you through adversity.
[time=1745] So that other people can see there's something different about that person.
[time=1749] They still have a smile, it's not the church smile.
[time=1751] They still have this smile, this joy, this peace, this comfort that they shouldn't have while walking through the waves of life.
[time=1758] Their life looks a mess right now.
[time=1760] They're that little red man in the middle of all the stuff, but there's something different about them.
[time=1766] Sometimes God wants to deliver you through adversity so other people can see Him in ways they never would have seen Him before.
[time=1770] Had you not walked through that adversity, the way that you walked through it.
[time=1774] God wants to do something new with His mercies that argue every single morning.
[time=1780] God will confuse the world by how you walk through times of pain.
[time=1784] Will we let Him do that?
[time=1786] One of my favorite verses that I always call to mind, any time pain comes.
[time=1790] You want to know what it is?
[time=1791] It's Philippians 4, Philippians 4, 6, and 7.
[time=1794] It's going to be on the screen for you as well.
[time=1795] It says, "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication
[time=1802] with thanksgiving," that's asking a lot, right?
[time=1805] It's hard to be thankful, but here's the good part, "Let your request be made known to God and the peace of God which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and
[time=1816] minds through Jesus Christ." That word "guard," the Greek word for "guard" really means to hold in custody or to confine.
[time=1826] I love that because my heart and my mind wonder and it needs to be reigned back in.
[time=1831] If you've had young kids, you get the baby gates for a reason, right?
[time=1835] You get the little baby jail circles that you put them in so that they don't wander into places they don't need to go.
[time=1840] Well, that's the concept of guarding our hearts and minds.
[time=1844] What is it that guards our hearts and minds?
[time=1846] It's the peace of God that surpasses all understanding.
[time=1849] It's a peace that doesn't make sense.
[time=1852] God is not a logical God.
[time=1855] He does things that don't make sense.
[time=1857] This is one of them, his peace can guard, confine, constrain, pin up your heart and mind in Christ
[time=1864] Jesus.
[time=1865] Where is it pinning it to?
[time=1866] To him, his peace confines you to what he is doing.
[time=1872] That's when the waves of life start to look a little bit different.
[time=1875] And there's a story in my life that I think exemplifies this better than any other story, and it's back when I was in 10th grade, I was in home room with my cousin.
[time=1885] Now, I had three cousins that were my dad's brother's kids.
[time=1891] One was the oldest, just like I'm the oldest in my family, and we played together.
[time=1894] And then the middle child, her name was Amy, my cousin.
[time=1897] She and my sister, Bethany, were best buddies.
[time=1902] And so Amy was in my grade, and we were in 10th grade.
[time=1905] We had home room together, but in 10th grade, she was in a very tragic car accident.
[time=1910] And she passed away in 10th grade.
[time=1912] I saw her that morning in home room, saw her in the halls.
[time=1915] We played together all of our lives, and she passed away.
[time=1922] And I got a new understanding of Philippians 4, because my uncle, her dad, who I had worked
[time=1928] with for many years, putting in ground swimming pools was how I learned what work ethic really was.
[time=1936] At the visitation in the funeral home, I'll never forget looking at him and my aunt.
[time=1941] His name's Keith, Uncle Keith, and Aunt Sharon Rivers.
[time=1944] I remember seeing my aunt Sharon with her 16-year-old daughter laying in a casket.
[time=1950] And she was broken, and she was crying, and she was a mess.
[time=1955] She looked the way you would expect a mom to look who had just lost her 16-year-old girl.
[time=1960] But then I saw my uncle, and he was over there, and he had a smile on his face, and it made
[time=1968] me mad.
[time=1969] I was angry at him.
[time=1970] I still remember that feeling.
[time=1972] It was so tangible.
[time=1973] I was a shy, awkward kid who never spoke up, but I remember watching him, and he just had
[time=1979] joy.
[time=1980] He still looked like Uncle Keith.
[time=1981] He's the cut-up of the room, and he was that guy.
[time=1984] And I finally pulled him aside.
[time=1985] I said, "Come outside with me," and I talked to him, and I remember grabbing his arms, and he just stood there as calm as he could be.
[time=1991] Just lost his daughter, and here's this punk kid coming into his life.
[time=1994] But he had such mercy and grace for me, because here's what happened.
[time=1997] I said, "What's wrong with you?
[time=2000] Why are you not upset?" "Amy's gone," and then he teared up, and I'll never forget what he said to me.
[time=2010] He said, "Kevin, I don't know.
[time=2013] All I know is that God keeps putting Philippians 4 and verse 7 on my heart, and it says the
[time=2019] peace of God that I can't even understand will guard my heart and my mind, because of Jesus.
[time=2026] And he sat me down, and he put his hands on my shoulders, and we sat there, and he looked at me with tears in his eyes, and said, "Kevin, you're going to have times in your life that you don't understand." But in those moments, just like this moment for me, you can have the peace of God that
[time=2043] will make people ask you questions, just like you're asking me questions.
[time=2048] And I pray that you will be able to look at them and say, "I have the peace of God that passes understanding." And you can have it too.
[time=2063] That's the God that we serve.
[time=2066] That's the recurring grace that I don't deserve.
[time=2069] He showed it to me in his darkest moment, and in so doing he forever redefined how I will look at Philippians 4 and verse 7.
[time=2078] I'll never forget how that recurring grace became so new in my life.
[time=2082] I'll never forget how that recurring grace that God was pouring into my uncle's heart
[time=2088] and his life, and it was guarding his heart and his mind.
[time=2090] I'll never forget how he reciprocated that, what he got he gave.
[time=2095] In his darkest moment, he gave to me.
[time=2097] I didn't deserve that.
[time=2098] I was being the punk kid, pulling him aside, being a jerk to him for just living in the
[time=2104] peace of God.
[time=2105] I didn't know what I was doing, and he knew that, and he loved me where I was, and the grace of God that was guarding his heart.
[time=2111] That peace that passes his understanding was passed on to me.
[time=2115] Isn't that beautiful?
[time=2117] You've probably had some people do something similar in your life.
[time=2120] If not, then you can be the uncle Keith and somebody else's, and I pray that I am just
[time=2126] that.
[time=2127] He's an example of somebody willing to leverage the worst of times to do the best of things that only God could bring about.
[time=2134] I want to be that person.
[time=2135] Let's talk about the second thing, not just the recurring grace of God, but what about renewed growth?
[time=2140] Right that now, if you're taking notes, verses 25 and 26, renewed growth, renewed growth.
[time=2147] We already said that waves are overcome as grace produces growth, renewed growth we see in verses 25 and 26.
[time=2154] Let's look there in Lamentations 3.
[time=2156] Verse 25, "The Lord is good to those who wait for him, to the soul who seeks him.
[time=2163] It is good that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord."
[time=2170] The confession of a pastor, "I'm a loud waiter." He says, "Wait quietly." "I'm a loud waiter.
[time=2178] I wait loudly sometimes.
[time=2180] I'm a pretty impatient guy a lot of times." I feel like I'm patient with people, but when it comes to do with something I'm wanting to see or something I'm wanting to do in my life, I feel like I get so impatient I'm ready to go.
[time=2192] Anybody join me?
[time=2193] I was like, "Okay, good.
[time=2195] Just making sure it wasn't just me.
[time=2197] We're all in this together." Let's talk about growing through our mistakes.
[time=2200] Some of you, though the history that you've brought, what I did is still what haunts you when it comes to the new things God wants us to do.
[time=2207] I want you to flip over to the New Testament to Mark chapter 4.
[time=2210] Go to your New Testament, second book of your New Testament, Mark chapter 4, and we're going to look at the disciples.
[time=2216] I like to call them the knuckleheads of Scripture.
[time=2219] They just did not get it so many times, but Jesus was so patient with them.
[time=2226] And one of my favorite things is you flip to Mark 4, Luke 22, you can just jot this down.
[time=2230] We're not going to read this, but Luke 22, it talks about Peter denying Jesus.
[time=2234] And Jesus had predicted Peter, you're going to die me three times before the rooster crows.
[time=2240] But in Luke 22, the end there, verses 60 through 62, you see something very unique happen that we often miss when we read about that story.
[time=2247] It says when Peter looked into the eyes of Jesus, when he looked at Jesus, he remembered.
[time=2254] Now a lot of times we say, yeah, he remembered that Jesus said that he was going to deny him three times.
[time=2259] Yeah, I think it means that, but it goes a lot deeper than that.
[time=2262] He remembered how Jesus loved him.
[time=2266] He remembered, because you see, this was the beginning of something new for Peter.
[time=2270] And this is a whole other message, maybe we'll get to one day, but it was the beginning of something new.
[time=2274] When he walked eyes with the Lord, it changed everything.
[time=2278] It even changed how he looked at his own mistakes.
[time=2280] It even changed how he looked at how he could move forward past the mistakes that he had made.
[time=2285] Aren't you glad that that's the kind of new mercies that we have in Jesus?
[time=2289] Peter found that.
[time=2290] And he was one of the disciples in Mark 4 that we'll look at now.
[time=2294] This is really one of those times where the disciples were anxious for nothing.
[time=2298] And so if you like a good story, this is a good one.
[time=2300] They were anxious for nothing here.
[time=2303] I love this passage because it just illustrates what we do in our own lives.
[time=2307] And we see the renewed growth that maybe we can gain from the story.
[time=2311] Verse 35 of Mark 4 says, "On that day, when evening had come," he said to them, "Let us go across to the other side." Verse 36 of Mark 4, "And leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was." Not even time to change.
[time=2326] You can picture the story here.
[time=2328] He was going through the motions of ministry, and Jesus was pouring out, and there was no time to change.
[time=2332] Let's get out.
[time=2333] Let's go to the other side.
[time=2334] The appointment at the other side, very important, verse 37, "And a great windstorm arose," which happened at the Sea of Galilee quite a bit, "and the waves were breaking into the boat so that the boat was already filling." Anybody say, "I feel like my boat's filling up today." Yeah, the waves just tend to do that in our own lives.
[time=2351] Verse 38, "But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion."
[time=2358] You ever feel that way?
[time=2359] If you're honest, the waves are crashing into your boat, and it feels like God's just over there somewhere sleeping.
[time=2365] Do you hear my prayers, God?
[time=2367] Do you really care about the waves of my life?
[time=2371] Are you just sleeping, or are you going to just stay asleep?
[time=2374] For honest, we would all say we've had those moments.
[time=2376] Some of you are in that moment right now, and you came hoping maybe God would say something about the storm of your life, and I think he's going to.
[time=2383] And they went to him.
[time=2384] They woke him up and said to him, "Teacher, do you not care that we're perishing?" And he awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, "Three words, peace, be still."
[time=2395] And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm, and he said to them, "Why are you so afraid?
[time=2400] Have you still no faith?" And they were filled with great fear and said to one another, "Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?" They thought they were afraid of the waves.
[time=2411] Who is this guy?
[time=2412] But I love this story because we can identify with the disciples, because we often feel like it's hard to grow through our mistakes.
[time=2419] It's hard to grow through the unnecessary waves we bring on ourselves, but then those that we don't bring on ourselves.
[time=2425] Those hurts that we didn't ask for, but we got dealt to us as the hand that we had dealt.
[time=2430] And so we'll often feel like Jesus is asleep in the stern on a cushion while we go through the waves of our life.
[time=2436] It feels that way.
[time=2438] But yet Jesus wants to awaken something new, just as He does in this story.
[time=2443] I believe this.
[time=2444] Jesus wanted them to wake Him up, because Philippians 4 verse 6 says, "Let your request be made known to God." He wanted to hear from them.
[time=2452] I don't think He was bothered that they woke Him up.
[time=2455] He wanted them to wake Him up.
[time=2456] I think what bothered Him was the spirit through which they woke Him up, the spirit of fear and of doubt and lack of trust that they had in Him.
[time=2464] They're with this God who, and here's the thing, do you ever wonder why would He lead them into the storm, right?
[time=2470] Maybe they wondered that.
[time=2471] I don't know.
[time=2472] He said, "Well, He's Jesus.
[time=2474] He's the Son of God.
[time=2475] He knew the storm was coming.
[time=2476] He kind of created the weather patterns.
[time=2477] He probably knows them, right?
[time=2479] But He said, "Let's go to the other side." He led the way in that.
[time=2484] And we feel that way, too.
[time=2485] "God, why would you let me get here, here?
[time=2488] How would this happen?
[time=2489] Why did you let this happen?" And sometimes we'll shake our fist at God, and here's what I love about the God that I serve.
[time=2496] His mercies are still new every morning.
[time=2498] I've shaken my fist at God before, you say, "Well, I didn't know we had a pastor who would do such a thing.
[time=2503] Well, you do." I'm real just like you.
[time=2508] I don't understand things, just like you don't understand things.
[time=2512] But the beauty of the new mercies of God is that Jesus loves us right where we are, and
[time=2518] He walks us and teaches us what's next.
[time=2521] Here's what I love about this story.
[time=2523] He wasn't upset at them that they woke Him up, because He got up and what did He do immediately?
[time=2528] Peace, be still.
[time=2532] But I love that when we look at this story, we see a few key things back to our board
[time=2538] over here.
[time=2539] This is where they were.
[time=2540] They were right in the middle of the waves of life.
[time=2543] But when we know Jesus, and we live in the new mercies that He gives to us, when we're in the middle of the waves of our life, He won't always calm the waves and say, "Peace,
[time=2554] be still." Sometimes He will walk you through those waves.
[time=2558] But here's what I want to challenge you with.
[time=2560] There's a couple of key words.
[time=2562] The first one is why.
[time=2566] The second one is what?
[time=2569] What I want to challenge you with today is you can get through any what if you have a good enough why.
[time=2574] If you know Jesus today, why do I go through this?
[time=2578] We ask a lot of why.
[time=2579] Why?
[time=2584] When you have those moments, you can know that you have a good enough why to get you through
[time=2590] any what?
[time=2592] The why, the meaning that you have in Jesus Christ, knowing that even in the worst of moments, when I find myself here and it looks more like this, and I'm broken and I'm hurting and I'm in the darkest of seasons in my life, I still have a reason to get up.
[time=2608] I still have a reason to keep going.
[time=2610] I don't have to let the wind and the waves overwhelm me because my why is greater than my what?
[time=2616] Jesus is your why.
[time=2618] The reason that you can get up, your meaning every single day, even in the worst of circumstances is that someone may come to know Jesus, is that I may come to know Jesus better in my life.
[time=2629] And so you can get through any why if you have a good enough what?
[time=2633] In this story, we see a whiteboard.
[time=2635] We see the whiteboard as the waves in the wind of your life.
[time=2639] And I think that's the case for you today, the whiteboard of your life is the problems that you experience, the waves that seem so big in your life.
[time=2646] But God's grace is the pen that wants to teach you the why.
[time=2651] God's grace is the pen that teaches you why He's doing what He's doing.
[time=2655] You may not know some of the why until you're with Jesus.
[time=2659] And you know what?
[time=2660] That's okay because I trust my Savior because He is trustworthy.
[time=2665] He is faithful even when I'm faithless.
[time=2668] And so today as we leave, I want you to know the whiteboard that is your life is a teaching moment and the pen is the grace of God.
[time=2677] And I want to challenge you to let the recurring grace of God be the pen that writes on the whiteboard of your life, your reasons to continue, that writes on the whiteboard of your life.
[time=2689] Why it's okay to hurt, but why you know you can get up and keep going.
[time=2695] I want you to today, allow God's recurring grace to lead you to some renewed growth in your life.
[time=2704] You know what?
[time=2705] A lot of times we feel like the waves around us are the problem, don't we?
[time=2709] Well, if I could just get rid of this wave, if you could pick one wave to get rid of, think about it with me.
[time=2715] If you could pick one wave to get rid of in your life right now, what would it be?
[time=2717] Don't say it out loud.
[time=2718] Just know what it is.
[time=2720] A lot of times we say if that wave would go away, everything would be okay.
[time=2725] But I want to challenge you with something.
[time=2727] I believe with all of my heart that the problems, what really is holding us back from the new things in our lives that God wants to do, has nothing to do with the waves around us.
[time=2737] It has everything to do with the waves within us.
[time=2739] And I think Jesus' point in the story in Mark 4 was to teach them, look, I am the God of the sea.
[time=2745] With three words, I can make the wind and the waves obey me.
[time=2749] I can do whatever I want, whenever I want to.
[time=2751] But I want to teach you that just as I can do that to the waves around you, you have the power through me to do that to the waves within.
[time=2759] You can say peace be still and you can calm the waves within.
[time=2764] And then here's the thing.
[time=2765] When you calm the waves within, when that peace of God that passes understanding guards your hearts and your minds through Christ Jesus, when that happens, the waves within start to calm and to settle, the waves without start to look a lot different.
[time=2779] They start to not look so big, they still are, but they start to feel different in your
[time=2785] life.
[time=2786] I'm going to tell you that the sermons you preach through your pain are far louder than
[time=2792] the ones you preach through your blessings.
[time=2794] I'm going to say that again.
[time=2795] The sermons you preach through your pain are far louder than the ones you preach through your blessings.
[time=2801] I'm going to ask you a question, what sermon are you preaching today?
[time=2805] What does that look like in your life?
[time=2807] I want to just ask you to close your eyes and reflect on two challenges.
[time=2810] I want to give you two challenges.
[time=2814] Nobody looking around, just you and God, you and Jesus for a moment, all I want to tell you that it's often when our days are the worst that we find Jesus the most.
[time=2825] Maybe you're in some of those days and it's time to find Jesus the most, two challenges.
[time=2829] I want to challenge you to find one wave within, just one, start with one.
[time=2833] One wave within, one of those waves inside the worry and fear and doubt and anxiety that
[time=2839] seems to overtake you in your life that you know God wants you to come and let him say peace be still in this moment.
[time=2849] The second challenge is to find one way this week that the waves of your life could become
[time=2856] a platform for growth for you and a platform for the gospel of Jesus.
[time=2861] What does that really mean?
[time=2862] Simply put, use the sermon that you're preaching through your pain to touch somebody's life.
[time=2869] So number one, find a way to calm the waves within and you know the way.
[time=2873] His name is the way, the truth and the life and we don't come to the Father except for him.
[time=2877] You found the way.
[time=2878] Let him say peace be still over the waves within so that even though the war is raging outside of you on the inside things are different.
[time=2885] Number two, find a way to touch somebody's life even through the most challenging situation you find yourself in now.
[time=2892] I want to speak to those of you who may say the waves within really to me today are stemming
[time=2899] from the fact that I just don't know Jesus.
[time=2901] I just don't know that I have a permanent relationship with him.
[time=2905] I don't know that I can reach God the Father because I know God the Son.
[time=2908] I don't know that I have a permanent home in heaven, an eternal home with Jesus when I die.
[time=2914] I'd like to know that but I just don't know.
[time=2916] The new story of the gospel is for you.
[time=2919] Your new step is to accept those new mercies that God does have every morning.
[time=2923] It starts with knowing Jesus on a personal level.
[time=2927] It starts with saying, crying from your heart, your heart screaming and if you don't know him today, saying, Jesus, I need you.
[time=2934] I know you died for me on that cross.
[time=2936] You paid for my sins by living a perfect life and being my sacrifice, something I could never do.
[time=2942] You did that for me.
[time=2944] I know you're alive.
[time=2945] I know you rose again.
[time=2947] Will you save me?
[time=2949] I lay my life down at your feet.
[time=2950] I'm yours.
[time=2951] Some of you need to take that step in this moment.
[time=2953] I want to give you a moment to do that right now as we're talking and we're praying together.
[time=2957] Just cry out to him.
[time=2958] You don't need me to lead you in a prayer because you're already saying it.
[time=2961] Your heart is already screaming it.
[time=2963] Will you take that step today?
[time=2965] Those of you who are here that do know Jesus.
[time=2968] What are the answers to those questions, those challenges?
[time=2971] Maybe there's still some reconciliation that needs to happen in a relationship.
[time=2976] Maybe there's some waves within that God is trying to come.
[time=2979] We're going to sing in just a moment.
[time=2980] The band's going to come up and I'm going to pray for us and as I say amen, we're going to start to sing a song.
[time=2984] As we sing this wonderful song about broken vessels, how we're a broken vessel, but how God's amazing grace is greater than the challenges of my life.
[time=2994] I want to open up the whole building.
[time=2996] You can pray in your seat.
[time=2997] You can pray here at the front.
[time=2998] There are going to be a couple of elders that are going to stand down front here.
[time=3001] There are going to be some elders at the back.
[time=3003] If you want to fill out the card that you received when you came in just as a sign of commitment that you gave your life to Jesus, bring that to us.
[time=3009] If you need prayer, we want to pray with you, but as we sing about God's amazing grace, will you let it transform you?
[time=3016] Will we go here today different and new from where we entered the building?
[time=3021] Let's pray together.
[time=3022] God, you are so good.
[time=3023] Whatever your word, I thank you for your grace that is recurring.
[time=3026] I thank you for the renewed growth that you want to bring about in our lives.
[time=3030] Lord, I thank you that your grace is a pen riding on the whiteboard of our life in such
[time=3036] a way that we'll renew the growth in our life in ways that will change the world.
[time=3041] God, as we sing in just a moment, I pray for those that have prayed to receive you.
[time=3047] If you are here right now, I just want to challenge you.
[time=3049] Nobody's looking around.
[time=3050] If you prayed to receive Jesus today and you said, "I just gave my heart and my life to Him." I want to say a prayer for you, specifically for you.
[time=3057] You'll have an opportunity to take some next steps.
[time=3058] We want to get some materials in your hand, but for right now, just acknowledge that by raising your hand.
[time=3063] Would you say, "Just pray for me, Pastor." I gave my heart to Jesus today for the first time.
[time=3066] I see you, sir.
[time=3067] God bless you.
[time=3068] Keep them up high for a moment.
[time=3069] Who else?
[time=3070] Say, "Pray for me, Pastor." I gave my life to Jesus.
[time=3074] I see you, sir.
[time=3075] God bless you.
[time=3076] Who else?
[time=3078] Anybody else?
[time=3081] Praise God.
[time=3082] Anybody else?
[time=3083] Put your hands down.
[time=3084] God, thank you for these at least two or three that have professed their faith in you today.
[time=3088] I pray that this will be the beginning of something new, that their life is truly now beginning.
[time=3095] This isn't the end of something, it's the beginning of everything in their life, and I thank you for that.
[time=3100] God, as we sing about your amazing grace, I pray they would take a step, as would all of us, God, a step of faith, whether that means praying or finding someone to talk to.
[time=3108] God, I thank you that you're in us, among us, around us, and you want to work through us.
[time=3113] Will you do that now as we sing and use this as a time of worship and commitment to you?
[time=3117] And all guys, people said, "Hey, man, would you stand to your feet this morning as we sing this?" And when I asked a couple of our elders to come up front, Phil and Rick are going to join me here, and the rest of our elders, if you go to the back, if you'd like to go to the back and just have somebody to talk to, we're here for you.
[time=3130] But as we sing, will you respond?
[time=3137] All these kisses, broken and scattered, in mercy gathered beneath them home, empty handed,
[time=3156] but not forsaken, I've been set free, all I've been set free.
[time=3166] Amazing grace, how sweet thou sound, that save the rich like me.
[time=3179] I once was lost, but now I'm found, was blind, but now I see, oh, I can see you now.
[time=3197] I can see the love in your eyes, laying yourself down, raising up the broken to love.
[time=3220] Take our failure, you take our weakness, set your treasure in charge of learning.
[time=3242] So take this heart, Lord, I'll be your best on the world to see your life in me.
[time=3257] Amazing grace, how sweet thou stand, that save the rich like me.
[time=3270] I once was lost, but now I'm found, was blind, but now I see, oh, I can see you now.
[time=3287] Oh, I can see the love in your eyes, laying yourself down, raising up the broken to love.
[time=3317] Hello, Kevin Rivers again here, Lead Pastor at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=3324] I just want to thank you for joining us today, and I pray that you've been challenged in some way about the new mercies that God has for you, and we just want to thank you for participating and watching and being a part of what God's doing at Black Hawk, but more importantly, I want to talk to you about what God's doing in your life right now.
[time=3340] Hopefully, you have experienced some of the new mercies that God has for you.
[time=3344] Maybe you've accepted a challenge to understand what it means to embrace those new mercies in your life, what it means to bring those mercies to other people in your life, but I'm guessing that something grabbed your heart today as we looked at Lamentations 3, something grabbed your heart and your mind and your life because you've got some waves, you've got some troubles, you've got some of those problems that just weigh on you so much.
[time=3366] And I want to speak specifically to somebody that's watching today, I want to speak to you that today God did a work in your heart, and the new thing God did in you has prompted you to consider accepting the gospel.
[time=3377] What does that look like to perceive Jesus the way that he is?
[time=3381] And so I want to give you that moment that we've just discussed, to just reach out to him because he cares for you.
[time=3388] Jesus says, "Cast your cares on me because I care for you." And so in this moment, maybe your step, maybe the new thing that God's doing in your life is to say, "Jesus, my life that has been mine all of this time, I now lay it at your feet.
[time=3401] Jesus, it is yours." The beautiful thing is that Scripture describes that as the new reason for living, the new
[time=3409] meaning, the new mercies, the new hope, the new salvation that only Jesus can bring about.
[time=3413] If that's the condition of your heart, Scripture promises that you'll be saved.
[time=3417] More importantly, God looks at you as I'm looking at you now and says, "I promise you will be saved." I want to give you a moment to maybe just do that in this very moment, praying something like this, just saying, "Jesus, I want to give you me.
[time=3430] I want to give you all of me, not some of me, but all of me.
[time=3432] I know that you died for me on that cross.
[time=3435] I know that you did that to pay a price for my sins that I could never pay.
[time=3439] I could never live that perfect life that you live, Jesus, but you did that for me.
[time=3444] And I believe that you are alive.
[time=3446] You rose from the dead.
[time=3447] And Jesus, I lay my life at your feet.
[time=3449] I give it to you now, will you save me and forgive me?" I know what some of your thinking has got us tugged and stirred in your heart right now.
[time=3458] I know you're saying it can't be that simple.
[time=3460] But I want to tell you the new story of the gospel, your new meaning in life really is
[time=3466] that simple.
[time=3467] God wants to continue working in your life and we want to walk with you.
[time=3470] If you took that step today, I want to challenge you, we're going to put some information on your screen.
[time=3475] There's going to be an email address and a phone number.
[time=3476] Reach out to us because I've got a book that I'd like to get into your hands.
[time=3479] We'll mail it to you.
[time=3480] We will get it in your hands one way or another.
[time=3482] It's just a growth guide for you believers, beginning steps.
[time=3486] Because here's what I tell you.
[time=3487] If you accepted Christ today, it's just the beginning.
[time=3491] God is just getting started with all the new things He wants to do in your life.
[time=3495] New life has truly begun, but you can't do it alone.
[time=3498] Jesus made us to need each other, to need community.
[time=3501] And that's what we want to be for you at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=3504] We want to be a family that you can lean on when you need us the most.
[time=3508] And we need you.
[time=3509] We need you to lean on each other as we lean into all the new things that God wants to do.
[time=3514] So reach out to us.
[time=3515] Give us that opportunity.
[time=3516] And whoever it is today, that God's just done something new, whether you've accepted Christ or whether you've known Jesus for a long time, but just found that God is doing something inside of you when it comes to these new mercies, or maybe you're walking through the waves, maybe the waves of your life outside of you are big, loud, heavy, and they're
[time=3535] knocking you down, but God spoke to you today about the waves within that we've talked about today.
[time=3541] I want to challenge you.
[time=3542] Let God calm the waves within.
[time=3544] As He calms the waves within, even the waves without, the waves outside of you start to look a little bit different.
[time=3550] It doesn't mean they're going away, but they will look differently.
[time=3553] And you will be able to tackle them in a different kind of way.
[time=3556] Thank you again for watching today.
[time=3558] Thank you for letting us into your home and into your life.
[time=3561] And we trust that God is going to continue to do big things.
[time=3564] We're here for you, and I hope to see you soon.
