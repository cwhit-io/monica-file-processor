[time=302] [APPLAUSE]
[time=320] [MUSIC]
[time=330] Yeah.
[time=335] [MUSIC]
[time=339] What a moment you had brought me to such a freedom.
[time=346] I have found in you, you're the healer.
[time=351] You may all think new, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[time=359] I'm not going back, I'm moving ahead.
[time=364] Here to declare to you, our past is over.
[time=370] All things are made new, surrendered my life to Christ.
[time=377] I'm moving, moving forward.
[time=382] [MUSIC]
[time=389] You were raised out of, with all the power in your hand.
[time=395] You have given me a second chance.
[time=399] Hallelujah, hallelujah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[time=407] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[time=413] I'm not going back, moving ahead.
[time=419] Here to declare to you, our past is over.
[time=425] In you, all things are new, surrendered my life to Christ.
[time=432] I'm moving, not going back, moving ahead.
[time=438] Here to declare to you, our past is over.
[time=444] In you, things are made new, surrendered my life to Christ.
[time=451] And I'm moving, moving, moving forward.
[time=459] [MUSIC]
[time=463] Said I'm moving forward.
[time=468] [MUSIC]
[time=478] To make all things new, and I will follow you forever.
[time=491] Oh, are you made of things?
[time=496] You make all things new of things.
[time=501] You make all things new, and I will follow you forever.
[time=577] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=637] Hi, my name is John Brock.
[time=645] I would describe my life before Christ simply in one word, and that's selfish.
[time=654] Basically, my life revolved around just trying to find out how I could feel good, how I could not feel anything at all,
[time=664] and how I could just avoid discomfort of any kind, whether it was emotional or physical.
[time=672] I was afraid of talking to people because I was afraid of being hurt by things they might say.
[time=680] This led to loneliness, so I sought ways of overcoming that.
[time=693] I found out in high school that people would give me a chance if I drank or did drugs with them.
[time=702] I dove into that and experimented with that.
[time=709] After 20 years of that kind of a lifestyle, I felt both my body and soul just damaged.
[time=719] In my soul, as I would describe it, I didn't really like myself.
[time=726] I felt like I had let my family down at times.
[time=731] Instead of going to family gatherings, I would choose to stay home because going to that family event
[time=739] would possibly mean that might delay when I got the buzz that night.
[time=746] That was one way that we could see my selfishness at work and my fear of people.
[time=757] It got to the point where, although the drinking of drugs started out as a social thing,
[time=763] it got to the point where it was something I just did at home.
[time=767] I would sit there with a can of beer in one hand and a one-hitter of weed and the other,
[time=774] forming a relationship with a television that wouldn't call me out for not accepting the basic responsibilities of being a man.
[time=785] So physically, my body began revolting against me.
[time=790] I ended up in the emergency room three different times.
[time=794] The third time, I went there in an ambulance right from work.
[time=799] What the doctors eventually decided was that I was suffering from anxiety.
[time=806] They didn't use the term withdrawal, but I'm sure that's what it was.
[time=811] I didn't understand why I would make it go 12 hours without a drink, so it had gotten that bad.
[time=820] My stepdad picked me up from the hospital and dropped me back off at my car, and I went right to the liquor store and bought a 30-pack of beer to take home with me and think about where I was going to go from there.
[time=835] I had tried to quit many times in the past. I had been throughout patient counseling even in my first years of college,
[time=844] and that worked for a couple of months, and then I was right back at it.
[time=850] Many times I had tried to quit on my own and even with the help of other people, but I always went back to the drugs and alcohol.
[time=861] Somehow I knew that this was different, and I knew that even though I didn't like myself,
[time=873] I felt a hope and I felt the love of Jesus with me.
[time=879] Some nights I would, if I felt like I was being tempted, I would go for walks instead,
[time=887] and sometimes those walks would divert into prayer, and it almost felt as if Jesus was with me on those walks.
[time=897] That was an important time of transition in my life.
[time=902] It's not that God has taken an introvert and made me an extrovert.
[time=908] He's taken an introvert, and he's put him in places where I need to rely on him
[time=914] to show his supernatural strength in areas where I am weak.
[time=919] That reminds me of my need to rely on him, my dependence on him, and may I always see it for what it is.
[time=928] What a great story, huh?
[time=934] I'm grateful to John for sharing his story.
[time=937] I wanted to start with that because I think it characterizes really what today is all about.
[time=942] It's about new method, a new method.
[time=945] We've looked so far in our series, we're in a series new, and so if you're with us for the first time, you're jumping in at a great spot because today's really about how God gives us the methods we need to keep going.
[time=955] Do you ever feel like you're just too inadequate, too small to do the big things that maybe God wants to do?
[time=961] I know that has been, in a lot of ways, the story of my life.
[time=964] So we're going to be in Isaiah chapter 43.
[time=966] If you got your Bible, slip there with me, Isaiah 43, and so whether you're watching us online today or television,
[time=974] we're glad that you're here and thankful for everybody in this room.
[time=977] What a good-looking group that we have.
[time=979] And so we're going to be looking at how God can do the things that you can't do.
[time=984] Does anybody in yet?
[time=986] I need a little bit of help sometimes.
[time=988] I need a lot of bit of help, a lot of times.
[time=991] I think you can identify.
[time=993] And so speaking of that, God, I don't know if it's God.
[time=996] I don't know if it's what it is, but there's some pretty neat sports things going on.
[time=999] A little bit of a buzz around town lately.
[time=1002] Why would that be?
[time=1003] Any Cubs fans in the building?
[time=1005] Whoo!
[time=1006] It's great.
[time=1007] And how about the Indians there, too, right?
[time=1009] Cleveland and Chicago.
[time=1010] Yeah.
[time=1011] A lot of Michigan fans in the room.
[time=1013] That's going well for you.
[time=1014] If you're a Notre Dame fan, I know I have many family members here at Blackcalt that are Notre Dame fans.
[time=1019] I can identify probably more with you as a Georgia fan this year.
[time=1022] But hey, we're in it together, right?
[time=1025] There's plenty of grace for every sports fan known to man, right?
[time=1029] Only Jesus could bridge the gap between Notre Dame and Michigan.
[time=1035] But he can do just that.
[time=1038] So, hey, let's do our theme verse.
[time=1040] This second Corinthians chapter five.
[time=1042] You've been working on it?
[time=1043] Yeah.
[time=1044] Remember last week I joked with you because your eyes were up here and I know you were looking at the screen.
[time=1047] But I'm looking now to see if I get some eye contact.
[time=1050] Second Corinthians, we're trying to memorize this verse.
[time=1052] Second Corinthians five verse 17.
[time=1054] You ready to say it with me?
[time=1056] Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[time=1062] The old has passed away.
[time=1065] Behold, the new has come.
[time=1068] I'm impressed.
[time=1069] Are you impressed?
[time=1070] Yeah.
[time=1071] Good job.
[time=1073] So, in this series, just a quick recap with that, we've looked at new meaning.
[time=1076] We looked at the purpose that comes from new meaning, how we see, determines how we be, how we live, how we walk it out.
[time=1082] Last week, we looked at the waves of life.
[time=1084] Anybody encounter a few waves this week?
[time=1086] One or two, maybe.
[time=1087] Hopefully God's Word has carried you through those waves in a way that looked a little bit different this wave than last wave.
[time=1094] But we looked at that fact that God's grace, this recurring, carries us to renewed growth.
[time=1099] And that leads us to today.
[time=1100] Now, how can we continue that growth?
[time=1102] How can we continue to do the things that only God could lead us to do?
[time=1105] How can we continue to keep pressing forward, moving forward, as we just sang about, when we feel like life is crumbling around us?
[time=1113] Or when the new things that it seems God wants to do feels a little bit too big for us.
[time=1118] And so, we'll look at that today, but we don't feel new at times.
[time=1122] If you remember, what are the three things that make us not feel so new?
[time=1125] It's our history, our hurts, and our habits.
[time=1128] Say that with me.
[time=1129] It's our history, our hurts, and our habits.
[time=1133] Our history is what I did.
[time=1135] Anybody ever done anything in your history that you don't like and regret?
[time=1138] Can I get a name in?
[time=1140] Our hurts is what somebody did to me.
[time=1143] And then our habits are the things that we continue to do.
[time=1146] I won't ask you if you have any of those, because I know we all have them in the room.
[time=1149] And so, do those worries, though?
[time=1151] Last week we talked about Philippians 4.
[time=1153] If you're with us last week, some of my favorite verses about worry.
[time=1156] It says, "Be anxious for nothing." But do the worries of your life ever just feel so big that it makes you feel so small that you could never do anything big?
[time=1165] Anybody with me there?
[time=1167] Those worries become the chains that we drag around in our life.
[time=1172] And we worry about this and we worry about that.
[time=1175] Right now there's this election that's coming up.
[time=1177] Sometimes we get so caught up in how that's going to turn out or how this conflict at work is going to turn out.
[time=1182] Or we wonder if our kids are going to get past that class.
[time=1185] We're wondering, we're worrying, we're wondering, we're worrying.
[time=1188] And we get to where there's this big chain around our neck that we drag around every single day.
[time=1194] And so today I want to ask you, just between you and Jesus, to answer this question, what is your greatest worry chain?
[time=1200] That's what we'll call it, because that's really what worries are.
[time=1203] What's your greatest worry chain that you drug in the building with you today?
[time=1209] Just think about what that is.
[time=1211] And I just believe that God's going to speak to you in that area.
[time=1214] Because here's the bottom line of Isaiah 43.
[time=1216] We'll be looking at verses 14 through 25 in just a moment.
[time=1219] Isaiah 43 talks to us about God's methods, his ways.
[time=1224] And so here's the bottom line.
[time=1225] If you're taking notes, jot this down.
[time=1227] The bottom line today is that God's ways destroy my worries.
[time=1232] I believe in proclaiming truth and claiming it together.
[time=1235] So I want us to say that out loud together.
[time=1237] Say it with me.
[time=1238] God's ways destroy my worries.
[time=1243] Look at somebody say, you're going to need this one today.
[time=1246] Because I think we all have those worries that we drag around.
[time=1249] God's ways are not our ways though.
[time=1251] And so in Isaiah, don't flip there.
[time=1252] I'll read this to you.
[time=1253] Isaiah 55 verses 8 and 9, it says, "For my thoughts are not your thoughts."
[time=1260] Can I get a name in?
[time=1262] God, I'm telling you, God does things in ways that just don't make sense to me sometimes.
[time=1267] But he continues, "Neither are your ways my ways," declares the Lord.
[time=1272] "For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts." On the screen is 1 Corinthians chapter 1 and verse 25 where it says, "For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men."
[time=1291] I have learned in life that God's agenda, God's plan, God's timing, God's ways are all ways
[time=1300] better than mine.
[time=1303] So many times though, I act like my ways have got to be better than his.
[time=1307] So many times, if I'm honest, I'd even say that I've looked at God and said, "God, I know you created the universe and all, and I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, but I'm pretty sure you're a little off on this one because we need to go this route." Anybody with me, if you're honest, we're all done that, right?
[time=1323] His ways confound the wisdom of the wise.
[time=1327] It makes no sense, and even our journey of coming here to Fort Wayne, it was not something that
[time=1333] we were looking for.
[time=1334] It was not something that we had mapped out.
[time=1336] It's not because I have anything against you.
[time=1338] I didn't know you.
[time=1340] I was just fine where I was.
[time=1342] But God said, "I've got a different plan," and I said, "But what if I don't like that plan?" He said, "You're going to do it anyway." And here I am, and I do like his plan because his plan is always better than mine.
[time=1354] And his plan is always better than yours, too.
[time=1357] It's always better than yours, too.
[time=1359] And his ways are better than ours.
[time=1362] So in Isaiah 43, we get to see a glimpse of God's methods.
[time=1366] We get to see a glimpse of his ways and how those ways break the chains of bondage that
[time=1373] come from our worries.
[time=1375] So let's look at Isaiah, chapter 43.
[time=1378] The first thing I want to tell you, three things we're going to look at.
[time=1380] Straight from this passage here in Isaiah 43, verses 14 through 17, we're going to find that his ways overrule my obstacles.
[time=1390] His ways overrule my obstacles.
[time=1393] Isaiah 43, starting in verse 14.
[time=1396] Anybody ready for the word this morning?
[time=1399] Let's do it.
[time=1400] "Thus says the Lord," verse 14, "You're a dimmer, the Holy One of Israel.
[time=1403] For your sake, I send to Babylon and bring them all down as fugitives.
[time=1408] Even the Chaldeans in the ships in which they rejoice." Those ships, those Chaldeans, those Babylonians that he says, "I will bring down." That represented to Israel in this time you need to know they're big obstacles.
[time=1422] They were big obstacles, big oppositions in their life.
[time=1425] You say, "Well, that means nothing to me, those things, but I'm guessing you can identify with God's target audience here of Israel in that you also have some pretty big obstacles and pretty big enemies in your life." Anybody with me?
[time=1439] Verse 15, "I am the Lord, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.
[time=1444] Thus says the Lord who makes a way in D.C., a path in the mighty waters, who
[time=1451] brings forth chariot and horse, army, and warrior, they lie down.
[time=1456] They cannot rise, they're extinguished, quenched like a wick." I love that passage because it talks about obstacles, and we all have obstacles, and they're real obstacles, but God's ways overrule your obstacles.
[time=1470] I love in verse 14, those big obstacles, as he's talking about the Babylonians, and those ships that they rejoice in, and how he says, "I will bring them down." Here's the thing, whatever you face today, it is no match for your Savior.
[time=1485] He looks at any obstacle and says, "I can bring that down with a thought." But yet I know some of you are saying, "That's great, and I believe that, but he isn't bringing my obstacles down." I wish he would, but he hasn't yet brought down those obstacles.
[time=1500] That goes back to his ways.
[time=1501] We're going to get there in a minute, so don't get ahead of me.
[time=1503] Stay with me for a minute.
[time=1504] I promise we'll address that to his timing, the past, those things that we drag around with us, but he can, with a word, bring down the very obstacles you see as impassable, impossible things to get through.
[time=1516] That's the God that we serve.
[time=1518] That's the King who sits on the throne.
[time=1521] In verse 16, I love how he says, "I'm going to make a way." We're talking about God's ways.
[time=1525] A way in the sea and a path in the mighty waters.
[time=1528] Some of you feel like you're drowning still.
[time=1530] It's like, well, the pastor talked about the waves of life last week, but the waves just got bigger.
[time=1535] I feel like I'm drowning even more in the waves, the sea.
[time=1538] But God says, "I'm going to make a way in that sea, and I'm going to make a path through those mighty waters that you face." David Platt said this because I want to submit to you.
[time=1549] If you're thinking you're going to get what many call this, the prosperity type gospel where if you just follow Jesus, everything works out and your church smile will be a real smile and everything's going to be perfect and the seas are going to be smooth, it's really not that way.
[time=1565] Look at the followers of Jesus.
[time=1567] Look at what they went through.
[time=1569] Some of the toughest things any of us could ever imagine facing.
[time=1572] You think you have obstacles.
[time=1573] Look at those who walked with Jesus and talked with Jesus.
[time=1576] Look where they ended up.
[time=1577] Almost all of them died for their faith.
[time=1581] It's like, well, this is really encouraging pastor.
[time=1583] I thought I'd come to get encouraged today.
[time=1585] But you can be encouraged by the fact that even though we walk through those tough challenges in our life.
[time=1591] Hear me.
[time=1592] Even though this Jesus following way does have obstacles and it's not a very safe way to go.
[time=1598] The safest place to be in your life is in the will of God.
[time=1602] I'll never forget I had my pastor growing up baptized in Franklin First Baptist Church in Franklin, Georgia.
[time=1608] It's a little tiny town and I remember our pastor always saying the safest place to be is in the will of God.
[time=1614] And I'd be like the safest place to be in the will of God.
[time=1616] And I remember it.
[time=1617] Like we're memorizing this scripture.
[time=1619] It meant nothing to me at times.
[time=1620] But there have been so many times in my life where God brought those words right back up.
[time=1625] That's why I believe in memorizing 2 Corinthians 5-17.
[time=1627] I've already heard some of your stories where, hey, I memorized it and this week it popped up at the exact moment I needed it.
[time=1633] It's because the truth we store up in our silence comes out in the storms.
[time=1638] You've heard me say that before.
[time=1639] You're hearing me say it again.
[time=1640] That's why we store up God's truth.
[time=1642] But David Platt said this about how overcoming obstacles are often going to bring you to unsafe places.
[time=1647] In his book, Radical, he wrote this.
[time=1649] "To everyone wanting a safe, untroubled, comfortable, life free from danger, stay away from Jesus.
[time=1657] The danger in our lives will always increase in proportion to the
[time=1663] depth of our relationship with Christ." I'm going to say that statement one more time.
[time=1668] The danger in our lives will always increase in proportion to the depth of our relationship with Christ.
[time=1675] Some of you may say, I don't even necessarily agree that.
[time=1677] It may not always look that way and it might not.
[time=1679] And I'm not here to argue for or against that.
[time=1681] But I will say this, the more you follow Jesus, the more you're going to have to be uncomfortable.
[time=1686] Jesus didn't call you to be comfortable.
[time=1691] And even the way we do church, we try to make it comfortable.
[time=1694] We want you to be comfortable.
[time=1695] We want you to be comfortable when you come in these seats because we want you to know that you are wanted.
[time=1699] We want you to know that there's grace for you.
[time=1701] We want you to know that Jesus will meet you where you are.
[time=1704] But why do we do all that?
[time=1705] We don't do it just so that we can all get comfortable and sit in our cozy building when it's cold outside.
[time=1709] It's nice and warm in here so we can sing and go out and come back and do it again next week.
[time=1714] Why would I do that?
[time=1715] I don't want to do that with my life.
[time=1717] No, we make this place comfortable so all of us can be a part of something that turns into something that goes out so that we can get uncomfortable together.
[time=1726] The calling of Jesus for His church is that we would get uncomfortable as a team and look outward beyond what our little bubble affords to us.
[time=1735] So I want you to know, as your new pastor here, I've only been here a few weeks, I'm here to burst some bubbles.
[time=1741] (laughter) God's bursted my bubbles so many times and called me out of the waters that are still and smooth and quiet, but He's doing the same in your life.
[time=1755] I knew I wouldn't get too many amenes there, but the beauty is that God will walk you through every challenge, every obstacle that you face.
[time=1762] Some of you still don't believe me, so I'm going to read to you my favorite list about excuses.
[time=1766] I love this list because it comes straight from scripture.
[time=1769] If you think you've got excuses, if you think you have obstacles, try some of these.
[time=1774] Try to keep up with me on this.
[time=1775] Don't try to write them down.
[time=1776] I'll share the list with you later if you want to, but just let this minister to you.
[time=1779] This is a list of Bible excuses that could have been crippling worry chains in people's lives.
[time=1785] You ready?
[time=1786] Here's the list.
[time=1787] Moses stuttered.
[time=1788] David's armor didn't fit.
[time=1790] Hosea married a prostitute.
[time=1791] David had an affair.
[time=1792] Solomon had too much money and too many women.
[time=1795] Abraham was too old.
[time=1796] Timothy had ulcers.
[time=1797] Paul was ugly.
[time=1798] Jeremiah was suicidal.
[time=1799] Elijah suffered from depression.
[time=1801] Paul was a murderer.
[time=1803] So was Moses.
[time=1804] So was David.
[time=1805] John the Baptist dressed funny in eight bugs.
[time=1809] It gets better.
[time=1811] Samson needed a haircut.
[time=1813] Zacchaeus was too short.
[time=1814] David was only a teenager.
[time=1816] So was Mary the mother of Jesus.
[time=1818] So was Daniel.
[time=1819] And here's my personal favorite.
[time=1821] Are you ready?
[time=1822] Lazarus was dead.
[time=1824] [laughter] Do your excuses look a little smaller now?
[time=1830] I know mine do when I look at all the things that God overcame in this story.
[time=1835] The greatest story ever told.
[time=1837] The story of the gospel.
[time=1839] The things that God has overcome to do His will and His way in the world to be made known today blows my mind.
[time=1848] You think He can overrule your obstacles now?
[time=1851] Because I want you to know He can.
[time=1854] And I want to just challenge you.
[time=1856] Do something a little different for a moment.
[time=1859] Some of you have really been letting some obstacles get in your way.
[time=1862] Maybe it's time for you to accept Christ and stop playing around with this thing.
[time=1867] You've been toying back and forth and feeling unworthy and today is just that day.
[time=1871] And you need to just take a moment and do that now.
[time=1874] You don't have to wait for a song at the end of a service.
[time=1876] We just do that to give you a chance to respond.
[time=1878] But God doesn't need a song.
[time=1879] He's been at work in your heart long before we had songs to sing.
[time=1883] Some of you have been saved but it's time to get baptized.
[time=1885] And you just have been putting that step off.
[time=1888] I would love to be a part of that step in your life.
[time=1894] And so I want to challenge you to get this card out again.
[time=1896] If you didn't put one in the offering plate already.
[time=1898] And you won't get this from a pastor very often.
[time=1901] I'm not going to promise it again any time soon.
[time=1903] So you better take advantage.
[time=1905] I'm going to give you a moment to check out of my sermon.
[time=1910] A lot of you are like I've been there a long time brother.
[time=1915] I'm going to give you a moment to check out of my sermon because some of you just need to take that step.
[time=1921] Some of you just need to take a step of writing it down and saying okay today is the day.
[time=1925] I'm going to get baptized.
[time=1926] I'm going to let them call me.
[time=1927] I've been afraid of what if one of those pastors call me.
[time=1930] Oh my goodness.
[time=1931] I promise you we want to walk you through this.
[time=1933] Today is that day for you.
[time=1935] So take that step, fill out that card.
[time=1937] And even if you're at home watching us online, send us an email at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=1942] We want to walk with you.
[time=1944] We're in this together and God will overcome those obstacles.
[time=1948] Second thing, his ways, looking at verses 18 through 21, his ways preside over my past.
[time=1956] His ways preside, they rule, they reign over my past.
[time=1962] I'm guessing in a room this size, with this many people, a lot of you brought some chains and baggage and skeletons from your past with you this morning, and they're sitting right beside you.
[time=1971] They're sitting in your lap.
[time=1973] They're staring you in your face.
[time=1976] And you're trying to hear what God's saying, but that's what's holding you back.
[time=1980] You just know there's these things in my past.
[time=1983] Well, I've got some news for you.
[time=1985] These are two of the verses, a few of the verses that have really characterized my journey, Jessica's journey over the last year, part of which led us to come, take the step of faith to come to Fort Wayne, Indiana, and for me to be the lead pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=1999] Looking back at it, I see how God was piecing things together all the way through, but in the middle of it, I didn't see a lot of that stuff.
[time=2006] A lot of it didn't make a lot of sense.
[time=2008] It didn't fit my plans and my agenda, but then again, I learned that his ways are not my ways, and his thoughts are higher than my thoughts, and they're always better.
[time=2017] Look at verse number 18 of Isaiah 43.
[time=2020] Again, his ways preside over my past.
[time=2022] Don't believe me?
[time=2023] Let's see what God says.
[time=2024] Remember not the former things.
[time=2027] Remember not the former things, nor consider the things of old.
[time=2032] And if you look at those words, it doesn't just mean to kind of hold on to to let them pop up as never, you know, pop up thought that comes up into your mind, but no, don't let these things control you and consume you anymore.
[time=2044] Verse 19, "Behold, I am doing a," what?
[time=2048] A new thing.
[time=2049] Behold, I am doing a new thing.
[time=2052] Now it springs forth.
[time=2053] You're saying, well, I was hoping it'd be Monday.
[time=2055] No, he says, now it springs forth.
[time=2057] Will you not perceive it?
[time=2059] That word perceived doesn't just mean will you not see it?
[time=2061] Will you not acknowledge it?
[time=2062] Will you not just look at it and know that it's there?
[time=2064] That word perceived, I love it.
[time=2066] I looked even more into it this week.
[time=2068] I knew it meant to really embrace and to own.
[time=2070] Some of you have heard me say that before, but here's what it really means.
[time=2074] It really means to learn.
[time=2076] Hmm.
[time=2078] Will you not learn it?
[time=2080] Will you not walk through it, embrace it, own it, let it penetrate your heart and your life?
[time=2085] Will you not learn and let me stretch you as I do this new thing?
[time=2091] Hmm.
[time=2093] I will make, and if you don't think you can do it, because some of you said, that all sounds good.
[time=2099] It's good preaching and all, but I can't do it.
[time=2103] He continues in verse 19, I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.
[time=2108] Does your life ever feel like a wilderness or a desert?
[time=2111] Well, he says, I'll blaze a path through that wilderness.
[time=2115] I'll make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.
[time=2118] If you feel dry today, God wants to quench your thirst and walk you through the things you never thought you could get through in your life.
[time=2125] But you can't let your past hold you back from it.
[time=2129] That's why that came first.
[time=2131] Verse 18 came before verse 19 for a reason.
[time=2134] You can't remember that you've got to let the past go.
[time=2137] You've got to learn from the past, perceive the new that's coming in spite of the past.
[time=2141] If you want to experience the new things that God wants to do.
[time=2144] Verse 20, the wild beast will honor me, the jackals and the ostriches.
[time=2149] It seems like a weird follow-up, but let me ask you.
[time=2152] Should I, well, I was going to say, should I ask you if you have any jackals or ostriches in your life, but that's probably not a safe question, is it?
[time=2162] We'll leave that alone. You probably do, though.
[time=2164] For I give water in the wilderness, rivers in the desert, to give drink to my chosen people and the people whom I form for myself that they might declare my praise.
[time=2176] That's what will happen if you realize that God's ways preside over, rule over, are bigger than your past.
[time=2185] Isaiah 62, I love, because here's the thing, some of you have labels from your past right now.
[time=2191] And I would ask you, I love how it says the beast will obey him.
[time=2195] He'll tame the beasts in your life.
[time=2198] And so I would go back to that original question, what's your worry chain?
[time=2202] It's probably the same thing that you would call a beast in your life.
[time=2205] You just cannot tame that beast.
[time=2207] Maybe it's the history or the hurts or the habits, those things you just keep doing.
[time=2211] You're struggling to tame those beasts.
[time=2213] Well, God is bigger than those things that just consume you and control you in your life, especially those things in your past, because He said, "Behold, I'm coming to make all things new, all things new, even those things in your past that you think you will never be able to let go of." He said, "He wants to make you new even through those things." Isaiah 62, verse 2 says, "You shall be called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord will name." What are the labels you've carried around in your life?
[time=2243] Some of you would say that you're told, "You're just never going to amount to anything.
[time=2248] You're going to end up in prison one day.
[time=2251] You're a loser.
[time=2253] You're nothing.
[time=2256] Shame on you.
[time=2258] You'll never make it in life.
[time=2263] And you know, I don't say those things ingest or lightly, because I realize, as I said some of those things, a lot of phrases popped into your mind that have labeled you for a lot of years, if we're all honest.
[time=2277] And so it's with a lot of emotion, of emotion that I tell you that I hurt with you.
[time=2283] I know those things are real.
[time=2285] I don't take that lightly, but it's with so much excitement
[time=2291] that I can tell you that Isaiah 62 and verse 2 is true for you.
[time=2296] I will give you a new name, and it's going to be a name that I will give you.
[time=2301] Not that anybody else can give you, but the name that I will give you.
[time=2306] You don't have to be held back by the bonds and the chains of your past anymore.
[time=2311] Today is a new day because Jesus said so.
[time=2315] And he said, "I will take all of those labels, all of those things that you used to associate with when you look in the mirror, and I'll throw them away because I don't care, and I'm not held back by those things.
[time=2325] I don't care who said them.
[time=2327] I am greater than anybody who could say anything to you in your life."
[time=2333] And it'll change how you look in the mirror.
[time=2335] It'll change how you live your life.
[time=2337] I love in Scripture, Abraham became Abraham, Jacob, which means swindler or hustler became Israel.
[time=2344] There's a lot in all of these we can preach on, but I won't do that because we've got to get to the other point, right?
[time=2347] Because you have lunch today.
[time=2349] And Judges 6, Gideon became the mighty man of valor, warrior.
[time=2354] God will help you to grow into your new name, too.
[time=2358] I found that.
[time=2359] One of my new names was Preacher.
[time=2363] Gosh, if you'd have told me that a little over ten years ago, which God did tell me that a little over ten years ago, I'd look at you cross-eyed and probably start to faint.
[time=2375] And I did.
[time=2376] I did do. I didn't faint.
[time=2377] I came pretty close a few times, I'm sure.
[time=2379] But God's helped me grow into the names that He named for me.
[time=2382] I didn't choose to do this.
[time=2383] In fact, you've probably heard me say by now that the one thing I always told God I would never be is a pastor like my dad.
[time=2393] Be careful what you say you'll never do.
[time=2397] I think I have some grandparents that have said that.
[time=2399] Be careful what you say never about, boy.
[time=2401] Yeah?
[time=2403] Well, here I am.
[time=2404] And God will help you grow into whatever new name.
[time=2406] Maybe it's forgiven.
[time=2407] Maybe some of you just can't believe that you really are forgiven.
[time=2410] I'm going to help you with that in just a minute, too, as we continue in this passage.
[time=2414] But I'm not going to be able to really help you with anything.
[time=2416] Emma, you're going to have to believe God at His Word.
[time=2419] And I believe many of you are going to do that in this place today.
[time=2423] In your notes, write this down.
[time=2425] "My past will refine me, but it will not define me."
[time=2432] "My past will refine me, but it will not define me." And so here's the thing.
[time=2436] Let's just get the elephant in the room out on the table.
[time=2438] I have this little accent that you guys like to laugh at a little bit.
[time=2441] And so I want to invite you in.
[time=2443] I'm going to teach you some southern accent.
[time=2445] Are you ready?
[time=2446] Are you afraid?
[time=2447] You're afraid I'm going to rub off on you, aren't you?
[time=2449] And your family will disown you.
[time=2450] We're going to say this with our best southern accent possible, okay?
[time=2454] Are you ready?
[time=2455] Say it with me.
[time=2456] "My past will refine me, but it will not define me."
[time=2462] Do you believe that, though?
[time=2464] Do you believe that?
[time=2465] That my past will refine me.
[time=2467] It will make me more into this person that God wants me to be, not going to define me.
[time=2471] Some of you need to say today is that day it won't define me any longer.
[time=2475] It's been defining me for years, but that day is no more.
[time=2478] Jesus came to make all things new.
[time=2483] Number three, verses 22 through 25, rather, is that His ways invalidate my inadequacies.
[time=2492] His ways invalidate my inadequacies.
[time=2496] You ever feel too small to accomplish the things that God has before you?
[time=2499] You ever feel inadequate?
[time=2500] That's the story of my life.
[time=2503] If you haven't heard me say this before, you'll hear me say it today, and many, many times over, I believe, and I'm a living testimony of the fact that God does not call the equipped, but He always equips the called.
[time=2514] God does not call the equipped.
[time=2516] That's me doing this.
[time=2518] I wasn't equipped for this, but He equips the people He calls.
[time=2521] He helps you grow into the names He has for your life.
[time=2526] He doesn't mean He'll help you grow into the names that you want to have for your life, but He'll help you grow into the names that He has for your life, and He will walk you through and throw away your inadequacies.
[time=2536] I would agree with you would say, "Well, you saying those inadequacies aren't real?" No, you're very inadequate.
[time=2544] I'm very inadequate.
[time=2546] Man, this pastor's brutal, right?
[time=2548] It's true, none of us are adequate.
[time=2550] You don't have what it takes to do anything for the kingdom of God.
[time=2554] No, I don't have anything that it takes to do something for the kingdom of God, except for the blood of Jesus Christ that has saved my soul and equipped me because He called me to be a part of something bigger than myself.
[time=2567] But here's the thing, even though I didn't bring anything to the table, He brought everything to the table.
[time=2572] And I have everything at my disposal to do what God has called me to do.
[time=2576] You are no longer.
[time=2578] If you know Jesus, hear me.
[time=2579] I just told you you're inadequate, so I hope nobody cuts that part out because here's the important follow-up.
[time=2583] This is what it's all about.
[time=2584] Yes, you have been inadequate at one season or another in your life before you knew Jesus.
[time=2588] But if you know Jesus Christ today, you are adequate because His grace is sufficient for you.
[time=2597] He's just getting started with your life.
[time=2600] So stop letting the things of your past.
[time=2604] Stop letting your inadequacies hold you back from all the things that He wants to do with your life.
[time=2611] Psalm 71 verse 20, great verse simply says, "You who have made me see many troubles."
[time=2618] Hmm.
[time=2619] You ever feel like God just keeps throwing you into the whirlwind of life?
[time=2623] You who have made me see many troubles and calamities will revive me again from the depths of the earth.
[time=2629] You will bring me up again.
[time=2633] Romans 8, 31, tells us if God is for us, who can be against us.
[time=2638] So here's what I want to challenge you with.
[time=2640] Are you ready?
[time=2641] This is going to be hard this week, but you can do it because Jesus is in your corner and He is walking with you.
[time=2647] I want to challenge you to stop letting people, things, circumstances or yourself bring you down when God has already raised you up.
[time=2656] He's just getting started.
[time=2659] He walked you through a lot of troubles, a lot of waves in your life, but He has raised you up to walk in the power of Jesus
[time=2666] and nothing and no one can bring you down if Jesus has raised you up.
[time=2673] You're not inadequate if you know Jesus.
[time=2675] He's just getting started with the new things that He wants to do.
[time=2678] So I want to give you this statement for you to write down and ponder this week.
[time=2682] It's simply this, out of your greatest weakness is again, you do have those, right?
[time=2687] Okay.
[time=2688] Yep, we do.
[time=2689] God can raise up His greatest strength.
[time=2691] Out of your greatest weakness, God can raise up His greatest strength.
[time=2696] And I believe He's going to do that in your life this week.
[time=2699] If you don't believe me, let's look at those verses.
[time=2703] Verses 22 through 25, I want to read that and then I want to pause before verse 25 because that's where it gets good.
[time=2709] Because this gets a little depressing, but then God raises us up again at the end of this passage.
[time=2714] Verses 22 of Isaiah 43, yet you did not call upon me, O Jacob, but you have been weary of me, O Israel.
[time=2721] You have not brought me your sheep for burnt offerings or honored me with your sacrifices.
[time=2726] I have not burdened you with offerings or wearied you with frankincense.
[time=2730] You have not bought me sweet cane with money or satisfied me with the fat of your sacrifices.
[time=2737] But you have burdened me with your sins.
[time=2740] You have wearied me with your iniquities.
[time=2744] Hmm, that's me.
[time=2748] That's after the hold I'll make all things new.
[time=2752] I'll make a way in the wilderness, rivers in the desert.
[time=2756] I'm going to do these new things.
[time=2757] Will you not perceive it?
[time=2758] Now it springs forth.
[time=2760] After that, that's what we get.
[time=2763] Kind of sounds like the story of my life.
[time=2765] God does everything for me, I throw it in His face and do things my own way.
[time=2774] If you would identify today, I've got a word for you.
[time=2777] It comes from verse 25.
[time=2780] I am He who blots out your transgressions for my own sake, and I will not remember your sins.
[time=2796] I will not remember your sins.
[time=2800] What does that mean?
[time=2801] How can that be?
[time=2803] I'm that guy in verses 22 through 24 who just throws it back in God's face and says no thanks,
[time=2809] I'll do things my way.
[time=2810] I'm that guy, but God says no.
[time=2812] Even in the Old Testament, I love how Jesus is in every book of the Old Testament.
[time=2816] Did you know that?
[time=2817] You think, well, he wasn't on the scene yet.
[time=2819] Nobody was coming and every word of the Bible paves the way for Jesus.
[time=2824] And we see it here because we know when we have Him as the definer of our life, that He won't
[time=2831] even remember our sins.
[time=2833] How is that possible?
[time=2834] What does that look like?
[time=2835] Explain that to me, you say.
[time=2836] It's because when He looks at you, He doesn't see all the junk.
[time=2841] He looks at you and He sees Jesus.
[time=2845] That's why we do communion.
[time=2847] The Lord suffer because He poured out His blood for us and His body was broken for us so that
[time=2853] when God looks at us, He doesn't see our junk, He sees Jesus.
[time=2856] He doesn't see the me that once was.
[time=2859] He sees the me that He has renamed and made whole.
[time=2863] And a lot of you are like this story I heard a long time ago, a preacher talked about how a father and son were walking on a path and on this path was a huge log right in front
[time=2875] of them.
[time=2876] And the little boy and they needed to get out of the way so they could keep moving, had their bikes and all with them.
[time=2880] And so the little boy looked at the dad and said, "Dad, I've been working out.
[time=2884] Do you think I could move that log?" And the dad looks at the little boy and says, "I know you could move that log if you use all of your strength." Okay, so he pulled his sleeves up.
[time=2895] He went to lifting.
[time=2899] And for about five minutes he tried and he looked at his dad and his dad just went.
[time=2903] And he kept trying.
[time=2905] And he was trying to lift that log with all of his might.
[time=2908] He gave everything that he had until he was dripping with sweat and completely exhausted and went back to his dad as weary as he could be.
[time=2915] And said, "Dad, I thought you said I could lift the log.
[time=2917] I gave everything I had.
[time=2918] I tried my best." And his dad just simply looked at him and said, "Son, I told you you could lift that log if you used all your strength.
[time=2927] You never asked me for help." And needless to say, they went over together, "Dad, will you come help me then?"
[time=2939] Off went the log.
[time=2941] I'm guessing that many of you in here are just like that little boy.
[time=2945] You're a weary loglifter.
[time=2948] You have been trying to lift the logs of your life by yourself for too long.
[time=2954] And it's time to say enough.
[time=2956] It's time to tap into all of the strength you have available to you.
[time=2960] And I'm going to tell you, it doesn't get any better than having the dad and that story be Jesus.
[time=2965] You have that in this moment right now.
[time=2969] With that, will you just bow your heads with me and reflect on the log lifting that you've been doing?
[time=2974] What have you been doing on your own?
[time=2978] That it's now time for Jesus to take over.
[time=2981] If you know Jesus, there's still a lot of logs in your life, a lot of inadequacies, a lot of things in your past
[time=2987] that have been holding you back.
[time=2990] But I want to speak to those of you who would say right now, you know, I need to just give my life to Jesus.
[time=2995] Maybe you filled out that card just a moment ago.
[time=2997] You filled it out because you stopped in the middle of my sermon and said, "I'm giving my life to Jesus." If that's not you right now, I want to give you just a moment to do that.
[time=3005] To respond to what he's doing because his word doesn't come back void.
[time=3009] That means it's real and it's alive and it's active and God wants to work in your life.
[time=3013] Some of you need to just pray something like this from your heart to his.
[time=3016] And I would challenge you to do just that right now.
[time=3018] If you don't know Jesus, you don't know that you would spend eternity with him if you were to die today.
[time=3022] God forbid, as you leave this place.
[time=3025] It's not about the words, it's not even really about a prayer.
[time=3027] It's about your heart being turned to God.
[time=3029] Just scream it to him, say, "God, I do need you today.
[time=3032] Jesus, I know you died for me, paying the price for my sin, that only you could pay.
[time=3037] I know you're alive, Jesus.
[time=3040] Please will you forgive me and save me.
[time=3043] Wash away my sins.
[time=3045] Jesus, I'm yours.
[time=3046] This life has been mine.
[time=3048] It's now yours.
[time=3049] Christ is my reward on my devotion.
[time=3065] Now there's nothing in this world that could ever satisfy.
[time=3076] Through every trial my soul will see no turning back.
[time=3085] I've been set free.
[time=3090] Christ is enough for me.
[time=3103] Everything I need is in you.
[time=3109] Everything I need.
[time=3114] Christ, my all in all, the joy of my salvation.
[time=3125] And this hope will never fail, 'cause heaven is our home.
[time=3135] Through every storm my soul will see Jesus is here.
[time=3144] To God be the glory.
[time=3149] Christ is enough for me.
[time=3162] Everything I need is in you.
[time=3168] Everything I need.
[time=3171] I have decided to follow Jesus.
[time=3177] No turning back.
[time=3183] I have decided to follow Jesus.
[time=3188] No turning back.
[time=3194] The cross before me.
[time=3197] The world behind me.
[time=3200] No turning back.
[time=3206] The cross before me.
[time=3209] The world behind me.
[time=3212] No turning back.
[time=3221] Christ is enough for me.
[time=3234] Everything I need is in you.
[time=3240] Everything I need.
[time=3244] Christ is enough for me.
[time=3257] Everything I need is in you.
[time=3263] Everything I need.
[time=3266] I have decided to follow Jesus.
[time=3272] No turning back.
[time=3278] I have decided to follow Jesus.
[time=3283] No turning back.
[time=3289] I have decided to follow Jesus.
[time=3295] No turning back.
[time=3302] Thank you so much for watching, listening, and just letting God work today.
[time=3306] And maybe you are one of the people that God has just really tugged on your heart.
[time=3310] And maybe you've just prayed.
[time=3312] Or maybe you're still contemplating taking that step of faith.
[time=3315] That leap of faith.
[time=3316] Maybe you've been standing on that edge for a long time.
[time=3318] And today is the time to respond to the gospel and to start that new story.
[time=3322] That new chapter in your journey.
[time=3324] I want to just lead you through a moment and maybe facilitate that with you.
[time=3328] Right now, there's no time like the present.
[time=3330] And if we wait until we feel ready, if we wait until we feel like we've got things together, that time just won't come.
[time=3336] And so I want to challenge you just to take that step right now.
[time=3339] And the gospel really is all about salvation, really is all about.
[time=3342] Your heart just crying out to God what you already know.
[time=3346] You already know that, hey, I can't get to God on my own.
[time=3349] I'm not good enough to meet that standard that God has a perfection.
[time=3353] I'm nowhere near there.
[time=3355] So I'm separated from God because of my sin, but Jesus paid that price.
[time=3358] Jesus is the reason that that doesn't end things for me.
[time=3361] Jesus is the reason that I can have hope and salvation.
[time=3364] I know Jesus died for me.
[time=3366] I know that he's alive and I give my life to you.
[time=3369] So I want to facilitate that for you if that's where you are as you watch us right now.
[time=3373] Just pray something like this from your heart to his.
[time=3375] Say, Jesus, I need you right now.
[time=3377] I don't feel ready, but I'm taking that leap.
[time=3379] I choose it today.
[time=3380] Today is the day of salvation for me.
[time=3382] Will you save me?
[time=3383] Will you forgive me?
[time=3384] I know you died for me.
[time=3386] I know you're alive and I just want to lay my life at the further cross.
[time=3390] I just give you all of me, not the pieces of all of those pieces together.
[time=3395] It makes all of me I lay down at your feet.
[time=3398] If that's you today, then the Bible promises you.
[time=3401] And better than that, the author of the Bible, Jesus himself, God the Father, promises you that you have been saved.
[time=3408] You have an enemy screaming in your ear or whispering in your ear that it didn't really matter.
[time=3414] It didn't really count.
[time=3415] But today I want you to know that if you have screamed that out to Jesus that you've been saved.
[time=3420] We want to walk with you if that is you today and I'll tell you a little bit more about that.
[time=3424] But for those of you who have watched, those of you who may have just taken that first step, we want to continue to walk alongside of you as the church.
[time=3430] Because here's the thing is we're not just called to go to church.
[time=3433] We're called to be the church.
[time=3435] The way that we be the church together is we get connected in community.
[time=3439] We lean on other people.
[time=3440] And so we want to walk beside you and give you the tools that you need in your daily life.
[time=3445] And so one of the ways that we do that, we'd like to get a booklet into your hands.
[time=3448] It's called beginning steps, a growth guide for new believers.
[time=3451] If you've taken any step, maybe you want to be baptized.
[time=3453] You've already been saved.
[time=3455] You've already given your life to Jesus.
[time=3456] But now's the time to be baptized.
[time=3458] We'd love to be a part of that, part of your story at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=3462] And so if that's you, then we want to get this book into your hands.
[time=3465] You're going to see an email address and a phone number on your screen.
[time=3468] And we want to get these things, these materials in your hands.
[time=3470] You can reach out to us with any questions that you have.
[time=3472] We want to walk alongside of you.
[time=3474] And so today, wrap up by just simply challenging you with those areas we've looked at.
[time=3479] Maybe it's your past that's held you back.
[time=3481] It's been the worry chain that you've been dragging around.
[time=3484] Maybe it's your inadequacies.
[time=3486] You just feel like I'm too small to do anything significant.
[time=3489] No matter what it is that you drag around, no matter what worry chain you drag around today,
[time=3495] God's ways are bigger.
[time=3499] And His grace is always sufficient for you.
[time=3502] We love you and we care about you here at Black Hawk Ministries as do I.
[time=3506] And anyway, we can serve you.
[time=3507] Please let us know that.
[time=3508] Thank you so much for watching and share this and share the message of hope, the message of Jesus, the message of new as we move forward together.
[time=3515] God bless you and I'll see you soon.
