[time=0] You
[time=30] [MUSIC]
[time=60] Hi, I'm Joe Cox and my story starts in June of 1990 when I married Angie Burkett.
[time=72] We married and immediately left to go back to North Carolina where I was stationed when I was in the Marine Corps and had some good years together.
[time=80] However, in 1993, about April or so, March, we discovered that she had cancer.
[time=89] It was diagnosed eventually at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and they had to do surgery to resect the cancer.
[time=97] I originally thought it was non-malignant or benign and ended up finding out the day we were getting out of the hospital that it was actually a malignant tumor.
[time=108] They took half her liver along with the tumor and thought they got it all, but there were no guarantees, obviously.
[time=114] In 1998, we had Kristen who was at the time six years old
[time=122] and Joseph was at the time ten months old.
[time=126] The cancer didn't come back. In fact, it came back two more times.
[time=130] And then there were two more surgeries involved over the years.
[time=137] The last time the cancer came back was in 1998 when Angie was pregnant with Joseph
[time=145] that that was one of the times that the CT scan caught the cancer before she had another surgery.
[time=153] And that time, the doctor or oncologist wanted her to have an abortion.
[time=162] That was the last time we saw him. We explained that that was not an option.
[time=167] Angie obviously was fully on board and even if she wouldn't have been, I would have said that, but she was on board.
[time=173] The doctor in North Carolina explained to us that the surgery can be done while she's pregnant.
[time=178] If it's done, I think, in the first or third trimester.
[time=181] Angie, however, decided, "No, this is not going to happen. We're going to have the baby. Then I'll take care of that." Well, Angie had Joseph and then we find out when he's probably June or so of 1998, we see blood in Joseph's urine in his diaper.
[time=205] And that led to the urologist here in Fort Wayne, which then led us down to Riley, children's hospital,
[time=212] which then led to a diagnosis of a tumor on Joseph's kidney, his right kidney.
[time=218] The surgery for that was the very next morning, so I ran home, got closed, came back, got back in time for the surgery.
[time=226] While we were there that week, I noticed Angie getting sick. I noticed that she wasn't good.
[time=233] Encourage her to go and have this CAT scan done that she was due for another one at the time.
[time=238] And she explained to me that, "No, I'm not doing this. I'm waiting until he's better. Then I'll get my CAT scan."
[time=244] Well, we got home from the surgery. They opened Joseph up and the tumor was too big to remove.
[time=252] The plan was to do chemotherapy. They put a central line in his chest and then come back when the tumor shrunk and then take it out.
[time=260] We came home and Angie got more sick to a point where she couldn't eat. She ended up deciding, "Okay, I'll have the CAT scan done."
[time=271] And the doctor's office called us and said that we needed to see you immediately.
[time=276] We went into the doctor's office and Dr. Smith sat us down and explained that the cancer had returned.
[time=282] And this time, instead of being a non-aggressive malignant, it was an aggressive malignant cancer. It was changing forms.
[time=290] And it was all spread throughout the liver. This time, there was no, there was no resecting it.
[time=298] She was given three to six months to live. She lived until October the 5th.
[time=304] Just before that, the doctors had explained that Joseph's ready for surgery. The chemo had to effectively shrunk the tumor.
[time=311] I said, "Can we wait until my wife is gone because she's not going to last?" And they were like, "Absolutely."
[time=318] So Angie passed on October the 5th. Joseph's schedule for surgery was scheduled for November the 5th.
[time=326] So November the 5th, my mom, Joseph, and I went down to Riley and he had his surgery and we were there for an entire week for that.
[time=336] Hi, my name's Diana. My story begins when I'm a freshman in high school.
[time=341] When I was a freshman at New Haven High School, I asked Scott Hevel to the Sadie Hawkins Dance.
[time=346] I was 15 and he was 14. That was March 19th, 1976. And we were together until we got married in June of '81.
[time=357] Scott and I had four kids, Melissa, Amy, Jessica, and Jared.
[time=363] I had a wonderful husband, four kids, and life was perfect.
[time=368] Fast forward to 1993 and found ourselves kneeling at the side of our bed together asking Jesus Christ to be our Lord and Savior.
[time=383] We ended up at Black Hawk and we're part of the Abundant Life ABF and our kids were plugged in as well.
[time=393] We had never felt that kind of community before and we loved it. It was truly some of the best days of our lives.
[time=401] Life was perfect.
[time=405] February 13th of 1997, everything changed.
[time=412] The day started out as any other day. The kids went off to school. Scott was getting ready for work and I was standing right next to him and he collapsed to the floor.
[time=424] I called 9-1-1 and they came and took Scott to the hospital. I called my dad and he took me.
[time=434] We got to the hospital and we were in a quiet room for a while and then the doctors came and told me that Scott had a slim chance of living.
[time=446] I just couldn't believe it.
[time=452] He hadn't had a heart attack after all. He had aneurysm in his brain that ruptured and he was in a coma.
[time=464] The first several days I stayed around the clock. Everything was just really touch and go and days turned to weeks and weeks turned to months.
[time=476] Scott had several surgeries during this time but he remained in a coma.
[time=484] There was a time when it was determined that Scott wasn't going to get better and he was moved to a hospice facility.
[time=493] I still believed that God could heal him at any time. At the same time I prayed for God's will and what was best for Scott.
[time=508] May 8th after almost three months of being in a coma. Scott went to be with Jesus. Scott's celebration service was beautiful.
[time=523] The gospel was shared and Scott would have loved that. This time the kids are 14, 11, 9 and 6.
[time=533] I didn't find myself getting angry at God at this time but I did cry out to God and pray.
[time=543] In fact I bought a picture of a lady kneeling and praying and it has Psalm 55, 17 and it says evening.
[time=550] In morning, hand at noon, will I pray and call aloud and he will hear me. I remember one particular time. I was calling out to God and I told him.
[time=562] I said I'm 36 years old. I'm widowed. I have four kids. My life was so good. It will never be good again.
[time=573] Almost immediately after I said that I apologized to God and I said I'm so sorry. I'm underestimating you.
[time=581] I don't understand how my life could ever be good again but I believe that you can do it.
[time=588] What a beautiful day it's been already. I know some of you wonder how those get tied together here.
[time=601] They ended in a few ways that make you feel like that sounds like my life and really that's the series that we've been in so far.
[time=609] We're in week five of a series called New. If you're new with us then we're glad you're here.
[time=614] We're coming at a great time because really in this series so far we spent four weeks looking at new meaning at the hope and the purpose that comes from Jesus.
[time=622] New mercies, how his mercies are new every morning when we need them the most and we continued from there and all those things are kind of introspective and we talked about how God's ways are better than our ways.
[time=633] His methods are higher than our methods and then last week we looked at our memories. Anybody had some memory challenges this week?
[time=640] All right well you're in the right place for that too but here's the thing all of those things have really been kind of introspective.
[time=646] They've been inward focused where God's doing something on the inside in the middle of those stories that don't make sense.
[time=654] In the middle of the tragedies of life the lowest of lows the highest of highs how we can build a foundation inwardly that turns into something outwardly.
[time=667] And that's where we're going to go today with the next two weeks of this series today is about a new model.
[time=672] A new model if you're taking notes turn to John chapter 13 if you brought your Bibles with me get your apps out here today and find John chapter 13.
[time=681] And we'll be looking at some of the verses there toward the end of that chapter particularly verses 34 and 35.
[time=687] The new model today takes this to an outward level as we look at the scripture today.
[time=693] So let's do our theme verse and our memory verse hopefully you've been learning it second Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 17.
[time=701] Say it with me if you know it try to not look at the screens if you can and it says therefore if anyone is in Christ he is a new creation.
[time=712] The old has passed away behold the new has come I am impressed I am impressed you guys are getting that down.
[time=722] That's really the heart of this entire series is that God does want to do something new in your life.
[time=729] The story of the gospel is new Jesus came to make all things new Jesus came to do something here's where it gets personal though something new in your life.
[time=740] And so in this this theme of the day today you've seen a couple of stories and you've heard some songs but we want to do things a little bit different with all of those things in mind.
[time=750] I would like to turn your attention now back to those stories so we can see how God because the theme really today is really all about the love of God and what does that mean for our lives.
[time=761] How does the love of God lead us to something new and in the two stories that you've heard from Joe and from Diana today you've seen the love of God begin to work in some new ways.
[time=772] And so I would like to direct you now back to the screen so we can see how those stories turned out and then we're going to sing about God's faithfulness.
[time=781] My daughter Melissa had been on a mission strip with New Haven High School campus life to Haiti the summer of 1998 and when she came back she kept having severe abdominal pain and she was in and out of the hospitals in Fort Wayne.
[time=798] And eventually they weren't sure what else to do for here so they sent her to Riley Hospital even though she was 16 years old.
[time=808] A friend of mine Mark Rhodes who attended Black Hawk at the time we were accountability partners and would actually meet once a week and pray and hold each other accountable spiritually.
[time=819] He was also Melissa, her oldest daughter who was at Riley's campus life director.
[time=824] Well Mark called me on a Sunday afternoon at Riley and said hey do you remember, he went to check on Joseph and he said hey do you remember Diana Hevel.
[time=831] And he said yeah I remember her we used to pray for her when her husband was sick and in the hospital and he said well she's at Riley right below you the floor right underneath you.
[time=841] And I'm like oh well I'm 120 miles from home I'm really tired of staring at four walls and my mom's with me so I went downstairs to introduce myself and to meet Diana and Melissa.
[time=854] And I walked into the room and Diana's at the time holding Melissa's hair back while she's throwing up.
[time=861] Joe introduced himself was just in there the room with short time and he left and my friend Amy, rim chisel was with me and he left the room and I said Amy what is God doing.
[time=878] And she said Joe's going to be a new friend for Dave for her husband because Scott and Dave were very good friends and I was relieved and I'm like oh that sounds perfect because
[time=890] I am never getting married again and I was 100% sure of that in fact my name is already in stone so I was relieved that that's not what God was doing.
[time=900] Fast forward a couple of months we're back in New Haven.
[time=904] Prior to Angie passing away a very dear friend of mine Tim Smith and his wife had talked to Angie and I before all this happened and said hey look if anything happens and you know you need me and I'm Joe you work with shifts.
[time=918] You need childcare help whatever our basement is available you can move in feel free.
[time=923] Well I ended up taking Tim up on that probably January February timeframe of 1999 we moved in with Tim and Angie.
[time=934] I didn't realize it until we had already committed to do it and then I talked to Diana that she lived like seven houses down from the Smiths in New Haven there so in Arrowhaven.
[time=947] So we had the opportunity to visit a little more often.
[time=952] Yeah I was still encouraging the friendship between Dave and Joe so we helped Joe move into the basement.
[time=963] We went to some concerts together the four of us just trying to help him to have this new friendship with Dave.
[time=972] I know I know I can specifically remember them helping us move into the Smiths basement when I looked at Diana and I thought to myself hmm she's really nice and she's cute.
[time=985] So I began to seek some advice from some elderly guys and peers that I trusted that were godly men on hey is this too soon I'm feeling this way and they were encouraging me that it's okay.
[time=1001] I was realizing that Joe and I were doing some non dating things together like going to Lowe's buying he needed some new suits.
[time=1014] And there was a particular time that I was disappointed about not being able to see him or something and I was totally surprised myself that I was feeling that way.
[time=1025] And so I was going to tell Joe that we shouldn't see each other do anything together anymore him and Dave were already friends so that it wouldn't harm that.
[time=1037] And so I was going to tell him that we just couldn't see each other anymore.
[time=1042] Well when she told me that and I realized that I was going to lose her if I didn't speak up and say that hey I am actually interested.
[time=1050] I finally spoke up and said well I am interested and that began the stage of where we kind of dated.
[time=1058] It was a short dating time because that was probably March, March April-ish and we got married in August.
[time=1068] Well there was a time when I was leaving work and I was on 469 and I had been telling Joe that I had never gotten a ticket before and sure enough I was pulled over.
[time=1080] And it was a female officer and I thought am I going to be a name dropper?
[time=1088] And I thought no I'm not I deserve my ticket I was speeding and anyway she came back up to the car.
[time=1098] And when Michelle went up to the car to give Diane her ticket I got out of the passenger side of the squad car and I walked up behind Michelle and kind of put my shoulder and my head over her shoulder and I said I can get you out of this ticket if you'll marry me and I gave her the ring.
[time=1114] So yeah so I had 4 kids and I had 2 and so together we had 6 a lot of people call us the Brady Bunch and now we have 13 grandchildren 14 coming in March.
[time=1128] And it's God's story. Yes it's God's story.
[time=1144] How you care for me. You have made me you will save and carry me always. You are faithful. You are faithful. You are faithful. Your joy is my strength.
[time=1174] You are my guide. I rely on you. I put my hope in things not seen. Your promises are true. You are faithful. You are faithful.
[time=1203] You are faithful. Your joy is my strength. You are faithful. You are faithful. You are faithful. Your joy is my strength.
[time=1233] Always you are with me. Your hand will lead me. My trust is in your hand.
[time=1254] Always you are with me. Your hand will lift me. My trust is in your hand. You are faithful. You are faithful. You are faithful. You are faithful. Your joy is my strength.
[time=1283] You are faithful. You are faithful. Your joy is my strength. You are faithful. Your joy is my strength.
[time=1307] You are faithful. You are faithful. Your joy is my strength.
[time=1330] These guys preach a way better sermon than I ever will don't they? I want to thank Joe and Diana for sharing their story. Can we just celebrate that? Wow. What a story of redemption and love.
[time=1346] What you may not have been able to hear because there was a lot of laughter and a lot of celebration is at the end of the video. Both of them just looked at each other and said, it's God's story. It's God's story. And man is that not the case. Today really is all about just that. And I wanted them to share their story because that's a much better, much louder sermon than I could ever preach. But here's what I'll tell you. So is yours.
[time=1373] God's got a new thing he wants to do in your life. And you know, if these guys would have mapped out their story, they wouldn't have written it this way. Right?
[time=1383] I'm guessing you can probably identify in one way or another. If you could write out your story, map it all out. You probably wouldn't write it out the way that certain pieces, certain components have gone, but yet God is still faithful.
[time=1396] Yet God still wants to do something new. Yet you are still that new creation that we've been talking about if you're in Christ. And that's really what Jesus came to establish.
[time=1408] I told you we're kind of turning from building an inward foundation now to building something outward. And that's where we are right now. And so when you look around at the world, does anybody just notice that it's a little bit broken?
[time=1419] When you look around, well, guess what? I know the answer. I do. You said, well, good. I came to church. It's election week and there's a lot at stake. In the weeks ahead, I came to hear the answer. So it's a good thing.
[time=1432] You know it. The answer is really not as complex as you think. And the answer really doesn't include the fact that all of the brokenness around us will be fixed yet.
[time=1442] The answer simply lies in walking with Jesus and letting him do the new things he wants to do in your life and through your life in the midst of all of the brokenness around you, just like you saw in Joe and Diana's story.
[time=1456] That's what they did. They looked for Jesus in the cracks, in the brokenness, in the pain, and they found him there. And you can too. I want to give you the bottom line today. If you're taking notes, it's really simple.
[time=1469] But it's so true and so profound. And I believe so timely for where we are. Not just as a nation, but just where the church is today and the opportunity that the church, that we, the church.
[time=1481] And I'm not talking about Black Hawk Ministries. I'm not talking about this building. I'm talking about you and I'm talking about me, the opportunity that we have representing Jesus in the world around us.
[time=1492] It's great today. And the bottom line is simply the defining trait of the church is love that is radically different.
[time=1500] Joe and Diana, their story, they experienced that love and it guided them and it brought them together. I love that story because it's a good love story in the room. You can't get that kind of stuff on television, folks.
[time=1515] But I love it because it's based on the greatest love story ever told. The story of Jesus loving us enough to die on the cross for us. And so Jesus started a new model. We're going to be in John 13. Look there with me.
[time=1527] In this passage, we'll read it in a moment, but he says, "I want to give you a new commandment." And then it was simply just to love one another. And so what's new about that? What's new about love? That's the question I want us to look at today. What's new about love?
[time=1543] Look at somebody say, "What's new about love?" It's the oldest story ever told, but that's the beauty. That is the majesty. That is the wonder of knowing Jesus is something as timeless as the love of God.
[time=1558] Does something brand new in your life that you did not expect it? Now in this passage, I wanted to share this with you because this is what I think God wants to do in your life today in this moment. In this passage, the word new, the Greek word for new means unusual, unexpected, fresh, or here's my favorite, or unused. So the word there, that we're going to look a new command I give to you, Jesus says, that we'll read it in a moment. It's an unused command.
[time=1587] It made me think this week, how do I not tap into? How do I not use the stuff that God has at my fingertips? How is the new command that's just to love one another?
[time=1602] How is it new and unused in my life? And so I would challenge you as we read this, as we look at this story today, I would challenge you to answer that question.
[time=1610] How is the love of God something that perhaps is unused in certain areas, perhaps, in certain relationships, perhaps, of your life?
[time=1620] Now in this story, John has a particularly strange and unique and powerful perspective. John, one of Jesus' disciples in John 13, we won't read all of this, but in his story, this is the night before, let me set the tone for it. This is the night before Jesus would go to be crucified.
[time=1636] And so that's where we are in the history of this story, as we look at John at chapter 13, as you continue reading there, but before this happened, Jesus was there with his disciples, you know the story.
[time=1646] He was there having that meal with his disciples, and everyone wanted to know, he kept talking about someone's going to betray me, someone's going to betray me.
[time=1652] Well, who is it? Who is it? Is it him? It's got to be him. I saw that look he gave to Peter the other day, right? You can imagine the banter going back forth, but John got an inside scoop if you look at this story.
[time=1663] If you go back even to verses 25 and 26, you'll see that he said, well, who is it that's going to betray you? And Jesus told him, go back there to verse 25, we'll look at that there together.
[time=1674] So that disciple leaning back on Jesus, this is John and Lord, who is it? Jesus answered, "It is he whom I will give this morsel of bread when I have dipped it."
[time=1684] And I always thought that was just kind of the public declaration in the room, but if you keep reading, though, verses 28, 29, you see that nobody else knew, so let's keep going and looking there.
[time=1692] And so when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas, son of Simon of Scariot.
[time=1697] Then, verse 27, after he had taken the morsel, Satan entered into him, and Jesus said to him, what you're going to do, do quickly.
[time=1705] We skipped these next verses, though, a lot of times in this story, because verse 28 says, "Now no one at the table knew why he had said this to him."
[time=1713] So that would tell you that John was leaning back on Jesus, and maybe he said it pretty quietly, where only he heard that story.
[time=1719] So he got a little bit of an inside scoop. Can you imagine what's going through John's mind right now? Put yourself in John's shoes for a moment.
[time=1726] That'll be important as we tie things together here today.
[time=1729] So, verse 29, "Some thought that because Judas had the money bag, Jesus was telling him by what we need for the feast," is what they thought, "or that he should give something to the poor."
[time=1738] And so they thought that's what he's going to do.
[time=1740] Verse 30, "So after receiving the morsel of bread, he immediately went out, and it was night." Go to verse 31.
[time=1746] When he had gone out, Jesus said, "Now, by the way, Paul's there." We skipped that a lot of times.
[time=1753] He was saying, "Now the time has come." We'll look at that.
[time=1755] But I also believe in your life this moment, Jesus is looking at you and saying, "Now, now the time has come for me to be glorified."
[time=1764] Now, those unused portions of who I am are going to become real and are going to become new in your life.
[time=1769] I believe in this place that's going to happen in dozens and dozens of lives.
[time=1773] So continue on verse 31. Jesus says, "Now the Son of Man is glorified. He knew the time had come, and God is glorified in him."
[time=1780] If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and glorify him at once.
[time=1785] Verse 33, "Little children," underline that, because this is the only place other than one other book in all of scripture that this exact phrase for little children is used.
[time=1795] Jesus says, "Children," quite frequently, but this is a different word.
[time=1798] This is a different term of endearment that Jesus is using. And guess where else is used in scripture?
[time=1803] It's used here in John 13. There's only one other writer, and guess who it was? His name was John.
[time=1808] In 1 John, who used it again, this was a profound moment in John's life.
[time=1814] It changed everything about how John saw love. It changed everything about how John saw the church.
[time=1820] We'll come back to that. Verse 33, "Little children, yet a little while I am here with you, you will seek me.
[time=1825] And just as I said to the Jews, now I also say to you, where I'm going, you cannot come." And here's where we're going to dig in today. That set up the story. We're going to go back to John's perspective, because here's what I'll tell you, because John had a unique perspective on this portion of the story.
[time=1839] His book, his writing in the book of 1 John, I call him the Little John's.
[time=1843] We're in Big John right now, the Little John's at the end of the Bible, 1 2 3 John.
[time=1847] If you need a way to remember it, that's what it is. He wrote these things, but he wrote about this moment.
[time=1853] And we often don't connect those things. We're going to connect those dots for you here today.
[time=1858] Verse 34, Jesus says, "A new command." Everybody say, "A new command."
[time=1864] A new command I give to you, that you, what?
[time=1868] Love one another. That's not new.
[time=1872] Just as I have loved you, you are to love one another.
[time=1875] Verse 35, I love this. "By this all people will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another."
[time=1885] Let's think about John for a moment. His writing in 1 John now becomes our best commentary, if you will, on what Jesus meant.
[time=1894] By saying, "This is a new command I give to you to love one another." And we're going to look at some of John's writing in 1 John chapter 2. If you want to save your place there, don't read ahead. Don't go to the end of the story.
[time=1906] That would have been bad if you knew the end of the story on the screen, right?
[time=1909] So don't get to the end until we walk there together in a moment.
[time=1912] But I want to give you a couple of things. We're asking the question, so what's new about love?
[time=1916] The command to love one another was new in a couple of key areas, probably more than this, but I think this encompasses really why Jesus said what he did and what it means for you and for me today.
[time=1926] Write these down if you're taking notes. We've got to wait for you to do that in your bulletin or your app.
[time=1930] If you've got the Black Hawk app, you can do that there as well.
[time=1933] Number one, the aim. A-I-M, the aim.
[time=1938] What's new about love? What's new about this command to love one another?
[time=1942] The aim of love is, first of all, what was new?
[time=1946] We went from, if you go back in history, you'll see that the command to love your neighbor as yourself.
[time=1952] In fact, Jesus at this point in history in John 13, Jesus had already said, well, teacher, what's the greatest command and all that they're trying to trip him up?
[time=1960] And Jesus, of course, answered the most profound way that only Jesus and only the Son of God could.
[time=1965] One of the times that he didn't answer a question for a question, though, he said, well, it's simple.
[time=1969] It's to love the Lord God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and the second is like it to love your neighbor as yourself.
[time=1978] It's on these two that all the law and the prophets hang, right?
[time=1982] So that's the story. A lawyer had asked him that question. So that was not new to love your neighbor as yourself, but here's what was new.
[time=1988] Here's what had happened.
[time=1990] Imagine this. People twist the words of God.
[time=1993] You ever seen that happen before? I'm glad I've never done that.
[time=1996] Twisted God's words to fit what I wanted him to mean. I'm glad I don't do that.
[time=1999] But that's what had happened because what had gone down is people started saying, well, love your neighbor as yourself.
[time=2005] Well, who's your neighbor? That person definitely in my neighbor.
[time=2010] The Jew and Gentile distinction was there, but for you and for me, you need to know.
[time=2015] Just so you know, I'm not going to preach on this today.
[time=2018] But if we talk about the differences between the Jews and the Gentiles when Jesus came on the scene and what that looked like for the early church,
[time=2024] your hatred for different people, different races, whatever it may be, the distinctions we have today don't even compare.
[time=2031] They really don't. But we try to make them compare all too often.
[time=2035] That's what I'm going to talk about with this aim of love here today.
[time=2038] But that's what had happened. Well, who's my neighbor? Well, I think that's my neighbor.
[time=2042] I like him. He's my neighbor. She's pretty cool. She can be my neighbor. I love her. Right?
[time=2047] That's what was going on. But here, Jesus broadens that aim and makes it clear once and for all.
[time=2053] Yes, you're to love your neighbor as yourself, but he says something different.
[time=2057] The aim gets a little broader here because he says you're to love one another.
[time=2061] And it's by this, the world will know you are my disciples, how you love one another.
[time=2067] So we went from neighbor to one another.
[time=2072] We went from neighbor, narrowed, to everyone.
[time=2077] I remember one of the first ministry opportunities. You ever noticed that it bothers me?
[time=2082] You've heard me say this perhaps before, but it bothers me that the church buildings around the globe become the most segregated places on the planet on Sunday mornings.
[time=2092] It shouldn't be. It shouldn't be.
[time=2096] And I remember the first time I got a taste of that was I was in youth ministry.
[time=2100] And Jessica, my wife and I ran a bus ministry.
[time=2103] The only thing about our bus ministry is we didn't have a bus.
[time=2107] Our bus ministry was one out run out of a little four-door Nissan Altima, our little silver bullet.
[time=2112] I wish I wouldn't have sold that car, held on to it.
[time=2116] But I was 17. Jessica was 18 when I started this youth ministry.
[time=2120] And I'll never forget those days, some special precious days.
[time=2125] But a big part of that was our bus ministry run out of our little car.
[time=2129] A little four-door car because we would go and pick up kids.
[time=2132] Started in this youth group, had three kids there. God just blew it up.
[time=2135] It was an amazing experience for us.
[time=2137] But I'll never forget some of the low moments where the aim got off in our church.
[time=2141] And then some people's minds because we went and picked kids up.
[time=2144] We would start on Wednesday right after school.
[time=2146] We'd start running back and forth to the church.
[time=2148] And all I knew, I was just this young kid.
[time=2150] I knew I probably didn't need to go pick up because in case it was all girls in the car, I didn't need to be by myself.
[time=2154] So Jessica came with me. We weren't even married yet.
[time=2156] But we rode together, picked up these kids.
[time=2158] We'd bring a load back. They'd pile in.
[time=2160] And I'll admit, I think I kind of broke the law several times with my bus ministry.
[time=2164] Because you know, you go to pick up three because that's how many seat belts you have.
[time=2168] But then they have three more friends.
[time=2170] And so they pile into anyway.
[time=2172] So we would make trip after trip, bringing these kids back.
[time=2175] And then eventually we started bringing in different races.
[time=2179] I didn't bother me, I bet I loved it.
[time=2181] Again, that's what the church is supposed to look like.
[time=2183] So I thought it was the mindset.
[time=2186] But some people didn't share that mindset.
[time=2189] And I'll never forget getting sat down and told we can't bring different races to the church.
[time=2196] I said, "Why not?" Heaven is going to look that way.
[time=2200] I remember, I'm just this young punk kid. That's all I knew.
[time=2203] But I didn't know how right I was.
[time=2206] I didn't know how that would characterize, and wrongly so, so many ministries in the world around me at that age.
[time=2215] I had no idea.
[time=2217] We continued to do it anyway, bring the kids.
[time=2220] And you know, we did ministry there, and God blessed that ministry.
[time=2223] And some people just don't see things the way that God sees things.
[time=2226] But God grew me during that time in ways that I'll never forget.
[time=2230] You know, God in trouble for letting them tear up the carpet.
[time=2233] And just so you know, here at Black Hawk Ministries, we love our kids.
[time=2236] And it's okay if they tear up the carpet here.
[time=2239] They make more carpet.
[time=2241] They make more. I've seen it.
[time=2243] It's everywhere. If they tear up a place in the sheetrock, it's okay.
[time=2246] We can build again. We want to respect what God's given us.
[time=2248] But if we bring in kids, and they tear, I've told duty this already.
[time=2251] And all of our youth ministry team, if it gets torn up, it's okay.
[time=2255] We're here to use the place that God's given us to do ministry to the people God puts in our path.
[time=2260] And I'll never forget in that season of my life,
[time=2267] I made a commitment to God in that moment in those meetings.
[time=2271] That God, my aim, I didn't use that word, but that's the word for the doubt.
[time=2274] I'll never forget it though. I said, God, no matter what.
[time=2278] No matter what anybody says to me, I promise you, from this day forward, I will make sure to accommodate the aim.
[time=2285] I will make sure that anybody and everybody, regardless of race, ethnicity, background, income level,
[time=2292] they are a part of any ministry I am ever attached to.
[time=2295] And I made that commitment to God a long time ago, and I feel like I've honored it well, and we will honor that here at Black Hawk, and I love looking around and seeing the fact that that is honored in this place.
[time=2305] Because I don't care what preferences you may or may not have or what that I may or may not have.
[time=2311] Here's what happened, John 13.
[time=2313] Jesus said, the aim is everybody.
[time=2316] There are no qualifiers for my love.
[time=2319] The new command I give you to love one another, you can't put qualifiers on it.
[time=2325] And we like saying amen about that at church, but then life happens.
[time=2330] But then you go to Walmart.
[time=2333] Oh, the grocery store.
[time=2336] You guys know exactly what I'm talking about, don't you?
[time=2340] Then that relative comes to the gathering.
[time=2346] I know I've got family, too.
[time=2348] I know how it goes. I've got friends, too.
[time=2350] And we often like to put qualifiers.
[time=2353] Well, you know, I will love you, and I will accept you if you...
[time=2359] And we list these things out. I want you to know, folks, I'm so glad that when God aimed at the world, when God aimed at me with his love, he didn't put those qualifiers.
[time=2367] Because otherwise, I wouldn't be here.
[time=2370] And you wouldn't be here either.
[time=2372] I love that the aim that God has is the global aim.
[time=2376] So in a world, and this is what I love about the aim of God's love.
[time=2379] He aimed at the world that the world may know.
[time=2383] Now, does everyone choose to enter into that?
[time=2385] Does everyone choose to embrace this new command and love that God gives us?
[time=2388] Absolutely not.
[time=2390] But the aim stays the same.
[time=2393] It makes life a lot more simple for us as those that are trying to be the church.
[time=2398] In a world that's defined, if you look around, not just on Sunday mornings, but you look around in a world that's defined by differences and divisions, only Jesus unifies.
[time=2409] When you look around at a world that's divided by races and by hate and by barriers, only Jesus unifies.
[time=2417] When you look at a world that's defined by the divisions and the differences of Republican and Democrat and all the different things, only Jesus unifies.
[time=2427] I'm glad I know him.
[time=2429] And I'm glad he's still on the throne.
[time=2431] And I'm glad that he aimed for me with his love.
[time=2435] Only Jesus in a world that is so defined by differences can bring the world together
[time=2442] for the gospel, for one purpose, for something new.
[time=2446] Number two, not just the aim.
[time=2449] Jesus said, by the way, a big part of that is I want to make love a verb.
[time=2452] I think I missed that blank.
[time=2454] I want to make love a verb.
[time=2456] And so that would be what I would say to you when it comes to this love that we're talking about, the aim that we're talking about, how can love become a verb this week?
[time=2466] So many times love becomes just a noun in our life, an object that we talk about,
[time=2474] something that we like having around us, but when it comes to walking it out, that's the difference, that's the newness, that's the unused parts of this new command that God has for us to love one another is that it becomes a verb in our life.
[time=2489] So what does it mean for you this week for love to become a verb?
[time=2493] Number two, the amount, not just the aim, but the amount, the amount of love.
[time=2498] It goes back to that rule of no qualifiers.
[time=2502] We're not allowed to qualify as well.
[time=2504] I love this person this much because they hit these marks, but this person, I've got to take it down and say, no, I'm glad God doesn't do that.
[time=2511] He loved, for God so loved the world.
[time=2517] I think I'm still in the world.
[time=2519] Some days I wonder when I look out here at the congregation, sometimes you wonder, are they in this world, right?
[time=2525] Those of you who got it, we're actually listening, the rest of you really are in another world.
[time=2531] Here we are, we're in the world.
[time=2533] God so loved the world.
[time=2536] Here's the thing, back to our text here, a new command I give you that you love one another.
[time=2541] That word love, there's a lot of different words, four key different words for love in the Greek language.
[time=2546] This is the top one, the agape one.
[time=2549] Agape means it has no boundaries, it has no limits, the amount is endless.
[time=2555] It's unconditional.
[time=2557] It has no qualifiers.
[time=2561] The volume of this love is all the way to the top.
[time=2565] Now some of you've met my little girl, Callie, she just turned four.
[time=2569] What you may not know about Callie, because if you've seen her, she probably did something like this,
[time=2575] is once you get to know her, she has two volumes.
[time=2580] One is through the roof and the other is off.
[time=2585] There's really no in between.
[time=2587] She's our loud, she sings, and my goodness, we'll be carrying on a conversation at home, and she'll decide she wants to sing, and you're not having that conversation.
[time=2595] You're just not having it, because you can't hear anything else.
[time=2599] She just lets a rip, she has one volume, and I was thinking about that this week.
[time=2603] I love the differences in our kids, because Caleb, he's got a lot of different volumes, and you can interpret where he's at, depending on where those volumes are in his life.
[time=2611] I love the differences in how God made us all unique and special in those ways, but I was thinking about Callie's, a little Miss Callie's volume this week.
[time=2619] It hit me that that's the volume that Jesus was talking about.
[time=2622] It should be as loud as it can go, blasting our eardrums.
[time=2628] So loud that the world around us cannot help but hear the love that we have found in Jesus
[time=2635] until the day it just has to be turned off because we're not here anymore.
[time=2639] It should be loud or off, and we don't turn it off, we leave it on.
[time=2645] It's only going to get multiplied when we get to turn it off in heaven, because then it gets turned back on to an all-new level that none of us could ever even imagine, because every tear will be wiped away, every pain will be gone, all we will do is celebrate that same love that we have in Jesus.
[time=2660] Look at a couple of Scriptures here, Jesus said, "As I've loved you, you should love one another." Well, that changed things, doesn't it?
[time=2667] I'm glad that Jesus loves me the way that He loves me in spite of me, but it makes it hard to reciprocate that same kind of love to other people, because they get on my nerves, right?
[time=2680] But Jesus said, "You're to love as I have loved you." Look at Colossians 3, it's on the screen for you.
[time=2686] Colossians 3 and in your bulletin as well, verses 12 and 13.
[time=2689] "Put on, then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, patience, bearing with one another, and if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other as the Lord has forgiven you, so also you must forgive." So love as I love you and forgive as I've forgiven you.
[time=2713] That removes qualifiers, it broadens the aim to whoever God places in your path,
[time=2719] and it puts an endless amount on how much you give out.
[time=2724] Jesus is calling us, here's what I think this means, and we're going to look at 1 John, if you want to flip there with me, 1 John chapter 2.
[time=2730] Told you that's the best commentary we have on this passage.
[time=2733] Jesus is calling us, write this down if you're taking notes.
[time=2736] Jesus is calling us to move from imitation to participation.
[time=2740] From imitation to participation.
[time=2744] You ever seen anybody do impersonations of somebody else or a cover of a song?
[time=2749] And there's some good ones out there, but typically the general rule of thumb is that the impersonations are never as good as the original, right?
[time=2759] I think the same is true.
[time=2761] And a lot of times, I think in my journey of fate, I felt like my call of being the church was to impersonate Jesus.
[time=2770] And rightfully so, Paul says be imitators of me, follow my example.
[time=2774] Certainly there's some truth there.
[time=2776] But the love of Jesus says not just the system that has been, before he came to law, the system that once was, I came to start a new covenant.
[time=2785] I started a new day where we moved from just imitating the light, just imitating, trying to be a little bit of a picture of, being impersonator of what the church is supposed to look like, to participating in actually being the church.
[time=2799] That's why last week we looked at the Holy Spirit.
[time=2801] We've talked about the Holy Spirit and how Jesus said, "It's better for you if I go away, because when I do, my spirit will come and will end dwell you." And that's the point.
[time=2810] Jesus came, Jesus died, and then Jesus left so that his Holy Spirit could come and indwell us and be a part of our lives so that we wouldn't just imitate the light, that is Jesus.
[time=2821] We became the light, that is Jesus, because he became a part of us.
[time=2828] There's a difference in imitating that light and participating in that light.
[time=2833] When you participate in it, you actually have the authority of giving it out.
[time=2837] One of my favorite verses in Scripture will look at it over the next couple of months, this first Peter 4-10 where it says, "We are stewards of God's grace, a steward's a manager.
[time=2847] I don't deserve to be a manager of the grace of God." But God says you are.
[time=2852] That's the difference in an imitator and a participator.
[time=2856] I'm not just here to imitate the light.
[time=2858] John says it best.
[time=2859] Let's look at that together.
[time=2861] John 1 John chapter 2.
[time=2867] Look at somebody as you find your place there and say, "You're the real thing.
[time=2871] You're the real thing." A lot of times we think that we're an impersonation, but we're the real thing.
[time=2877] That's the point.
[time=2878] Don't believe me.
[time=2879] Let's look at what John says.
[time=2880] Again, John wrote this and it's the only place in Scripture where you remember little children verse 33, John says it.
[time=2886] Get this.
[time=2887] John says this seven times in five chapters, little children.
[time=2892] It's the only other place in Scripture where we find new command as we see it here,
[time=2898] this new command.
[time=2899] It's because this moment in John's life as he found out, imagine where he was.
[time=2904] He found out Judas was going to be the betrayer.
[time=2908] Jesus said, "Now the Son of Man can be glorified." He knew what that meant or at least he thought he did.
[time=2914] He's fixing to leave me.
[time=2919] What is my life going to look like?
[time=2922] This was a defining moment for John and as he wrote about it and as he reflected on it.
[time=2928] Here's what we find that he said in verse number seven of first John 2, "Beloved, I'm writing to you no new command, but an old commandment that you had from the beginning.
[time=2938] The old commandment is the word that you've heard.
[time=2942] At the same time, it is a new commandment." He sounds a little confused, doesn't he?
[time=2947] It's a tough thing to interpret here.
[time=2949] He was asking the same question you and I were, "What's new about love?" But I think he got it because we keep reading.
[time=2955] It is a new commandment.
[time=2957] He says, "At the same time, it is a new commandment that I'm writing to you, which is true.
[time=2960] Underline this, oh, this will change your life, which is true in him and in you."
[time=2967] Which is true in him and in you because of the darkness.
[time=2972] The darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.
[time=2978] I love this passage.
[time=2979] Here's what?
[time=2980] New commandment.
[time=2981] New commandment is true in him.
[time=2983] That's no surprise.
[time=2984] This command to love is true in him, but it's also true in you.
[time=2989] It's already shining.
[time=2992] Again, do you ever have that stuff at your fingertips that you just don't take advantage of, the unused newness, the unused layers of God's love?
[time=3001] That's what John's talking about here.
[time=3004] It's already shining.
[time=3008] It's true in him, but at the same time and the equivalent is that it's also true in you.
[time=3015] That same love, that same new commandment.
[time=3018] And verses 9 and 10, he talks about abiding in the light.
[time=3021] In other words, you're not copying the light.
[time=3023] You are in the light because the light is in you.
[time=3028] That's a beautiful thought.
[time=3029] You're not copying the light.
[time=3031] You are the light.
[time=3032] You are in the light because the light's in you.
[time=3034] You walk around with that light every single day.
[time=3040] And for those of you saying this model of love, as I know the pushback of those things, well, if it's really that simple, then we wouldn't have all the rest of scripture.
[time=3048] So you're just proposing this hippie kind of love fest that we just sit back and ignore all the rules and the text, right?
[time=3055] No.
[time=3056] Because here's the truth of the matter.
[time=3057] If you really want to look at what Jesus is asking of us, yes, the model that Jesus put forth
[time=3063] is much less complex, but it's far more consuming.
[time=3068] It's far anything the temple weighs before Jesus, the old covenant, what it looked like
[time=3074] is so demanding and it's demanding so that we see we can't meet those demands and we need a Savior.
[time=3080] That's the point of the law.
[time=3081] That's why the law was given.
[time=3083] That's why the old covenant was what it is.
[time=3086] And those of you saying, well, we can't just abandon it.
[time=3088] No, we're not abandoning it.
[time=3089] It points us to this moment, to this new model, all of scripture points to Jesus.
[time=3093] And yes, the Jesus model is a lot less complicated, a lot less complex, but it's way more consuming.
[time=3101] It takes a lot more from us to live this out.
[time=3104] Write this down if you're taking notes.
[time=3107] I want to ask you a question.
[time=3108] This is your challenge for the week.
[time=3109] What does love require of me?
[time=3111] That's a great question.
[time=3113] I don't even know where I heard it, but I wrote it down on a posted note years ago.
[time=3116] I heard it in a sermon and I wrote it down and I've asked that a lot.
[time=3120] It's kind of my, what would Jesus do?
[time=3122] Question.
[time=3123] Anybody ever have the, what would Jesus do, bracelets?
[time=3126] I did.
[time=3127] Well, this is kind of my, what would Jesus do?
[time=3129] Question.
[time=3130] When I'm ending one of those tough spots, I would just simply ask myself, what does love, not my love, that gets me nowhere in life.
[time=3136] I don't have much to offer, but what does the love of God require of me in this moment, in this decision, in this relationship?
[time=3144] What does love require of me?
[time=3148] And here's why I like that approach.
[time=3149] Here's why I'm a big fan of the Jesus model.
[time=3151] First of all, it is the model whether I like it or not.
[time=3154] I don't get to set the rules.
[time=3155] I just get to follow after the one who did, and he already did that for me.
[time=3158] But I love this model because it doesn't give me the loopholes, the ways out.
[time=3162] A lot of times in church, I'm going to challenge you for just a minute because I am you.
[time=3166] I'm in this with you.
[time=3167] A lot of times in church, where we come in and we sit down at church and we sit back and
[time=3175] you're already going, I think he's about out of time, it's about time for lunch.
[time=3180] You're right, I am, it is, but I'll get there in a minute.
[time=3183] This is going to be good though, it'll be worth your time, I promise.
[time=3186] They'll save the chicken legs.
[time=3188] But we'll sit in church and we find a comfort zone.
[time=3191] We find a way that we can just sit, a way that we can be comfortable, a way that we can be safe.
[time=3197] And here's the thing, we love making this place feel safe and comfortable for you, but it's so that we can make you uncomfortable.
[time=3205] Why?
[time=3206] Because that's the call of Jesus.
[time=3208] It's not to sit and get comfortable.
[time=3210] It's to stand and do the uncomfortable things in your life that you've been avoiding.
[time=3215] Religion gives you a lot of loopholes.
[time=3217] You can find loopholes in the contracts of religion.
[time=3220] You can find ways to sit in your seat with religion.
[time=3224] That's why I don't like religion.
[time=3228] That's why Jesus came to start relationships.
[time=3230] Because relationships don't give you the loopholes, they don't give you the ways out.
[time=3234] It asks you, "What does love require of me?" And you can't find a way out of that, if you're honest.
[time=3239] And so my challenge to you would be, as we leave church today and you symbolically stand, get out of your seats.
[time=3247] That you would not just physically stand and get out of your seats.
[time=3251] That you would spiritually stand and get out of your seat.
[time=3255] And ask, "What does love require of me?" And here's my vision for us, Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=3261] When it comes to this, as a church, that we all individually walk this out together.
[time=3267] That we all walk this out in such a way that the world outside looks at Black Hawk Ministries,
[time=3273] looks at the church that Jesus built and says, "I'm going to be critical of them because of what they believe, but I can't help but acknowledge the love that they give out." It's so loud, it's blinding to the world around them.
[time=3286] That is the vision that Jesus had for the model of His church that He built and said, "I will build my church and even the gates of hell can't prevail against it." Who's in?
[time=3299] I want to thank you so much for watching today and just letting God minister to your heart.
[time=3303] And I want to speak specifically to you if the aim that we have talked about today.
[time=3307] We've talked a lot about that, but I think no matter where you sit right now, God has been aiming for you. He's been targeting your heart and your life in new ways today.
[time=3317] And if that's the case, as we've discussed today, the gospel really is just that simple.
[time=3322] That God did target you, that God did send His Son Jesus to die for you.
[time=3326] Because you are His target, because you are that aim for the amount of love that's endless that we've discussed today, you can know that you have salvation through Jesus.
[time=3335] And I want to challenge you, if you need to take that step, do that right now.
[time=3338] You don't need a prayer, you don't have to be in a church setting.
[time=3341] You can do that right in the comfort of your home, wherever you may be, right in this moment.
[time=3345] God is calling you to do that. And if you have done that and if you are considering doing that, we want to walk with you that the gospel really is that simple, that Jesus came.
[time=3353] He died on the cross to pay a penalty for your sin and mind that we could never pay.
[time=3358] Because He lived that sinless life that we could never live.
[time=3361] He did die on that cross, and He is alive today.
[time=3364] And He loves you right where you are.
[time=3367] And Scripture makes it clear, God makes it clear to us, and He's speaking right into your heart, perhaps, that today is the day of salvation.
[time=3373] And it's no longer that we have to make complicated that that God has made so simple.
[time=3378] If you've made that step today, I want to walk with you.
[time=3381] I want to challenge you to let us help you here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=3384] That's why we're here, that's why this broadcast is here, and we're grateful that you've watched and that you've let us into your home and into your life.
[time=3390] We've got a booklet that we'd like to get in your hands.
[time=3392] It's called Beginning Steps, a growth guide for new believers.
[time=3394] It looks like this, and we would love to mail one of these to you to get one in your hands, whatever that needs to look like, so that we can help you see that it really is just the beginning when we come to know Jesus today.
[time=3405] No matter where you're at today, we want you to know that God has aimed for you for a long time.
[time=3410] You are the target that God had in mind when Jesus came here to the earth.
[time=3414] Think about that for a moment.
[time=3416] You were His target when Jesus was on that cross and all the pain and all the suffering, all the agony that He went through was present.
[time=3424] You were on His mind.
[time=3425] What an amazing thought for us to have in mind today for our lives.
[time=3429] And here at Black Hawk Ministries, that's the thought, that's the truth, that's the gospel, that's the meaning that we want to send throughout the world, and that's why it's in your home today and in your life.
[time=3440] Let us walk with you in any way that we can.
[time=3442] We've got an email address on your screen.
