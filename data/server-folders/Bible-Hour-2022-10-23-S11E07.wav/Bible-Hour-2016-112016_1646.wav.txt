[time=111] >> There is a truth older than the ages.
[time=117] There is a promise of things yet to come.
[time=124] There is one born for our salvation.
[time=131] It's Jesus, there is a light that overwhelms the darkness.
[time=143] There is a kingdom that forever reigns.
[time=149] There is freedom from the chains that bind us.
[time=157] Jesus, Jesus, who walks on the waters,
[time=166] who speaks to the sea, who stands in the fire beside me.
[time=176] He roars like a lion, he bled as a lamb.
[time=182] He carries my healing in his hands.
[time=189] Jesus, there is a name.
[time=196] I call in times of trouble.
[time=200] There is a song that comforts in the night.
[time=206] There is a voice that comes to storm the ages.
[time=214] Jesus, Jesus, who walks on the waters,
[time=223] who speaks to the sea, who stands in the fire beside me.
[time=232] He roars like a lion, he bled as a lamb.
[time=239] He carries my healing in his hands.
[time=245] Jesus.
[time=251] Messiah, my Savior, there is power in your name.
[time=264] You're my rocket, my Redeemer.
[time=270] There is power in your name, in your name.
[time=283] You walk on the waters, you speak to the sea,
[time=289] you stand in the fire beside me.
[time=296] You roar like a lion.
[time=299] You play as a lamb.
[time=302] You carry my healing in your name.
[time=308] You walk on the waters, you speak to the sea,
[time=314] you stand in the fire beside me.
[time=320] You roar like a lion, he bled as a lion.
[time=327] You carry my healing in your name.
[time=332] Oh, Jesus.
[time=337] There is no one like you.
[time=355] The Bible says in Galatians 4, 7, says this.
[time=359] So you are no longer a slave, but a son.
[time=364] And if a son, then an heir, through God.
[time=369] Then in Romans 8, 8, 15 says this, for you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry.
[time=383] I'm a father.
[time=413] A God.
[time=416] I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[time=423] I am a child of God.
[time=429] I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[time=437] I am a child of God.
[time=442] From my mother's womb, you have chosen me.
[time=460] Love has called my name.
[time=466] I've been born again to your family.
[time=473] Your blood flows through my veins.
[time=479] I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[time=485] I am a child of God.
[time=491] I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[time=498] I am a child of God.
[time=504] I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[time=511] I am a child of God.
[time=517] I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[time=524] I am a child of God.
[time=541] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[time=567] You split the sea so I can walk right through it.
[time=573] My fears are drowning perfectly alone.
[time=579] You rescued me and I will stand and sing.
[time=585] I am a child of God.
[time=592] You split the sea so I can walk right through it.
[time=598] My fears are drowning perfectly alone.
[time=604] You rescued me and I will stand and sing.
[time=610] I am a child of God.
[time=628] Oh, baby, yes, I am a child of God.
[time=639] I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[time=648] I am a child of God.
[time=655] I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[time=663] I am a child of God.
[time=711] It's been a great day already so glad that you are here.
[time=736] If you've got your Bibles, look at Romans 6 and your New Testament.
[time=740] If you're using one of the Bibles in the seats in front of you, I think on the bulletin, there's a page number to get you straight there.
[time=748] If you don't have a Bible, we'd love for you to take that one home as well as our gift to you.
[time=751] So glad you're here.
[time=752] My name is Kevin.
[time=753] If you don't know me, pastor here at Black Hawk and love what God is up to.
[time=757] We're in a series of messages called "New." And so you may say, "Well, I'm new here and I'm coming on the last week of the series." So this can't be for me, but the beauty about the gospel, the beauty about what we study, week in and week out, the Bible, God's Word, to you and to me is every single week stands alone and gives you some truth that applies to your every single day life.
[time=778] And so we're glad you're here and so I'm excited to continue this series today.
[time=781] Let's dive right in and this series for five weeks now, we have recited this memory verse.
[time=787] 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 17.
[time=790] So this is your last chance to show off.
[time=793] So who's ready to join me? Are you ready?
[time=795] Alright, it's going to be on the screen.
[time=796] So try to close your eyes or look away if you think you've got it down by now.
[time=799] This is your last chance.
[time=800] So 2 Corinthians 5 verse 17.
[time=804] Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[time=809] The old has passed away.
[time=812] Behold, the new has come.
[time=815] Good stuff. I'm impressed.
[time=817] Every week it's gotten better.
[time=819] And I've got to give a shout out to Miss Sandy.
[time=821] She's back in her spot over here, so she didn't know I was going to call her out, but she's the hugging lady is how she was introduced to me.
[time=827] And see, yeah, welcome her back. She's been out for a little while.
[time=830] So, yeah.
[time=833] She's probably going to get me for that a little later on too, right?
[time=836] So, yeah.
[time=837] So today, hey, you've noticed today is all about Orphan Sunday, and it could not have been a better Sunday.
[time=843] I'd love to say, hey, I knew it was coming and we mapped it out to be specifically on this day. We're talking about Romans chapter 6.
[time=848] I'd love to tell you that. I didn't really do all that, but God did.
[time=851] He knew it was going to line up, and I'm excited about what we're going to talk about today.
[time=854] But to kick things off, not just for Orphan Sunday, but for this idea of a new mindset, because here's what we've done.
[time=860] We've gone through all of these different parts of what it means to be new.
[time=863] New is the story of the gospel, and that means that God wants to do something new in your life.
[time=868] We looked at new meaning, new mercies, new method, new memory, and last week we looked at a new model, and we shifted.
[time=875] All the first four weeks were really internal, kind of introspective, of building a foundation on the inside so that we could do something with that foundation on the outside.
[time=884] And last week we looked at the love of God, the new model.
[time=887] Jesus said, "A new command I give to you to love one another." And we looked at why that was new.
[time=893] And if you did not get to see that last week, or if you work with us, you can go to blackcalkministries.org.
[time=898] We've got all of those on there. We'd encourage you to catch up.
[time=901] But today, I'm really excited because this is really the ultimate goal of new.
[time=905] That we get to a new mindset, that we get to a new way of thinking, a new way of looking at the world around us, and ultimately a new way of living.
[time=913] So I want to ask Jordan to come on stage with me now, because the best way to illustrate that is to continue just these guys preach way better sermons than I do, really, is the bottom line.
[time=922] And so Jordan's coming on stage, and his family are going to join us in just a minute.
[time=927] So welcome Jordan Palmer, everybody, real quick.
[time=930] And this little guy is Aaron.
[time=935] And so he was adopted, and so we're going to hear a little bit about his story.
[time=939] And so Jordan, tell us a little bit about before we get to the real meaning of why we're here right now, which is this guy and your family.
[time=946] Tell us a little bit about what led you to look at pursuing adoption in your life, in your family.
[time=952] My wife and I, we'd always kind of discussed adoption, but it was just kind of those, hey, yeah, we would adopt, you know, sure, we'd be down for that.
[time=960] But it really probably started when the church went to one service, and we were first-hour people.
[time=967] And so when we went to the one service, we decided that we were going to get more involved.
[time=971] And so instead of first-hour, just coming here and sitting through it and then leaving and spending time with family, we got involved in double exposure at first, and we were just so blessed to be around some wonderful people, a lot of them were sitting over here, and godly people that were able to mentor us for a while.
[time=990] And then that expanded to a community, just from relationships here that led to small groups
[time=997] outside of Sundays, and eventually we landed in, grafted.
[time=1003] And through seeing the lives in there and the children that had been kind of brought
[time=1013] into this community here, and we were right there at the beginning.
[time=1019] When we started the beginning, it was in the middle of the convalese, or towards the end of the convalese adoption of Samuel.
[time=1023] So we got to see that a little bit.
[time=1025] And that just led us to finally follow God's plan for us,
[time=1031] to not just be open to it, but to seek it out.
[time=1035] And that led us one day to my wife showing me a picture of Aaron.
[time=1040] And I was just like, yeah, let's do it.
[time=1043] Isn't he beautiful, by the way?
[time=1045] Yeah, and what you don't know is he just had surgery.
[time=1048] Three surgeries last Thursday.
[time=1050] So he's not usually this quiet.
[time=1053] He's still recovering, so we're very grateful you're here to tell the story.
[time=1057] So tell us, you've told me, I know in talking with you guys, the long story short of it is you got to go to China, and in China, you really got to experience some things that really were life-changing, some defining moments.
[time=1067] Tell us a little bit about that experience.
[time=1068] Yeah, so talking with Melissa, we both had two different kind of experiences.
[time=1073] For me, it was the day that when you're there, they have things all set up and lined up for you, but you go to the abandonment spots of your child.
[time=1083] And we were blessed to have another family that was there with us.
[time=1087] And so we went first to Aaron's abandonment spot, which was on the steps outside of the hospital he was born in.
[time=1093] So the visual that I saw when I'm holding my son is that his birth mother, because of his cleft lip and cleft palate or whatever reasoning I like to, you know, I can't imagine she walked out after being released from hospital, set him down on the steps and walked away.
[time=1108] And then walking from there and then driving to the abandonment spot of the little boy,
[time=1115] Jude, that his parents we were also there with, he was left after a longer time with his birth parents in a walking path
[time=1124] because he had some medical problems.
[time=1127] And just watching him and Aaron just run around and play out there and then picturing them as these little babies just discarded.
[time=1137] I just, I remember thinking to myself, I'm never going to forget what I have at home.
[time=1142] I'll never forget that.
[time=1144] No matter how bad it can get, my family were so blessed.
[time=1149] And then talking with Melissa, she talked a little bit about with me when we went back to the orphanage.
[time=1155] And you see all of the kids that are in the classes that are there, the ones that Aaron was in, and then the older boy, Jude, his classes, and to see them, and they seem to be having fun, but they don't have any idea of where these children are going.
[time=1173] They're going to get forever families.
[time=1175] They're going to get to be a part of a community specifically for us and the other family who's there, followers of Christ.
[time=1183] And those children, you just see them and they're real because now they have a face.
[time=1189] I'm looking at them, it's not just the idea of an orphan, it's a real child that has no family and may never.
[time=1197] And so those two things really stuck out for us.
[time=1200] Yeah, it became a defining moment that changed really a lot about how you see the world around you, right?
[time=1205] And so tell me if you could pin it down to one or two things that really changed your mindset, because that's what today's about.
[time=1212] And what I love about this guy's story and the story of his family is your mindset changed.
[time=1217] You talked about the life you were living and how God just changed how you see it all, and then certainly through this journey it took it to a new level.
[time=1223] Yeah, so I think that for us, we have two beautiful daughters
[time=1231] and we have a good home and we have a family and we're very blessed.
[time=1239] But I think for us we just decided that we wanted to be a part of kingdom building things in our life.
[time=1246] And without, you know, it's good for us to have all the things that we have, but we wanted to do more.
[time=1254] We wanted to invest in our lives and things that were forever lasting, not things that would fall away, but so our life investment was going to be in that.
[time=1262] And so for us, the best way we found with that was an adoption of Aaron.
[time=1267] Love it, love it.
[time=1268] Well, I want to ask Melissa and the girls if you guys are still okay with that.
[time=1271] I'd like to just pray over them and as they come up right now, I'll tell you a couple of things. We're going to put a couple of pictures on the screen of their family.
[time=1277] It's just so you can see the beauty, just the beauty of adoption,
[time=1285] the beauty of what God can do in a family's life.
[time=1289] These guys preach a better sermon than I ever could.
[time=1291] And what you may not know is Joe and Diana who were here last week.
[time=1295] This is their family. This is a continuation.
[time=1298] Those of you who weren't here, you need to go check that out.
[time=1300] Last week's story, we heard an amazing story of how God brought some people together.
[time=1304] And so this is Melissa. You saw her picture on the screen and the stories last week.
[time=1309] Yeah. Can we just celebrate that? Yeah.
[time=1313] Let's pray together. I just want to pray for this beautiful family and thank God for the picture of His grace
[time=1326] that I have standing right here beside me. Can we do that?
[time=1328] God, you are so good and so powerful. I thank you for these beautiful girls.
[time=1333] I thank you for Jordan and Melissa, for Aaron and his story.
[time=1337] God, I thank you for this dear family that you care about so deeply and God that took a step of faith
[time=1343] that was willing to say, God, my mindset will forever be different because you want it to be.
[time=1348] My mindset is changed because of how you've revealed yourself to me.
[time=1353] God, I pray we could hear something in our own hearts and our own journeys from their story to ours.
[time=1359] God that we would not necessarily even know that it's to adopt a child.
[time=1363] But God, the mindset shift that it takes to pursue adoption is the same mindset shift that it takes
[time=1369] to pursue anything, God, that you lay on our hearts and impress us towards.
[time=1373] And so God, I thank you that today I get to share a stage with a family that God is so near and dear to your heart.
[time=1378] I thank you for them. Pray your blessings over Aaron, over this sweet family, over these girls, Lord, that you would just touch them and bless them in all their days ahead.
[time=1385] In Jesus' name, I ask it all, amen.
[time=1387] Can we thank them one more time for sharing their story? Thank you, guys.
[time=1391] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1392] Love you, guys.
[time=1393] So, yeah, you could just go home. We could just pray and say amen, and that's it, right?
[time=1402] But there's more. Let's look at Romans chapter 6 because here's the question I'd like to ask you.
[time=1406] Do you ever find yourself struggling to attain the kind of mindset you know God has for you?
[time=1411] In your life. Do you ever find yourself doing the things you just wish you would stop doing?
[time=1416] Is that just me? No, it's not. It's you too. God to know that because we're in this together.
[time=1421] We've talked about how we don't feel new because of our history, because of our hurts, because of our habits, and that is so true of all of us, and we struggle to have that kind of mindset.
[time=1431] And here's what I love about today. Here's what I love about Romans 6.
[time=1434] As we look at this today, we wrap this series up. Some of you are here, and you would say to me, if you were honest, you would say pastor, I'm here because I'm wanting to hear a little bit more about Jesus,
[time=1445] but I really just don't know if I can get there.
[time=1448] I really just can't ever find that I can identify with the Bible.
[time=1453] Some of you would say that if you're honest, and what I love about today is that if that's you, if you would say I just can never relate to what I read and hear about in the Bible, today is for you.
[time=1464] Because I think all of us can identify if with nothing else in all of the Bible, think we can all identify with this, and with Paul who wrote the book of Romans.
[time=1474] You need to know Paul wrote the majority of our New Testament, but he also wrote this.
[time=1479] Look on your screen, it's also in your bulletin, Romans 7. We're going to be in Romans 6, but I want us to look at Romans 7 because it sets a tone for where we're going today.
[time=1487] Romans 7, verse 15, and then verse 18.
[time=1490] Paul, again, wrote most of your New Testament. He's kind of it when it comes to shooting for a spiritual guy to aim your life after, to model your life after.
[time=1500] He's the mentor of all mentors, but he said, "For I do not understand my own actions.
[time=1506] For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing that I hate."
[time=1513] Verse 18, "For I know that nothing good dwells in me." That is in my flesh. "For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out." Can I get an amen in the building?
[time=1530] Now do you think you can identify with the Bible?
[time=1533] Can you relate with the Bible now?
[time=1535] I know I can when I read those things, and if you keep reading in Romans 7, verse 20, he goes on to say, "It's not me that does these things, but the sin that dwells in me." And that's the thing.
[time=1544] We all have this little thing called sin that has affected us all from Adam from the beginning of mankind.
[time=1550] It has indwelled and affected all of us.
[time=1553] Anybody in the building have to teach their kids to do anything wrong.
[time=1556] Anybody.
[time=1558] I've got to, and they just pick this stuff up on their own.
[time=1562] I don't know what the deal is with that.
[time=1564] They just get it on their own because it's a part of who we are.
[time=1568] And Paul says that, but verse 24, this is what we're going to look at today of Romans 7.
[time=1572] He then says, "What a wretched man I am." Have you ever looked in the mirror and said that?
[time=1577] It may not use the word wretched.
[time=1579] You may use something far worse than that, but you use some words and you look in the mirror and you can identify with Paul where he says, "What a wretched man I am." And I love the question that he asked though.
[time=1589] He then says, "Who will rescue me?" Who? Not what.
[time=1595] That's the most important part of the day.
[time=1597] He doesn't say, "What will rescue me?" He doesn't say, "I've got to figure out how I can rescue me." He says, "Who will rescue me?" Today is all about that who.
[time=1610] Today is all about the who that can rescue you and that did rescue Paul.
[time=1615] Here's the question of the day though.
[time=1617] What do I do when I can't seem to do what I ought to do?
[time=1628] Do you ever ask that question before?
[time=1630] Here's the thing.
[time=1631] We know what we're supposed to do and that's why you've heard me talk about, "Well, why don't you preach on sin more?
[time=1636] I do every week because I preach on you and me." Every week we talk about sin because we bring it all in with us.
[time=1644] If it was just about knowing what to do and that was all we had to do, then church would look a lot different.
[time=1650] Here's what it would look like.
[time=1651] It would probably be a 15-minute service.
[time=1652] We would come in, we'd sing a couple of songs of worship.
[time=1654] I would get up and go, "Stop it!" I would pray we would sing one more song and we would go home.
[time=1664] And so what I'm saying is it's not my fault you're late for lunch.
[time=1670] If it were that simple, we wouldn't be here wrestling with the things that we wrestle with.
[time=1675] Am I right?
[time=1676] Because we know what to do so many times, but we struggle with the ability, just like Paul did, to find the ability, to find the meaning, to find the push, to find the drive, to find the ability just to do what we know is right.
[time=1691] And so here's the thing.
[time=1693] First Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 16, jot that down if you're taking notes.
[time=1697] And we'll have to flip there, we're going to be enrolling in six in just a moment.
[time=1700] It tells us Paul writes this as well and he says that we have the mind of Christ.
[time=1704] We're talking about a new mindset today.
[time=1706] He says that we, anybody who's in Christ, we're a new creation.
[time=1709] We've learned that, we've memorized that, but he also adds to that you have the mind of Christ.
[time=1715] You and I, if we know Jesus, have the mind of Jesus.
[time=1719] And so the bottom line of today is simply this.
[time=1721] You're taking notes, jot it down.
[time=1722] The bottom line is that the mind of Jesus, if we truly have that, which we do for in Christ, the mind of Jesus connects our who to our do, connects our who to our do.
[time=1733] And that's what we're going to look at today.
[time=1735] If you're totally confused, then we're going to dig into that together.
[time=1738] A lot of times we get our who mixed up.
[time=1740] We think that it's me, I'm the who.
[time=1742] I'm the way that I can get to it.
[time=1744] If I just try a little harder, some of you have been living the try a little bit harder Christianity for far too long.
[time=1751] Now what's the pastor up there saying?
[time=1753] He's saying I need to quit trying.
[time=1754] No, I'm saying that your who gets mixed up.
[time=1757] Your ability and who drives you and who gives you the ability to do what God's called you to do gets mixed up so many times.
[time=1765] Now, if you're like me, I'm not as much of a mechanic.
[time=1768] So here's what it goes like if I'm stopped on the side of the road, my car stops working.
[time=1773] I pull over and what do we do, especially as guys, right?
[time=1776] We pop the hood.
[time=1778] We get out, put our hands down in front, spread our legs out a little bit.
[time=1784] And we look into this big, huge compartment that maybe most of you probably do know, but we look like we know what we're talking about.
[time=1792] And here's what I do, I look there for maybe three or four minutes, fiddle around with a few things that I don't know what they are.
[time=1799] And I stand up and I reach in my pocket and I call somebody that knows what they're doing.
[time=1807] I find a different who, a who that hopefully can help me know what to do about my car.
[time=1814] But here's what I want to tell you, some of you have been looking under the hood of your life for far too long and mixing up who it is that can truly connect the pieces back together.
[time=1823] That's what today's all about.
[time=1825] That's what Paul is talking about.
[time=1827] Even when he says I just keep doing the stuff that I hate, it's time to stop looking under the hood and call the only who, his name is Jesus who can walk you through and to all the things that he wants you to do.
[time=1839] Jesus and Jesus alone can do that.
[time=1842] Let's talk about a couple of things in Romans chapter six that we can look at.
[time=1845] What do I do when I can't seem to just do what I know I ought to do?
[time=1849] We're going to find our answer to that.
[time=1851] Two things.
[time=1852] Number one, we need a new master.
[time=1853] Write that down if you're taking notes.
[time=1854] We need a new master verses one through seven of Romans chapter six.
[time=1859] Who's ready for the word this morning?
[time=1862] Romans six.
[time=1864] He says, what shall we say then?
[time=1867] Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?
[time=1870] By no means.
[time=1871] How can we, that's the license to sin.
[time=1873] Those of you who are saying, when you talk about this grace stuff, it just means you can go do whatever you want and it just doesn't matter because you're all covered by grace.
[time=1880] That's not grace.
[time=1881] That's what Paul is talking about.
[time=1882] If you've really experienced Jesus, it changes your mindset and that's where he's going.
[time=1885] Continuing on verse two.
[time=1887] By no means, how can we who died to sin still live in it?
[time=1891] Do you not know that all of us have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
[time=1897] We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead
[time=1904] by the glory of the Father, we too may walk in newness of life.
[time=1909] When we baptized, I'll pause there for a moment ago.
[time=1911] This is one of the passages, the main passage I like to reflect as we baptized.
[time=1915] We say buried with Christ in baptism because it symbolizes the fact that he died, that he was buried.
[time=1920] Then you come out of the water and it symbolizes the newness of life.
[time=1924] I say you buried with Christ in baptism, raised to walk with him in a new life.
[time=1928] It symbolizes he was dead.
[time=1930] He sacrificed himself for you.
[time=1932] He was buried and he came back to life.
[time=1934] He was raised from the dead in the same way.
[time=1937] We die to ourselves so that we can be raised up to walk in a new life with him.
[time=1941] If you haven't been baptized, by the way, and you're contemplating that, we're baptizing next Sunday.
[time=1946] I would encourage you to take that step.
[time=1948] I had to pause in the middle of that because that's why we use that passage because it pictures.
[time=1952] That's what it is, it's a picture.
[time=1954] It doesn't save you.
[time=1955] You're saved by grace through faith alone in Jesus Christ.
[time=1958] But that's the first step of obedience we're called to take because it says to the world, "I died to me and I'm alive in him." So some of you need to take that step.
[time=1967] No extra charge for that extra little sermon yet.
[time=1969] Back to our scripture, verse 5.
[time=1971] "For we have been united with him in a death like his, if we have, we shall certainly be
[time=1979] united with him in a resurrection like his." If we've been united in a death like his, certainly the resurrection does the same thing, has the same power.
[time=1987] We're still just as tied in to that.
[time=1989] Verse 6.
[time=1990] "We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to
[time=1996] nothing so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.
[time=2002] For one who has died has been set free from sin." Wow, there's a lot of stuff in that passage.
[time=2009] I won't be able to cover it all, but the newness that we see in this is what I want to focus on because it comes from a new master.
[time=2015] We've been enslaved to sin.
[time=2018] We get a new master when we know Jesus.
[time=2022] Salvation happens when Jesus, our who, when Jesus, our who becomes the new master of our
[time=2028] life and takes over the dominion.
[time=2030] If you look down, I think it's verse 14, we'll get there in a moment, it says that sin has dominion over us but it no longer does when we find this who known as Jesus.
[time=2041] Now I want to take a little side note because there's this little thing that happened last week, the little election thing that happened.
[time=2047] Anybody watch that and miss a little sleep.
[time=2051] We just prayed for our new president-elect.
[time=2053] I wanted to make sure we started our service with that to lead to this moment where I'd like to say to you because when I look around the church world today, not just here at Black Hawk, all of my friends and family and those that are affiliated with the church that are in Christ.
[time=2067] On Facebook, on social media, you know it asks, what's on your mind?
[time=2071] You ever notice that?
[time=2072] That's pretty dangerous just so you know.
[time=2076] Some of us would do well to learn that, wouldn't we?
[time=2078] But here's what I would submit to you.
[time=2080] When I look around, I feel this spirit of fear about our nation.
[time=2085] I feel this spirit of uncertainty about our nation.
[time=2089] And I would tell you, I feel it too.
[time=2091] I wonder what lies ahead.
[time=2093] Any time there's a new day, it's kind of this series that we're in, any time you step into something new, good, bad, ugly, or in between, any time you step into something new, there's always some uncertainty attached.
[time=2103] It's new.
[time=2104] We've never been there before.
[time=2105] But I would like to just pastor us for just a moment and shepherd us.
[time=2110] That's what shepherds do.
[time=2111] And that's what Jesus, the good shepherd, does for me and he's called me to do for us.
[time=2115] It's where we kind of funnel towards the right stuff.
[time=2118] Let me funnel us for a minute into telling you today that it does not matter.
[time=2123] Once again, who sits in the Oval Office?
[time=2126] Our mission as the church remains the same.
[time=2130] No one and nothing can change the mission of the church.
[time=2133] That mission that Jesus started and said, "I'm going to build my church." He didn't say, "I'm going to build a church and all these people are going to affect it and run it." No, he said, "It's my church.
[time=2143] It's not mine.
[time=2144] It's not yours." "It will build my church and even the gates of hell can't prevail against it." Nothing changes our mission.
[time=2156] So what then do we do since he's our master?
[time=2158] So that would be my question to you.
[time=2160] What is your master today?
[time=2162] I've watched a lot of people let their master become the direction of our nation.
[time=2166] Their questions regarding what the world around us is going to look like.
[time=2170] Is that your master today?
[time=2172] If it is, if it is, if you're allowing it to take over, then kick it to the curb and let Jesus sit on the throne of your life where he's already on the throne anyway.
[time=2183] That's my challenge to you today.
[time=2185] And what do we do then as the church?
[time=2187] We'll say, well, the reality is still that we're in the nation that we're in, yes.
[time=2190] And so we're called to pray for our leaders.
[time=2192] It doesn't matter how you feel about whoever's in office.
[time=2194] We're supposed to pray for our leaders and we will pray for our leaders.
[time=2198] But the best thing you can do, you ready for this?
[time=2200] It's pretty complicated. It's really complicated.
[time=2202] It's probably going to take a little while.
[time=2204] The best thing you can do is be the church.
[time=2209] I told you it was complicated. That's it.
[time=2211] You're waiting for the rest, right?
[time=2213] The best thing you can do for our nation, the best thing you can do for the world around us is be the church.
[time=2222] To submit to this master known as Jesus.
[time=2225] Romans 5, we just read Romans 6, but I love Romans 5 and verse 8, where Paul says, while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
[time=2234] And a lot of times we, and it continues earlier before that verse, he says, while we were still powerless, while we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly.
[time=2243] And I've heard some pushback at times when I've witnessed or shared with other people and even myself, well, I'm not ungodly.
[time=2252] I'm doing better than she is. I'm doing better than he is.
[time=2255] I'm not ungodly. I'm just imperfect.
[time=2257] I want to solve that mystery for you. You're ready?
[time=2260] It's pretty simple. Here's the thing.
[time=2263] Paul says, you say, well, I'm kind of offended.
[time=2265] Paul would say that I'm ungodly.
[time=2267] Paul doesn't know me. You don't even know me.
[time=2269] Here's how I know that you're ungodly.
[time=2271] First of all, because I know I am, because I know me pretty well.
[time=2274] But here's the thing. Ungodly means not like God.
[time=2276] And so you would say, well, I'm imperfect.
[time=2278] Well, here's the thing. God is perfect.
[time=2280] We're imperfect. So we'll say we're imperfect.
[time=2283] If we're imperfect and God is perfect, that means we're unlike God.
[time=2287] That means we're ungodly.
[time=2291] That's it. It's really that simple.
[time=2294] So look at somebody and say, like it or not, you're ungodly.
[time=2297] Go ahead. This is your chance.
[time=2299] You've been waiting for this, right?
[time=2301] How often do you get to do this in church?
[time=2304] Now that we're all ungodly, here's the thing.
[time=2306] When we gain a new master, when we gain, some of you are having way too much fun with that.
[time=2311] It's time to move on.
[time=2312] When we gain a new master, verses three through seven that we just read, we see verse four, we walk in the newness of life.
[time=2320] Two things from verse six, the old self was crucified.
[time=2323] We're no longer enslaved to sin.
[time=2325] Verse seven, one who has died, has been set free from sin.
[time=2330] So in your notes, you see the simple phrase, sin is not my master.
[time=2335] And so here's what I know.
[time=2337] Some of you need to hear yourself say that.
[time=2339] Even if you've got a whisper, even if you don't totally believe it.
[time=2342] I want to ask everybody in the room, just to yourself, not to anybody else, to just simply say that phrase, sin is not my master.
[time=2350] Go ahead.
[time=2353] That was a beautiful one. Don't you want to do it again?
[time=2355] Let's do it again.
[time=2356] Sin is not my master.
[time=2359] That was pretty weak.
[time=2360] So now that we've done it twice, let's do it one more time with some authority, the authority of Jesus in our life.
[time=2365] You ready?
[time=2366] Ready?
[time=2367] Sin is not my master.
[time=2371] Some of you still feel mastered by sin, even though you just said that, but you need to say that to yourself a hundred times a day.
[time=2378] Here's why one of the reasons I love adoption, as we've talked about adoption today.
[time=2383] You know, these children that are in need, and if you don't know, my wife and I are in the process of adoption ourselves.
[time=2389] It's just something that I've seen impact my family.
[time=2391] I'm going to tell you more about that story, not enough time for all of that today, but you'll hear more of that story.
[time=2396] But I love that it's a picture of the gospel.
[time=2399] And here's what I know some of you may say, well, I'm just, I can't adopt or foster because of A.B. and say, you may be exactly right.
[time=2407] But I do love about adoption, that it's one of the cornerstone actions of the gospel.
[time=2412] Very few things in the gospels are as clear as take care of the widows and the orphans.
[time=2417] You see that very clear in Scripture.
[time=2419] And I love that we have care in ministry, we have people that go out and visit, people that make sure we care for those who are in pain, for the widows, for the orphans.
[time=2426] I love that we have an adoption ministry here because it's clear that we should care about that.
[time=2431] Now, what is caring about that mean?
[time=2433] Does that mean I have to adopt a child? Not necessarily.
[time=2435] I hope you will if God tells you to, and he may just do that.
[time=2438] But if not, then we have a ministry you can give to.
[time=2440] We have a ministry you can come serve and be a part of.
[time=2443] I love that we have those venues because it's clear in Scripture.
[time=2446] But here's really why I love it so much.
[time=2448] Why is it such a picture of the gospel?
[time=2450] These children that are in need of adoption, they're known to belong.
[time=2455] This is the phrase you'll hear.
[time=2456] They belong to the state.
[time=2457] You've heard that, right?
[time=2459] Well, they're a word of the state or they belong to the state or they belong to, they belong.
[time=2463] But with the stroke, I love this.
[time=2465] With the stroke of the pen, you sign the dotted line.
[time=2473] Their life changes forever.
[time=2478] But when I look in the mirror, I'm reminded that I was that orphan.
[time=2485] I had nowhere to go.
[time=2487] I was separated from God because of my sin.
[time=2491] But with the stroke of a pen, Jesus said I am your master.
[time=2497] And I've adopted you into my family.
[time=2501] You're mine and I am yours.
[time=2504] That's why I love adoption because it's such a picture of what God has done for us and what He will do for you if you're not a part of that family.
[time=2512] Today is that day.
[time=2514] I believe that with all of my heart.
[time=2516] It is possible.
[time=2517] Why?
[time=2518] Because of our master, because of Jesus.
[time=2521] Some of you need that new master today.
[time=2524] But here's the thing about a new master.
[time=2526] A new master always gives way to a new mindset.
[time=2528] That's the second thing, write that down if you're taking notes, verses 8 through 14.
[time=2532] A new master always leads us to a new mindset.
[time=2536] It changes how we look at the world around us when we decide who our master will be.
[time=2541] Look at verse number 8 with me of Romans chapter 6.
[time=2544] This is where it turns from who is mastering our life.
[time=2547] Who is on the throne of our life to how it affects us.
[time=2551] And this is really the point of this whole series tied together in a few verses.
[time=2555] Now if we have died with Christ, we believe.
[time=2559] And verse 9 says no, that sounds like mindset kind of stuff to me.
[time=2562] We believe that we will also live with Him.
[time=2566] Verse 9, we know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again.
[time=2570] Death no longer has dominion over Him.
[time=2573] For the death He died, He died to sin once and for all.
[time=2577] But the life He lives, He lives to God.
[time=2580] So you must also consider yourselves, new mindset here.
[time=2583] Consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.
[time=2592] Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body to make you obey its passions.
[time=2598] Easier said than done, right?
[time=2600] But here's the master that gives you the mindset that gives you the ability to be able to carry this out.
[time=2604] Verse 13, do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, to present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life,
[time=2615] and your members to God as instruments for righteousness.
[time=2620] How can we be an instrument for righteousness, by the way, before I read the last verse?
[time=2624] We can be an instrument for righteousness.
[time=2625] Have you heard me talk about how we have become the righteousness of God?
[time=2629] You're not just an instrument that God plays and puts away.
[time=2633] You have become the righteousness of God.
[time=2635] That's what instrument means, does it mean a little instrument that you play strum a few times and you put on a shelf?
[time=2641] It's an instrument that is the very righteousness that God wants to set forth in the world around us.
[time=2647] You are that.
[time=2648] You don't just get to carry that.
[time=2649] You are the righteousness of God if you know Jesus.
[time=2653] Verse 14, for sin will no longer have dominion over you since you are not under law but under grace.
[time=2660] Beautiful passage, and I want to talk about that new mindset for a moment.
[time=2664] I want to tell you, we looked at 2 Peter chapter 1.
[time=2667] Jot that down if you're taking notes.
[time=2668] 2 Peter chapter 1 is great.
[time=2669] If you don't believe me yet, that you can be and you are the righteousness of God.
[time=2674] Go read 2 Peter chapter 1.
[time=2675] It tells us that we have everything we need for life and godliness.
[time=2680] I love that because when I look in the mirror, I don't see a guy who has everything that I need for life and godliness.
[time=2687] Why do I have that then?
[time=2688] Because it's not me that lives, but Christ who lives through me and in me.
[time=2692] If I'm in Christ, I'm a new creation.
[time=2695] The old has passed away behold, the new has come.
[time=2699] That's past tense.
[time=2700] If you know Jesus, it's not the new's going to come a little piece at a time each day.
[time=2704] No, the new has come.
[time=2706] It is finished.
[time=2708] He's already won the battle.
[time=2711] We're not called as Christians to fight for victory because victory's already been won.
[time=2716] We're called to fight from victory, not for it.
[time=2719] We can't win it.
[time=2720] He's already won it.
[time=2721] I like being on a winning team.
[time=2724] It makes life easier.
[time=2725] You would think, right?
[time=2726] But then life happens and that victory just doesn't feel like a victory, but it doesn't change the fact that it is a victory because he has already won.
[time=2734] Some of you need a new perspective, a new mindset.
[time=2736] I heard a story one time about these grandkids.
[time=2739] Any grandparents in the building?
[time=2741] Yeah, okay.
[time=2742] Well, you probably can identify the grandkids.
[time=2744] Here's what you guys do.
[time=2745] A little side note, a little rant because I have grandparents in my life and we call it grandparent detox.
[time=2750] Any time the grandparents get ahold of them, they let them do whatever they want to, right?
[time=2755] And they spoil them.
[time=2756] And then we got one grandparent over here and she's a part of this and she knows it, so it's okay.
[time=2761] But then we get the kids back and we have to detox them from the grandparents and get them back used to, yeah, you know.
[time=2767] Okay, anyway, rant over, moving on.
[time=2770] So there's a story of these grandkids that wanted to play a trick on their grandpa and had this big mustache.
[time=2774] And so they got some of the stinking kind of cheese.
[time=2777] It smells really bad.
[time=2778] Limburger kind of cheese.
[time=2779] I don't know if that's the right kind of.
[time=2780] They rubbed it on his mustache while he was sleeping.
[time=2782] He was, they rubbed it on his mustache.
[time=2786] And so he woke up and they were in the corner, you know, peeking around seeing what he was going to do.
[time=2790] And he got up and the living room stinks.
[time=2796] He got up and went into the kitchen.
[time=2801] Honey, what are you cooking at stinks in the kitchen too?
[time=2804] That went bad.
[time=2805] Then he walked outside.
[time=2807] I'm like, I'm going to get some fresh air.
[time=2809] Walked through the foyer.
[time=2810] The foyer stinks too.
[time=2811] I went outside.
[time=2812] Looked outside and went, the whole world stinks.
[time=2818] And I would submit to you and to me that a lot of us have something just like that grandpa right under our nose.
[time=2824] Right under our nose.
[time=2825] Just like he literally had something under his nose that affected his whole perspective and saying the whole world stinks.
[time=2831] Some of you have been living a, the whole world stinks kind of lifestyle.
[time=2835] And I would submit to you today that I believe God wants to do something new in your life to help you see life in a new way.
[time=2842] And it's likely something that's right under your nose about your mindset.
[time=2846] That if you'll allow God to make you the new creation, to make you over, to be your master and give you a new mindset.
[time=2852] It'll change how you see the stinking world around you.
[time=2858] What's right under your nose today?
[time=2861] I believe there's something there. There's something that God's wanting to do in your life.
[time=2865] 2 Corinthians 10 and 5 says take every thought captive. Paul says that. I love that.
[time=2870] Take every thought captive.
[time=2872] That means that we put all of our thoughts, that's our mindset.
[time=2876] We put all of our thoughts under subjection of our who.
[time=2880] We put all of our thoughts, our mindset, under the subjection of our who, who is our master, who is Jesus Christ.
[time=2886] That's when our who starts to trickle over into what we do.
[time=2890] We would be okay. I think we could all agree, can't we, that if our who affected everything that we do, we would be just fine.
[time=2898] If Jesus truly affected everything we do, we'd be great.
[time=2902] But a lot of times we just don't allow our who to drive what we do.
[time=2907] And that's why Paul, the Apostle Paul, the author of most of the New Testament looks at us and says,
[time=2913] I just keep doing the stuff that I hate. I know what to do, but I just don't feel like I have the ability to carry it out.
[time=2920] And that's why he talks so much about this very thing. Our new master leads us to a new mindset.
[time=2925] Write this down if you're taking notes, because here's what it boils down to for you and me.
[time=2928] When my who determines my do, I become new.
[time=2935] It's when my who determines my do that I can be new.
[time=2941] That's really what this whole series has been about, where Jesus determines and drives and defines me.
[time=2948] Not just what I do, but it starts. That's why I said the beginning of the series was more introspective.
[time=2952] If you've got to build an internal foundation so that what we do, the external implications of that internal foundation,
[time=2958] that's why we have to build that foundation first so that we can truly allow this who, the greatest who, who could ever define you to have everything to do with what you do and how you do it
[time=2970] and how you see the world around you.
[time=2974] That's really what the whole series has been about, and I pray that God's done some new things in your life, and I'd give you this challenge for the week.
[time=2981] John 836 says, "If the sun sets you free, you will be free indeed." I know I've been hearing story after story of how people are finding freedom, and I would challenge you with this for the week.
[time=2993] What you do needs to be connected to your who this week.
[time=2999] It's time for a new do. We say that, don't we?
[time=3002] It's time for a new do, new hairdo.
[time=3004] I think it's time for a new do for some of you in the building today.
[time=3008] It's time that you do, and I think that there's an action. That's really what it boils down to here.
[time=3012] There's something God has placed on your heart right now that Jesus is saying to you, "Connect that to me this week." Some action you need to take, some mindset that you need to change, some level of trust that you need to build. I don't know what it looks like, but you do.
[time=3028] If you don't, if you ask him, I promise he'll tell you, he's good about that.
[time=3032] He walks us through the journey with all the grace we could ever imagine.
[time=3036] The most important thing I could tell you though today, the do that needs to be connected to the right who pertains to salvation, pertains to knowing Jesus.
[time=3043] And so with that said, I want to ask you just to close your eyes for a moment.
[time=3046] Everybody in the building, nobody looking around.
[time=3048] We're going to sing a song in just a minute and give you some time to reflect and respond on what God's been doing in your life, but here's the most important thing I can tell you.
[time=3056] The most important thing you could do today, the new do that maybe you need in this building today
[time=3062] starts with you knowing Jesus as your personal Savior.
[time=3068] Some of you would say, "I've been wrestling with that." Some of you would say, "And I've heard some of you talk to me recently and said, "I'm fighting through what that could look like for me, but I just can't quite get there, but I'm almost there." Some of you are on that verge, and I would tell you, whatever's holding you back, stop letting it hold you back because it's not of God.
[time=3085] He wants you to take that leap in this moment and say, "I trust you, Jesus, with my life." And stop trying to complicate what God made so simple.
[time=3094] That's the gospel. It's a story.
[time=3096] And so with all heads bowed, all every eye closed in the building, if you don't know Jesus, it's very simple to come to know Him.
[time=3102] It's not about a prayer. In fact, I'm not even going to lead you in a prayer, because I think in your heart, in your spirit right now, God's already drawing you, and you already feel Him doing just that.
[time=3113] And you would just say, "Jesus, I need you. I know you died for me. I know you're alive.
[time=3118] Please save me." Whatever words your heart's screaming, would you cry out to God in scripture promises?
[time=3123] And why does scripture promise? Because God promised.
[time=3126] God promised that He'll save you in this moment.
[time=3128] Will you take a moment and do that right now?
[time=3138] Your love is devoted, like a ring of solid gold,
[time=3144] like a vow that is tested, like a covenant of old,
[time=3151] and your love is enduring, through the winter rain,
[time=3158] and beyond the horizon, with mercy for today.
[time=3165] And faith will you have been, and faith will you will be.
[time=3172] You pledge yourself to me, and it's why I sing your praise.
[time=3179] Will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips.
[time=3221] You follow the orphan, your kindness makes us whole,
[time=3228] and your shoulder weakness, and your strength becomes our own.
[time=3235] Now you're making me like you, clothing me in white,
[time=3242] bringing beautiful messages, but you will have your pride
[time=3249] free of all her guilt, and rid of all her shame,
[time=3256] and know my her true name, and this why I sing your praise.
[time=3262] Will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips.
[time=3290] And you will be praised, and you will be praised.
[time=3297] With angels and saints we sing worthy, are you Lord?
[time=3304] You will be praised, and you will be praised.
[time=3311] With angels and saints we sing worthy, are you Lord?
[time=3318] You will be praised, you will be praised.
[time=3325] With angels and saints we sing worthy, are you Lord?
[time=3332] And you will be praised, you will be praised.
[time=3339] With angels and saints we sing worthy, are you Lord?
[time=3347] And it's why I sing your praise.
[time=3350] Will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips.
[time=3381] Thank you so much for watching today.
[time=3383] We want you to know that we don't take it lightly, that you spend some of your time with us each week.
[time=3387] And so I want to speak directly to those of you who today may be that new day.
[time=3392] We've been in the series called New, and today could be that new day for you where you're ready to take that leap of faith.
[time=3397] Maybe it's a leap that you've been battling with and thinking about for quite some time, but today is the day of salvation for you.
[time=3404] As we've talked about today, we often complicate something that God made so simplistic for us.
[time=3410] Even a child, I know I was five years old when I first came to understand the gospel.
[time=3415] Even a child can understand what salvation is truly all about.
[time=3418] It really is all about that surrender.
[time=3420] Just laying our life down at the foot of Jesus and saying, "Jesus, I truly do need you.
[time=3425] I know that you died for me. I know that you're alive, and today I just choose to give you me." Now, some of you are looking right now and saying, "It really can't be that simple." To which I would say to you, it absolutely can and it absolutely is.
[time=3440] No matter where you're at today, no matter what skeletons are in your closet, no matter what things you attach to your past that have held you back from perhaps looking at this step,
[time=3449] today can be the day of salvation for you.
[time=3451] I want to challenge you to take that step and to not hold back today.
[time=3455] We're here. That's why we do what we do.
[time=3457] We're here to walk with you, to show you the way, to show you the next steps.
[time=3461] I want to get a booklet in your hand if you have taken that step or even if you're just thinking about it.
[time=3465] You're going to have some information that's going to be on your screen, some phone numbers, websites, email addresses, where you can reach out to us and we'd like to get this booklet into your hands.
[time=3473] It's just called beginning steps, and that's what it really is.
[time=3476] If you give your life to Jesus, it really is the beginning of something new.
[time=3480] It's not just a fire insurance that gives us a guarantee of being in heaven instead of in hell one day.
[time=3486] It's really a beginning of a new life.
[time=3488] Jesus said, "I came to give you life and to give it to you more abundantly." For those of you who have taken that step, thank you for allowing us to walk with you.
[time=3496] Today, as we've looked at this new mindset, I want to challenge you this week to allow your who to dictate your do.
[time=3503] What you do flows from who is driving you.
[time=3506] Today, we've looked at that who.
[time=3508] His name is Jesus and let him be the driver of your mindset.
[time=3512] Let him give you that peace that passes understanding.
[time=3515] In the midst of a crazy world with a lot of things going on all around us, a lot of uncertainty.
[time=3520] There is certainty in the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=3524] We're excited to build on that certainty and to allow him to drive everything that we do here at Black Hawk Ministries,
[time=3530] but also in your life.
[time=3532] That's really been the point of this series.
[time=3534] I pray that it's been a blessing to you as we've looked for six weeks at this concept of new and how new is the story of the gospel.
[time=3540] But more importantly, how new is really something that God wants to do in your life and in mind.
[time=3546] Thank you so much for allowing us to be a part of your journey, a part of your story, and I pray that the new beginnings of God in your life
[time=3553] are just getting started and we're going to journey on that together in the days of head.
[time=3556] You can check us out on our website, blackhawkministries.org.
[time=3559] You can get all of our information off of our screen and thank you again so much for watching.
[time=3563] We'll be back with you next week. God bless you. See you then.
