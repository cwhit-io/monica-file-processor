[time=841] Jesus, Jesus.
[time=858] When we walk with the Lord in the light of His Word,
[time=867] what a glory He sheds on our way.
[time=875] While we do His good will, He abides with us still,
[time=883] and with all who will trust and obey.
[time=890] Trust and obey for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus,
[time=902] but to trust and obey.
[time=912] Not a burden we bear, not a sorrow we share,
[time=920] but a toy he doth richly repay.
[time=928] Not a dream nor a loss, not a frown nor a cross,
[time=936] but His blessing we trust and obey.
[time=943] Trust and obey for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus,
[time=955] but to trust and obey.
[time=958] Lord, I love you.
[time=960] Please help me to trust and obey.
[time=966] Lord, I love you.
[time=968] Please help me to trust and obey.
[time=974] Amen, fellowship, sweet.
[time=983] We will sit at His feet, for we'll walk by His side in the way.
[time=996] What He says we will do, where He says we will go.
[time=1004] And if you only trust and obey, just and obey for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus,
[time=1022] but to trust and obey.
[time=1027] Trust and obey for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus,
[time=1038] but to trust and obey.
[time=1042] Lord, I love you.
[time=1044] Please help me to trust and obey.

[time=1065] Please help me to trust and obey.
[time=1070] [AMEN] Thank you so much for watching us today on the Bible Hour.
[time=1079] I'm so honored that you just given us a little of your time today.
[time=1082] I've got my good friend Darren here, and we want to tell you a little bit about some of the events coming up towards the Christmas holidays here at Black Hawk Ministry.
[time=1090] Darren, tell us a little bit about, first of all, the Prodigal Christmas that's coming up in.
[time=1094] On December the 17th, at 2 o'clock and 7 o'clock, we have a real treat for you.
[time=1101] It is called the Prodigal Christmas, and it's a musical.
[time=1104] It's actually written by one of our own, Corey Benson and his wife, Becky.
[time=1109] And the story is the biblical story about the Prodigal Son, and it is set in the 20s.
[time=1117] And I won't tell you anything else. I want you to come see it.
[time=1120] So, remember, December the 17th, at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and 7 o'clock at night.
[time=1125] Come join us.
[time=1126] And what you really need to know is that this guy is going to be a part of that as well.
[time=1130] So, yeah.
[time=1131] Still, come join us.
[time=1133] Following that, we also have two important Christmas services here at Black Hawk Ministry.
[time=1138] Sunday is actually Christmas Day this year, and so Christmas Eve, Saturday night, the 24th, we will have a Christmas Eve service here at Black Hawk that will be at 6 p.m.
[time=1148] Now, this service and the service on the next day are both going to be family services.
[time=1152] What that means is all the kids, all ages will all be in the worship center.
[time=1156] And we know it's going to be loud. We know it's going to be different.
[time=1159] We're ready for that.
[time=1160] I'm even preaching a shorter sermon that day.
[time=1162] And so, we want to invite you to come be a part of that.
[time=1164] December 24th at 6th, the second Christmas service is December 25th, Christmas morning at 10 30.
[time=1170] That's our normal service time here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=1173] We won't have our 9 a.m. activities, but we will have another family service at 10 30 a.m.
[time=1179] here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=1180] On behalf of Darren and I both, thank you so much for just hearing us out today.
[time=1184] And we want to invite you personally to come be a part of all the great stuff that God is doing here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=1189] We'll be looking forward to sharing with you in just a moment. Thanks for watching.
[time=1219] [MUSIC - 20 seconds]
[time=1248] To have a lot of money or personal gain through hard work.
[time=1253] Well, I think of money and well, and then like a Ferrari and you know like sunglasses and chain.
[time=1259] That's it for your brush. Yes.
[time=1262] To have money.
[time=1265] To have tons of money and be able to go wherever you go because you have too much money.
[time=1274] To have lots of money.
[time=1280] But you get lots of money and you have lots of money and that's what I think.
[time=1287] It's a hell lot of money and property and a lot of stuff.
[time=1294] Yeah.
[time=1296] To have a lot of something that not a lot of people have.
[time=1300] To have lots of family and beer have a strong connection with God.
[time=1304] It makes me to be rich. It is to give money to my family so they can buy a better house because we're not doing so great right now.
[time=1317] To have a lot of teases.
[time=1320] I feel like there are two kinds of rich like money rich and like rich and knowing God.
[time=1327] Well, human wise it would be to have like a lot of money and be wealthy and then spiritually wise it would be obviously to be rich in Christ.
[time=1337] You know, have a good relationship with it and all that kind of stuff.
[time=1342] Fundance of things that could be money are like a lot of different things.
[time=1347] To me to be rich it means to have lots of family around you and to be fulfilled in the things in your life that God has given you.
[time=1356] Not only terms to be rich meaning that I would like, I would understand the Bible and not necessarily go to church but understand the word of God.
[time=1367] And just basically just like know God's word and practice it.
[time=1373] To have God be the Lord of your life.
[time=1377] Talking like in a deep spiritual sense I'm like a physical human sense.
[time=1381] What kind of rich are we talking about?
[time=1383] Like cake rich, chocolate cake rich, chocolate cake and pretty rich.
[time=1387] You can have money, I'm having a lot of money and then being rich is Jesus which is having Jesus and then there's chocolate.
[time=1396] To be rich is a lot more than just money.
[time=1401] I think it has a lot more to do with being concerned with your life and being satisfied.
[time=1409] ♪
[time=1423] Does anybody wish they were rich?
[time=1426] Those were some of BCS Black Hawk Christian schools on with their answers.
[time=1430] Some glimmers of hope in there too, right?
[time=1433] I wonder what it would look like if we pulled all of you guys.
[time=1436] What does it mean to be rich?
[time=1437] What would that look like?
[time=1438] That's one of the things that we're going to look at in this series.
[time=1441] We're kicking off a new series today called "intrusted." If you've got your Bibles, look at 1 Timothy chapter 6.
[time=1448] We're going to be looking at verses 17 through 21 for four weeks.
[time=1452] You say there can't be that much there.
[time=1455] Oh, there's that and more for us because we do not have all of this down yet.
[time=1459] But I'm really excited today and pumped about what we got to do to kick off the service.
[time=1464] Anybody still excited about that, all those baptisms?
[time=1467] Yeah, can we celebrate what God's doing here?
[time=1469] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1471] Yeah, so today, you know, the most important thing we're interested with is the grace of God.
[time=1477] We're going to look at one of my favorite verses in Scripture probably on the last week of this series, 1 Peter 4.10, that tells us we are stewards, managers of the grace of God.
[time=1487] That's the most important thing we're interested with.
[time=1489] But we're going to look in this series for four weeks at what it means to be entrusted, what it means to make the most out of the stuff that God gives to us.
[time=1498] Now, just so you know, let me clear the air.
[time=1501] You're thinking, is he doing one of the M-word series, the money series?
[time=1507] Yes, I am.
[time=1509] Now that we've got that out of the way, yes, I am.
[time=1511] I'm going to talk about money.
[time=1512] You may say, why do preachers talk about money all the time?
[time=1516] Why do you do that?
[time=1517] We talk about money all the time because, well, Jesus did.
[time=1520] Jesus had more to say about our money than he did.
[time=1523] A lot of things that might surprise you.
[time=1525] Heaven, hell, sin, all those kind of things that you think the Scripture is all about.
[time=1528] Why?
[time=1529] Why did Jesus do that?
[time=1530] Talk about our money.
[time=1531] Well, he wanted us to know that he knew where our hearts truly are, gets seen by where our treasure truly is.
[time=1540] And so we're going to look at that in a minute, but I want you to know there's a whole lot more to life.
[time=1543] There's a whole lot more to stewardship.
[time=1545] Steward means to manage.
[time=1547] There's a whole lot more to being interested than just money.
[time=1551] So now you can breathe a little bit.
[time=1553] You can let that breath out.
[time=1554] He's not just going to talk about money, for sure.
[time=1557] But there is a lot to say about what we do with what we are interested with.
[time=1561] And when I look around, I see a lot of families.
[time=1563] We're interested with a lot of amazing things.
[time=1566] I want to make the most of what I've been interested with.
[time=1568] Today we're going to talk about how can I be rich.
[time=1570] We're going to answer a question each week and we're going to look at riches today because this passage is going to happen.
[time=1574] Because this passage really digs us into that.
[time=1576] We're just going to look at verse 17 today.
[time=1578] We'll read that whole passage in just a minute.
[time=1580] But I want to give you kind of the foundation of the series.
[time=1583] The foundation of this series, we'll say this every week, is simply put, the heart of being entrusted is trust.
[time=1591] The heart of being entrusted is trust.
[time=1594] Do you even notice on the logo?
[time=1595] There are the brackets there because in the middle of the word, entrusted is the word trust.
[time=1600] To truly be entrusted well, we've got to learn to trust God with everything that He has entrusted to us.
[time=1606] And so that's really what we'll be digging in.
[time=1608] I want to give you a memory verse because you guys did so well with your memory verse in the new series that we just did.
[time=1614] And we're going to look, this is an easy one.
[time=1616] Are you ready for this?
[time=1617] Matthew is what we're going to look at.
[time=1619] Matthew 621, simply put Jesus said it this way, say it with me.
[time=1623] For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
[time=1632] Really what we're looking at today, because I know what goes through some of your minds.
[time=1636] We saw it even in our videos.
[time=1638] Well, I haven't been entrusted with as much as that person has been entrusted with.
[time=1642] I just need to be entrusted with a little bit more than my stewardship would be fine.
[time=1646] Right?
[time=1647] Can I get a name in, if we're honest?
[time=1650] We often live it out that way, especially in regards to money, but really in regards to life.
[time=1655] If I could just get that job or if I could just get that relationship figured out or if that girl would finally say yes and go on that date with me perhaps, whatever it might look like, we want to be entrusted with more, but Jesus has called us to look at where our heart is.
[time=1670] And the best indicator for where our heart truly is is where our treasure truly goes.
[time=1675] And so today it's really about this, and I want to address some of those thoughts.
[time=1678] It's not what you have, it's what you do with what you have.
[time=1683] What this passage about, what Jesus is talking about, what you can grow from, starts with the knowledge.
[time=1688] And this is why we've got to grasp this.
[time=1690] Is everybody grasping with me today?
[time=1691] You ready for this?
[time=1692] It's not what you have.
[time=1694] It's what you do with what you have.
[time=1697] That's what matters.
[time=1698] That's what Jesus is talking about.
[time=1700] And that's what we're going to look at even in this series.
[time=1703] So let me give you the bottom line.
[time=1704] I always give you a bottom line.
[time=1705] This is really verse 17.
[time=1706] This is really a part of the bottom line of this passage that we'll read together.
[time=1710] And it's what you treasure reveals what you trust.
[time=1714] Because at the heart of entrusted is, all right, some of you are with me and alive and well today.
[time=1721] The rest of you will get you there in a few moments.
[time=1723] What you treasure reveals what you trust.
[time=1726] And so I've got with me a treasure chest.
[time=1731] What you treasure reveals what you trust.
[time=1735] Now, I think this treasure chest is a lot like our life.
[time=1738] It's pretty small.
[time=1740] You can only fit certain amount of things in here.
[time=1742] We like to fit a lot of things in here.
[time=1744] We'd like to have a bunch of treasure chests.
[time=1746] And that's kind of the American dream, if we're honest, isn't it?
[time=1749] Is to have a bunch of treasure chests scattered throughout the nation.
[time=1752] But the thing about this treasure chest is you can only fit a certain amount of things in here.
[time=1757] And I think Jesus knew that when he said where your treasure is, there your heart will be.
[time=1763] Also, what is he saying?
[time=1764] He's saying where your treasure goes, what you fit into your treasure chest.
[time=1769] Because we all have a treasure chest.
[time=1771] We all have the capacity to gain treasure, to gain finances, to gain resources.
[time=1778] But what we fit in our treasure chest, Jesus is saying, what we prioritize, if you will,
[time=1784] that reveals where our trust really lies.
[time=1788] I figured it'd be silent.
[time=1790] Because a lot of times when we really reflect on that, what are we putting in our treasure chest?
[time=1794] It starts to get uncomfortable because we start to realize, you know, maybe I value certain things that I shouldn't value as much.
[time=1800] Maybe they're at the top of my priority list.
[time=1802] Maybe I need to take those out of the treasure chest and put something else in.
[time=1805] Make a little more room for the things that Jesus has for my life.
[time=1808] So I start by just asking you this question.
[time=1810] What have you squeezed into your treasure chest in your life right now?
[time=1814] What are your priority lists?
[time=1816] If you were to list them out, what would it look like?
[time=1819] That's a big list.
[time=1820] That's a big question.
[time=1821] And we're going to work on that list and that question for four weeks.
[time=1825] So maybe our treasure chest might look a little bit different at the end of four weeks.
[time=1830] Not just in regards to how we spend our money, but how we value what God has entrusted to us.
[time=1835] Maybe as a parent, or a grandparent, maybe as a steward of our job, or the influence,
[time=1841] or the power, or the authority that we're given in our life.
[time=1844] And so I pray you can learn what it means to be entrusted a little more effectively.
[time=1849] And our treasure chest will look a little bit different.
[time=1851] I want to do two things today.
[time=1852] I want to give you two enemies of trust and then two enablers of trust.
[time=1855] Pretty simple, pretty short, pretty sweet today.
[time=1858] But I think it's something that will really impact your daily life and your week if you allow God to speak into your heart.
[time=1863] Who's ready for the word this morning?
[time=1865] First Timothy, chapter six.
[time=1867] Let's look there together.
[time=1868] I want to read the whole passage starting in verse 17.
[time=1871] First Timothy, chapter six, verse 17.
[time=1874] As for the rich in this present age, now let me pause.
[time=1878] I know what half the building just did.
[time=1880] Yes, this series doesn't apply to me.
[time=1884] All I'm going to tell you is don't hold your breath.
[time=1886] Now we'll keep going.
[time=1887] As for the rich in this present age, Paul's talking to Timothy, his protege, someone he mentored in his life because he's a leader.
[time=1895] This is what he had to say to him.
[time=1896] Charge them not to be haughty nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches,
[time=1902] but on God who richly provides us with everything to enjoy.
[time=1907] They are to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share, thus storing up treasure for themselves as a good foundation for the future,
[time=1917] so that they may take hold of that which is truly life.
[time=1921] Oh Timothy, guard the deposit entrusted, entrusted to you.
[time=1927] Avoid the irreverent babble and contradictions.
[time=1930] Avoid as falsely called knowledge for by professing it, some has swerved from the faith.
[time=1935] Grace, be with you.
[time=1937] Let's zoom in on verse 17 and look at some things about trust today.
[time=1942] Let's start with a couple of enemies of trust.
[time=1944] Two enemies of trust.
[time=1945] The first one is denial.
[time=1948] This is for all of us who said, "Yay, this passage isn't about me because I'm sure not rich."
[time=1954] Denial, denial.
[time=1956] Let me talk to you for a minute about what we often view as rich.
[time=1960] It's why we put together that video.
[time=1961] I think the kids did a great job capturing what we see, not just in our nation, but a lot of times what mirrors our hearts.
[time=1967] So the Gallup polls, you've heard of those before, those big polls that go across the United States.
[time=1971] They did a survey several years ago on what it looks like to be rich.
[time=1975] Just simply went out and asked that question, "What is rich?" And I asked it in a money contest.
[time=1980] How much money do you have to have to be rich?
[time=1983] The United States as a whole said $150,000 annual salary constitutes as rich.
[time=1990] If you ask the people who make 30 to 35,000 a year, just that segment, they said $75,000 a year was rich.
[time=1998] And if you read Money Magazine, I don't read that because I don't know, you know, anyway.
[time=2004] Money Magazine did a survey for all of their subscribers, and they said $5,000,000 was rich.
[time=2012] A lot of different perspectives, huh, on what rich truly looks like.
[time=2016] But here's the common denominator of all that.
[time=2018] You say, "What does that have to do with me?
[time=2020] I might have said something in between those." Here's the common denominator.
[time=2022] Everybody on that list, if you were to ask the people they were talking about, if you ask the people that made $150,000 a year or more, $75,000 a year or more, or $5 million a year or more, they would all tell you this.
[time=2033] Are you rich?
[time=2034] The United States thinks you are, "No, I'm not rich.
[time=2036] I'm not rich." They would almost all say, "I'm not rich," as you and I would likely do as well.
[time=2044] So what's the conclusion?
[time=2045] The conclusion of all that is that nobody's rich, but everybody knows somebody who is.
[time=2050] (Laughter) Nobody's rich, but we all know somebody who is rich.
[time=2058] Let me tell you this.
[time=2060] If you make a household income in today's world, today's economy, if you make a household income of around 44 to 45,000 a year, a household income, then you are in the top 1% of wage earners in the world.
[time=2075] I had a feeling their response I get is about that because then we start to realize,
[time=2084] "Well, maybe I am rich by the world's standards.
[time=2088] Maybe I have more to celebrate than I think I do." Those bills that are staring you right in the face on your desk when you get home would scream otherwise, but when we look at how blessed we are even financially, we start to realize that maybe we just get in denial about how rich we truly are.
[time=2107] I would say the anecdote to denial, denying it, is trust.
[time=2112] The more we learn to trust Jesus with our life, the more we learn to realize, hear me, the more we realize how much treasure we truly have, the more we realize how much treasure we truly have, the more we can learn to trust God with that treasure.
[time=2127] If we refuse to realize it, if we refuse to acknowledge how rich we truly are, we forget the owner of it all.
[time=2134] We forget that it was him who blessed us with every bit of it anyway.
[time=2138] Psalm 103, we looked at this in our new series a little while back, but I just kept coming back to it this week.
[time=2142] Psalm 103 and verse 2 says, "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not His benefits."
[time=2148] I know I'm bad at times about forgetting all the benefits that I have available to me in Jesus.
[time=2153] I forget about the power source I get to plug into.
[time=2156] I forget about all of the material blessings that I really do have because the natural tendency in the American dream especially is to long for more.
[time=2164] We always want something else.
[time=2169] And so that leads us to the second part of this, which is discontentment.
[time=2172] You can go in and fill that in.
[time=2174] So denial will lead you to discontentment.
[time=2176] And I'll tell you this about those.
[time=2178] The more you recognize what God has done.
[time=2180] Back to Psalm 103, verse 2.
[time=2182] The more you recognize what God has done, the more you can focus on what He can do.
[time=2187] A lot of times I get stuck on what I wish God would do and without recognizing all the stuff that He already has done.
[time=2194] And I've said it a few times already.
[time=2196] The God who got us here, the God who got you here will also get you there.
[time=2200] He's the same yesterday, today and forever.
[time=2203] And the more we realize all the things that He has done and recognize the blessings, He's poured into our lives.
[time=2209] The more we recognize that, the more we can look to all the things He has for our future.
[time=2214] I get held back by my past so many times saying, well, if God would have done this
[time=2220] at that season of my life, then I would be in a different place today.
[time=2224] But God wants you to say, look at the things I did do.
[time=2227] Think about the things that you don't even realize I did in that season of your life.
[time=2232] You don't even know the car wrecks I saved you from.
[time=2235] You don't even know the times when you should have been killed, but I decided I'm not done with you yet, and you're still on this earth.
[time=2243] When we realize the things He's done, we can look to the things He wants to do and will do in our lives.
[time=2250] So it says hope, verse 17.
[time=2252] It says hope on the uncertainty of riches.
[time=2255] A lot of us have our hope there.
[time=2256] It says don't put your hope in the uncertainty of riches.
[time=2259] Look at that in verse 17.
[time=2260] The uncertainty of riches.
[time=2262] You should underline that.
[time=2263] A lot of times we get our hope in things that are uncertain.
[time=2266] In my life, every time I go downhill in my life, it's usually because my hope got put in something that goes like this.
[time=2272] This up and that's down and that's left and that's right.
[time=2274] That's uncertain.
[time=2275] And I want to tell you, my friends, listen, riches will always be uncertain.
[time=2280] I don't care if you reach that pinnacle mark that you've got in your mind of your bank account.
[time=2284] As soon as you reach it, you'll be discontented because you want a little bit more.
[time=2287] The cost of living will get a little bit higher and things will change in a little bit of a different way, and you'll never be content with what you have until we realize all the things that God's done.
[time=2295] And then when we lay them at His feet, our treasure starts to point to where our trust is and our trust cannot look so much like it's in our treasure but in the one who gave us the treasure to begin with.
[time=2305] That'll change what it looks like to be entrusted.
[time=2309] Anybody feeling good about yourselves yet?
[time=2312] There's good news, I promise.
[time=2314] I'm talking about the enemies now, okay?
[time=2316] We're going to get to the enablers in just a minute.
[time=2318] But, you know, I've met some rich people before.
[time=2321] You ever met one?
[time=2322] Because, you know, nobody, none of us are rich, but we all know somebody who is.
[time=2326] So, I've met some rich people before, and I've seen them, they'll stand, it's crazy stuff.
[time=2330] They'll do crazy things, like have a shoe rack full of shoes to go with all these different outfits.
[time=2335] And then they'll stand in front of their closet and say, I have, you know, some rich people too, don't you?
[time=2344] I have nothing to wear, but in our closet we have work clothes, work out clothes, after work clothes, work in the yard clothes, clothes for after we work in the yard clothes.
[time=2352] And then between we work in the yard clothes, right?
[time=2355] We're so blessed, we're so blessed, but why is it that the world around us is so discontented?
[time=2361] It's a very simple answer, and it goes back to where our trust lies.
[time=2365] It's because trust ends up in the uncertainty of the world around us.
[time=2369] I'll broaden this verse as riches, but a lot of times it just simply ends up in the world around us, all the things that we can't control, but today I want to challenge you.
[time=2378] Find a way to let your treasure point to the fact that your trust is in the one who gave you all the treasure to begin with.
[time=2384] Your trust is in none other than Jesus Christ because the world is uncertain and it's up and it's down,
[time=2390] and you can make a list of all the uncertain things in your life right now.
[time=2394] As uncertain as the world is, Jesus is constant and the same forever and forevermore.
[time=2400] (Applause) So how much money would you have to have to feel like you've arrived, to feel like you're rich?
[time=2412] I don't even need to poll the audience because I know the answer.
[time=2415] It's more than you already have, isn't it?
[time=2419] But this contentment can be destroyed.
[time=2422] When we stop denying how blessed we are and just look at the reality of all that God's done in our life, and then we start to find some enablers of trust.
[time=2430] And before I get to those enablers, I want you to see this verse.
[time=2433] Jot it down. I want you to meditate on this.
[time=2434] There's a lot of thoughts in this verse.
[time=2436] Proverbs 18-11 says, "A rich man's wealth is his strong city,
[time=2442] and like a high wall in his imagination." Hmm. It's kind of a deep verse, isn't it?
[time=2450] The wisest man to ever live wrote it, so it's probably a lot more there than my simple mind, can grasp, but I think a couple of things stand out that a lot of times that becomes what we trust.
[time=2458] Our riches, our wealth becomes what we trust, and it becomes this wall that we try to scale, and we imagine things what could be if I had a little bit more, and a little bit more, and a little bit more, and in our imagination that wall keeps going up and we never reach it, and we stay discontented, and we stay in denial, and we give in to, and the enemies of trust overcome us.
[time=2479] But God's given us some enablers, and this verse alone, we see some very clear enablers of trust.
[time=2483] I want to give you two. The first one is humility.
[time=2486] The first one is humility. Two enablers of trust, humility is number one.
[time=2490] It says charge the rich in this present age.
[time=2492] By the way, who's that apply to now?
[time=2494] Raise your hand if that's you?
[time=2497] Some of you got it. The rest of you, we've got three more weeks.
[time=2499] You'll get there.
[time=2502] Enablers of trust, humility, says to the rich in this present age, to the rich in this present age.
[time=2508] And I think we all fit that category more than we would ever realize it when we look at what God's blessed us with, charge them not to be haughty.
[time=2516] It's a lot of times what happens is we can't trust because we lack the humility that it takes to trust. We don't often look at trust as a humility issues.
[time=2525] You think, well, I'm not an arrogant person.
[time=2527] I would probably agree with you, but a lot of times deep down in our heart and our soul, we think we're pretty sufficient.
[time=2535] I've done pretty well for myself when I look around.
[time=2538] I've done okay. I can handle this. I got this one, God.
[time=2543] But it takes us, that's the hardiness that Paul is talking to Timothy about here, is to say, I got to trust God, even if I think I've got it together, I know right around the corner I'm probably just fixing a stumble and fall flat on my face.
[time=2554] You ever been that person? You think you've got it together?
[time=2557] It's usually in that moment. Pride goes before a fall.
[time=2564] That's been my life. Any time I fall flat on my face, it usually has to do with a time I was hardy, a time I thought, or I'm pretty good on my own. I've got this one figured out.
[time=2574] But Paul is saying, it takes humility to truly trust.
[time=2578] Don't trust me, trust he.
[time=2583] Everybody look at somebody and say, don't trust me, trust he.
[time=2589] That's the first enabler of trust. The second enabler of trust is hope.
[time=2593] Hope, write that down if you're taking notes. Humility and hope.
[time=2596] Both of those things very clearly seen.
[time=2598] Because it says, do not place your hope in the uncertainty of riches, but place your hope in God, in God.
[time=2607] I love what the verse says. Look at verse 17 again.
[time=2609] For the rich in this present age, charge them not to be hardy, nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but on God who richly provides us with everything to enjoy.
[time=2620] Did you know God wants you to enjoy life?
[time=2623] A money series at church, or all the times Jesus talked about money, the stewardship series that we do, it's not saying, well, you can't have fun in life.
[time=2632] You've got to give all your money to the church.
[time=2635] No? It's saying, God's blessed you.
[time=2638] Enjoy what he's blessed you with, but next week we're going to look at verse 18 at what it means to be generous.
[time=2643] Because when you truly trust Jesus who gave you all the treasures you have in your life right now, generosity is natural.
[time=2651] You can't hold it back.
[time=2653] And if you want to become a more generous person, make sure you're here next week as we dig into what that looks like, because generosity goes a lot further than the checks that you write.
[time=2661] And it starts with where your hope lies, but humility will lead you to hope.
[time=2665] Have you ever found that? Every time I humble myself, and I just say, it does good, by the way, sometimes just to get on your knees and physically demonstrate what you're trying to get your heart to imitate.
[time=2680] You know, a lot of times we try to be humble, but we just refuse to humble ourselves.
[time=2686] I would challenge you one action step that you can take.
[time=2688] I've given you two so far.
[time=2689] If you're taking notes on your homework, there will be a quiz next week.
[time=2693] The first one is to make a list of all the ways you've been blessed.
[time=2697] Just make that list.
[time=2700] You want to see your trust migrate to Jesus?
[time=2703] Realize how blessed you have been.
[time=2705] A lot of times life screams at you the things you don't have, the things you wish you had, but I think if you just physically took 15 minutes and wrote it out, I think God's going to do something in your heart pertaining to your trust.
[time=2718] The second piece of homework is to do this.
[time=2721] One time this week, just once, I believe some of you're going to do it 10 times
[time=2727] because you see God do something in the one time, but one time, get on your knees for your prayer time.
[time=2733] I pray going down the road a lot just so you know I keep my eyes open.
[time=2736] You should too.
[time=2737] God still hears you.
[time=2739] But at some point where it's quiet at home, wherever your quiet place will be, just get on your knees to physically demonstrate to God the posture of your heart that you're humble and that your hope is in him.
[time=2752] And I think when you combine that list with that humility of just bowing before God, I think God's going to do something in your heart pertaining to you the way that you can trust him with your treasure of all the things that he's entrusted to you.
[time=2765] And I want to tell you, I want to pose a question to you that you can ponder this week.
[time=2769] It's in your notes, I want you to help you fill in a blank here.
[time=2771] The question is, why would I put my hope in the provision when I know the provider?
[time=2778] Don't we do that though?
[time=2781] Why would I put my hope in the provision in that job, in that relationship,
[time=2788] in that stressor in your life that you wish you could just stop worrying about?
[time=2792] If you could just get your kids in line, if you could just get this or that or whatever it might be, why would I put my hope in those provisions when I already know the provider?
[time=2801] And he says boldly approach the throne of grace, boldly ask, ask.
[time=2808] He tells us to come to him, I know the provider, do you?
[time=2812] The best illustration I've seen of this this week, Jim Thomas passed away.
[time=2819] A great friend of black caught been a member here a long time.
[time=2821] I got to go to his house and sit with him a week before he passed.
[time=2825] Our double exposure class has been such a huge impact in his life and I'll be doing his funeral in South Bend tomorrow.
[time=2833] But I don't know that as a pastor I get to see a lot of people in a lot of different situations.
[time=2837] I don't know that I've ever met anybody who understood that principle more than Jim.
[time=2842] He's been battling cancer for quite some time and he lost that battle, but he won the ultimate war, didn't he?
[time=2849] Because he knew Jesus.
[time=2851] And he looked at me and our double exposure group went over there and served him communion, preached a little sermon and sermon that I think it was called by my brother Phil.
[time=2864] They sang songs, they did communion together.
[time=2867] And I think, I think that that just said to Jim, you know, it's okay.
[time=2873] It's okay to go.
[time=2876] And talking with him, I want you to know he was at the end of his life at the end.
[time=2881] And here's what I want to challenge you with with Jim's story.
[time=2883] I think he would love to see this happen in your life.
[time=2885] I know he would love nothing more than to see this happen in your life right now.
[time=2888] Here's the point is that at the end of people's lives, your life, my life, at the end of our lives, we're going to look to Jesus.
[time=2896] We're going to be looking for something that goes far beyond all the things we've gotten so caught up in.
[time=2901] You are going to do that.
[time=2903] You may be offended by that statement, but I just believe it because Jesus said at his name, every knee will bow, every tongue will confess that he's Lord, all to his glory.
[time=2913] So we're going to look to him and I've seen it.
[time=2915] Here's the thing, it's scriptural, but it's also practical.
[time=2917] As a pastor, I've seen people in those moments.
[time=2919] I've seen people die without knowing Jesus.
[time=2921] Even those people always look up to God in that last moment.
[time=2925] So here's my challenge to you.
[time=2927] If you're going to look to him at the end of your life, why not get a head start and do it now in the middle?
[time=2932] And my heart breaks for you.
[time=2941] I want you to know that sounds like a harsh question, but it's a real one, isn't it?
[time=2945] It'll change our life, want it?
[time=2947] But I want you to know that I identify with.
[time=2951] I understand and I break with you over that struggle in your journey.
[time=2956] That's where you are right now.
[time=2958] But more than my heart can break for you, Jesus' heart has been broken for you.
[time=2962] His body was broken for you and his blood was spilled out.
[time=2966] And in just a few moments, we're going to partake of communion together.
[time=2969] I wanted to do it at the end of the message because I believe some of you need to take that step of just trusting Jesus, not just with your treasure, with your life, your most treasured asset.
[time=2978] I believe that today is that day for some of you in this place.
[time=2982] And today can be that first communion that you truly get to partake in.
[time=2986] Don't ask you just about your heads for a moment.
[time=2990] Nobody looking around, I just want to give you a moment to reflect and think about what God's doing in your life.
[time=2998] If you're going to look to Jesus at the end of your life, why not start now in the middle?
[time=3003] That day has come for somebody in this room, for several, somebody's in this room.
[time=3007] If you know Jesus today, then I'm guessing God taught you something about what it means to trust
[time=3013] and to be entrusted with all these things that God's given you.
[time=3017] But right now I want to speak to those of you who just say I need to finally put my foot down and say I don't feel ready, but today's the day of salvation Jesus take my life.
[time=3026] I'm not going to lead you in a prayer because your heart is saying that prayer as I speak right now.
[time=3032] But I want you to know that salvation truly is as simple as your heart screaming out to Jesus that you need Him, that you know He died for you.
[time=3042] That you know He's alive, that He rose again after three days.
[time=3047] And you surrender your life, lay it at His feet.
[time=3050] That means, what does that practically look like?
[time=3052] It means you say Jesus, my life's been mine, but now it's yours.
[time=3057] It's really that simple.
[time=3059] And I know some of you are going to shake your internal heads right now and say no way.
[time=3063] It can't be that simple.
[time=3064] If you only knew all the things that are going on in my life, I don't, but He dies.
[time=3071] But He still is calling out to you in your heart and your soul right now.
[time=3074] Would you call out to Him and just ask Him to save you?
[time=3077] And I promise you, based on His word, not mine, that He will do just that.
[time=3082] Will you call out to Him?
[time=3085] Thanks so much for watching today.
[time=3087] I pray you've been blessed as we've kicked off this series, "intrusted." At the heart of "intrusted" is trust.
[time=3093] And so I would challenge you to consider this week, what does it look like to truly trust Jesus with your life?
[time=3098] Whether you've already come to know Him, whether you've already given your life to Him, or maybe today you're one of those that I've talked about where you truly have gotten to this place where God has stirred you.
[time=3107] You've gotten to this place where God has showed you that today is the day of salvation.
[time=3112] And you've learned it's really not all about a prayer, it's really about my heart.
[time=3116] And what a great time of year to just truly lay your life down at the feet of Jesus.
[time=3121] And so if that's you today, I want to give you a moment and just challenge you to take that step, push pause, step outside.
[time=3126] Whatever you've got to do to just simply say, Jesus, I need you.
[time=3130] Today is that day for me. I want to give you my life. I know you died for me.
[time=3134] I know you did that because you paid a price I could never pay for myself.
[time=3138] You live that sinless life that I could never live.
[time=3141] Jesus, I don't just give you some of me today. I give you all of me. Will you save me?
[time=3146] Will you forgive me? I know you died and I know you're alive today.
[time=3149] And the Bible promises us that you shall be saved.
[time=3153] It's not you will be saved if this or if that. It's you shall be saved.
[time=3158] And if that's you today, I want to congratulate you for taking that step.
[time=3162] And we want to walk alongside of you here at Black Hawk Ministries and show you what's next because truly this is not an end that you've experienced today.
[time=3169] This is just the beginning. And I want to tell you about a resource we'd like to get in your hands called Beginning Steps.
[time=3174] It's a growth guide for new believers and this book is just going to walk you through some of the steps that it takes to really continue on this journey of faith.
[time=3182] To truly let this be a beginning point in your life where you've been entrusted with the very grace of God that saves our souls.
[time=3190] And so we would love to mail one of these to you. You're going to see some information on our screens and email address, phone number, website.
[time=3196] We would love to get in touch with you and get one of these in your hands and also just hear from you.
[time=3200] If this ministry has blessed you in any kind of way, we'd love to hear some of your stories, what God's been doing in your life.
[time=3206] We've baptized several here today. Maybe God's prompted you that you need to take that step of baptism that doesn't save you but that propels you into your faith that solidifies and signifies to the world around you all the stuff that God's done inside of you.
[time=3220] If you want to take that step, let us know. Let us walk alongside of you. And I want to personally say thank you for just allowing God to work.
[time=3227] That's why we're here. That's why this ministry exists is so that the name of Jesus could be famous here in our community and all around the world.
[time=3235] I want to say God bless you and thank you so much for your time today. I hope to see you again very soon.
