[time=0] You
[time=30] [MUSIC - 208 seconds]
[time=244] Thank you so much for watching the Bible Hour today. My name is Kevin Rivers. I'm the pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries and I wanted to pause for a moment and just tell you a few things that are going on here at Black Hawk because there's some exciting times here. And one of those key ministries is the Bible Hour. So obviously had an impact on your life. And I want you to know that we are grateful that you're taking some time just to watch with us today. We've had some channel changes and some new opportunities where you can catch us. We're now on my TV channel 21.3 on Sundays at 9.00.
[time=272] And then local Comcast cable access on channel 57 on Wednesdays at 5. And so we're grateful that you're watching. Please spread the word. You can also watch us live on blackhawkministries.org every Sunday at 1030. Or on our Black Hawk Church app. You can look that up in the app stores and we'd love to just continue connecting with you. Christmas time is upon us now. We've got several opportunities that we want to share with you. The Prodigal Christmas is one of those. That's coming up on December the 17th of December.
[time=301] We have two showings here at Black Hawk Ministries, 7400 East State Boulevard here in Fort Wayne. I said 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. The Prodigal Christmas. I'm really excited about what this story is going to be.
[time=313] It's from Luke 15, the Prodigal Son story. You can look that up and see how that might tie to Christmas. And really the goal is to help us really discover why Christmas exists.
[time=323] What Christmas really does look like. What it really doesn't mean to us. The Prodigal people that really need a father who's going to love us.
[time=330] I want to invite you to come and join us and be a part of that. Also, Christmas is on a Sunday this year, December the 25th.
[time=337] And so before that, on December 24th, we have one service on Christmas Eve at 6 p.m.
[time=343] And then on Christmas Day, we have one service at 1030 a.m.
[time=347] And so both of those services, the 24th at 6 p.m., the 25th at 1030 a.m., both of those will be family services.
[time=354] And we want to invite you to come and be a part of those.
[time=357] What is a family service, you might ask. That is where we want you to bring all your kids.
[time=361] We know it's going to be loud, it's going to be fun, it's going to be a different type of service.
[time=365] I'll even be preaching a shorter message that day, but it's going to be an excellent day for you to just come as a family and enjoy the real meaning of Christmas.
[time=373] Again, I just want to say thank you for watching today. I wanted to make you aware of some of the amazing opportunities we have coming up here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=379] Thanks for watching. We'll see you soon.
[time=387] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=427] It's good to see everybody today. Let's get your Bibles out today.
[time=433] I'm excited to continue our series called "Intrusted." Look at 2 Timothy chapter, I'm sorry, 1 Timothy chapter 6 is where we'll be today looking at verse number 18.
[time=443] How's your Thanksgiving? Good Thanksgiving for everybody. Good. Hope you're stuffed and ready to go and grateful because we're going to look at gratefulness a little bit today.
[time=452] So we're in the second week of this series called "Intrusted." The whole point of this series really is this.
[time=458] I'm going to walk us through a couple of quick parts of this and then I've got a very special guest that's going to share some story with you that I know you'll be blessed by.
[time=466] Really, the heart of this series is this statement. It's in your notes there. The heart of being entrusted is, say it with me, trust. Let's say that together.
[time=475] The heart of being entrusted is trust. And so the point of this series is just that, that we as believers have been given so much, starting with salvation through Jesus.
[time=487] And then on top of that, we have all of these blessings and all of these treasures and last week I talked to you about the treasure chest of your life and how we fill that treasure chest with only so much.
[time=498] And we prioritize and Jesus said it best when he said where your treasure is, there your heart is. In other words, what you treasure reveals what you trust.
[time=507] And that's what we looked at last week, but today we're taking that a step further as Paul writes to young Timothy and takes it to this idea of generosity.
[time=516] And so today we're looking at how can I be generous? I don't think anybody in the room would look at me and say, I don't really want to be a generous person.
[time=525] I want to be a generous guy. I want to be a giving person. I want when people think of Kevin Rivers, they think of a guy who was willing to give back.
[time=532] A guy who was willing to make a difference. And I know you share that mentality in one way or another. So how can we truly be generous?
[time=540] So that's what we're going to look at today. So let's say our memory verse together today is Matthew chapter 6 and verse number 21.
[time=547] It's going to be on the screen for you, but I've challenged you to memorize it and I gave you a break because the last one was a little bit longer than this, but this one pretty easy.
[time=555] Are you ready? Matthew 6, 21, for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
[time=562] Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
[time=566] And so today I want to introduce a very special person to you as we look at 1 Timothy chapter 6 today as I think I will introduce him to you this way.
[time=576] He's the most generous guy I have ever known as we look at generosity and he didn't know I was going to say that, but I want to bring my dad up.
[time=585] This is Carlton Rivers and I'll let you welcome him in just a moment, but before you do, I want you to know that, come on up here with me, that this guy has been a demonstration of generosity in my life for quite some time.
[time=600] And I loved that as we go into the series and trusted that he was going to be up here for Thanksgiving with my family and I asked him to share a part of his story that's also a part of my story today that I think will give you a glimpse into how we can truly trust God in ways that sometimes may not even make total sense.
[time=618] And so I wanted to share some of his story, but dad, I want to tell you that I love you and I want to thank you in front of all these people for being a generous guy that is an example. So give him a good welcome.
[time=635] Well, thank you for the privilege of being here. Thank you for taking in my family and loving them and just like your own. And you know what you can kind of be a little more content when you know your children are being cared for and loved. You can kind of let them go a little bit.
[time=649] But Kevin, thank you for this privilege also. And thank you for listening to me just for a few minutes.
[time=654] About 20 years ago, things were really going well in my life. I was in the swimming pool business and the business was growing and prospering. I had just built a mega pool store.
[time=665] And I was only in that building about two years when God just pulled my vision for the business. He pulled my desire for the business.
[time=674] And you that know me, probably the few family members that might watch online know that's not me because I'm one, if I'm in something, I'm in it and I'd love to see it grow.
[time=685] And so I sense God pulling my desire and I said, "Okay, Lord, what's up here? What do you want me to do?" He said, "I want you to leave your business." Now, it was tied to my father's business. He had the construction side of the pool business. I had the retail side.
[time=700] So it was not going to be easy just to me to get out of it because I couldn't up and sell the whole business. So I said, "Okay, Lord, I'll follow you. I'll just go." But where were we headed?
[time=710] You all ever done that? And God said, "I'll tell you that later." I said, "Okay." So I sold the business, what little I could get for it to a couple employees.
[time=721] And I had enough money to make it for a couple of years, actually without working a whole lot. And after five months of praying and waiting on the Lord, I experienced a very unusual phone call which led to a very unusual call to a ministry.
[time=738] Our church was growing at the time, very small church. The church didn't even have a full-time secretary or a part-time secretary. It was done by volunteers.
[time=747] So the church had decided they were going to hire a secretary for 16 hours a week at $8 an hour. And my pastor calls me up. He was stammering around.
[time=757] He said, "I know I'm almost embarrassed to ask you this, but I just feel led to ask you, are you interested in doing this position as a part-time secretary?"
[time=767] Now keep in mind God had not called me into the ministry yet, I thought. And so I began to pray about it. I knew what God wanted me to do, and that was accepted immediately.
[time=778] I knew it, but I did the Christian thing, and I prayed about it. Well listen, there are prayers that will lead to doubt, and that I began to doubt.
[time=787] I said, "Now Lord, you know our financial state. This will work for a while, but we had a very unusual expense, medical expense going on. It had been going on for eight years.
[time=798] I don't know if Kevin shared, but my two oldest children, Kevin and Bethany, were diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome at a very early age of age one and two, two and three right in there.
[time=809] And we were spending out of pocket about $18,000 a year on their treatments driving to North Atlanta every two weeks to get IV gamma globulin, which was controversial. The insurance would not pay it.
[time=825] So I said, "Now Lord, you know we got this expense on top of the normal expenses." And then I said, "Lord, you know now I have run my own business before.
[time=835] I'm sure he called the angels over and said, 'Hey, you can listen to him.'" Yeah, I was questioning, "Lord, now you know I know how to run a business, and you're asking me to be a church secretary."
[time=845] But anyway, I went through that doubt, and during that time, over a day or two, God led me to a passage of Scripture, and it's the story of Captain Naaman in the Bible.
[time=855] In 2 Kings, Naaman had leprosy, but God was bringing a cure to him through a very unusual source through his servant girl.
[time=864] And he got the message from this servant girl, said, "If you go over to see this prophet Elijah, you'll be healed."
[time=870] Well, I want to read kind of this story right quick from 2 Kings, chapter 5, verse 9 through 12.
[time=877] So Naaman came with his horses and his chariots and stood at the doorway of the house of Elisha.
[time=883] And Elisha sent a messenger to him saying, "Go wash in the Jordan," and notice he sent a messenger to talk to Naaman.
[time=890] Naaman had traveled a long way. He said, "Go wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh will be restored to you, and you shall be clean."
[time=898] But Naaman was furious and went away and said, "Behold, I thought he would surely come out to me."
[time=905] Basically, he'd come to me in person and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God, and wave his hand over the place and cure the leper.
[time=913] Or not Abena and far par, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel, could I not wash in them and be clean?
[time=921] So he turned and went away in a rage. Basically, he had a spiritual temper tantrum. That's kind of what I was doing.
[time=929] I was saying, "Lord, don't you know, you see, we have expectations of how God is going to meet our needs, and that's the mistake."
[time=935] Because God usually does things that are totally contrary to human understanding.
[time=941] And I was praying, Proverbs 3, 5, and 6 this whole time, lean not on your own understanding.
[time=946] And I said, "Okay, Lord, I'll quit pitching my temper tantrum, and I'll just do what you said."
[time=952] So call the pastor back, and I said, "I'll be willing to do it for 16 hours a week at $8 an hour."
[time=959] Now, what unfolded next over the next two or three weeks was just amazing.
[time=965] I sensed God now calling me a little deeper to the call to preach, the call to pastor.
[time=972] And what better place to be sitting there a few hours a week with a godly pastor who was a friend of mine, and I could talk this out with.
[time=981] And I thought, "This is just like God." Now it begins to make sense.
[time=984] Why would he call me out of the pool business? Why didn't he just tell me that up front?
[time=988] It would have saved me a lot of worry, a lot of headache, a lot of persecution.
[time=992] I had people that said, "Are you crazy?" Somebody got you over about, "Why would you leave the pool business?" You see, the average person wants to know where we're going when God tells you to take a step of faith.
[time=1003] So I started a seminary.
[time=1006] God used me at the church not just to be a secretary, but I was able to set up the accounting.
[time=1012] There was no software, there was no computers, there wasn't even a fax machine back then.
[time=1017] And so I was able to use my business skills to, of course, set the church up.
[time=1022] And then later they called me to be the associate pastor just a few months later, a few more hours, still part-time.
[time=1029] And I worked there for another year, finances were dwindling down at this time.
[time=1033] And I said, "Okay Lord, these medical bills are still here, and what am I going to do?"
[time=1040] But you know what, God helped me to trust in the small things, He helped me to trust again and again.
[time=1047] Trust is a daily thing.
[time=1049] It's not just a one-time thing.
[time=1051] So I said, "Lord, you're going to take care of us." At, almost to the week, God healed our kids as the finances dropped.
[time=1061] (Applause)
[time=1067] Kevin is a bottom-line person, as I am going to give you three bottom lines.
[time=1072] Okay?
[time=1073] Number one, trust God with a little, it often leads to God trusting you with more.
[time=1079] Had I not trusted God to take this to me seemingly insignificant small job as a secretary,
[time=1088] I don't personally believe God would have called me right then to pastor and preach.
[time=1092] He might have dealt with me later, probably would have, but he would not have called me later.
[time=1097] The second thing was, I exchanged a few things in my life when I began to trust more.
[time=1103] I exchanged worry, discontentment, and doubt with peace, contentment, and trust.
[time=1112] Now, trust built upon trust, and then the third thing, trust led to transformation.
[time=1118] Transformation, for me, is positive action.
[time=1121] I began to think rightly, and God began to change my thinking into right-doing.
[time=1127] Right-believing will always lead to right behavior.
[time=1131] And I began to trust him.
[time=1133] Now, I wasn't worried about what he was going to do.
[time=1135] Well, I was excited.
[time=1137] And Kevin will tell you this story off and on, more probably this happened time and time again
[time=1143] from that 20 years ago where God just did some miraculous things, and it's just exciting.
[time=1148] I don't worry about where he's going to take me.
[time=1150] I'm just excited what he's going to do.
[time=1152] Thank you, Kevin.
[time=1153] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1164] What I'm about to add, and what he didn't get to share with you is that's just the beginning.
[time=1172] This guy got addicted to trusting God, and he's done it ever since.
[time=1177] And he stepped out of pastoring a church where he was very comfortable, where things were
[time=1183] normal, where he had a stable income again, and left that church to go plant a church since
[time=1190] about five years ago, just celebrated five years of a church that he planted.
[time=1196] There was a lot different from that.
[time=1198] And then, yeah, go ahead.
[time=1200] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1205] He won't share all of that, so I will.
[time=1207] So he left when things finally got stable again.
[time=1209] He trusted God so much.
[time=1210] He left that, went and planted a church, and went back into the pool business at that time to earn a living, and has opened that pool business up, and God has blessed that in Georgia.
[time=1219] And so it's kind of neat how things come full circle, but it all goes back to trust.
[time=1224] And I am very, very blessed, and I'm sure you are with one way or another.
[time=1228] Somebody in your life that has demonstrated to you what trust really looks like.
[time=1232] I'm very blessed with that with my family, and I would challenge you with this.
[time=1235] I know that you're here, and you've got some kind of trust journey.
[time=1239] It's the point of today saying that God's calling you out of your business to go into the full-time ministry.
[time=1244] I don't know, it might be.
[time=1245] It might very well not be, but here's what I do know.
[time=1248] I know that God has you on a journey of trust, just like my dad just shared about, just like you talked about last week, likely after we looked at trust and how what we treasure reveals, what we trust.
[time=1259] I know that you're on some kind of trust journey.
[time=1262] And what I want to tell you today is what he just said in your notes.
[time=1265] If you're taking notes, you can do that in the bulletin on your app.
[time=1267] You can get that out.
[time=1268] Look at 1 Timothy 6, but the bottom line of the day is this, that trust leads to transformation.
[time=1276] Trust just changes everything about your life, not just in the story you just heard, but in
[time=1283] your story.
[time=1284] When you learn to trust, it transforms you.
[time=1286] It changes your entire life.
[time=1288] So let's look today.
[time=1289] I want to look at two key understandings from one verse that we're going to look at.
[time=1294] 1 Timothy, chapter 6, verse 18.
[time=1296] We'll look at that.
[time=1297] I'll read that whole passage to you again.
[time=1299] But I want to give you two key understandings that will lead to generosity.
[time=1303] What does it mean to be a generous person?
[time=1305] What does that look like?
[time=1306] Let's look at God's Word.
[time=1307] Who's ready for the Word this morning?
[time=1310] Starting in verse 17.
[time=1311] We're going to be keying in on verse 18 today.
[time=1313] But let's read verses 17 through 21 of 1 Timothy chapter 6.
[time=1318] Paul writes to Timothy and says, "As for the rich in this presentation, by the way, Paul, any rich people in the room?" All right.
[time=1326] Those of you who raised your hand, you remember last week.
[time=1328] Those of you who didn't know what last week was all about, I challenge you to watch it online.
[time=1331] If you don't think you're rich, you might just be mistaken.
[time=1334] Now moving on, charge them.
[time=1336] As for the rich in this present age, charge them not to be haughty nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but on God who richly provides us with everything to enjoy.
[time=1347] Verse 18.
[time=1348] They are to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share.
[time=1357] Thus, storing up treasure for themselves as a good foundation for the future.
[time=1363] Anybody want a good foundation for the future?
[time=1366] And this future is not just your future retirement either.
[time=1369] It goes way beyond your retirement area into the eternal foundation for the future is what we're looking at here.
[time=1375] So that, continuing in verse 19.
[time=1377] So that they may take hold of that which is truly life.
[time=1381] O Timothy, guard the deposit entrusted to you.
[time=1386] Avoid irreverent babble and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge by professing it.
[time=1392] Some have swerved from the faith.
[time=1395] Grace be with you.
[time=1398] And grace, I will tell you, is with you if you know Jesus today.
[time=1402] There is plenty of grace for your life, for your finances, for your children, for your family,
[time=1408] for the troubles of the holidays, for all of those things.
[time=1411] Here's one thing I know, I know we just went through Thanksgiving.
[time=1413] We're going into Christmas.
[time=1414] It's the joyful time of the year that we look forward to.
[time=1416] But it also brings up some of the most stressful things in your life.
[time=1421] I see a lot of nodding.
[time=1422] You didn't want to amen because then you might get some looks.
[time=1425] But I see a lot of nodding because it does.
[time=1427] It brings up seasons of loss.
[time=1430] Maybe someone is not there that once was.
[time=1434] It brings up the stress of buying all the gifts and keeping up with the Jones across the street.
[time=1441] It brings up all these things but here's what I want to tell you.
[time=1444] This Christmas season, this December, this end of November is we're getting out of Thanksgiving weekend right now.
[time=1450] It can be the best one you've ever had and it's not going to be because of finances.
[time=1455] It's not going to be because of those relationships that you wish were better, got better all of a sudden.
[time=1460] It's going to be because you learned how to trust God with all the things He's entrusted to you.
[time=1467] It's going to be because your trust in Him led to transformation in your life.
[time=1471] It changed how you see all the things around you.
[time=1474] And it makes you generous and so I want to give you two thoughts about what it means to be generous.
[time=1478] How can I be a generous person?
[time=1480] The first one is this.
[time=1481] Drop this down if you're taking notes.
[time=1482] Gratitude is the gateway to generosity.
[time=1486] Gratitude, we're just coming out of Thanksgiving.
[time=1489] Being thankful.
[time=1490] Gratitude is the gateway.
[time=1492] It opens the door to you being able to be generous.
[time=1495] I'll submit this to you.
[time=1496] You'll never be a generous person if you're not a grateful person.
[time=1500] It's impossible to be generous if you're not grateful.
[time=1504] If we're not thankful, if we don't realize the treasures that God has placed in our life.
[time=1509] I won't ask for a show of hands, but last week I gave you two pieces of homework.
[time=1512] The first was to make a list.
[time=1514] To spend 15 minutes and make a list of all of your blessings.
[time=1517] And I trust, I say I know that several of you have done that because you shared that with me.
[time=1521] The second thing that I challenged you to do was just be humble.
[time=1524] He said, "Challenge the rich." Paul wrote to Timothy, "Challenge the rich." The rich in this present age not to be hardy.
[time=1531] And so I challenge you just to get on your knees when you pray.
[time=1534] Some of you are not able to do that.
[time=1535] Some of you did that sitting, but there's a kneeling that happens inside of your heart.
[time=1539] And when we're physically able and we take that step, it changes how we pray a little bit, does it not?
[time=1544] And so those were the homework pieces that I gave you with that.
[time=1547] And I give it to you again if you did not take me up on that offer because it's more of an offer than a homework assignment.
[time=1553] I'm offering to you a way that you can truly bring yourself to a place of gratitude that will lead to generosity,
[time=1559] to trust, realizing how blessed you truly are in your life.
[time=1563] He said, "Be rich in good works," in verse 18.
[time=1565] Be rich in good works.
[time=1569] That's a little bit different than be rich in your bank account.
[time=1572] Then be rich with what's under the tree.
[time=1575] Some of you are so caught up today, I believe it because I've been in this cycle many times.
[time=1579] Some of us get so caught up in what's under the tree and what we're able to give.
[time=1583] And we tie our generosity to what we're able to give.
[time=1586] And we put them on the credit cards and we do whatever it takes to fill up under the tree.
[time=1590] And we get so stressed about it.
[time=1592] We can't even enjoy and be grateful for what God's given us because we're so stressed about what we've got to do in January.
[time=1598] You ever notice that January comes after Christmas?
[time=1600] And this funny thing happens, they always send the credit card bill in January.
[time=1605] It always comes and you know it's on its way.
[time=1610] But I want to challenge you that generosity starts with knowing what generosity really is.
[time=1614] And when you know what generosity really is, it makes you grateful.
[time=1618] And when you're grateful, you truly then and only then have the capacity to be generous.
[time=1623] What is generosity then?
[time=1625] One word, I can sum it up, it's Jesus.
[time=1628] It's what the Christmas season is all about as we go into the month of December.
[time=1632] Generosity is Jesus.
[time=1635] He is the picture of generosity.
[time=1638] He gave to us so that we could, through our gratitude, give that out to other people and know what generosity truly looks like.
[time=1645] How do we do that?
[time=1646] Be generous, Paul says.
[time=1647] Be generous and ready to share.
[time=1650] I try to teach our kids to share.
[time=1652] A lot.
[time=1654] Don't need to finish the story.
[time=1658] It's funny how that doesn't come natural to us, does it?
[time=1662] To share.
[time=1663] And little Angel, my little sister, we had our National Orphan Sunday and Angel's adopted.
[time=1669] And she's been a part of our family all of her life actually, even before she was officially adopted.
[time=1673] And she didn't know I was going to do this, but she is one of the most giving ready to share people I've ever met.
[time=1678] It just came natural.
[time=1679] She kind of broke the mold with that.
[time=1681] And Angel, I'm proud of you for that because she just lives, she gets some money.
[time=1686] And instead of going and spending it on herself, which we all do, all the little kids and the big kids.
[time=1694] Can I get an amen?
[time=1695] That's what we do?
[time=1696] You get a little bit and we go spending.
[time=1697] There's nothing wrong with that.
[time=1698] God wants you to enjoy.
[time=1699] That's what we just saw.
[time=1700] The riches.
[time=1701] He wants you to enjoy those things when he blesses you.
[time=1703] But this little girl, every time she gets some money, she always brings a gift to my kids.
[time=1707] Every time.
[time=1708] And it blows my mind.
[time=1710] And it's, I've just watched how her gratitude for life and not just my family, but her love for Jesus.
[time=1719] She's a believer.
[time=1720] She knows Jesus.
[time=1721] She gave her life to him.
[time=1722] I saw her baptized.
[time=1723] And I've watched how I'm just a child.
[time=1726] She's 12 now.
[time=1728] Knows what it looks like to be grateful so much that she just overflows with generosity and pouring it out to other people.
[time=1735] And so Angel, I look up to you in that.
[time=1737] We can all learn a few things from the children.
[time=1739] It makes you kind of understand why Jesus always said, "Let the little kids come to me." That unless you can be like one of these children, you will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=1749] I start to understand that when I look at our life.
[time=1752] And so here's what I tell you.
[time=1753] When it comes to generosity, I believe, a wholeheartedly believe that generosity should characterize the church.
[time=1759] If I could pick one thing, hear me.
[time=1761] This is a big statement.
[time=1762] It may ruffle some feathers, but I'm okay with that.
[time=1764] My feathers get ruffled all the time.
[time=1766] If I could pick one thing that our church and our community could be known for on a practical level.
[time=1771] Obviously, it's the gospel and it's spreading the love of Jesus.
[time=1774] But how?
[time=1775] How do we do that?
[time=1776] I would tell you this.
[time=1777] I would go back to the early church and I would look at what they were known for.
[time=1781] What was the early church known for when it was first established?
[time=1785] I'll tell you this.
[time=1786] It was not known for its theology.
[time=1788] I'm a big believer in having good doctrine and good theology and knowing why I believe what I believe and making sure that we live it out on a daily basis here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=1797] You're an elder team.
[time=1798] My leadership, I can promise you, will always fight for that because the Bible is truth.
[time=1802] And we do believe that.
[time=1803] If you didn't know, we believe God's Word is God's Word and it's true.
[time=1807] And we're to follow it.
[time=1808] But here's the thing.
[time=1810] The early church wasn't really known for its theology.
[time=1813] It was being developed.
[time=1814] It was being learned.
[time=1816] It was being practiced.
[time=1817] It was being written about so that we have the Word of God today.
[time=1821] What were they known for?
[time=1823] They were known for their generosity.
[time=1825] That's what stood out.
[time=1827] And so if I could pick one thing that the church would be known for in our communities and around the world, why do we do gifts that go?
[time=1833] Because I want this church.
[time=1835] We want this church.
[time=1836] God wants his church.
[time=1838] It's not your church.
[time=1840] God wants his church to be known as the most generous group of people known to man.
[time=1845] I would choose that we would be known by how generous we are, not just with our checkbooks, but with our lives.
[time=1853] Now I want us to look at what that means.
[time=1855] Now I think that means that we put that on a very high pedestal.
[time=1859] And you would say, well, churches don't preach on money that often.
[time=1862] Or some of you would say, well, that's all churches preach about some money.
[time=1865] And if you would say that's all churches, all preachers preach about, I would say, I talk about it because Jesus said it best.
[time=1871] That where our treasure is, there your heart will be also.
[time=1875] And Jesus was always about the heart.
[time=1877] Jesus wasn't about money.
[time=1878] Jesus was about your heart.
[time=1879] Here at Black Hawk, we're about your heart.
[time=1881] We're about my heart.
[time=1882] And what we treasure reveals what we trust.
[time=1884] It gives us a picture of our heart when we look at the mirror in terms of our treasures in our life.
[time=1890] It was the trademark of the early church.
[time=1891] And I believe it should be the trademark of today.
[time=1894] They were known for sharing all things.
[time=1896] So write this down to our senior notes there.
[time=1898] If you're taking notes, generosity is perhaps the greatest venue that the church today has to be Jesus to the world.
[time=1907] Think about that for a minute.
[time=1909] Now you would say, well, good, I believe that.
[time=1911] That's why I'm glad Black Hawk, my church does gifts that go.
[time=1914] Now check that off the list.
[time=1916] I'm a generous person now.
[time=1919] No?
[time=1920] Who's the church?
[time=1921] I haven't been here that long, but you're going to hear me say it over and over again.
[time=1924] Who's the church?
[time=1926] Give me a point up because it's his church.
[time=1929] Now do this.
[time=1932] You're the church.
[time=1933] I am the church.
[time=1934] So for the church to be generous, it means all of us doing our part and being generous.
[time=1939] Yes with our finances and yes with our treasures and our resources, but also with our time, with our talents, with what we focus on, with what we treasure, with what we prioritize, with that person that drives you crazy at work.
[time=1952] With those people in the lines for Thanksgiving, trying to get those last minute Thanksgiving things.
[time=1959] With that family member that's going to be at your gathering or they just were.
[time=1963] With how we treat each other, how we love each other, how we give of ourselves and we're generous and ready to share as Paul talks about.
[time=1972] I believe that that should be the reputation of the church and Jesus said it this way.
[time=1976] Look at Luke.
[time=1977] Look there with me.
[time=1978] Luke chapter number six.
[time=1980] Jesus always says it better than me, I found.
[time=1982] So let's let him say it to us.
[time=1984] Luke chapter six, starting in verse 32.
[time=1988] And he's talking here about generosity and while you're flipping there and finding your place, in this time we always think, well generosity makes sense here.
[time=1996] We believe in being generous.
[time=1997] We've seen the church be generous.
[time=1998] We've had people be generous to us.
[time=2000] But in the day and age when Paul would have written this, in the first century, generosity looked a lot different.
[time=2006] Jesus was changing, shifting the entire paradigm of what generosity looked like.
[time=2010] The Latin word liberallatos was what generosity looked like when all of this was written.
[time=2016] When Jesus said what we're fixing to read, when Paul wrote what he wrote to Timothy.
[time=2019] What does that mean?
[time=2020] Liberallatos.
[time=2021] It means a you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours mentality.
[time=2026] Generosity was in that day and age, I'll be generous with you if you'll be generous with me.
[time=2032] I'll be generous to you if I get something in return.
[time=2035] So it's not the story that my dad shared where you've heard me use the phrase.
[time=2039] The answer is yes Lord, now what's the question?
[time=2041] That question was a big part of what brought us here to Black Hawk Ministries in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=2046] Where you give God your yes before you even know what the question is.
[time=2050] I've watched my dad live that.
[time=2051] I've gotten the opportunity to live that.
[time=2053] You have opportunities to live that.
[time=2055] That's when generosity starts to flow though, is when we see generosity the way Jesus was painting it.
[time=2060] Not the way the world says it is where I'll be generous if.
[time=2064] I'll be generous when.
[time=2067] Let me ask the questions first and then I'll be generous.
[time=2070] Jesus wanted to change that entire mentality.
[time=2073] Luke chapter 6 starting in verse 32 will read through verse 36.
[time=2077] Jesus said, "If you love those who love you what benefit is that to you?
[time=2080] For even sinners love those who love them and if you do good to those who do good to you what benefit is that to you?
[time=2087] For even sinners do the same." Verse 34.
[time=2089] And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive what credit is that to you?
[time=2094] Even sinners lend to sinners and get back the same amount.
[time=2098] But love your enemies.
[time=2100] Here's the paradigm shift for all of us.
[time=2102] Love your enemies and do good and lend expecting nothing in return.
[time=2110] And your reward will be great.
[time=2113] And you will be sons of the most high for he is kind to the ungrateful and the evil.
[time=2121] Be merciful even as your father is merciful.
[time=2126] You want to know how to be a generous person.
[time=2128] Look at Jesus.
[time=2129] Look at what he had to say about generosity.
[time=2132] He changed everything.
[time=2133] It's not about you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.
[time=2136] I remember my mom used to have a back scratcher.
[time=2139] I remember I had one of those.
[time=2146] I was going to scratch my own back.
[time=2149] Jesus is saying throw away the back scratcher.
[time=2152] Throw away the back scratching mentality and go scratch backs.
[time=2156] If you're a zitchen, let it itch.
[time=2159] It doesn't matter.
[time=2161] Give the way God has given to you.
[time=2163] Be merciful the way that God has been merciful to you.
[time=2167] And I don't know about you, but I found a lot of mercy.
[time=2170] A lot of grace and a lot of generosity in the way God has treated me.
[time=2174] I want to give that out.
[time=2177] Acts 4.
[time=2179] You don't have to turn their jot this down though.
[time=2180] Acts 4 verse 32 says this.
[time=2182] This is that early church.
[time=2183] What were they characterized by?
[time=2184] Wasn't there theology?
[time=2185] It wasn't their big buildings.
[time=2187] It wasn't their this.
[time=2189] It was their generosity.
[time=2190] It was their mentality about how to be generous and how to love those around them.
[time=2193] It says verse 32 all the believers were in one heart and mind.
[time=2197] That's unity.
[time=2198] They were together in one heart and mind.
[time=2200] No one claimed that any of their possessions were their own.
[time=2206] But they shared everything they had.
[time=2211] Now it all starts with gratefulness being thankful.
[time=2214] Write this down if you're taking notes.
[time=2215] When we're thankful, we become thoughtful.
[time=2223] And I was thinking this week about some times in my life where I became thankful.
[time=2228] And what made me the most thankful that led to some of the most thoughtful seasons of my life.
[time=2232] And I thought back it was appropriate with my father being here with me.
[time=2235] We got to go to South Africa on a mission trip together back in 2011 or 12.
[time=2240] We went to South Africa and got to do a lot of great.
[time=2243] They don't want to show you a couple of those pictures.
[time=2245] The first one is a picture of a playground.
[time=2247] This was us.
[time=2249] And there's a playground that a member of our church had a business doing that.
[time=2252] And they installed that for the local kids there.
[time=2254] They had essentially nothing.
[time=2256] And so that's the two of us there for that.
[time=2258] I'll show you another picture of my dad sharing the gospel.
[time=2260] This is one of the schools there.
[time=2262] We got to see how these kids live.
[time=2264] We got to go to their world.
[time=2266] And this was my dad sharing the gospel to hundreds and hundreds of kids.
[time=2271] A beautiful picture.
[time=2272] A beautiful, awesome, amazing experience of spreading the gospel around the world with my father.
[time=2278] But here's what really led me to becoming more of a thankful person.
[time=2282] This picture of an orphanage in a daycare.
[time=2285] And you can't really tell here, but I've saved this picture.
[time=2289] I've kept it with me.
[time=2290] I've looked at it often because we got to go to a little orphanage/daycare where the kids would spend their entire day.
[time=2298] And this was the only meal they would have for the whole days because they were here.
[time=2302] And what you don't see is there were rats in the corners running around.
[time=2307] There were bugs in the porridge stuff, mush.
[time=2310] I don't even know what you would call it.
[time=2314] And I'll remember this.
[time=2315] And I don't do this to make you feel guilty for having a good lunch today.
[time=2318] That's not my heart.
[time=2320] I want to show you this because I know in my heart that this changed everything about who I am.
[time=2326] Because I came back knowing that not only had God blessed me immensely with finances and with the ability to have good meal and the ability to have a play, a roof over my head.
[time=2336] The ability to have a family that loves me and cares for me and set an example for me.
[time=2340] But I was reminded how much God loved those babies.
[time=2344] And I want you to know we at Black Hawk Ministries are and will always be all about the phrase,
[time=2350] the statement that red, yellow, black, and white, they're all precious in his sight.
[time=2354] And that is why we do things like gifts that go.
[time=2357] That is why we will not allow us to turn inward and just get comfortable.
[time=2361] That is why I made a commitment to God so many years ago that any time anybody's crazy enough
[time=2367] to give me a microphone, I would make sure the gospel is clear and that people had a chance to respond to it
[time=2373] and that no matter what, we would always be outward focused.
[time=2379] Because when we're thankful, we become thoughtful.
[time=2383] When we express our gratitude to a God who gave everything to us, we become a generous picture of the generosity of Jesus to those around us.
[time=2395] Our gratitude is what leads us to that generosity.
[time=2398] The second thing I want to tell you is this, that percentage is the pathway to progress.
[time=2404] I'm saying it this way because I want those words that rhyme and stick together to ring in your ears this week.
[time=2410] Let's talk about percentage.
[time=2412] The percentage is the pathway to progress.
[time=2414] Jessica and I, I get the question a lot as a pastor, tell me why I'm supposed to tithe.
[time=2420] Where did the tithe come from? The 10%.
[time=2423] And why do we ask that question so much?
[time=2426] Because 10% feels like a lot of money, if we're honest, doesn't it?
[time=2429] And it is in Scripture and I get the question, well, in that an Old Testament principle, yes.
[time=2434] So good.
[time=2435] That's all I needed to know, pastor, and then I always say, but hold on.
[time=2439] If you want to dismiss it because it's an Old Testament and you're in the New Testament Church, because I'm not saying that's where you're going, it's not where you're going, for sure.
[time=2447] But if it were where you're going with that, then we would be looking at things through the lens of the Jesus kind of generosity.
[time=2455] The early church kind of generosity, Acts 4 verse 32, they didn't count any of their possessions as their own,
[time=2461] but they shared everything they had.
[time=2463] And so, you know, a lot of people stick with the Old Testament 10% because that's a whole lot less than 100.
[time=2471] Are you up here pastor arguing that I need to be given 10% of my income?
[time=2475] That I need to be given 100% of my income?
[time=2478] Yeah?
[time=2481] Yeah.
[time=2482] I'm arguing that we should always know that every good and perfect gift comes from above, that everything we have, everything you have and that I have is not yours and it's not mine.
[time=2492] It's all his anyway.
[time=2494] All God wants from us and so here's what I would challenge to you.
[time=2497] If you're getting caught up in the numbers of 10%, throw the 10% to the side.
[time=2501] Let me say pastors are not supposed to say that.
[time=2503] Well, here's what I know.
[time=2505] I know that if you'll pick a percentage and start with it, God's going to bless.
[time=2511] He's going to make you more grateful and as you become more grateful, you'll become more generous.
[time=2516] And that's why we're not all about the numbers and the money here at Black Call.
[time=2520] Yes, we need money, but money is not something that we worry about.
[time=2524] Why?
[time=2525] Because God provides for his church because Jesus gave us a promise when it came to his church.
[time=2529] He said, "I will build my church." And I'm just guessing if Jesus is going to build it, your money and my money is not going to get in the way.
[time=2537] He's going to build his church.
[time=2539] He said, "I will build my church and even the gates of hell won't prevail against it." Now, Jessica and I, we were very blessed.
[time=2546] Some of you are in this boat.
[time=2548] So I want to speak to all of us when it comes to our giving with the money stuff here in the church.
[time=2553] Jessica and I were blessed with a great example and I had a bank growing up that had the little slots for my coins.
[time=2559] It had the spending one, the saving one and the church.
[time=2562] When I had a little church house and every time I'd get a dollar, I'd get ten dimes and I'd put one.
[time=2567] Every time, it was just a habit.
[time=2569] And Jessica and I, since we got married over ten years ago, made a commitment to God that no matter what, we would always give at least ten percent of anything that we got.
[time=2577] And people asked, "Well, do you do that on your gross or your net?"
[time=2583] I love my favorite answer to that came from another mentor of mine, Dr. Bill Purvis, I think was the first I ever heard to say this.
[time=2590] He said, "Well, do you want to be blessed on your net or on your gross?"
[time=2596] But Jessica and I made that commitment a long time ago, and I don't say this boastfully.
[time=2600] I say this with all humility, but I want you to know we work hard to practice what we preach, and it's hard to practice what we preach with this, but we have never missed a tithe.
[time=2609] We've always given ten percent.
[time=2611] We give more than ten percent now because I've learned what it means to be grateful so that we become generous.
[time=2618] And so here's what I would say to you.
[time=2619] Here's what I'd say to you.
[time=2620] It's not about the number.
[time=2622] Pick a percentage and go with it.
[time=2625] Jesus said it this way.
[time=2626] Look at Mark, Mark chapter 12, the widow's offering.
[time=2630] We often call this the widow's might, that word might doesn't come in actually until the King James version, believe it or not, but we're going to look at exactly what that might really look like.
[time=2639] So let's look at Mark chapter 12.
[time=2641] You can just listen to it or read along with me.
[time=2643] Mark 12, 41, 344.
[time=2646] And he sat down talking of Jesus here.
[time=2648] He sat down opposite the treasury and watched people putting money in the offering box.
[time=2653] Now think about that.
[time=2654] That's kind of a weird.
[time=2655] We skip over that a lot because we get to what Jesus said, but here's Jesus.
[time=2659] In the temple.
[time=2661] He just sat there with the disciples following him and he just watched people given their offering.
[time=2667] Some of you did that earlier too, right?
[time=2669] You were like, they didn't put any in.
[time=2672] They did.
[time=2673] So Jesus was sitting there and he was watching people bring offerings.
[time=2677] And so I just want you to picture that.
[time=2679] And you know the disciples probably got up and sat down and went.
[time=2682] You ever sat with somebody that way?
[time=2687] You know what I'm talking about, don't you?
[time=2688] Or you just sit there and it's like, oh my gosh, what am I doing?
[time=2691] Why do I associate with this person?
[time=2692] You know they felt that way.
[time=2693] Here's what happened.
[time=2694] As he sat there, many people put in large sums, verse 42.
[time=2698] And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which make a penny.
[time=2704] Which make a penny.
[time=2706] And we'll look at what that actually meant for their day and time in just a moment.
[time=2709] Verse 43.
[time=2710] And he called his disciples to him and said, truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all who are contributing to the offering box.
[time=2719] For they all contributed out of their abundance.
[time=2722] But she, out of her poverty, has put in everything she had, all she had to live on.
[time=2730] Now that wage, that amount, those two small copper coins really equated to what would
[time=2736] be about six minutes.
[time=2738] Six minutes, think about this, six minutes of a day's earnings.
[time=2742] Six minutes of work, hours, work time in the day.
[time=2746] Because what you're looking at here is 1/128th of a denarius.
[time=2751] It's about one day's wage.
[time=2753] And so that would equate, those two small copper coins would equate to about six minutes of work time.
[time=2758] It was nothing.
[time=2760] In terms of the offering, it meant nothing.
[time=2763] It didn't impact the offering of the day.
[time=2765] Yet Jesus said she gave more than everyone.
[time=2769] Why?
[time=2770] I want to return to a statement I gave you last week.
[time=2772] It'll be on the screen.
[time=2773] It's this statement that it's not what you have.
[time=2775] It's what you do with what you have.
[time=2778] It's not what you have.
[time=2780] It's what you do with what you have.
[time=2782] And that's why I say percentage is the pathway to progress.
[time=2786] Pick a percent.
[time=2787] If it's not 10%, it's okay.
[time=2789] God's not going to come down from heaven.
[time=2791] God's going to bless you for being generous.
[time=2793] He already did come down from heaven.
[time=2795] And he already did bless you.
[time=2797] With generosity, whether you've been generous or not.
[time=2802] I want to be the kind of person that Jesus talks about here.
[time=2805] And Jesus says really to you and me today, I'm not impressed with the zeros on your checks.
[time=2811] I'm impressed with the percentage in your heart.
[time=2815] With what you're willing to give up.
[time=2816] With what you're willing to be the church to the world.
[time=2820] How much you're truly willing to be me to that person across the street.
[time=2824] How much you're truly willing to step out on faith.
[time=2827] Whatever that may mean for you today.
[time=2829] And you know what that looks like.
[time=2830] You have your own journey of trust.
[time=2832] But I've learned that when I give first, I save better and I spend less.
[time=2837] That's a pretty good combination on a practical level today.
[time=2841] And so I would challenge you with this.
[time=2843] I gave you a variation of this question last week.
[time=2845] But I would ask you, why trust the gifts when I know the giver?
[time=2850] Why would I trust in the provision when I know the provider?
[time=2853] And as Christmas comes around, I say it to you that way today.
[time=2856] Why would I trust in the gifts, the resources when I know the giver of all things?
[time=2861] Now I want to challenge you to do something this week.
[time=2863] I want to ask you just to lay your hands on your lap and set your notes down.
[time=2867] Be a little weird.
[time=2868] I want to ask anybody this willing just to do this with me.
[time=2871] Palm up.
[time=2874] I want to teach you a little trick.
[time=2876] When I'm dealing with somebody that drives me crazy.
[time=2881] Somebody that frustrates me.
[time=2884] I'll sit with my palms up in my lap.
[time=2887] So most of the time it's under the table because they would say, what are you doing?
[time=2890] Are you getting ready to...
[time=2892] This is not getting ready for a backhand.
[time=2895] But I sit because I want to do a couple of things.
[time=2899] I want to receive from God what he's trying to do in that situation, in that moment.
[time=2905] I want to stay open to him to receive his instruction for how I can be Jesus in whatever situation I may be in.
[time=2913] And then I think it symbolizes an open handedness and open arms approach to the people around me.
[time=2920] Because I want to receive people the way...
[time=2922] I want to be merciful.
[time=2923] Jesus said, verse 36 of Luke chapter 6, "Be merciful just as your father is merciful." I want to be merciful.
[time=2928] I want to receive people the way he receives me.
[time=2932] And so with that said, I want to ask you just to close your eyes and if you'll join me, keep your hands in your lap, keep them open to receive what God wants to say to you in this moment.
[time=2941] But I want to tell you this, when God's people learn to be generous with their heart, with their life, the church starts to become known for what we're for, not just what we're against.
[time=2952] The church will start to look like that open handed, open arms kind of a place that Jesus envisioned
[time=2958] when he said, "I'll build my church and the gates of hell won't prevail against it." And so with our hands open and our arms spread wide open, let's receive the world around us with generosity.
[time=2971] Being a picture of Jesus and what he wants to do in our life, then we'll become known for what we're for, not what we're against.
[time=2976] In a world today, the church often becomes known for what we're against.
[time=2979] Jesus said, "I want you to show the world through your generosity that you are for me,
[time=2985] and that when I am for you, which I am, which is why I died for you,
[time=2991] it will change everything about your life.
[time=2993] Truth will lead to transformation." So nobody looking around, all eyes closed, I want to ask you if you know Jesus today, what step of generosity, what step of generosity has God asked you to take this week today?
[time=3008] Am I saying it's another offering?
[time=3010] No, we're not taking up another offering.
[time=3013] We've already done that.
[time=3015] That step of generosity could be making a phone call today when you leave.
[time=3019] Going by somebody's house that you know you need to go reconcile with,
[time=3025] calling that relative that you haven't talked to that maybe you had it out with at Thanksgiving.
[time=3031] It may be just going and giving two or three dollars to somebody you know that needs it.
[time=3036] Challenge you to take that step.
[time=3038] What step of generosity has God called you to?
[time=3041] If you don't know Jesus today, I want to challenge you with the most important step of generosity you could ever take.
[time=3048] And you know what, the beautiful thing about salvation, when I say step of generosity, you're not even being asked to be generous.
[time=3055] When it comes to salvation, all you're asked to do is receive the generosity of God.
[time=3061] Because here's the thing, you're right, you're right.
[time=3065] I know some of the things that go through your head, I would accept Jesus if.
[time=3070] When I get this straightened out or figured out in my life, then I'll give my life to him, I'll truly trust him.
[time=3077] If, when, but, I want to tell you, you're right.
[time=3082] You don't have what it takes to receive the generosity of God through his son Jesus.
[time=3088] You don't.
[time=3089] That's why scripture promises and tells us and proclaims over and over that salvation is by grace through fate,
[time=3097] not of works, lest any of us could boast.
[time=3100] What does that mean?
[time=3101] If I could achieve it, then I could boast about it.
[time=3104] And here's what I want you to know.
[time=3105] You're right.
[time=3106] You can't attain salvation, but our generous God provides it to you freely by grace through fate.
[time=3114] And it comes back to that one word in the middle of entrusted.
[time=3117] It comes back to that one little word called trust.
[time=3121] Will you trust him to save you in a way that you could never save yourself?
[time=3126] That's you today.
[time=3127] I believe your heart's screaming a prayer to God and you don't know that you've been saved.
[time=3130] You don't know you've trusted your life into his hands.
[time=3132] I believe today is that day and you can scream it out from your heart.
[time=3136] You can say it out loud.
[time=3137] You can say it silently because God knows your heart.
[time=3139] Salvation is a heart issue.
[time=3141] And I want to challenge you to lay your heart down before Jesus.
[time=3144] Something like saying, Jesus, I need you.
[time=3146] I know you died for me.
[time=3148] I know you're alive and I trust you to save me.
[time=3151] I'm not trusting me anymore.
[time=3153] I'm trusting you.
[time=3154] I'm yours.
[time=3155] Save me and forgive me.
[time=3157] We do that right now.
[time=3162] [MUSIC - 285 seconds]
[time=3456] [APPLAUSE]
[time=3458] Thanks so much for watching today.
[time=3459] I pray that today's message about what it means to be entrusted and how we can learn to trust God with all that He has entrusted to us.
[time=3467] I hope it's been a blessing to you.
[time=3469] And today God may have been stirring inside of you, something new.
[time=3472] As we've looked at what it means to be entrusted, the most important thing that we could be entrusted with is salvation, the grace of God as we've talked about today.
[time=3482] Trust leads to transformation.
[time=3484] And what that really means for you and for me is that when we come to know Jesus, it changes everything.
[time=3491] And if God's changed your heart, if you've given your life to Jesus today, or if you're contemplating that, I want to challenge you, take that leap of faith.
[time=3498] Don't stand on the edge anymore wondering why you can't do it, wondering what's going to hold you back, wondering if it's going to really matter, if it's really going to work, and just trust the promises of God today.
[time=3508] That would be my challenges to you.
[time=3510] And so we've got a booklet that we'd like to get in your hands.
[time=3513] If you're taking those steps, or if you're contemplating taking that step in your life today, it's called beginning steps.
[time=3519] Because here's what I'd like to challenge you with.
[time=3521] When you trust God with your life, it's not an end.
[time=3524] It's a beginning.
[time=3525] It's the beginning steps into a new life that he wants to create in you.
[time=3529] And here at Black Hawk Ministries, we'd love to get one of these in your hands just so we can walk alongside of you, so that we can support you, so that we can give you resources, and we can do this thing called life together.
[time=3539] And so thank you for watching and giving us that opportunity.
[time=3542] Maybe you've got questions about the Bible hour.
[time=3544] Maybe you've got questions about what it means to trust Jesus, or to be baptized, or to get connected here at Black Hawk Ministries, and we would love nothing more than to hear from you.
[time=3554] We've got some information that's going to be on your screen.
[time=3556] We've got an email address, a phone number, and then our website as well, so you can get in touch with us, and we can walk alongside with you in all the days ahead.
