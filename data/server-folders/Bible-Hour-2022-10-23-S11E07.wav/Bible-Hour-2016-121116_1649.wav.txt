[time=482] [MUSIC]
[time=503] Thank you so much for watching today.
[time=505] I pray that you've already been blessed, but before we move into today's message and look at what it means to be entrusted, I wanted to just say thank you from the Bible hour and our whole team just for allowing us to have just a little slot in your life each week.
[time=518] And so I want to tell you a little bit about the Bible hour.
[time=521] We've got a new channel, our TV and broadcast now looks a little bit different.
[time=525] You can watch us every week, Sundays at 9am on my TV channel number 21.3.
[time=532] Or on local Comcast cable, the access channel is 57 and that is on Wednesdays at 5pm.
[time=539] And so those are our new landing spots.
[time=541] You can also find us on Facebook.
[time=543] The Bible hour, you can search that on Facebook and we stream live our services every Sunday at 1030am.
[time=550] Or you can go to our church website, blackhawkministries.org and you can stream us live there.
[time=555] So I want to make sure you're aware of all the different ways that you can continue staying connected to our ministry.
[time=560] Now I want to tell you about a couple of things coming up for Christmas.
[time=563] The Prodigal Christmas is one of those things that I am really excited about.
[time=567] So this is going to be a place, going to be a musical that's set even to the 1920s.
[time=572] Without giving too much of it away, I'll tell you that it's set to the Luke 15 Prodigal Son story
[time=578] where the Prodigal Son took his inheritance, went and just spent it all and had to come back home begging for forgiveness, begging for love, begging for healing.
[time=588] And you know it ties to our life, even with Christmas.
[time=591] It's a unique tie to the Christmas season because if we're honest, we all have a little bit of the Prodigal Son in us.
[time=598] And so this play, this musical is going to tie the Prodigal Son story to the Christmas story.
[time=603] And so you can join us here at Black Hawk Ministries on December the 17th.
[time=607] That's a Saturday, there are two showings, and that is 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.
[time=612] And you can get free tickets to that by going to theprodigalChristmas.com.
[time=616] And then also we have two Christmas services at Black Hawk Ministries, the first of which will be on Christmas Eve.
[time=623] Christmas Eve December the 24th at 6 p.m. here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=628] And then on Christmas Day is our second service December the 25th at 10.30 a.m.
[time=633] Now that day we won't have our 9 o'clock hour, we will just have the 10.30 service here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=640] Now the thing you need to know about both of these services on December 24th and December 25th is that both are family services.
[time=647] That means they're going to look a little different.
[time=649] That means I'm going to have to preach a shorter sermon because all of our kids are going to be in the building together.
[time=654] To be loud, it's going to be fun, we're going to have a blast as we celebrate the true meaning of Christmas,
[time=660] the arrival, the birth of our Savior.
[time=663] So I want to invite you personally to come and be a part of these amazing services as we do just that here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=669] Thanks again for watching. I pray you've been blessed, and I hope to see you again very soon.
[time=674] [MUSIC - 244 seconds]
[time=927] - Hi, I'm Tate, and I'm gonna tell you a little bit about how we came to tithe.
[time=933] We would give not very much, it wasn't hard, it wasn't trusting God.
[time=938] And talking with Jim Kimball, he really challenged me to give 10% off the top.
[time=946] And me and my wife talked, and a couple of weeks passed, and we didn't do it, and finally, we just felt convicted to do the whole 10% off the top.
[time=955] And we started doing that, and the blessings that come from friends and family, and just how bills are easier to pay.
[time=963] There's money to pay.
[time=964] There's money just there.
[time=969] I can explain it because I know where it's coming from.
[time=972] And then we had a really cool thing happen to us.
[time=976] My wife had knee surgery, and she came to me and said, Tate, I don't think we can pay our bills, we're gonna have to tithe less.
[time=984] And I immediately didn't want to, and we sat down and we talked about it, and we wrestled with it, prayed about it.
[time=990] And finally, we came to the conclusion that we will just tithe and trust God.
[time=995] And after that Sunday of giving, my wife got a $200 bonus check.
[time=1001] We tithe for to obey God, what he tells us to do.
[time=1006] And the blessings are a bonus of that.
[time=1010] We get blessings from our friends and our family.
[time=1013] Money is just there to pay bills.
[time=1016] I can't explain it.
[time=1018] I can't explain it because I believe in God, and I know that's where it's coming from.
[time=1022] But it's a joy to give now.
[time=1025] It's not just a thing we do.
[time=1027] It's a pure joy, and actually my wife and I fight about who gets to put it in that month.
[time=1049] [MUSIC - 333 seconds]
[time=1385] - We're excited to continue our series and just simply called "Intrested." And at the heart of being entrusted, this is the foundation of the series.
[time=1393] At the heart of being entrusted is, say it with me, trust.
[time=1398] At the heart of being entrusted is trust.
[time=1403] It's got to be something that we trust God with.
[time=1406] What is it, everything, all the stuff that he has entrusted to us?
[time=1410] We're gonna be in 1 Timothy, chapter 6.
[time=1412] If you've got your Bibles, you can get your apps out.
[time=1414] Black Hawk Church app, if you don't have that, it's a great way to follow along with us.
[time=1418] It has our notes there.
[time=1419] We have sermon notes in the bulletins that you got when you came in, where you just join in.
[time=1423] However, you so choose today.
[time=1425] And so I wanna thank those watching us online or TV.
[time=1428] And then all of us here together, no matter where you may be, no matter what life looks like for you, I challenge you today to let God speak into your heart, because here's the thing.
[time=1438] He has entrusted you with much.
[time=1441] The scripture reminds us that when God entrusts a lot too, as he expects a lot from us.
[time=1447] Now, what does that look like?
[time=1448] Does God want something from us?
[time=1449] No, he wants something for you today.
[time=1452] If you heard anything I just said about the intro to this series, it's here that God has something for you today.
[time=1459] And even in a world where we see the church, we see giving, we see what it looks like to be entrusted in all of these different ways with so many different perspectives.
[time=1469] One thing can unite us, and his name is Jesus, and when we truly understand Jesus, who he is, we see ourselves differently.
[time=1477] When we look at ourselves differently in the mirror, then we look at the world around us, and every single thing in life changes.
[time=1484] Trust changes everything, because Jesus changes it all.
[time=1489] Our series theme verse, hopefully you've been memorizing that.
[time=1492] It's Matthew chapter 6 and verse 21.
[time=1494] It'll be on the screen, it's in your bulletin for you as well.
[time=1496] I challenge you just to memorize this, put it in your memory banks.
[time=1499] Jesus said it, and it goes something like this.
[time=1501] Say it with me if you know it.
[time=1502] For where your treasure is, there your heart will be awesome.
[time=1506] We said it this way in the beginning of the series.
[time=1509] What you treasure reveals what you trust.
[time=1512] I had the treasure chest, and we can only fit so much in it.
[time=1515] But what we treasure, what we prioritize, it reveals where our trust truly lies.
[time=1519] It reveals where our priorities are.
[time=1521] And then last week we looked at how trust leads to transformation.
[time=1524] When we just trust God with everything, it changes everything inside of us.
[time=1528] But today, I want us to look at particularly verse 19 of 1 Timothy chapter 6.
[time=1533] In verse 19, it has this phrase that has just jumped out at me.
[time=1538] And the phrase is about what it means to truly live.
[time=1542] To take hold of that, which is true life.
[time=1546] True living.
[time=1548] So today we're going to answer the question, how can I truly live?
[time=1552] Has this ever been the phrase of a season in your life where you would just simply say, I wish I could just get some more out of life.
[time=1560] I wish I could just get more out of life.
[time=1563] I just wish life looked a little bit more like what I thought it would look like.
[time=1568] I wish that life would be a little bit more meaningful.
[time=1571] I could have a bigger impact in life.
[time=1574] And so here's what I'll tell you.
[time=1575] In the Christian faith, we've looked at the early church in the series quite a bit.
[time=1578] And I told you that the hallmark, the defining characteristic of the early church was what?
[time=1584] You didn't notice the quiz on Sunday morning, did you?
[time=1589] Surprise.
[time=1590] It's generosity.
[time=1591] I heard it a couple of times.
[time=1593] I'm just messing with it.
[time=1594] It's generosity.
[time=1595] It wasn't even their theology.
[time=1596] It was all being formulated at the time.
[time=1598] It was how giving they truly were.
[time=1601] They were entrusted with little, in fact.
[time=1603] If you look at the early church and where they were coming from, but they counted everything as common property.
[time=1609] And here's the thing.
[time=1610] If you keep reading in the book of Acts, I think it's chapter four.
[time=1612] You'll find that not only did they give of everything, they were ready to share.
[time=1616] And we're going to read that even in Paul's words of Timothy.
[time=1619] But because of that, there were no needs among them.
[time=1622] I was reminded of that even last week as we do that.
[time=1625] I'm not going to preach that passage, I promise, because we've got this one.
[time=1627] We'll save that for another sermon.
[time=1629] But the reason, why is it then that the early church, that Christianity is known as the most
[time=1635] generous faith?
[time=1636] Because it is.
[time=1637] If you look around, even from the early church days, it's one of those hallmarks.
[time=1640] It doesn't mean every believer is known as being generous.
[time=1644] And one of the things that stands out is in Christianity is this idea of generosity that
[time=1650] no other faith system really offers because of how Jesus defined it.
[time=1655] And Paul, in this passage, in verse 19 particularly, here's the thing, all eyes for a minute.
[time=1661] This is a secret to truly life, truly living, true life today.
[time=1664] Are you ready?
[time=1665] Paul is going to give it to us.
[time=1666] It's all in one passage.
[time=1668] Why is it that the Christian faith is so clearly defined by generosity?
[time=1672] Why is it that no other faith system offers the world through generosity, what Christianity
[time=1678] offers?
[time=1679] Paul answers that all in one question, and it's not quite as complex or is it, then maybe we think it is.
[time=1685] A lot of times, if you're like me, you make things that God made so simple, so complicated
[time=1691] and complex.
[time=1693] Paul does an excellent job in 1 Timothy 6, our passage for this four week series here, of just clearly defining, very simply put, showing us what it means to truly live.
[time=1707] And so here's the thing, in the world around us, and Paul starts, by the way, as for the rich in this present age, that's how the passage starts, we'll read it here in just a moment.
[time=1715] But as for the rich in this present age, and who's rich, any rich people in the room?
[time=1720] More hands this week than last week, I'm impressed.
[time=1722] We're all richer than we think at times when we look at the world around us, we've looked at that in the series, if you've missed any of that, you can go back on our website and catch up, and you might find that you're richer than you thought to.
[time=1732] But as for the rich in this present age, command them to, and then we move forward, here's what you may or may not know, 97% of people in the United States, think about this, 97%
[time=1744] of people in the United States believe that there is something beyond this life.
[time=1750] That's kind of a surprising statistic to me, but in the surveys, it doesn't mean I believe
[time=1757] that there's a heaven and a hell, and it's literal, it doesn't mean that it looks this way or that way, but I believe there's something beyond this life.
[time=1763] And I think that screams, hear me, I think that screams to the need that we all have
[time=1769] inside of us to know that this life just isn't it.
[time=1773] You're here today, I know, because you're at least searching out that thought, pondering
[time=1779] that question of what is there after this life?
[time=1782] Is there more to life than what I experience right now?
[time=1786] And some days you would join me in saying, "I sure hope so." And I want to tell you Paul's really talking about just that in this passage.
[time=1795] Let me give you the bottom line today, and the bottom line is this, "True life begins when I realize this life is not it." True life begins here in this life when I realize that this life is not it.
[time=1809] Let me put it a different way, it's not in your notes, but maybe you drop this down, this will resonate with you.
[time=1813] I would say to truly live in this life, we must live in light of the next.
[time=1820] To truly live in this life, we must learn what it means to live in light of what's next,
[time=1826] in light of the next life, 97% of the people in the United States believe there's got to be something left over, there's got to be something afterwards.
[time=1834] And so here's the thing, what Paul's arguing, and just so you know, this is his secret sauce in this passage, and it's the secret to true life that I want to share with you today based on the authority of God's word, that if we want to know how to truly live this life, we've got to live in light of eternity, we've got to live with eternity in mind.
[time=1851] So that's the question I want us to look at, it's simply this, "How can I live in light of eternity?
[time=1856] Is it possible?
[time=1857] What does it look like?
[time=1858] How can I take a step to begin on that journey?" That's what we're going to look at.
[time=1862] I want to give you two things from just simply verse 19, but before we do that, I want us to read the entire passage.
[time=1868] First Timothy chapter 6, we'll read verses 17 through 21.
[time=1872] Anybody ready for God's word this morning?
[time=1875] I love the Bible, in case you can't tell.
[time=1878] It just answers so many questions, and I used to question them, maybe you're here, I just feel like I should say this, maybe you're here and you say, "Yeah, I just don't totally believe the Bible like you do, pastor." Well, you know what, you might be surprised to know that I used to struggle to believe it like I do right now too, and you want to know how I came to the conclusions that I've come to now, that this is God's word to me, and it's infallible, and it's true in everything
[time=1902] that it affirms, because I asked God to show me.
[time=1905] Really, that was the secret sauce for me to get to this place, as I said, "God, if all this is true," and I grew up, I was the PK, I grew up, and I knew all the right answers,
[time=1916] but sometimes I didn't know all the right answers, so maybe that's you, and I just feel like I should tell you in this moment, ask God to show you because He promises you, if you draw near to Him, He will draw near to you.
[time=1929] He promises you, "Seek me, and you will find me." Why?
[time=1935] Because He loves you, and it applies to you just as much as it does the person sitting next to you, to me, or anybody else in your life.
[time=1942] No extra charge for that today, now let's look at the passage, we'll side note for you.
[time=1946] First Timothy chapter 6 verse 17, "As for the rich in the present age, in this present age, charge them not to be haughty, nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches
[time=1957] but on God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy." In case you didn't know, God wants you to enjoy life and enjoy what He's given you, He does.
[time=1967] It's proven right there.
[time=1968] Verse 18, what we looked at last week.
[time=1969] They are, if you're rich, if you're in that category, they are to do good, to be rich
[time=1975] in good works, to be generous and ready to share.
[time=1978] Verse 19, our focus for the day, when you do all of this, verse 19, "Thus storing up
[time=1984] treasure for themselves as a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold
[time=1991] of that, which is, say it with me, truly life." Then He finishes the passage, we'll look at this next week in detail, "O Timothy, guard the deposit entrusted to you, avoid the irreverent Babylon and contradictions of what is falsely
[time=2007] called knowledge for by professing it some and swear from the faith grace be with you."
[time=2013] So let's look at verse 19, we'll give you two things that will help us, I believe, answer this question, how can I live in light of eternity?
[time=2021] What does that look like?
[time=2022] Number one, pick the right foundation, write that down if you're taking notes.
[time=2027] First thing, pick the right foundations.
[time=2031] Verse 19, Paul says, "Thus storing up treasure for themselves as a good foundation for the
[time=2037] future foundations," so let's start with foundation, then we'll move to future in just a moment, but pick the right foundation, storing up for themselves treasure as that good foundation.
[time=2046] But let me do the New Testament book of Luke, Luke chapter 12, let's look there together in just a moment.
[time=2052] It's the parable of the rich fool, and so it fits this series very well, and I want to look at the words of Jesus in a moment, but as we do that, here's what a lot of people look at that, this parable as when you read it.
[time=2065] You look at it and say, "Well, it's talking about saving," and so you know I believe in saving.
[time=2070] I said it I think last week that the more I give, the better I save, and the less I waste.
[time=2077] I believe that.
[time=2078] I believe in saving up.
[time=2079] I believe in those things.
[time=2080] But a lot of people say, "Well, this is a parable I can use all my kids to teach them to save." Well, it's not a bad idea, it's a good principle, but that's really, is this a parable about saving?
[time=2090] I'll ask that question before I read it.
[time=2091] Now let's read and look at the words of Jesus together when it comes to the right foundation.
[time=2096] Because as you can tell already, I'm arguing that this parable really has more to do with the foundation that you're building on and trusting in than it does even with saving up.
[time=2105] So let's read it together.
[time=2106] I'm going to start in verse 15 of Luke chapter 12, and he said to them, "This is the words of Jesus, 'Take care and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one's life does
[time=2117] not consist in the abundance of its possessions." Good words from Jesus there, but then he tells a story to illustrate it as he so often did.
[time=2126] I love stories in case you haven't noticed in my own life, because it just illustrates and makes it real.
[time=2131] So he does this in verse 16, and he told them a parable saying, "The land of a rich man produced plentifully, and he thought to himself, 'What shall I do for I have nowhere to store my crops?'" And he said, "I will do this, I've got it.
[time=2145] I know what to do.
[time=2146] I'll tear down my barns and big, bigger barns, and there I will store all of my grain and my goods." I would pause this before we read verse 19 and say, "He just described pretty well the American dream as we look around.
[time=2158] We want to build bigger and better barns, because we have more and more things in our life, more and more things that God gives us and blesses us with and that we work hard for." And here's the thing, I'm not up here saying you didn't work hard for and don't deserve all of it.
[time=2172] From my standpoint, I don't deserve any of the things that God has given to me, and if I'm honest, I am so rich not because of anything I've done, but because of all God's given to me.
[time=2182] But this flies in the face of what culture screams at you.
[time=2186] It really does.
[time=2187] It's so different from what we see on a day-to-day basis.
[time=2191] Is it not?
[time=2192] It's not bad.
[time=2193] Is he saying, is Jesus saying it's bad to build bigger barns, to get a bigger house?
[time=2197] No.
[time=2198] Not at all.
[time=2199] We just read 1 Timothy chapter 6.
[time=2200] He's the one that richly provides everything for you to enjoy, of course not.
[time=2204] So what's Jesus saying?
[time=2205] He clarifies.
[time=2206] Verse 19.
[time=2207] And I will say to my soul, this is the rich fool here, the rich man, do you ever do this by the way?
[time=2213] I love this in the passage.
[time=2214] I will say to my soul, soul, anybody here, let's just own it, do you talk to yourself?
[time=2221] Raise your hand.
[time=2222] I'm that guy.
[time=2223] Okay.
[time=2224] All right.
[time=2225] Me too.
[time=2226] I've talked to myself a lot.
[time=2227] I've always liked that about that passage.
[time=2228] I just thought I'd point it out.
[time=2230] I will say to my soul, soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years.
[time=2236] Relax, eat, drink, and be merry.
[time=2238] And it'd be great if it ended there, but Jesus said, verse 20, but God said to him, fool,
[time=2246] fool.
[time=2248] And at that point, everyone may have thought, well, this is a good story about saving and Jesus is making a really good point here, but then all of a sudden Jesus turned and changed the mode of generosity, the meaning of generosity, the meaning of what it means to be entrusted.
[time=2262] And then everybody sat on the edge of their seat and leaned forward a little bit.
[time=2265] Fool.
[time=2266] It doesn't sound foolish to me.
[time=2267] It sounds like he was pretty smart.
[time=2268] He's got bigger burns than I do, right?
[time=2271] Fool.
[time=2273] This night, your soul is required of you and the things you've prepared, whose will they
[time=2279] be?
[time=2280] Hmm.
[time=2281] So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and has not and underlined these words in your Bible.
[time=2287] I would challenge you.
[time=2288] People often said, is it okay to mark in your Bible?
[time=2290] Of course.
[time=2292] I love that I can make notes and make it personal and that's why it's there.
[time=2295] So anyway, you may not feel that way and I don't hold it against you, but I would encourage you, underlined these three words, who is not rich toward God, rich toward God.
[time=2305] There's a big difference of being rich in this present age and being rich toward God.
[time=2311] It's a new phrase that changed generosity and how do you do that?
[time=2316] Verse 33, as we just looked at, it's really simple to let go as Jesus continued.
[time=2321] Look down at verse 33 of Luke 12.
[time=2324] You'll see what I'm talking about here.
[time=2326] He says, sell your possessions and give to the needy.
[time=2328] Provide yourselves with money bags and do.grow old with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.
[time=2337] What was he talking about?
[time=2339] Does that mean I can't have stuff?
[time=2340] I've got to sell everything and give it all away to truly be rich toward God?
[time=2343] Is that Jesus pointing?
[time=2344] No, because he also says, and Jesus never contradicts himself, that through Paul here,
[time=2351] be rich towards God, be rich in good works, and know that God richly provides you everything
[time=2357] to enjoy.
[time=2358] That means you can enjoy some things.
[time=2360] So he's not saying that you have to sell everything.
[time=2362] He's saying that everybody do this again, remember this from last week?
[time=2366] This is what he's saying.
[time=2367] Join me, if you will.
[time=2369] This is what Jesus is saying.
[time=2371] I've got to have an open hand mentality if I want to be rich toward God, that it's not mine to begin with.
[time=2377] It's all his to begin with.
[time=2379] And if this isn't real enough to you, I talked about how I would do this a lot of times just to remind myself to be open to other people, but it's also a reminder to just let go.
[time=2389] It's not yours anyway.
[time=2392] And so you can put your hands away now, and so you don't have to sit awkwardly that way, the whole service.
[time=2396] But if that doesn't make it real to you, I think I can.
[time=2398] How many frozen fans are in the building?
[time=2401] Those of you who didn't do it, you know what I'm talking about.
[time=2405] If you've got kids, you know what frozen is.
[time=2407] Elson, Ana, and all the little snowman that hops around, we've watched it so many times in this house.
[time=2412] It's three little key words, let it go.
[time=2417] Let it go.
[time=2419] Don't make me sing it.
[time=2420] All right, I'm going to sing it.
[time=2421] Let it go.
[time=2423] Can't hold it back anymore.
[time=2428] Sally will get on the stage, whatever the stage is, whether it's a chair, and she will sing it at the top of her lungs.
[time=2434] She has the little crown, and there's one point in the song, if you remember, she throws the crown.
[time=2438] She'll throw the crown.
[time=2439] I've gotten hit by the crown.
[time=2440] We've seen the crown fly everywhere.
[time=2442] But frozen, who would have thought a Disney movie could give us the key to what it means to be rich toward God?
[time=2448] Let it go.
[time=2450] That is my challenge to you today.
[time=2452] That's what Jesus is talking about.
[time=2454] He's simply saying, "Let it go, live with an open hand mentality." I'll put it to you this way.
[time=2460] This is in your notes, and this is a phrase that I want you to ponder and think about when it comes to picking the right foundation, because that's what all this speaks to is what foundation you're trying to build in your life.
[time=2470] The phrase is this, "When you live in light of eternity, you loosen your grip on wealth,
[time=2479] let it go, open hands, and wealth loosens its grip on you." You ever been gripped by having more?
[time=2487] If we're honest, everybody in the room would raise our hand if we were honest to our answer that question.
[time=2492] Of course, we've been gripped by having more.
[time=2494] But when I live in a lot of eternity, I start to realize that the kingdom of God is different than this kingdom than this world.
[time=2500] Not only do I lose my grip, because that's what we fear.
[time=2502] We don't like that part.
[time=2503] I lose my grip on wealth, but I find that as I lose my grip on wealth, wealth loses its grip on me, and then I can be gripped by Jesus in a way that changes my life.
[time=2513] That's when trust truly does lead to transformation.
[time=2516] The number one contender, fighter for your heart today is your wealth.
[time=2519] That's why Jesus talked about money so much in his ministry.
[time=2523] In the kingdom of God, here's the thing.
[time=2524] Here's what Jesus is saying.
[time=2526] You don't get credit for any of the stuff that you leave only for what you give.
[time=2532] That goes contrary to everything that the world will show you.
[time=2535] Why is it that we don't get credit for what we leave behind, the stuff that we accumulate?
[time=2539] I heard a preacher say a long time ago, and I've always remembered it, that if you ever seen a U-haul behind the hearse, I've never seen a U-haul behind the hearse.
[time=2549] It doesn't come with you.
[time=2550] It stays here.
[time=2551] Here's the thing.
[time=2552] You may say, "Well, mine looks different because my neighbor may have this, but here's what I would be leaving behind." No, here's what I'll tell you.
[time=2557] This is why we don't get credit in the kingdom of God for what we leave behind.
[time=2561] We all leave the same thing, every one of you, all of it, all of it.
[time=2568] Now all of it looks different for you than it does to me than to the person who's sitting beside you, but the same thing is true that we leave behind all of it.
[time=2575] So I want to pass it forward to eternity and invest in something that's going to last in my life.
[time=2581] That's what Jesus is saying.
[time=2583] I'll go back to this statement.
[time=2584] It's not what you have.
[time=2586] It's what you do with what you have.
[time=2589] You have been listening, haven't you?
[time=2591] I said that in case you haven't noticed every week and just a little sneak peek of next week, I'm probably going to say it next week too.
[time=2598] It's not what you have because that becomes such an obstacle for us.
[time=2601] It's what you do with what you have.
[time=2604] Now when we talk about tithing as we've looked out in this, look at it this way, I've been so blessed.
[time=2609] I like to have so many good mentors and people I share with you, mine and Jessica's commitment from many years ago to always give 10% and we do above and beyond that now because God's blessed us and that's my goal is just to continually be challenged and that's why I challenge you with those three challenges of what the card you'll get at the end.
[time=2625] You may not choose to do any of those and I'll tell you we won't hold a thing in the world against you if you don't.
[time=2631] But I've had people challenge me in my life and this is what that looks like.
[time=2634] To think about it just as a visual, this is 10 $1 bills and as I hold these, here's
[time=2640] what entrusted really all about, I've got 10 $1 bills and I have these as we've already
[time=2646] established because God richly provides, they're his 10 $1 bills and he gave me 10 of them and it just says hey, 10% just means giving one back.
[time=2655] You can take this and richly that I've richly provided and enjoy life and hopefully you'll
[time=2662] do some more with that too.
[time=2664] I would tell you I've had some people in my life that have modeled to me what it looks like to do this.
[time=2669] Five and five, God gave me 10 but I give five back, I've watched people do it, I know some
[time=2677] people do it in this building where it's just basically half of everything I get, I give back to God.
[time=2681] I know a business person in Georgia who confidentially no one knew he did this but so he could continue
[time=2688] doing it, he had to let somebody in the loop and told me at one point that you know what, I've decided that it's God's business, he gave me my business and very, very successful business.
[time=2700] It's his business, he gave it to me and I used to have partners in my business but I don't anymore because of all these circumstances and so I've just decided that God is going to be my partner and so I want to be able to just give half, it's his prophet and so he was one of those people, half of everything he gave.
[time=2715] Is this a plea to give half of everything you make?
[time=2718] It's a plea and a reminder that it's all his anyway and so whatever he puts on my heart
[time=2724] to do with it, it's his anyway and does this apply to your $10 bills, does it apply to
[time=2731] the hundreds in your bank account, yeah, is that all it applies to, no, does it apply
[time=2737] to my kids, yeah, what about my house, yeah, what about the clothes on my back, yeah.
[time=2744] I can remember that being made real for me, I showed you some pictures last week of a trip to Africa that we took and we brought all these clothes one time and that little orphanage there, they didn't have clothes even for older children, I showed you some of the younger children but I remember I just decided just to wear as did I think everybody on our trip because it was just so heartbreaking to think of how many clothes, pieces of clothing I have in my closet and just saw these little kids that had nothing and we decided I think
[time=2772] I can just stink and wear what I have on for the rest of the trip, let's just give them our suitcases and so we did and we didn't really come back with much of anything because you start to realize that it's really all God's and then you start to see why in the early church it says they were characterized by their generosity, they were ready to share but then two verses later it says they didn't even have any needs among them, of course we wouldn't if we would all have the mentality that Jesus has propelled among us and that's not just your money, this is not just a money sermon, this is your life, entrusted, living and trusted is a lifestyle, it's not just a bank account thing, let me give you the second
[time=2809] thing, not just pick the right foundation but pursue the right future and I say that because in verse 19 it says a good foundation, it serves as a good foundation, that's the foundation we talked about but for the future we all are here because we care about our future because that's life but I would tell you it matters what future you pursue because when God gets your wealth, when God gets the stuff in your life, when you look at it as
[time=2834] something He entrusted to you, He gets your heart and by the way I would just tell you I've never, I've missed a lot of money that I waste, sometimes anybody done that, what
[time=2844] was I thinking?
[time=2845] Okay it was just me, I see a couple of knives, if you're honest you've been there too, come on, what was I thinking?
[time=2851] I bought that thing and now it's in the basement, I never look at it again, what was I, I missed that money, I missed money that I spend, I invest poorly, that I loan out to that brother in law, you know what I'm talking about, I don't have a brother in law, I'll just use something generic but you know what I mean with that, but when God gets your heart through
[time=2872] your wealth you'll realize that something happens in your heart, hear me, something happens in your heart but something also happens to your future, your future changes when God gets a hold of your heart through your trust, so pursue the right futures the second thing and I'll tell you this, when you think about your future I do something, this is just a little practical side note, I do something every year at the end of the year, I had a mentor show me this, model this for me many many years ago and I have done it every year since, I always take at least, at least a day, at least a day, I shoot for the better
[time=2904] part of a week, you may say well that's pretty extreme, it's changed my life though and I'll tell you why, what I do at the end of the year I find at least a day to just evaluate because here's what I've learned, we often use the phrase what makes you wiser in life, experience
[time=2919] and some of you know I'd because you've heard that in your life, I would say no it doesn't, I've had some good experiences, some bad experiences and it didn't make me a bit wiser because
[time=2929] then I ended up experiencing it again because I didn't get wiser, you know what I'm talking about, I would say that it's evaluated experience that really makes you wiser, when I learned
[time=2940] to look at my life, look at my goals, look at my dreams and weigh them in light of his that's
[time=2946] when I start to become wiser, so at the end of every year I always take time to just simply evaluate the experiences of the year, what were my lowest moments, these are a few key questions always, I just off the top of my head you have different questions but I always ask what were my lowest moments, what were my highest moments, what did I learn from
[time=2964] each of those, what did I learn in the midst of those low moments and those high moments, what would I have done differently, we always ask that question right, what would I have done differently, in what ways do I hope this coming year is different than the one that's
[time=2980] just ended, there's a few, just to get you started you'll come up with way better ones than that but I would challenge you to do that because your future matters and here's the thing, your future is not, here's a phrase, it's just going to change your life, you ready, if you keep doing what you've always done you'll keep getting what you've always got,
[time=2998] if you always do what you've always done you'll always get what you've always got, if you keep doing those same things it won't change, your future doesn't shift and so I would challenge you to evaluate experience and look at what could be different in your own life and here's what it boils down to as you do that at the end of the year, here's the key to change in your future and pursuing the right future that's being built on the right foundation like we're talking about in verse 19, the key to that is that the question really isn't what future I'm going to pursue, think about this, the question really isn't what future I'm going to pursue, it's whose future I'm going to pursue, it's not what future is whose future, as I'm even challenging you say well pastor you just told me to evaluate my future, I did but I'm challenging you a step further than that to evaluate your future
[time=3047] in light of eternity, I'm challenging you to evaluate your future in light of his plans
[time=3057] and his future for you, it's not what future, it's whose future, whose agenda are you pursuing
[time=3063] in your life, is it your agenda, you say yeah I pursued my agenda many years, I can tell
[time=3071] you I've done some decent things when I pursued my own agenda but the times when my life
[time=3077] was really fruitful when I truly lived, because that's what we're talking about right, how can I truly live, the times I would say in my life that I've truly lived came from when I pursued his agenda and not mine, his future and not mine, God what do you want for future,
[time=3092] not what do I want for future, it changes how you spend those ten one dollar bills, it changes how you parent your children, how you are a husband or a wife in your marriage, how you
[time=3103] love and minister to the people in your workplace, how those Christmas gatherings that are coming
[time=3109] up will look even in light of all the conflicts that are inevitably going to be a part of some of your Christmas gatherings, it changes everything when I know how to trust the God who's entrusted
[time=3122] stuff to me in my life, when it's his future I pursue and not my own and here's what I'm going to tell you, you say well there's been a lot of stuff on money, a lot of stuff and even what the church is doing right now, we want you to give to this and we want to do that, you may be that person, and I'll tell you I've been that person before, the church is only after my money, I remember growing up and I saw all they ever talk about, I've been that person, I get it, here's what I would wrap things together, tie a Christmas
[time=3150] bow on it for you to know today, is all of that isn't because Jesus wants something from me, here's what I'll tell you right this statement, I think it's in your notes there, Jesus wants something for you, not just something from you, Jesus wants something for you, I
[time=3168] believe somebody in this room came today to hear that statement, Jesus wants something
[time=3175] for you, he doesn't just want something from you and when you realize what he's done for
[time=3182] you, the battle he's already won on your behalf, when you understand those things, the things
[time=3189] that he asks for from you, really aren't from you anyway, because he just entrusted it all to me anyway, it's all his, so he doesn't want anything from me, it's all his and I don't mind pouring everything in my life at his feet when I realize what he's done for me, the key to doing something for God is to know what he did for you, to give the things that he's
[time=3208] asked from me come from what he's already done for me, and it changes how you look at
[time=3214] everything in your life and it changes how you can do what the end of the verse says and that's this, take hold, this is my closing challenge to you, take hold of that which is
[time=3224] truly life, verse 19, that my friends, when you pick the right foundation and pursue the
[time=3231] right future, that is when you can take hold of that which is truly life, I'm gonna ask
[time=3237] you just to close your eyes for a minute and evaluate, begin that evaluation process in your own life, if you know Jesus today, what does it look like for you this week to take
[time=3249] one step that would allow you to take hold of that which is truly life, to pick the right
[time=3255] foundation and pursue the right future, his and not your own, but some of you are here and you would say I've been wrestling and fighting and wondering and even pleading with
[time=3267] God just to show me who he really is, the way you take hold of that which is truly life
[time=3273] is finding eternal life through a personal relationship with Jesus, if you would say to
[time=3279] me, Kevin, I would love to know that I could spend eternity with Jesus, that I have true life through him, that I would spend eternity in heaven with God, if I were to die today,
[time=3290] I'm one of those 97% that believes something is waiting for me beyond this life, I wish
[time=3296] I could know but I just don't, well I want to tell you, right now God wants you to know
[time=3303] and he cares about where you're at and here's what that looks like, God's made it so clear for you, my challenges don't make complicated, as we've already discussed, don't make complicated what God made so simple, so simple that I was five years old when I gave my life to
[time=3317] Jesus, well you sure you could know that yes, well don't you think you were too young, no
[time=3324] because God made it that simple, here's what it looks like, I'm not going to lead you in a prayer because I know your heart's already saying it, some of you have already said that prayer I believe, it looks like saying Jesus I do need you, I don't feel worthy but I need
[time=3338] you, you died for me, you rose again, please forgive me, it's life's been mine but now
[time=3345] it's yours, I give you all of me, whatever words you choose to use to let that be the cry of your heart, that is what saves you, you take a moment, right now in this moment as God is stirring inside of you, you're holding on, you just need to let go, you need to open
[time=3361] your hands and say today is that day, we take a moment in this beautiful day that God's
[time=3369] given us, that he's entrusted to you and scream out to him.
[time=3375] Thanks for watching today, I pray that God has blessed you, God has spoken to you in one way, shape, or form today and you know I've said a lot over the last couple of weeks that the heart of being entrusted is trust and here's what I know, I know when we talk about the
[time=3389] Bible, when we talk about the Gospel, when we talk about Jesus and what it means to trust him that God does something inside of us, the inside, the heart, the soul of who we are gets challenged and it gets stretched and I believe that that's very possibly where you are right now and I want to speak to you, if that did you, I want you to know that I know in your mind it conflicts with your heart at times and you say I'm not ready to take that step, I've got to get some things cleaned up before I can take the step of truly giving my life to Jesus and trusting him with all that I am and I would just challenge you, I would encourage you, I would plead with you to not hold back, to take that step to
[time=3429] just dig into what God's doing inside of you right now, it really is as simple as we've been talking about, even had a story recently of someone who watched us on the Bible hour and called and wanted to talk with someone asking the question can you convince me that it really is as simple as you say it is every week and I would tell you right now that it truly is that simple, not because I can make it that simple, not because you can make it that simple, but because Jesus already made it that simple, he made it that simple by dying that brutal death that he died on the cross for you and for me, paying the price
[time=3463] that we can never pay because he lived the sinless life that you and I could never live, that's definitely a place we could start, a place that we could agree that the gospel is true and that we can't make it to heaven, we can't make it to God on our own, so that's where Jesus comes in and so as believers, as those that are truly choosing to trust Jesus
[time=3481] with their life, we're not fighting for that victory, we're fighting from that victory because Jesus has already won it, so if that's you, take that step today and let us walk alongside of you just simply telling Jesus, "My life is now yours, I give you me," and when you do that, scripture promises, when you believe on the name of Jesus that he died for you and that he's alive, he rose from the dead, that you shall be saved and if that's you, we want
[time=3506] to get something into your hands because we believe and know that that is just the beginning, God's just now starting something new in your life and we want to get one of these booklets into your hands right now, it's called beginning steps, it's just a simply a growth guide for new believers where we help you walk through what's next because you're truly in the beginning stages of a new life that Jesus has begun inside of you.
[time=3528] I want to tell you, thank you for allowing me to share personally into your life, I don't take that lightly, we don't take that lightly here on the Bible hour and at Black Hawk Ministries and we want to walk alongside of you in your journey and so no matter what you're facing right now, I want to challenge you to reach out to us, if you've got a story, an encouraging story that God has done something new in your life, let us know what that looks like, email it to us, we're going to give you a website, an email address, a phone number on your screen so that you can reach out to us and ask for one of these books, you can tell us your story and you can ask us any questions and we'd love to just walk alongside of you, thank you again for watching and I hope to see you again really soon, God bless.
