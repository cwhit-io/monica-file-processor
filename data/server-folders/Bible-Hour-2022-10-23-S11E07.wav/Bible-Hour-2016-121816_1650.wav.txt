[time=305] There is no one like you.
[time=314] [MUSIC]
[time=318] >> I want to thank you so much for watching today.
[time=320] I've got my good friend Darren here with me.
[time=322] And I just want to tell you a little bit about the Bible hour.
[time=325] Make sure you're aware of some of the channel changes that we've recently seen here.
[time=329] We are now on my TV channel 21.3 on Sundays at nine.
[time=333] We also air on Wednesdays at 5 PM on local Comcast Cable Access Channel 57.
[time=339] But I just want to give you a special thank you for allowing us a few minutes in your life each week.
[time=344] Just to let God minister to you, I pray that this has been a blessing to you and there's more blessings to come today.
[time=349] But I want Darren to tell you a little bit about Christmas that's coming up and some of the services you have a chance to be a part of here at Black Hall.
[time=355] And I know Christmas is a busy time for everyone this season.
[time=358] But we have a couple special services Christmas Eve.
[time=362] We have our Christmas Eve service is six o'clock.
[time=366] If you would like to come and celebrate the birth of Jesus with us, we would love that.
[time=370] It's going to be fun.
[time=371] It will be family friendly so you can bring your kids too.
[time=374] It won't be more than an hour long.
[time=376] It starts at six o'clock.
[time=378] Doors will open at 5.30 if you'd like to come then.
[time=381] And also Christmas Day, we have a Christmas Day service in the morning at 10.30.
[time=386] And that will be the same thing.
[time=387] It will be family friendly if you'd like to bring your kids and celebrate the birth of Jesus on Christmas Day.
[time=392] Doors open at 10 o'clock that morning.
[time=394] So we'd love to see you.
[time=396] Absolutely.
[time=397] And so we will not have our normal 9 AM activities on Christmas Day December the 25th.
[time=401] And so bring your kids.
[time=402] It's going to be loud.
[time=404] We've got a lot of activities and I'm even preaching.
[time=407] You believe this?
[time=408] A shorter sermon.
[time=409] I'll believe that when I see it.
[time=410] It's going to happen on the 24th and the 25th.
[time=413] After that, New Year rolls around.
[time=414] I want to tell you a little bit about a series that I'm very excited to kick off on January the 8th.
[time=419] The series is called Inside Out.
[time=421] And a little sneak preview of that is that we as people and we as the church, we tend to turn inward to make things as comfortable as we can.
[time=428] But in this series we're going to look at how God's challenges to build inwardly so that we can impact outwardly.
[time=433] And so I really cannot wait to just look at what the church is supposed to look like.
[time=438] To look at what Jesus built His church to do and to be in the world around us.
[time=442] And so I challenge you.
[time=444] Maybe you've been hurt by the church.
[time=445] Maybe you're watching us on television online.
[time=448] Maybe you've done that because you're afraid to just step into the church where we're going to be exploring what the church is supposed to be.
[time=454] What would the world look like?
[time=456] What would the church look like if we did it Jesus way?
[time=459] And so I want to invite you to come and join us beginning January the 8th for this really important series in the life of our church and hopefully even in your life.
[time=466] Thanks again for watching.
[time=467] On behalf of Darren and me, I want to tell you that we value your time and we appreciate you spending some time with us today.
[time=473] We'll see you soon.
[time=496] [MUSIC - 80 seconds]
[time=581] [MUSIC] Oh [MUSIC] Your voice was an end [MUSIC] A rush burning [MUSIC] Now your voice was an end [MUSIC] A rushing wind [MUSIC] It was still, it was small [MUSIC] It was hidden [MUSIC] Oh [MUSIC] You came like a winter snow [MUSIC] Quiet, soft and slow [MUSIC] Falling from the sky in the night [MUSIC] To the earth below [MUSIC] You were finally [MUSIC] You came falling from the sky in the night [MUSIC] To the earth below [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] â™ª
[time=703] We're closing out our series called "Intrusted" today.
[time=706] And this is a perfect week, a perfect series, to help us move into the Christmas season well, because as we know, we get into the frenzy a lot of times.
[time=717] This is the beginning of that frenzy period of Christmas so many times, and it's also a time, and I just want to acknowledge this right up front, right off the bat today, where many of us are reminded of things that we would just assume forget at times in our life, and we're reminded of hurts, and I want you to know that we're mindful of that here.
[time=735] But you know what? That doesn't really matter.
[time=737] What matters the most is that Jesus is mindful of that, and he knows where you are in your life, in this moment, what he's entrusted you with, what you're learning to trust him with.
[time=748] He knows all of those variables in that equation, but here's what I want to promise you today. Everybody listening, this is so important.
[time=755] That still small voice, just like the quiet winter snow the way that Jesus came, that still small voice is going to be speaking inside of you today.
[time=764] I know that. I'm confident of that. Why?
[time=767] Because you're here, because the Word of God is going to be spoken, it has nothing to do with me, it has nothing to do with you, but it has everything to do with him and what he wants to do in you and through you.
[time=778] So will you listen to that still small voice today?
[time=781] Now, before we go into our series, I've got a bone to pick with my Black Hawk family.
[time=785] You ready for this? Why didn't you tell me the weather would do this to me in Indiana?
[time=791] I'm just kidding. You told us we knew it was coming, and yet here we are, right?
[time=797] Welcome to Indiana from Georgia Rivers family.
[time=800] It's going to take more than snow to keep us away.
[time=802] Here we are, baptizing, celebrating.
[time=804] I love what we get to do today at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=808] If I told you lately that I'm excited about what God's up to here.
[time=812] Absolutely.
[time=814] So let's dig into interest in 1 Timothy.
[time=816] If you got your Bibles, look there with me. 1 Timothy, chapter 6.
[time=819] We're going to be looking particularly at verses 20 and 21.
[time=822] I want to say a special welcome to anybody that's watching online today on television at home.
[time=827] No matter where you may be today, I want to tell you welcome.
[time=830] God wants to do a work in your life as does he and all of us that sit in the room together today.
[time=835] I'm very excited about our clothes to this series.
[time=838] Now, you got a card when you came in. I want to tell you.
[time=840] And for those that are watching online, we want you to participate in this as well.
[time=844] But if you are here today, you got a card, and this card is a commitment card.
[time=848] There's three parts of that. I don't want you to be distracted when we look at the verses, saying, "Well, what do we do with this in case you missed last week?" I'll tell you now before we get into our scripture.
[time=857] And so there are three parts to the card you received when you came in.
[time=860] If you didn't get one, there'll be some available to you at the end of the service.
[time=863] It's a time of commitment.
[time=865] As we come to the culmination of this series about what it means to be entrusted, I gave you three challenges. I've been asked many times by many people, "Well, what can I do, Pastor, to start the journey of perhaps tithing, or to start the journey of trusting God with my job, or with my kids?" And so we came up with, particularly in the area of our resources.
[time=885] We know Jesus talked about our resources, our finances, our money, so much more than he did all these other topics.
[time=891] I've challenged you to maybe dig into one of three things.
[time=894] The Jesus' birthday challenge, where we give the challenges, give your greatest financial gift to Jesus this Christmas season.
[time=902] After all, it is his birthday. That was the challenge.
[time=904] So your greatest financial gift, give it to Jesus, and we've got a lot of venues for you to do that here.
[time=908] The second was the 90-day challenge, where we challenge you to tithe for 90 days.
[time=912] And if you don't think at the end of those 90 days that it was a good decision, we will give you your money back.
[time=918] It's risk-free. You don't get that in life a whole lot, do you?
[time=921] And then the last was the 1% challenge.
[time=924] We talked about how percentage is the pathway to progress.
[time=926] And it's not about people get caught up with, "If I can't do 10%, then I can't do...
[time=930] I've challenged you. Just start. Just give. Just go with percentage." That's why Jesus said the little lady who put in the little mite, the widow's mite that we call it, that was the equivalent of almost nothing. He said she gave more than everybody else in the building.
[time=944] And so we acknowledge that God's doing those kinds of things.
[time=946] So we're going to do that at the end of the service. We've got stations here.
[time=949] And so there's two boxes. There's a place just for your commitment cards and then places for your offerings.
[time=954] We're going to do that as a way just to get up and move and worship God at the end of the message today.
[time=958] So that's what's coming up. The other boxes for your offerings, your regular offerings, you can use the envelopes there in front of you.
[time=964] Or also you can use the gifts that go envelopes and you can bring those, put that in the same box.
[time=969] So now everybody clear. We'll go through that a little bit more later.
[time=972] But let's dig in to entrust it today. I love what we're getting to do because we just get the opportunity.
[time=978] And hear me. If you're a guest or if you're still praying through all that, you have no pressure.
[time=982] It's not about giving today. We're here today to learn what it means to be entrusted.
[time=986] To learn what it means to know how blessed we truly are this Christmas season and to walk through a life where we learn and know what it looks like to trust Him with all He is entrusted to us.
[time=997] So we said through the whole series that the heart of being entrusted, this is where you come in.
[time=1001] The heart of being entrusted is trust. That was weak.
[time=1005] We're going to do it again. The heart of being entrusted is trust.
[time=1009] Right in the middle of the word is the word trust.
[time=1012] And so we've had a memory verse that we have dug into for this series.
[time=1015] A short, simple little phrase from Jesus, Matthew chapter 6 and verse 21, say it with me if you know it.
[time=1022] For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
[time=1028] And so we've talked all about that. So here's the thing. In 1 Timothy chapter 6, let's look there together.
[time=1034] I want us to read one more time this whole passage, but let's look particularly at verses 20 and 21 together.
[time=1040] Anybody ready for God's word this morning? Let's do it.
[time=1043] Starting in verse 17, 1 Timothy chapter 6, and I'll be reading from the English standard version this morning, the same version that's in your seats around there.
[time=1051] So if you want to follow along there or in your apps or however you look that up, ESV version starting in verse 17.
[time=1057] As for the rich in this present age, charge them not to be haughty nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches,
[time=1066] but on God who richly provides us with everything to enjoy.
[time=1072] They are to do good, verse 18, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share.
[time=1078] Thus storing up treasure for themselves as a good foundation for the future.
[time=1083] So what we looked at last week, foundation and future, go back and listen to that if you missed that, because it sets up these verses perfectly.
[time=1090] So that they may take hold of that which is, say it with me, truly life.
[time=1095] Truly life.
[time=1096] Verse 20, Paul is writing to his protege, many would say, someone he had trained important to verse 20,
[time=1102] says, "O Timothy, guard the deposit, entrusted, entrusted to you.
[time=1108] Avoid the irreverent Babel and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge.
[time=1114] For by professing it, some have swerved from the faith.
[time=1119] Grace be with you." Now, how many of you would say, as that verse ended there, and you may say, well, that's kind of a weird way to end the passage there.
[time=1128] We're going to look at that.
[time=1129] But before we do, let me just ask you a simple question.
[time=1131] I think we can all kind of get to the same place where Timothy was, where Paul was trying to walk on that journey.
[time=1136] Have you ever found yourself in a place where you were swerving from faith?
[time=1140] You kind of got off track and you needed to veer back.
[time=1143] Maybe you did that this morning on the way in.
[time=1145] And by the way, I'll have you know, I impart, just so you know, I'm parked in our parking lot.
[time=1150] I think in between two lines, I'm not totally sure about that.
[time=1153] But I got here and I didn't swerve that much at all.
[time=1156] So your Georgia pastor made it here today.
[time=1158] But have you ever spiritually, yeah, go ahead.
[time=1161] That's right.
[time=1162] You know, you've made way better things to applaud than that today, right?
[time=1165] But spiritually speaking, though, has that ever happened to you?
[time=1169] Well, you just got off track.
[time=1171] You swerved, you veered off course, and you had to find a way to maybe find some directions to get off that detour that you went on spiritually and to find God in the situation,
[time=1182] the circumstances that you find yourself in.
[time=1184] I remember a story back in my younger years when Jessica and I were dating.
[time=1189] I guess we were actually, yeah, we were married at the time.
[time=1192] No, it was before we were married.
[time=1193] Yeah, I was 18, 17, 18 years old, learning to drive in the big city in Georgia of Atlanta.
[time=1198] And that's a challenge when you're 17, 18 years old.
[time=1202] I took her to a really nice restaurant.
[time=1204] I saved up money for quite a bit of time.
[time=1206] Never spent that much on a meal before.
[time=1208] And we went to the sundial restaurant in downtown Atlanta.
[time=1212] And so I took her there and we were living large.
[time=1215] And so we went there and I got there parked.
[time=1219] Everything was smooth.
[time=1220] I had really worked hard to try to make sure I could show off for my bride, right?
[time=1224] Show off for my beautiful lady.
[time=1226] And so we got there.
[time=1227] We ate the meals perfect.
[time=1229] We left.
[time=1230] And on the way home, you know, we were just going on.
[time=1232] But if you've ever been in Atlanta, there's a lot of roads there.
[time=1235] And they split -- you see where this is going already, don't you?
[time=1238] There's a split going south, and that's the way we would go home.
[time=1241] It's Interstate 75 and 85.
[time=1243] And they're together in the middle of Atlanta, in the heart of Atlanta.
[time=1246] And you've got to pick the right one, or you'll go the other direction.
[time=1249] It does kind of like this, right?
[time=1251] Well, what do you think I picked?
[time=1253] The wrong one.
[time=1254] So we drove and, you know, I felt like something wasn't quite right.
[time=1258] I really did.
[time=1260] An hour later, I felt like something still wasn't quite right.
[time=1263] And we ended up at a place -- you want to know how hard-headed your pastor is?
[time=1268] Two hours later, down I-75, when I needed to take 85 to go back towards where we lived.
[time=1277] And I finally said, "I think I'm lost." And she looked at me and I don't know what she said, but I'm sure it was something like, "Yeah, I know." So I picked up my phone and called my dad and said, "Dad, I'm lost." And he said, "Well, tell me what you're seeing." And I saw this college.
[time=1293] Tift College is where my mom went to college.
[time=1295] And he went, "You are at Tift College.
[time=1298] What did you do?" And he said, "You took the wrong interstate.
[time=1303] I know what you did.
[time=1304] I'm going to help you, but you're two hours out of the way." And I said, "Yeah, I've got that dad.
[time=1308] Just help me.
[time=1309] Help me get home." We made it home, but man, that was an embarrassing moment.
[time=1313] Then, spiritually speaking, you know, I've had a lot of those similar moments where I knew something wasn't quite right.
[time=1319] I needed to pull over and just get some directions.
[time=1321] I needed to make a phone call.
[time=1322] I needed to find my way back to center.
[time=1324] I needed to find the way back to where I knew I needed to get and where I needed to go spiritually.
[time=1329] But I just wouldn't pick up the phone and say, "Lord, help me get there." Can I get an amen?
[time=1335] Some of you are in that moment today.
[time=1338] Some of you came here today, braved the weather, and here you sit because God's doing something in you and you feel like God wants to do something in me.
[time=1346] I know, but I'm so far off track.
[time=1348] I don't even know if I can get back on course.
[time=1351] Some of you have been searching out this thing called fate for many years now, and you are still wrestling with what it looks like to follow and trust Jesus.
[time=1359] And some of you are even asking the question, "Is it worth it?
[time=1362] Is it worth it for me to follow Jesus?
[time=1365] Is it worth it for me to trust Him the way that crazy pastor keeps talking about?"
[time=1371] I want to tell you today, I believe and I know that it's worth every single ounce of it.
[time=1377] Because Jesus has changed everything about my life and He wants to change everything about yours and the thing about that change is it doesn't happen in a moment when you pray and give your heart to Jesus.
[time=1387] That's what fate, if you've been told that salvation is all about a prayer, somebody told you wrong.
[time=1391] It's much more in depth than that.
[time=1393] It's not more difficult than that.
[time=1395] Hear me?
[time=1396] It is that simple.
[time=1397] It is as simple as saying, "Jesus, I have nothing to offer you.
[time=1400] I'm so far off course, but here is me.
[time=1403] I give you me." It is that simple.
[time=1405] I promise you.
[time=1406] But it does so much more than just initially walking through a new change in your life, a new season in your life.
[time=1412] It permeates everything about who you are to the core of your trust.
[time=1417] Some of you would say, "I've been trusting in all the wrong things and that's really what the heart of this series has been all about."
[time=1424] And so today I want us to look at what it means to live in trusted.
[time=1428] Tying all of these pieces together that we've looked at over the last several weeks together.
[time=1433] How can I live interested?
[time=1436] The way that Paul is talking to Timothy about.
[time=1438] Let me give you the bottom line today of what really the whole passage, the end of this passage, I believe, points us to.
[time=1443] And it's simply this, being interested.
[time=1446] Being interested boils down to being established.
[time=1450] Established.
[time=1451] Let me tell you, I looked up the word "established" this week, and this is what I found to establish, is to set up on a firm or permanent basis.
[time=1461] Established is to set up on a firm or permanent basis.
[time=1466] And a lot of times in our journey of faith, it's really not about what we establish ourselves around.
[time=1472] It's who we establish ourselves in.
[time=1475] Let me say that again.
[time=1476] It's not always what we establish ourselves around.
[time=1479] We establish ourselves in a job.
[time=1481] We don't go into a career thinking that it's just going to be temporary and I don't really want to live this thing out.
[time=1486] Some of you may have, but you're doing it to get to the goal of establishing yourself in something that's permanent.
[time=1491] Something that'll be an ongoing part of your life.
[time=1493] Something that's stable because we want that stability.
[time=1496] Established.
[time=1497] Stable.
[time=1498] Stability.
[time=1499] We want that in our life.
[time=1500] It's not necessarily what you're established around in your life.
[time=1504] It's who you're established in.
[time=1506] And that is only determined by who you're trusting.
[time=1510] Where you're established, who you're established, really goes back to your trust.
[time=1514] Now, let's look at two questions.
[time=1516] Very simple outline today.
[time=1517] Two questions that I hope that we can answer that really point back to what it means to be established and live a life that's entrusted.
[time=1523] Trusting Jesus with all that we've got and really of ultimately living the established, entrusted life that Paul is talking about.
[time=1531] The first question is this.
[time=1532] With what am I entrusted?
[time=1534] You may say, well, I already know the answer to that.
[time=1536] I mean, I could make a list.
[time=1537] Earlier in the series, I challenged you to make a list of your blessings.
[time=1541] That's a great place to start.
[time=1542] Maybe you have that list with you now.
[time=1544] If you do, I challenge you to pull it out for a minute and just look at it as we go.
[time=1547] Some of you made that list of what you're blessed with, your blessings, and you maybe hit your knees.
[time=1552] That was one of the homework pieces that we've looked at with that.
[time=1555] But let's look at a few things that we are entrusted with because if we're going to live in a way that's entrusted and guard our deposit.
[time=1563] Paul says, oh, Timothy, guard the deposit entrusted to you.
[time=1568] What is that?
[time=1569] That's what we're going to boil all of this down to.
[time=1571] We've got to first understand what's available to us.
[time=1574] And it started with in this series, if you remember, the realization that we are maybe a little richer than we thought.
[time=1580] Were any rich people in the building?
[time=1582] There it is.
[time=1583] Way more hands than we had on week one because we've learned that even a very average income in the United States of America today puts us in the top 1% of wage earners in the world.
[time=1594] And we start to realize that, man, I'm a lot more rich, even financially than I thought.
[time=1600] But then if we start making that list, that's why I challenge you to make that list.
[time=1603] If I start making a list of all the things that I've been entrusted with, the things that I'm blessed with, then I start to realize all that I have at my fingertips.
[time=1611] But let me give you three things.
[time=1612] You can jot these down.
[time=1613] Your time, your talent, and your treasure.
[time=1621] You may have heard those words before, but I hope today they can gain a little bit more of a new meaning in your life.
[time=1628] Your time, your talent, and your treasure.
[time=1630] And so you can jot those down in your notes or any apps however you're taking notes there.
[time=1634] But let's explore that for a moment.
[time=1636] I want to challenge you in each of those categories, a little homework on the spot this morning.
[time=1640] To just think of maybe one way that you already know when you heard those words, when I said time, when I said talent, and when I said treasure.
[time=1649] Maybe God already put something on your heart, at least in one of those areas, that this week you need to take an action step and do something about.
[time=1657] To trust God more with your time, to trust God more with your talent, your abilities, what God's given you, and maybe to trust God more with your treasure.
[time=1666] The commitment cards we'll be doing at the end will give you a good venue for that.
[time=1669] But maybe God puts something on your heart right now.
[time=1671] And if he did, here's what I challenge you to do.
[time=1673] Write that down in your notes.
[time=1674] You can cover it up.
[time=1675] You can even write it in code if you want to.
[time=1677] So somebody beside you doesn't see it.
[time=1679] But just write it down as a commitment right now, even in the moment.
[time=1682] A lot of times we save that for after the sermon, but I challenge you to take a minute.
[time=1686] In your time, your talents, your treasures, what's God asking you to trust him more with?
[time=1691] Maybe it's to get up five minutes earlier to read that devotion that you've got saved in your phone, but you've yet to take the time to just dig into it.
[time=1699] Maybe it's to spend five more minutes with your kids before work or after work.
[time=1705] Maybe it is something that God's prompted you to take a step of serving, to use your gifts and your talents and you know you've got something there.
[time=1712] And I'll tell you, we have a talented group of people here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=1715] Every person I meet, it amazes me.
[time=1718] The gifts that God has given to his body, which is the church.
[time=1722] You may say, well, why do you use the Black Hawk uses the word "body" a lot when we talk about the church?
[time=1727] Why?
[time=1728] Because we are a body where the hands, the feet of Jesus, and it only works.
[time=1733] Our bodies only work and function properly when every single part of the body does its part.
[time=1738] And when we all jump in with all of our uniqueness and all of our different talents and our different abilities, then and only then can the body of Christ look like what Jesus intended when He said, I'm going to build my church and the gates of hell can't even prevail against it.
[time=1752] So how can your talent contribute to the body of Christ?
[time=1757] And then your treasure.
[time=1759] Maybe something resource-wise, money-wise, God's laid on your heart.
[time=1762] What has God asked you to do?
[time=1764] It could be the most important thing you do is just to jot that down right now as a commitment before Him.
[time=1768] And I told you I would say this again this week.
[time=1770] We said it every single week of the series because it all comes down to this.
[time=1773] We all say, well, they have more than I do, more money, more time, more talent.
[time=1778] I'm not very talented.
[time=1779] I don't really have anything to bring to the table.
[time=1781] If you think that, then this message is for you and I'm going to get there in just a minute.
[time=1785] But before we do, the statement is simply this.
[time=1788] It's not what you have, it's what you do with what you have.
[time=1793] Say that with me last time, it's our last chance to do that together.
[time=1796] It's not what you have, it's what you do with what you have.
[time=1801] And you have something to offer and here's how I know that.
[time=1804] If you're like me, you've heard me say that I believe and I'm a living, walking testimony of the fact that God doesn't call the equipped, but God always equips the calm.
[time=1814] I'm going to say that again, God doesn't call the equipped, but He always equips the calm.
[time=1819] That's who I am, the shy kid in the back of the class who always said the one thing He would never do is be a pastor like his dad.
[time=1826] Now, pastor's a church because God doesn't call the equipped.
[time=1829] He doesn't call people who already have everything that they need to do what He has in mind, but He calls people who are willing and just saying, "God, I'm available." And I was reluctantly, very reluctantly available, but He equips the people who are available.
[time=1841] He equips those that He calls and in your life, whatever He's calling you to, He will lead you through and equip you to do.
[time=1849] I promise you in your life.
[time=1851] And here's how I know when it comes to your time, your talent, and your treasures.
[time=1854] The heart of all three, write this down if you're taking notes so important.
[time=1857] The heart of all three is grace.
[time=1863] Mercy is getting something, is not getting something you do deserve.
[time=1868] If I have mercy on you, you deserve an F on that test, but I'm going to curb the grave a little bit and give you something that maybe you didn't deserve.
[time=1876] Mercy is not getting something you do deserve, but grace is getting all the stuff.
[time=1880] Hear me?
[time=1881] Grace is getting all the stuff that I don't deserve.
[time=1884] With Jesus, you get both.
[time=1886] We get the mercy of God.
[time=1887] I don't deserve to be able to look at God and pray.
[time=1891] I don't deserve for my prayers to make it through the roof of this building.
[time=1895] I certainly don't deserve eternal life and spending forever eternity with Jesus in heaven.
[time=1901] I don't deserve that.
[time=1903] But God says I'm going to have mercy on you, and I'm going to give you the grace of God.
[time=1909] The grace of God.
[time=1911] And how do we get the grace of God?
[time=1913] That's why I love Christmas because that's when grace came onto the scene and changed history.
[time=1919] The moment Jesus stepped his foot into this world, like that quiet winter snow, he didn't come with the wildfire.
[time=1925] He came like a quiet winter snow that first Christmas morning, he changed history.
[time=1930] Why did he change history?
[time=1932] How did it change religion?
[time=1933] Before Jesus got here, religions were rampant.
[time=1936] Religions were everywhere.
[time=1937] You may be caught up in today, all of the religions around you.
[time=1941] You may be caught up in the religious mindsets, the different religions that I can pursue, and you're digging through all of that today.
[time=1947] And here's what I'll tell you.
[time=1948] What's so different about Christianity?
[time=1950] What is different about Jesus?
[time=1952] What is different about Jesus is this one simple word named grace.
[time=1958] And grace is not just some subject.
[time=1960] Grace became a person when Jesus walked onto the scene.
[time=1964] Think about that.
[time=1966] Grace became a person.
[time=1967] It wasn't just a topic that we shared with each other anymore.
[time=1970] It changed history because Jesus stepped on the scene.
[time=1973] Grace became a person.
[time=1975] And then now because of the person, the name above every name, the name of Jesus, we have
[time=1981] everything we need, everything we need for life and for godliness.
[time=1986] We're going to look at that.
[time=1987] So look at 1 Peter chapter 4 and verse 10.
[time=1989] It's in your notes and on the screen here.
[time=1991] It says, "As each has received a gift," and this is for those of you I told you, I'm going to speak to those of you who feel inadequate.
[time=1998] Hmm.
[time=1999] Because I am you.
[time=2000] I understand.
[time=2001] I don't know what you're thinking and what you're feeling, but I'm sure I can identify with you in so many ways.
[time=2005] Every Sunday I get the privilege of preaching God's Word.
[time=2008] I battle.
[time=2009] I have this little whisper in my ear just so you know.
[time=2011] Let you enter the heart of your pastor for a minute every Sunday before I come up here.
[time=2016] Every week.
[time=2017] I always battle.
[time=2018] Who do you think you are?
[time=2020] All these people coming and trusting, listening to you preaching the Word of God.
[time=2024] Who do you think you are?
[time=2025] Do you remember that thought you had last week?
[time=2027] I do have bad thoughts sometimes just so you know, sorry to disappoint you.
[time=2031] You can laugh.
[time=2033] It's okay.
[time=2034] You do too.
[time=2037] Every week though, you don't have what these people need.
[time=2041] Who do you think you are?
[time=2043] But every single week I have to remind him and in so doing remind me that he's right.
[time=2050] I don't have what it takes.
[time=2053] I'm not sufficient.
[time=2055] He is sufficient and he is sufficient on my behalf and hear me.
[time=2059] You may amen because I'm talking about me, but he's sufficient on your behalf too.
[time=2064] Whatever you need.
[time=2065] Grace is sufficient for you.
[time=2069] Hear me.
[time=2070] His grace is sufficient for you.
[time=2072] I don't know what you're battling with.
[time=2073] I don't know what inadequacies, insufficiencies and pain you brought into these buildings.
[time=2078] But his grace is enough for you.
[time=2083] First Peter 4, 10.
[time=2084] If you don't believe me.
[time=2087] As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another as good stewards.
[time=2092] Say that with me, stewards of God's varied grace.
[time=2097] Now here's the thing.
[time=2099] It's one thing to be a steward and a steward as a manager.
[time=2103] A steward is someone who has been entrusted with something that's not our own.
[time=2107] It's not mine.
[time=2108] I'm going to let you take it, borrow it, use it, take care of it and manage it.
[time=2112] And really everything in life is that.
[time=2114] Is it not?
[time=2115] If we look at what the Bible says about what we've been entrusted with, it's all his anyway.
[time=2120] That's what being a steward is, it's a manager.
[time=2122] It's one thing to be a manager, a steward of God's, the time that he's given us.
[time=2127] The talent that he's given us, the treasure that he's given us.
[time=2130] But the heart of all three of those, we don't deserve any of those things.
[time=2134] I don't have that to bring to the table.
[time=2136] The heart of all three of those is grace.
[time=2140] Because he gave me what I don't deserve in my time, my talent and my treasure.
[time=2145] But here's what he's saying.
[time=2147] Here is what that passage wants to speak to you today through the power of God's word, is that you are sufficient because of nothing to do with you, but all because of Jesus and
[time=2157] his grace.
[time=2158] And he has asked you to be a manager, an administrator of the very grace of God that saves your soul.
[time=2167] That'll change how you look at time, talent and treasure, my friends, when we realize that
[time=2173] all of it is a gift from God, but I'm so humbled to think about the fact that God wants
[time=2180] to use me, me, that same God that looks me back in the mirror every morning, that I get
[time=2187] so disgusted with sometimes.
[time=2190] He wants to use me to be a manager, a giver outer of his grace.
[time=2199] He wants me to give out his grace, he wants me to manage it, me to be a steward of that as a part of a body, as a part of a team to which every person has a gift and it's a unique gift, that almost sounds like a perfect combination, it is, it is the perfect combination.
[time=2214] And that's why Jesus said, I'm going to build my church and the gates of hell can't even prevail against it.
[time=2220] This is why it's possible.
[time=2222] It has nothing to do with you and me to begin with, it has all to do with that little baby who came in the most humble of forms, that first Christmas morning and the grace that he gives to us that we get to experience, not just on that Christmas morning, knowing
[time=2237] that he came, but knowing that he came for a purpose.
[time=2240] Let's answer our second question and that is, how do I stay on track?
[time=2244] How can I stay on track?
[time=2246] This is some important stuff already just to know what we've been entrusted with and hopefully you feel like now that's a lot more than I even bargained for.
[time=2256] I didn't really look at it that way, perhaps.
[time=2259] Grace being the heart of my town, town and treasures, I've never thought about it that way.
[time=2264] I'm entrusted with a lot more than I thought.
[time=2265] Now, wow, I sure don't want to get off track with that stuff.
[time=2269] Can I get a name in?
[time=2271] If it's that important, if it's that crucial, if it really is all that you say it is, how
[time=2277] can I stay on track with it?
[time=2278] I want to give you three words.
[time=2279] The first is truth, truth, write that down if you're taking notes.
[time=2282] Three key words that will help you stay on track.
[time=2285] So in this passage, go back to verse number 20 and 21.
[time=2289] It says, "O Timothy, guard the deposit entrusted to you, avoid the irreverent babble and contradictions of what is falsely called," what?
[time=2299] Knowledge.
[time=2301] Important word.
[time=2302] Underline that.
[time=2303] Falsely called knowledge for by professing it.
[time=2304] Some have swerved from the faith.
[time=2305] Now, let's talk about knowledge.
[time=2306] That word in this passage is gnosis, G-N-O-S-I-S.
[time=2309] This is very important, so I want to give you the alternative word for knowledge.
[time=2315] Knowledge that we see in scripture, gnosis is this word.
[time=2318] It literally means what we would interpret as knowledge, head knowledge, something that we know intellectually.
[time=2323] It's something that we know, something that we read, something that we sponge up as a sponge that learns, those kind of things.
[time=2330] That's what we're talking about here.
[time=2331] So he's saying, "Because of this false knowledge, irreverent babble, things that get me off track, the false teaching Paul knew at this season, at this season of life, at this season of Timothy's ministry, there was a lot of false teaching going on around him.
[time=2345] False teaching meaning things that didn't pertain to Jesus.
[time=2348] False teaching about Jesus not being the way, the truth, and the life, and that no one could come to the Father except through him.
[time=2355] Things that would cause people to swerve from the faith that can truly save people's souls." Now, we can do that, too.
[time=2361] That's the false knowledge that he's talking about, gnosis.
[time=2364] But I want to read you a verse from 2 Peter.
[time=2367] You can jot this down.
[time=2368] You don't have to turn there, but just jot this down.
[time=2370] Look at it this week.
[time=2371] 2 Peter chapter 1.
[time=2372] I've referenced it already in the past several weeks.
[time=2375] 1 Peter, 2 Peter, rather, chapter 1, verses 2 and 3.
[time=2379] This is at the end of Peter's life.
[time=2381] And we know that he was crucified, much like his Savior.
[time=2385] So much to that story.
[time=2386] Won't preach that sermon today.
[time=2388] But at the end of his life, this is what he wanted people to know.
[time=2391] This is what he wrote to you and to me.
[time=2393] He said, "May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge," in the knowledge, he says it two times, "of God and of Jesus our Lord." His divine power.
[time=2403] Here, this is so good.
[time=2404] This goes back to our grace discussion here, "has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness." He said it gives us some of the things that pertains to life and godliness.
[time=2416] You guys with me today?
[time=2417] He said everything, all things that pertain to life and godliness through the knowledge,
[time=2424] through the knowledge of him who has called us to his own glory and excellence.
[time=2429] Now that word knowledge is not gnosis, G-N-O-S-I-S.
[time=2434] It's epignosis, E-P-I-Nosis, E-P-I-G-N-O-S-I-S.
[time=2440] Now you say, what does that matter?
[time=2442] There are a lot of different words in the Greek language for what we would just have one word for like love.
[time=2447] There's a lot of different forms of love in the Greek language, but we just say love.
[time=2450] Same thing here.
[time=2451] It's still knowledge, but it's a different kind of knowledge.
[time=2453] Remember gnosis was this kind of knowledge, head knowledge, epignosis, if you had to sum it up to just one little phrase, it's heart knowledge.
[time=2461] It's knowledge that does a little bit more than becomes something that you know.
[time=2464] It's knowledge that affects your life.
[time=2466] It's knowledge that permeates your heart.
[time=2469] It goes from the head to the heart and it starts to change and transform everything about your life.
[time=2474] It's knowledge that changes everything.
[time=2476] It's knowledge that changes how I look at my neighbor.
[time=2481] It's knowledge.
[time=2482] This is the hardest part for some of us.
[time=2484] It's knowledge that changes how I look at myself.
[time=2488] Now there's a lot of knowledge that might change my perspective in one area or another, but the only knowledge, epignosis, the only knowledge that changes how I look at everything is the heart knowledge of knowing Jesus on a personal basis.
[time=2502] There's a big difference.
[time=2504] So truth, building your life on truth is so important if you want to stay on track.
[time=2508] There was an old farmer.
[time=2509] I read a story one time of an old farmer who couldn't afford oats to feed his mule.
[time=2514] I'm a kind of a farmer guy if you didn't know.
[time=2516] We have horses and so yeah, this kind of spoke to my heart.
[time=2519] So if it doesn't speak to yours, just bear with me.
[time=2522] Maybe it's just for me.
[time=2523] But this farmer, he had a mule and he couldn't afford to feed the oats and things that he needed to feed him.
[time=2528] So he had a sawmill and so he said, "Well, I wonder if I could just introduce a little bit by a little bit some sawdust in place of the oats.
[time=2536] That's going to save me some money." So he introduced just a pinch of sawdust.
[time=2540] Everything's fine.
[time=2541] The next day he put a handful, saved the oats.
[time=2543] The next day he put two handfuls.
[time=2545] The next day he put a little bucket full and before long it was almost all sawdust.
[time=2549] And then everything was fine until one day, down goes the mule.
[time=2555] He's dead.
[time=2557] And in the same way spiritually, think about it this way.
[time=2561] Just like error, just like lack of truth, just like false teaching, just like not looking
[time=2567] at Jesus and not looking at ourselves, the way that he intends, not knowing this true Jesus, doesn't seem to impact you very much very quickly.
[time=2575] A little at a time it enters in and it erodes truth to the point.
[time=2579] And here's what I'll tell you, eroded truth will always lead to eroded trust.
[time=2585] Just like that mule, if we just let just a little bit of a mindset sneak into our life, it's so important to stay in the Word.
[time=2591] It's so important to stay around other believers, to do life alongside of other people.
[time=2596] Every single day because we're not very good on our own.
[time=2599] Can I get the name in?
[time=2600] I'm not very good on my own.
[time=2601] I need you guys.
[time=2603] I need all of you alongside of me, but more than anything I need Jesus and I need the real Jesus because just like that mule, even if I just introduced a little bit of lack of truth and a little bit more and a little bit more, eventually it will kill me on the inside spiritually.
[time=2617] Some of you are at that place where you're at a near death experience spiritually.
[time=2622] And you've gotten off track and it may be because the truth you're trusting in isn't the Jesus that you thought it was.
[time=2629] It may not be the real Jesus that came that first Christmas morning like a winter snow.
[time=2633] You may have started trusting in yourself or in other people.
[time=2636] I don't know what you may be trusting in, but what has gotten you off track?
[time=2640] What truth have you been pursuing?
[time=2642] I want to follow the way, the truth and the life, and his name is none other than Jesus Christ.
[time=2648] And he wants to be that in your life today in this moment.
[time=2652] And I would challenge you.
[time=2653] A lot of times we get caught up in knowledge and some of you may even feel like right now, good, that means I just need to get in another Bible study.
[time=2659] I'm all for Bible studies, hear me.
[time=2664] But what I'm not for is getting in another Bible study that gives you head knowledge about the Bible but doesn't permeate your heart and become something that you take out into the world, into the snow, into your neighbors all around you in your life.
[time=2677] That's what Jesus didn't like about the Pharisees.
[time=2679] If you didn't notice, Jesus never condemned and punched a sinner.
[time=2684] He never really got in the face of a sinner.
[time=2686] He confronted and used truth, but he always did it through love.
[time=2688] The only time he got really fired up, read it, study it in the scriptures is what the Pharisees, why?
[time=2693] Because they knew the truth.
[time=2695] They had the gnosis, they had the knowledge, but they were paralyzed.
[time=2699] They got paralyzed by the knowledge so much that they didn't do anything with it.
[time=2704] They wanted to hold everybody to all the rules of the knowledge that they had in their head without letting it permeate their heart to care for their neighbors that were starving and hurting all around them in their life.
[time=2715] And with that, Jesus had no patience and no tolerance.
[time=2720] Heart knowledge, epicnosis, is something that becomes something that goes, it's knowledge that goes because it does more than just stick in these old brains of ours and gets into our heart and gets into our life.
[time=2733] And that's the truth that God wants you to pursue today.
[time=2735] The second thing is training, training, not just truth, but training.
[time=2740] I remember when I decided I wanted to get in shape one time, anybody ever had those journeys?
[time=2746] We always say one time, right?
[time=2747] You always say, "Oh, I used to be in pretty good shape, you know, back in the day." Well, I got, I decided, "Well, I'm going to get a personal trainer to help me out." And I thought, "I can handle it.
[time=2757] I'm still young and tough and, man, I got this big guy, he was a huge bodybuilder, black
[time=2764] guy.
[time=2765] We became really great friends.
[time=2766] His name was Billy, and Billy, you might even be watching this, and so this is for you.
[time=2770] But I'll never forget the day after.
[time=2772] Billy worked me to the bone.
[time=2775] I mean, I never worked that hard in a gym in all my life.
[time=2779] The next day, I walked around like this.
[time=2784] But I remember, I wanted more, though, because I knew something was happening.
[time=2789] I knew I was gaining some traction, and I was crazy.
[time=2792] I went back to Billy some more, and Billy worked me again, and the next day it was like this
[time=2799] again.
[time=2800] It's all about, and even spiritually speaking, just like it was with that guy, we want more of what really makes a difference, right?
[time=2806] You're not going to do a workout if you don't think it's doing something and changing something in your life, right?
[time=2811] What trainer are you choosing?
[time=2813] What is training you?
[time=2814] Titus.
[time=2815] Look in your notes.
[time=2816] Titus chapter 2, "I'm not going to get to preach this passage today because we do have much time coming up right, but one day we'll preach this passage, and I'm telling you, this excites me because it's the grace of God, the heart of my time, my talent, and my treasure that does a little bit of this training." Look at Titus 2, 11 through 12, "For the grace of God has appeared." Who is that?
[time=2836] It's Jesus.
[time=2837] Again, it's a person.
[time=2839] It's not just a subject or a topic or a term.
[time=2842] The grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people.
[time=2846] Notice that we're training, say it with me, "Training us to renounce ungodliness, worldly
[time=2853] passions and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age."
[time=2859] So what does the training?
[time=2862] It's grace.
[time=2863] It's Jesus.
[time=2864] He's your trainer.
[time=2866] You think you had a, I thought I had a pretty good personal trainer in that gym.
[time=2869] How about having Jesus, having the grace of God, and that's the ongoing manifestation, the ongoing way that Jesus is made visible in your life.
[time=2877] It's His grace because who needs grace every day, anybody?
[time=2881] All of us need grace every day, so it's an ongoing thing.
[time=2884] And so it's also what trains us.
[time=2886] It's what empowers us to live the kind of life that we are looking at.
[time=2891] And here's what it boils down to.
[time=2893] Here's what it leads to.
[time=2894] We talked about how can I stay on track, it's truth, it's training.
[time=2899] Here's what it leads you to.
[time=2900] It leads you to trust.
[time=2902] The heart of being entrusted is trust.
[time=2906] I'm going to give you a quick review of all of the bottom lines that we've looked at in the series, and you'll see, I hope, how they tie together to lead us to a moment of trust in our life.
[time=2916] We started by talking about what you treasure reveals what you trust, what you prioritize, what you fit in the treasure chest of your life.
[time=2923] You can only fit so much, but what you treasure, what you prioritize, that points you to what you're trusting.
[time=2929] It just leads to transformation and it changes everything, how I see the world around me, how I see me, it transforms me.
[time=2935] True life begins last week when I realized that this life is not it, when I live in light of eternity and therefore build this foundation for my future that transcends everything else in life.
[time=2946] And then today, it boils down, being entrusted.
[time=2949] It boils down simply to what you're established in, who you establish your life upon today,
[time=2955] that firm, permanent fixture in your life.
[time=2958] I'm going to ask you to close your eyes and just think about for a moment what that means for you.
[time=2964] There's a lot that's been said, and in a moment, we're going to enter in a time of worship
[time=2970] where we just give.
[time=2972] And maybe for some of you, you know, that commitment card, it has a lot of things there about your finances and your money, but maybe God gave you something about your time or your talent or your treasure or about grace, and you just want to write it down and bring that forward as your commitment to God today.
[time=2986] Whatever God's doing.
[time=2987] We're here just to walk with you, but the most important thing I can tell you, every headbound, every eye closed, we're going to prepare to sing together and worship as we do this, but the most important thing I can tell you is that if you don't know Jesus today, he knows you.
[time=3004] If you don't know Jesus today, he wants nothing more than to change your life from the inside out.
[time=3011] And some of you may be that person that's saying, "I would if I could, but I just can't
[time=3017] write because I need to get some things squared away.
[time=3021] I need to get some things straightened out before I take that step, Pastor.
[time=3025] I want to challenge you and tell you that I truly believe if that's your mindset, you'll never get ready because what I would submit to you is that none of us are ready for the grace of God because we don't deserve it.
[time=3037] You can't have things lined up enough to become a Christian and be saved.
[time=3042] It all starts when you just surrender.
[time=3044] What does surrender mean?
[time=3046] You say these terms in church, what does that really look like?
[time=3048] It looks like me saying, "Jesus, this life has been all about me if I'm honest.
[time=3052] I thought I was leaning on you.
[time=3054] I thought I've been praying to you and trusting you, but I really haven't.
[time=3057] I've really been trusting in me.
[time=3058] I've really been trusting in everything but you, but today Jesus, I lay all of that down at your feet." And I say, "Jesus, I'm yours.
[time=3066] I know you died.
[time=3067] I know you did that for me.
[time=3068] I know you lived a sinless life that I could never live.
[time=3071] And Jesus, I know you're alive.
[time=3073] I know you rose from the dead.
[time=3077] And I give you me, all of me.
[time=3080] I want this knowledge to go from my head to my heart.
[time=3083] Jesus, save me." Those are just some terms and words, but I believe many of you in this room, your heart has already been saying those words and screaming it to Jesus right now.
[time=3093] It's not a prayer that saves you.
[time=3095] I'm not going to lead you in one because your heart's saying it.
[time=3097] Would you take just a moment in your own words, straight from your heart, cry out to Jesus and trust Him with all He's entrusted to you, especially your eternity.
[time=3108] We do that right now.
[time=3113] So being entrusted really boils down to being established.
[time=3117] And so in your life today, as we've pondered that thought, what does it look like for you to be established in Jesus today?
[time=3122] The heart of being entrusted really comes back to trust.
[time=3126] Every week of the series, that's what we've looked at, that key word, trust.
[time=3129] In the middle of the word "interested," is the little word, trust, that carries such a big meaning for your life.
[time=3135] And so today, where has your trust been established?
[time=3138] If it's not been in Jesus, then as we've talked about, I want to challenge you not to complicate what God has made so simple in your life, the gospel.
[time=3146] The gospel is simple, and it's something that will transform you from the inside out.
[time=3151] And today, if God's stirring inside of you, we're here because of this moment.
[time=3156] This is that moment that your life has been building up to, and we love being a part of these moments, and I want to challenge you not to hold back anymore, to stop looking over the edge of the ledge and just take the leap of faith and give your life to Jesus today.
[time=3169] It really is as simple as we've talked about.
[time=3171] It really is as simple as saying, "Jesus, I do need you.
[time=3174] Jesus, I know you died on the cross for me, and that after three days you rose from the dead, that you are alive, and I want to give you all of me." This life has been mine so far, but now it's yours.
[time=3185] I give you me, and I want to challenge you to take that step right now in this moment.
[time=3190] Press pause.
[time=3191] Step away.
[time=3192] Do what you've got to do to get that straight in your life, and we want to walk alongside of you, and we want to help you on that journey, and it truly is the beginning of something new.
[time=3200] And if you've taken that step, I want to get one of these booklets in your hands simply called beginning steps.
[time=3205] As I've told you, this trust journey with Jesus is the beginning of something new in your life, and we want to walk through these beginning steps with you.
[time=3213] We want to get one of these in your hand, and more than that, though, we want to hear from you and get to know you.
[time=3217] We want to know what God's teaching you, what God's doing in your heart, in your soul, in your life, and in your journey.
[time=3222] So allow us to do that.
[time=3223] We're going to give you some information on your screen, an email address, phone number, website that you can contact us, lots of venues, so that you can just tell us what God's doing.
[time=3232] Maybe you've got a story.
[time=3233] Maybe this ministry has impacted you in some way.
[time=3235] We want to hear about that way that it's impacted you.
[time=3238] We want to celebrate with you, and we want to help you walk with you every step of the way.
[time=3242] So thank you for spending time with us here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=3245] We value our partnership with you, and even if we haven't met, I would love to change that soon.
[time=3250] We want to invite you to come and join us at here at Black Hawk Ministries.
