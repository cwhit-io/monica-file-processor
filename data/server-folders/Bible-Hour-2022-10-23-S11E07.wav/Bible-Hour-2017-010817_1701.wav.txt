[time=0] You
[time=30] [MUSIC - 1434 seconds]
[time=1484] When you come to know Jesus as your Savior, you give your life to Him. You're given the best prize inside that eternity will ever offer. You will never have a better prize than what you are gifted the moment you lay your life down at the feet of Jesus and say Jesus this life that was mine is no longer mine it's now yours. That is the gospel by the way. Some of you came here today to hear some encouragement but you really didn't know it God wanted to send you here to hear that.
[time=1513] To hear that. To hear that the gospel is that simple. To hear that you're 2017 and your eternity hinges on your decision about Jesus Christ. But when you make that step what He does, I love the thought of a deposit. We have a guaranteed deposit. I like guarantees in life, don't you? We don't find very many, do we, in this life. But we're guaranteed a deposit of the Holy Spirit. Here's what that means. You give your life to Jesus.
[time=1541] And now He wants to indwell be a part of walk alongside of be with you every step of the way. And so what He does is He sends His presence through His Holy Spirit to be a part of your life from that day you are sealed. It's a guaranteed deposit that seals you until the day of redemption. What does that mean? It means He is with you and He will not leave you or forsake you no matter what until we're with Him for all of eternity.
[time=1569] That's a pretty good prize inside. What do you think? Mr. Crackerjack has nothing on that prize. But I want you to know today that your peace that has maybe been so elusive in your life, the peace that you're after comes from that prize inside. It comes from the presence of God in your life.
[time=1589] Now that seems pretty simple. Seems pretty surface. And you would say I'd like a little more than that please. Well the Apostle Paul says I've got something for you. Now Colossians 3, how many of you know who Vince Lombardi is? Vince Lombardi.
[time=1604] It was a coach of the Green Bay Packers. He was one of, if not maybe the best coach the NFL has ever seen. Now in football, here's what he would do. Now if you don't know Vince Lombardi, the Super Bowl trophy that we'll be seeing played for here soon.
[time=1618] He's named after this coach, Vince Lombardi. It's the Vince Lombardi trophy for the Super Bowl. But there's something pretty unique and interesting about Vince Lombardi. He would start every season off the same way.
[time=1629] He come in and think about it. He's not coaching Peewee League here. He's got Bart Starr. He's got the best of the best in the room. Think about a year after winning the championship. They just won it all.
[time=1640] He comes in the room, sits down and they expect and then it's time to get the game plans, the playbooks and all these kind of things that start the season. But every year, year after year, he would do this one simple thing. He'd get out of football.
[time=1652] He'd hold it up and say, "Gentlemen, this is a football. It has laces here. If you grip it right, you throw it well, it'll spiral. I want you to pass this around and I want us to go back to some of the basics of the game."
[time=1667] And he would literally have these championship teams pass around a football and go over basics of the game.
[time=1675] So here's what today really is. I love this passage because really and truly, you could call that Vince Lombardi's "This is a football speech," if you will.
[time=1683] This is really, guys, this is a football speech for your new year, if we want to look at it that way. Let's get back to the basics.
[time=1691] Let's go back to what God's presence means inside of me and what that can do for my life. And it's really just four sentences that we're going to read. Colossians 3, 1, 3, 4.
[time=1702] But these four sentences, not only can be a "This is a football" back to the basics speech for your life, it's going to change how you look at this year. I truly do believe.
[time=1711] Let's look at three pictures of peace. That's what I want us to dig into today. Colossians chapter 3. Who's ready for the word this morning?
[time=1718] Colossians chapter 3, the first thing that I want to tell you about, the first picture of peace that we're going to dig into is what I'll call the external purpose, the external purpose of peace.
[time=1731] There's a purpose that gets attached to peace and it happens outside and around us in our life. Let's look at verses 1 and 2. That's where we see that picture coming from.
[time=1740] Paul says this. If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
[time=1751] Set your minds on things that are above. There's a theme there. Not on things that are on earth. Paul's there. That's where we see this external purpose.
[time=1760] So he says, set your minds on the things that are above, not on the things that are below, not on the things that are in the earth. Set your minds on things that are above and pursue those things that are above.
[time=1772] That's the external purpose. It's where peace begins to have a purpose for everyday life, how we see the world around us. And so two questions.
[time=1780] I just want you to reflect for a moment. If you're taking notes, maybe you jot your answer to these questions down. What things below, things of the earth, as Paul puts it.
[time=1790] What things below have been stealing your peace and maybe just adding pressure to your life? As you reflected on this last year, maybe this morning, maybe since you've been in the building, something has been stealing your peace and just adding pressure.
[time=1809] Second question. What things above does God want to replace those things below with today? What things above does God want to bring in to breathe life into your life today to replace those things below that have been stealing your peace?
[time=1829] So what things below are stealing your peace and adding pressure and what things above does God want to replace them with? Those are good questions to restart your year. If you haven't done any reflection, well, I just helped you out.
[time=1840] I just gave you some good reflection questions that will help you move into a new year in a different kind of a way. But as we think about, and as you write down your answers to those things, I want to give you a few foundational, purposeful things from scripture.
[time=1853] As Paul just reminded us of, these things of earth just don't last. It's like the cracker jack prize inside. It's a good prize. There's nothing wrong with cracker jacks. Nothing wrong with the little tattoo, the little sticker that you get on the inside, but they don't last.
[time=1869] They just go away. That tattoo, I'd stick it on my arm or something. I'd lick it, you know, put it on there probably the wrong way and it'd go away the next day. I'd be rationally playing around and it would be gone. Just like that are the things that still are peace and our joy and our contentment in life.
[time=1885] But Romans chapter 5, I think gives us quite an answer. Romans chapter 5, you can just jot that down. Romans 5, don't lose your place in Colossians, we'll be coming back.
[time=1893] Romans 5, 1 says, "Therefore, since we've been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." Romans 5, 1.
[time=1906] Think about this, peace with God. I want to give you a thought. And this is going to be an uncomfortable one. It's going to be one that's going to stretch you.
[time=1914] It's not going to be those goals that maybe you want to pursue with your life. But the thought is simply this, that peace with God always leads to peace with people.
[time=1923] Peace with God leads to peace with people. That's when our vertical peace, the peace we have because of our justification by faith. What does that even mean?
[time=1934] Justification by faith. That means we are brought into the realm of Jesus. We are made right with God, not because of what we can do, lest any man should boast Ephesians 2, not because of what we can do, but because of what he did.
[time=1949] We're justified. We're brought into the presence of God and we can be right in a right relationship with God because of our faith is Jesus Christ.
[time=1959] Now, that peace, that's the vertical peace. It always leads to horizontal peace. And some people do the whole idea that that vertical peace and the horizontal peace at all points back to the cross. You see that there?
[time=1971] And it does because we can't get there on our own. But the vertical peace we have with God always leads to horizontal peace with other people. And here's the challenge for you. You ready for this?
[time=1980] For many of us, if not all of us, the best way you could start your new year is to allow the peace that you found with God. First of all, if you haven't found it, start there and find that with him. And it's offered freely to you here today.
[time=1995] But if you found it, the best thing perhaps you can do with your new year is start your new year by letting the peace you found with God lead to some peace and restoration with somebody else in your life.
[time=2006] Because one of the best ways that the world around us sees Jesus in us and through us, and by the way, you're going to be the only Jesus some people will see today, perhaps.
[time=2019] You may be the only Bible somebody is ever going to read this year. Today, this week, you feel a little pressure yet?
[time=2029] But the beauty is the pressure is really not yours. There's a statement that Jessica and I've tried to live our life by. We heard Charles Stanley say it so many years ago and the statement is simply obey God and leave all the consequences to him.
[time=2042] We usually associate that we're consequences with a negative, but the consequences of obeying God are so great because he removes the pressure and gives us peace.
[time=2051] But the best thing I submit to you today that possible you could do to kick off your new year is to be an example of Jesus, that Jesus that somebody else will see, that Bible that somebody else will read because you make peace, horizontal peace with others because you've already got peace with God.
[time=2071] I don't know what that means for you. I don't know what phone call that looks like or visit down the road.
[time=2076] It's up to you. It's between you and the Lord, but I think that could be one of the best steps that you could take to build on the prize that you have inside.
[time=2084] Second thing, not just this external purpose of peace, set your mind on things above, not on the things below or the things of the earth.
[time=2092] The second thing is the internal. We're going from external now to internal because if you're going to do that external stuff, something's got to be happening here, folks.
[time=2099] The internal promise of peace. I love promises. I do not like broken promises, but I love when a promise is fulfilled.
[time=2110] And I could tell you that my God has never failed me. He's never broken a promise. He is always faithful. The Bible tells us and reminds us that he's faithful even when we are faithless.
[time=2124] He's faithful and he always fulfills his promises in your life. And there's some promises of peace that maybe are a little bit unconventional in verse number three.
[time=2133] So we read verses one and two, but Colossians three and verse three gives us some of those internal promises.
[time=2140] It says, "For you have died."
[time=2146] I thought we were getting some good internal promises here. I was looking for some encouragement. You're killing me, literally.
[time=2153] "For you have died," Paul says, "and your life is hidden with Christ in God."
[time=2161] I love Paul. I love the Bible. It's so relevant and so true. And so I'm going to start with that first phrase.
[time=2168] "For you have died." Look at somebody and say, "You're dead."
[time=2176] Think about this statement. I found this to be true in life when it comes to life, because we're talking about for you have died death.
[time=2185] In life, I found that nothing transforms my perspective on life more than thinking about death.
[time=2193] Nothing transforms my perspective on life more than when I think about death.
[time=2201] If you've ever been to a funeral of a loved one, some of you've done that recently, talked to several of you this morning, in fact.
[time=2209] It transforms how you see life. It changes everything. Christmas is a joyful time of year, but it also reminds you of death.
[time=2217] It reminds you of those that used to be at those gatherings that weren't there this year.
[time=2222] It reminds you of loss. It reminds you of those things that once were, that maybe aren't anymore.
[time=2230] It's a heavy thought, but God wants even thoughts about death to bring us to the life he has in front of you.
[time=2240] Even the worst, most dreary thoughts that you ever have, they can transform and change you to move your thinking to life.
[time=2250] And I think there's a great illustration of that in the story of Lazarus.
[time=2257] If you ever think you had an excuse to not do what God wants you to do, well, Lazarus was dead.
[time=2261] Nobody has a better excuse than that. But the story of Lazarus, he's a friend of Jesus.
[time=2266] It's good to have friends like Jesus, obviously, because he got sick and he died.
[time=2270] And Jesus, if you know the story, he was late. There's a whole other sermon there, maybe a series there.
[time=2274] We won't do that one today, but man, that's some good stuff.
[time=2277] So, Lazarus died. Jesus got there late. Or did he? That's kind of the point of the story in so many ways.
[time=2282] But Jesus got there and he said, "I'm here to see Lazarus." And they said, "No, he's dead. I love in the King James version."
[time=2288] It says, "He stinketh." Look at that. He stinketh. The body already smells.
[time=2295] He had already been dead so long that the body had been begun to decompose and he smelled.
[time=2300] It was too late, but Jesus came and raised him back to life.
[time=2304] Can you imagine being a part of that story? But let me ask you a question that might start to get a little personal.
[time=2310] Is it okay if I get a little personal? Can you imagine Lazarus in his life?
[time=2317] Think about the things that maybe stressed Lazarus out before he got sick and died.
[time=2322] The things that added pressure to his life. The things that stressed Lazarus out.
[time=2326] Do you think those things added pressure and stressed Lazarus out in the same way post-death?
[time=2333] Then they did pre-death? Or did he look at life a little bit different?
[time=2338] I don't think Lazarus and those discussions, everybody wanted to talk to him.
[time=2341] I mean, the dead guy who's now talking to me, I would want to interview that guy too, right?
[time=2346] Can you imagine Lazarus is not the guy going, "You know, I mean, it's cool. I was dead."
[time=2354] You know, everything's kind of the same now. I'm just going to keep going until I die again.
[time=2361] Peace.
[time=2364] No. If I were Lazarus, I'd be like, "Listen, you people, we've been getting it wrong all of this time.
[time=2370] We get so pressure. We get under such pressure. We get so stressed out by all of these things that don't matter.
[time=2376] Listen, I died. I was done. My life was over. And I got it back.
[time=2381] Now, let me tell you what you need to focus on because life looks different in light of death.
[time=2385] When you look at life in light of eternity, it changes everything.
[time=2389] "For you have died," Paul says. "For you have died."
[time=2395] That is when we get to say, "And your life is hidden with Christ, with God in Christ."
[time=2402] Jesus. Our life is hidden with Him because of Jesus, because we have died.
[time=2409] For some of you, the best thing you can do for your new year is to die to yourself.
[time=2416] It's to die to yourself. This life that you've been holding on to so tightly is to die to it.
[time=2421] That's why Paul says, "I die daily." You've wondered, why are they talking about death so much?
[time=2426] Because we have to die in order to find life. If we don't die to me, if I don't die to me, saying this life that I've been holding on to so tightly, I'm going to lay it at the feet of Jesus, then I can't find life. That's the internal promise of peace.
[time=2442] John 14, look at it on the screen with me, John 14 verses 25 through 27, Jesus says it this way,
[time=2448] "These things I've spoken to you while I am still with you, but the helper, the Holy Spirit,
[time=2454] the prize in sign, but the helper, the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name,
[time=2460] He will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I've said to you.
[time=2465] Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give it to you.
[time=2475] Let not your hearts be troubled. Neither let them be afraid."
[time=2482] Let that sink in for a moment in your life. I didn't say that to you, Jesus did.
[time=2488] He said it long, long ago knowing that you would be in this very place so that he could say, "Let your hearts be troubled. Peace I give to you. My peace I give to you. Not as the world can give.
[time=2499] Stop going after the stuff in the world. Die to that stuff. Let it be dead and pursue true peace with the internal promise that only my peace can bring to your life and to your journey."
[time=2511] Jesus wants to do that in your life right now. The prize inside gives you the peace within and the promise that Jesus gives you changes your perspective and it's all based on his presence.
[time=2522] It's all based on the prize of his presence and who he is, at least me to the third thing that I leave with you today.
[time=2529] Not just this external purpose, the internal promise that takes care of the inside and the outside.
[time=2534] Let's take it a step further. What's the foundation of it all?
[time=2537] It's the eternal person of peace, the eternal person of peace.
[time=2544] Take somebody and say, "Peace is a person." Tell him, "Peace is a person. Peace is a person and his name is Jesus."
[time=2554] We see this from verse number four of Colossians chapter three and I would say that these next six words in
[time=2561] verse number four of Colossians three really are six of the most important words that you will ever hear in your life.
[time=2570] The six of the most important words you will ever hear in your life. Back to that original question.
[time=2575] You ever ask God, "God, what's your plan for my life?" And how can I have peace as I try to find it because I'm pretty stressed out?
[time=2583] I feel the pressure of the world around me. God, what is your plan for my life?
[time=2590] I think he answers us so well in verse number four. Here's those six words, it starts right here.
[time=2595] When Christ, who is your life? When Christ, who is your life, we'll come back with that.
[time=2608] When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you will also appear with him in glory.
[time=2615] And that turns it to the eternal perspective. We'll get to spend forever eternity with Jesus one day based on his presence in our life right now and what we do with that presence. What we do with this question of Jesus.
[time=2626] That's why I started with that question. That's what the foundation of this whole passage, that's what the foundation of life is really all about. But there's something that is implied, something that is so applicable to your life right now in everyday life. And that is those six words.
[time=2641] And when Christ, who is your life? God, what's your plan for my life?
[time=2646] God looks back to us and says that I would be your life. God, what's your plan for my life?
[time=2656] I am your life. You say, well, that still doesn't answer the question about that job or that relationship
[time=2665] or that question or this question or that question and we've got all these questions.
[time=2669] But I think we find the answer that this is a football speech, the back to the basics part of life
[time=2675] and decision making for your new year that can transform how you make any and every decision you ever make.
[time=2682] You didn't come expecting business world health or family or parenting help, but it is all wrapped up in these six words.
[time=2689] When Christ, who is your life? God, what's your plan for my life? I am your life.
[time=2695] That means, what does that mean? That means that God is not just a component of my life.
[time=2700] He is the driving force behind every step that I take, every thought that I have, set your mind not on the things below, not on the things with theirs, but on the things above.
[time=2709] That's how that can happen. Have you ever tried that on your own? Getting your mind right.
[time=2714] I don't get very far without a little help because he is my life. He is my ability.
[time=2721] What that means for us today is that Jesus, not that job, not that relationship, and not even you or me at all,
[time=2729] Jesus, when Christ, who is your life, Jesus is your purpose. Jesus is your peace.
[time=2739] Jesus is the person of peace. Jesus is the answer to those questions that you've been pursuing.
[time=2746] You say, but I still have questions that I've been pursuing. I still have decisions that I have to make.
[time=2751] And here's what I would tell you. When we've truly realized that God's not just a component of my life.
[time=2756] He's a person of peace. He is my purpose. He is my promise. He is my peace. He is my answer.
[time=2763] When we get that, here's what happens. The ultimate focus, this is tough.
[time=2768] The ultimate focus of my life shifts away from my future and to Jesus.
[time=2775] Here's the beautiful part of that. A lot of times we say, we've got to focus on my future and pastor even got up and said, you need to evaluate your life and think about your future. And I do. I believe that's such an important thing.
[time=2783] But the more we understand, the more we understand that Jesus is our life.
[time=2790] We stop thinking so much about our future. We start thinking about Jesus and then here's the best part about it.
[time=2795] That's when he starts to clarify things about the future he had in mind all along.
[time=2800] You want God to clarify things about your future and your new year. Just focus on Jesus.
[time=2805] Jesus said he who has seen me has seen the Father. You want to see God. You want to see his plans for your life.
[time=2811] Look at Jesus. Focus on Jesus. Who is your life.
[time=2815] And when he's become something that's not just this component of your life that you pray to, you pick up the phone and dial whenever you've got a big decision.
[time=2822] But he is encompassing every thought that you have in your life and driving you forward.
[time=2827] It's then and only then that he becomes your life in such a way that your future isn't really the focus anymore.
[time=2833] Jesus is the focus and then Jesus brings your future into focus.
[time=2837] Think about that. When your future isn't the focus, Jesus is. He brings your future into focus.
[time=2843] That's a beautiful thought. That'll change your decision making. That'll change your life.
[time=2850] That's what God's going to do. I believe in somebody's heart today and it comes from the prize inside.
[time=2855] Some of you feel more overwhelmed or maybe more confused now than ever.
[time=2860] I thought Jesus was my life but maybe he's not. Maybe he's not as much as I thought he was.
[time=2865] Maybe he's been giving me an answer I didn't know and our minds start to swirl.
[time=2869] So here's what I would challenge you to do. Just take a deep breath. Do it with me.
[time=2877] And here's the homework assignment for this week. Rest. Rest.
[time=2885] You say but everything you just said requires a lot of work Kevin. I know.
[time=2889] But the best thing you can do is rest in the prize that you have inside.
[time=2893] Rest in the peace that only the prize of Jesus can bring about in a world that's full of pressure.
[time=2902] Take a breath. Know he's on the throne and nobody's going to remove him.
[time=2907] He's not going anywhere. People have tried for centuries to kick Jesus off the throne of the universe
[time=2914] and they've all failed and they will always fail because at the name of Jesus every knee is going to bow
[time=2922] and every tongue is going to confess. Nothing's going to change that.
[time=2927] That kind of gives you some peace doesn't it? If we're honest I can take a breath with that
[time=2933] and it reminds me of Colossians 1 27 that says the glorious riches of this mystery talking about the mystery of the gospel the mystery of Jesus which is Christ in you the hope of glory.
[time=2944] Christ in you is your hope of glory. It is your peace.
[time=2951] So write this down if you're taking notes. Peace comes from loving Jesus more than my future.
[time=2956] Peace comes from loving Jesus more than my future.
[time=2963] You've got to love Jesus more than you love your future because here's what happens when you do that.
[time=2969] Your future you stop asking God what's your plan for my life and you start saying God what's your plan for your life in me?
[time=2979] It's your life. It's not my life. What are your plans for your life? What are your plans? What's your future?
[time=2986] Your desired outcome. Not what's my future all about. I love what you have way more than what I think I can do for myself.
[time=2994] Jesus I love you more than I even love my future. That's when you can have this mindset that you've heard me talk about
[time=3000] so much that God's been fostering and attempting to build for years here in my life that is the answer is yes Lord.
[time=3007] Now what's the question? Not God give me the question I'll get back to you in two weeks after I have time to think about it.
[time=3014] The answer is yes Lord now what's the question? Jesus I love you more than I love my future.
[time=3021] The prize of Jesus is the portal of peace. The prize inside of Jesus and His presence in your life through the Holy Spirit.
[time=3030] That is what will give you peace in a world full of pressure. That's the portal that you've been looking for.
[time=3037] That's the doorway that the challenge is to walk through today.
[time=3041] I want to ask you just to reflect on that with and bow your heads with me for a moment.
[time=3044] We just think about what that means in your life, what that looks like for you, what step has God laid on your heart today as a result of that.
[time=3054] If you know Jesus today, how is this peace possible for you? If you know Jesus today, what does peace with Him mean for peace with other people?
[time=3066] What phone call do you need to make? What purpose, promise, or what do you need to do with this person of peace known as Jesus if you know Him today?
[time=3075] To start off your year, in a moment we're going to sing, just give you a moment to respond and worship. But I want to talk to those of you that I believe God brought here for one single purpose today.
[time=3086] And it was to find peace, but it wasn't to find peace about that decision that you're making, it was to find ultimate eternal peace with God through Jesus.
[time=3095] Now what does that look like? It looks like you saying God your life, this life you've given me is yours. And I'm just now truly seeing that.
[time=3105] To start my new year, I want to give you me, Jesus. That's salvation. If you were to say to me, I would love to know that if I died today, I'd spend eternity with Jesus, but I just don't know.
[time=3118] That's why God brought you here today. You've got an enemy whispering in your ear that it can't be that simple. This guy's just a smooth talker who's trying to talk you into something that really won't last.
[time=3131] I would submit to you today that it has nothing to do with anybody in your life except the person of peace who is Jesus. It is that simple.
[time=3140] With all heads bowed, all eyes closed, if that's you, then I want to give you a moment to just do what I believe you've already been doing in your heart.
[time=3148] You've already been screaming out to Jesus. Salvation comes from knowing that Jesus died for you, paying the price for your sins, a price you could never pay.
[time=3157] He lived that sinless life you could never live. And then he rose again after three days and he is alive today.
[time=3165] And it's all about surrender. It's all about faith that I trust in him to save me, not in me to save me.
[time=3173] That's what will save you today. And just in your own words, would you cry that out to him?
[time=3178] If you don't know, you have a relationship with God. Take a moment and do that right now.
[time=3195] [MUSIC - 190 seconds]
[time=3391] Well, I pray you've been blessed today, and maybe you are one of the people that I've just been talking about, that this new year, as you've entered 2017, God has started something new inside of you, and perhaps that new thing that he stirred up inside of you, that new goal, that new resolution, that really is a lot more than a resolution, or a goal is eternal life. And you've been making complicated what God has made so simple in your life, and today is that day where you're just going to lay your life down at the feet of Jesus.
[time=3420] It's not my life anymore, it's yours.
[time=3423] The gospel really is that simple.
[time=3425] It says very clearly in Scripture, and more importantly, Jesus said it directly to you and to me that anyone who believes on the name of the Lord Jesus, shall be saved.
[time=3435] Not will be saved if, or might be saved as long as.
[time=3439] No, you will be saved if you simply believe on Jesus as your Lord and your Savior.
[time=3445] What that simply means is you say to him, this life that was mine is no longer mine, I give it to you.
[time=3450] I believe you died for me, paying a price for my sin that I could never pay, because I couldn't live that perfect, sinless life that Jesus, you lived for me.
[time=3459] You died on that cross for me.
[time=3461] While you're on the cross, I was on your mind.
[time=3463] And Jesus, I believe you conquered death for me when you rose from the dead.
[time=3467] I believe you're alive, and this life that was mine, I give it to you.
[time=3471] It really is that simple.
[time=3472] And I challenge you to take that step today.
[time=3475] Don't hold back, don't wait any longer.
[time=3477] And if you have taken that step, or you'd like more information about taking that step in your life, or someone just to walk alongside of you, then we want to be that church.
[time=3485] We want to be that teammate in your life that can walk alongside of you.
[time=3489] And one of the ways we do that is through a booklet that we want to get in your hands.
[time=3492] This book is simply called Beginning Steps, because when you give your life to Jesus, it's not an end.
[time=3497] It's not a fire insurance that ensures you get to go to heaven and miss hell when you die.
[time=3502] It's something that goes so much deeper than that.
[time=3504] It's the beginning of a new life that changes us from the inside out.
[time=3508] And we want to get one of these books in your hand, because it's just going to help you walk through this new journey that you have now started with Jesus.
[time=3515] And so there's some information on the screen that will give you an opportunity to reach out to us so that we can send this to you.
[time=3520] And we'd love to have you here at Black Hawk Ministries to talk with you some more about the new journey that you started on today.
[time=3526] And so no matter where you're at today, no matter what God's done in your life, maybe even known Jesus for quite some time.
[time=3532] But today, God started something new inside of you.
[time=3535] You've realized that my future and finding peace in this world of pressure really does go back to loving Jesus more than I even love my future begin with.
[time=3544] God's got a future for you, and the future He has for you is much greater than any future you could ever draw up for yourself.
[time=3551] So follow Jesus and I look forward to following Him alongside of you with you, and we'll do this thing together that we call life and we'll be the church together as we find peace in a world of pressure.
[time=3562] I hope you've been blessed today and we hope to see you again very soon. God bless you.
