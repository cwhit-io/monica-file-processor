[time=60] Who walks on the waters, who speaks to the sea, who stands in the fire beside me.
[time=78] He rose like a lion, he pecked as a lamb, he carries my healing in his hand.
[time=91] Jesus, there is a name that comes in times of trouble.
[time=104] There is a song that comforts in the night.
[time=110] There is a voice that comes to storm the rages.
[time=118] Jesus, Jesus, who walks on the waters, who speaks to the sea,
[time=131] who stands in the fire beside me.
[time=137] He rose like a lion, he pecked as a lamb, he carries my healing in his hand.
[time=151] Jesus, Messiah, my Savior, there is power in your name.
[time=170] You walk on the waters, you speak to the sea,
[time=197] you stand in the fire beside me.
[time=203] You roar like a lion, you play as a lamb, you carry my healing in your hand.
[time=215] God, you walk on the waters, you speak to the sea,
[time=223] you stand in the fire beside me.
[time=229] You roar like a lion, you play as a lamb, you carry my healing in your hand.
[time=242] Jesus, there is no one like you, Jesus, there is no one like you.
[time=258] Thank you so much for watching today, we're so glad that you've given some time just to dig in with us today and I'm excited about what God is going to do in your life.
[time=266] That's what we're all about here at the Bible Hour and we want to thank you for giving us the opportunity just to speak into your life.
[time=272] We have a lot of opportunities and a lot of examples of people just like you that have written in that have seen their lives change by what we do here and that's why we do what we do.
[time=282] It's really not us at all, it's really all him and Jesus that changes the lives around us.
[time=288] I want to thank you just for watching us today, I want to tell you a little bit about this series that we're in, we're kicking off and we're going to be in for a couple of months called Inside Out.
[time=295] The thought behind it is that we tend to build inwardly, we tend to build walls around what's comfortable in our life but Jesus came to mess all of that up and if you've met Jesus, he's probably messed your life up in some way because what he came to do was to teach us what it's like to build the church inwardly so that outwardly we would have the kind of impact that he had in mind to begin with and today we're going to be talking about how the church is for everybody and in this series we're going to be going through the book of Philippians and so if you want to join us on that journey then get your Bibles out, look at the book of Philippians, read through that, we're going to be in the first part of Philippians chapter one today and even looking back in the book of Acts chapter 16 at how the church at Philippi even began to begin with and that's going to show us really some of the purposes that Jesus had for his church when he built it and said even the gates of hell cannot prevail against it and so I want to invite you to join us on this journey through Philippians as we look at what it means to live inside out and so at Black Hawk Ministries there's a lot of ways for you to stay connected with us, I want to share a few of those ways with you, first of all Google Play or the App Store, you can get our Black Hawk Church app, it's a great way to stay up on all of the happenings here at Black Hawk Ministries all around all of our Ministries here with all the different age groups, ways that you can get plugged in, we're also on social media, you can search for Black Hawk Ministries and the Bible Hour on Facebook as well as @bhalkministries on Instagram and on Twitter and then also you

[time=656] face, your life forever flowing to wash our sin and shame away
[time=686] [MUSIC]
[time=716] >>Let me start just by asking you a question right off the bat, have you ever been hurt
[time=737] inside the church before? Probably, it's a weird question to start a sermon with, weird
[time=744] question to start a series with, but I think it's really where we all are if we're honest, we all have preconceived ideas, preconceived past experiences that really dictate how we
[time=755] view the church today, but here's what I want us to do, in this series I want us to explore the church being the church the way Jesus intended for the church to be the church, because it's his church, it's not yours, it's not mine, it's his, he built it and so this series
[time=771] simply called inside out, we're going to be going through the book of Philippians in eight weeks, so brought your bibles, we're going to dive right in here in just a few moments, Philippians chapter one, Philippians chapter one and we're going to be even jumping around a little bit to the book of Acts to see how the church at Philippi began, but here's the thing about this idea of inside out, the natural tendency that we have as believers, as people
[time=795] really is simply this, that we like to build walls around what's comfortable, we like to put inside this safe place what's comfortable for us, what we like, we like to make things
[time=808] around us in things that are secure, we like to build security and not really let anything
[time=814] in and build all around us, so here's what Jesus came to do, he came to build his church inwardly, on the inside we're kind of like these clay pots, I'm going to reference the clay pot again toward the end of the message, but Jesus came to build his church kind of like this, that we're a clay pot, that inwardly we build, inwardly we grow so that we overflow
[time=832] so that we spill out to the world around us and we open ourselves up to allow people
[time=838] in, not wall at all, we tend to build inwardly, but Jesus said I want you to build inwardly
[time=844] and as I build my church and it grows inwardly, the outward impact is going to multiply, that's
[time=850] really what Jesus had in mind when he built his church, but it takes us being willing to be a clay pot molded by the potter's hands, so we're coming back to that idea in a little
[time=861] while, but that's the thought of the series of being inside out a church that truly is what Jesus envisioned is one that's going to turn outwardly, here's another question that we're going to be exploring through this series is what would the world look like,
[time=875] what would the world look like if the church actually function the way that it's founder
[time=881] intended for it to, we all have ideas of what the church should look like and a lot of times
[time=887] we build it off of personal preferences, but I'm talking about a lot more than personal preferences, what would the world look like if the church functioned exactly like Jesus
[time=896] intended for it to, wouldn't that change things around us and Jesus simply told us Matthew 28 that we are called to go make disciples, to go make disciples of all nations, baptizing
[time=909] them in the name of the father of the son and the Holy Spirit, that's our call, that's our commission, the great commission we so often call it, now in the book of Philippians you may say well why are we studying Philippians when talking about the church, there are a lot of reasons, but first of all I just love this book, it is such a joy filled book, when
[time=927] I look at Philippians as much or more so maybe than any other book in all of scripture Philippians tells us how we can live a life of joy, could anybody use a little joy today?
[time=938] I like joy, I like joyful people, in fact I try to not be around, and this may offend
[time=944] some of you, but it's okay, I try to not be around, you know, the Eor people, it's like mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
[time=953] You know you go into where, how's it going?
[time=955] Yeah, just another Monday.
[time=959] I like joy, I like life to be full of excitement, because, and especially when it comes to
[time=965] the church, because here's what I believe about the church, I truly believe, and I do everything I can to contribute to the church being the most joyful place on the planet, the most
[time=977] exciting place on the planet, because we celebrate, and we are built upon something that transcends
[time=983] that's far greater than anything that steals your joy, anybody ever met a joy stealer?
[time=989] Not just those people, but those things in life, those circumstances in life, those seasons in life, anything you will face that can steal your joy, what we have on the inside, because
[time=999] of Jesus Christ, as a part of His church, far transcends and exceeds anything you'll ever face.
[time=1007] So Philippians tells us a lot about joy, and, and here's why, first of all over a dozen times, I think it is, in this book alone, you'll see a reference to the word joy or something along those lines.
[time=1017] So it's obviously something that Paul wanted to get across as he was writing to the church at Philippi and to you and to me, but here's the unique thing, Paul, when he is writing this, is likely in his fourth year of confinement in prison at this time.
[time=1033] Think about that.
[time=1034] You're writing a letter to a church that you planted, and you're in prison for planting churches just like that one.
[time=1040] He's sitting there waiting, Nero's sentencing, what is it going to look like, and we know how his life ends that he ultimately dies for his faith.
[time=1049] He's no dummy, this Paul, who wrote this letter in most of our New Testament.
[time=1054] He knows where this is likely going, yet he's writing to us about what it means to live a joyful life.
[time=1060] He's an ultimate example of choosing to rejoice.
[time=1064] And so in your notes, there are several ways you can take notes.
[time=1066] If you're joining us online, we want to welcome you today, or if you've got notes in your bulletin there, or your church app, or however you choose to do that, we're glad you hear and want you to take notes.
[time=1075] Your spot there for your notes is simply this statement, to rejoice is a choice.
[time=1082] To rejoice is a choice.
[time=1087] Now that's an interesting statement, because there's a lot of times where it's really hard to choose to rejoice.
[time=1092] Philippians 4, 4, "Rejoice in the Lord always, Paul says," and again, I'm going to say it "rejoice," from prison.
[time=1099] He's choosing to rejoice, so do you think we can learn something from Paul about what it means to be a joyful Christian?
[time=1105] I think so.
[time=1106] Now, the theme of this letter, really, though, is Christian maturity.
[time=1109] I want to give us a little glimpse at Philippians, and that's what a lot of today is going to be before we get into a lot of the meat of the book itself.
[time=1116] But regardless of where you are, the theme today is really Christian maturity.
[time=1121] The theme of Philippians is really what it means to be a mature believer, a mature follower
[time=1128] of Jesus, and we'll see why that's really the theme in a moment.
[time=1131] But here's what I'll tell you, regardless of where you are, you may say, "Well, I'm a pretty immature Christian." You ever met one of those, by the way?
[time=1138] You ever been one of those, by the way?
[time=1140] I know I have.
[time=1141] I've fit that category and then some so many times in my life.
[time=1144] But regardless of where you are in the journey of being a mature Christian, today Paul wants
[time=1151] to give you a glimpse at how you can take that next step, how you can get unstuck.
[time=1156] Is that even a word?
[time=1157] It is now, unstuck, how you can leave the mud and the mire that just has got you stuck
[time=1164] in the same place in your Christian journey to move towards spiritual maturity.
[time=1169] And in this book, we're going to see the inside-out concept of how we like to build inwardly.
[time=1174] But Jesus said, "I want you to build inwardly so that there's an outward impact, an inside-out impact." What would the world look like if the church was the church Jesus intended?
[time=1182] I'm telling you, it would start by turning us inside out personally and individually.
[time=1187] And then it would turn us all inside out collectively and it would turn us upside down and it would shake us all around and it would mix us up and it would change the way we look at life in general.
[time=1198] I love Philippians because you ever had a coffee mug that just has the coffee verses, you know, the Bible verses on it, a lot of them probably came from Philippians.
[time=1207] You think about chapter one, we get this phrase, "To live is Christ and to die is game." Philippians, the second chapter, we get this idea of Jesus coming and it says, "Making Himself nothing for us came and took the form of a bondservant or a slave for us."
[time=1224] He humbled himself even to death on across Philippians 3.
[time=1228] We keep going and we keep looking at these concepts in Philippians 3.
[time=1231] He says, "I count all things, good things.
[time=1233] I count all things as rubbish compared to the exceeding greatness of knowing Jesus."
[time=1240] Then Philippians 4, even if you have no church background at all, you've likely heard Philippians 4, 13, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."
[time=1250] So it's full of all of these coffee cup verses, it's full of all these things, but here's something that sets a tone for where we're going in this series.
[time=1257] Very important thought here and the thought is simply this.
[time=1261] That when you look at all of Paul's writings, he wrote much of your New Testament and they were all letters to these churches, but this is the only letter that Paul wrote, the book
[time=1271] of Philippians, the letter to the church at Philippi.
[time=1273] This is the only letter that Paul wrote that was not purposed towards correcting bad behavior.
[time=1281] You see a little glimpse here and there of that, but the purpose of this letter was not to correct bad behavior.
[time=1287] You look at his other letters, it's like, "Stop doing this and start doing this.
[time=1290] Come on, guys.
[time=1291] Get your act together." We learn a lot from those books because, well, we kind of fit that category.
[time=1296] Can I get amen?
[time=1298] Because we need to be told, "Quit doing this and start doing this." Even though we know we don't do so many times, and so a lot of his letters were purposed there, not Philippians, not his letter to the church at Philippi.
[time=1309] So what was he doing?
[time=1310] That tells me that perhaps maybe this is a church that gives us a good glimpse at what a mature church looks like, at what an inside-out church looks like because he has this exceeding
[time=1320] joy and love for this church.
[time=1323] Now, you may say, "Well, they just must have had it good." No, they were one of the poorest churches that Paul wrote to, yet they were one of the most generous churches that helped Paul the most when he needed help even financially as you read through the Scriptures.
[time=1335] They didn't have everything but they chose to rejoice.
[time=1339] To rejoice is a choice.
[time=1342] Now, that's an interesting thing about Philippians, so let's look at Philippians.
[time=1345] I want to read the first eight verses.
[time=1347] We're going to look at verses one through eleven together today, but let's start with the first eight verses because we'll see really a picture of Paul's gratitude for this church at Philippi.
[time=1356] Anybody ready for the Bible this morning?
[time=1359] Paul and Timothy, Timothy's servants of Christ Jesus to all the saints in Christ Jesus who
[time=1365] were at Philippi with the overseers and the deacons, graced to you in peace from God our
[time=1371] Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1373] I thank my God and all my remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you all
[time=1381] making my prayer with what?
[time=1384] With joy.
[time=1385] Because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now and I am sure of this
[time=1391] that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus
[time=1398] Christ.
[time=1399] It is right for me to feel this way about you all because I hold you in my heart, such a love for this people.
[time=1406] For you are all partakers with me of grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defense
[time=1413] and confirmation of the gospel.
[time=1416] For God is my witness how I yearn for you all with the affection of Jesus Christ.
[time=1422] Do you think he likes this group of people?
[time=1425] He loves this group of people he yearns to be back with this group of people and there are a few key reasons.
[time=1431] I've jotted a few down.
[time=1432] You can probably add to this list but consistency, partnership, faith, generosity, integrity
[time=1440] and joy, he loved this group of people.
[time=1445] Now a couple of things, let's make it personal.
[time=1448] There are a couple of key contributors to church.
[time=1451] Two key church contributors, not inner notes but you can jot them down if you want to.
[time=1455] They are very simple.
[time=1456] Two key church contributors that we see from these verses, starting in verse 6 where he says, "He who began a good work and you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.
[time=1465] He who began a good work." Who began the work?
[time=1469] God did.
[time=1470] Jesus did.
[time=1471] It's his work.
[time=1472] He who began a good work and you will complete it, bring it to completion and so two key church contributors is God number one, write that down.
[time=1480] God is number one.
[time=1481] He began the good work, not you and me.
[time=1484] I'm sorry to tell you, I'm sure you don't know this but it's going to be a revelation to you but you don't have anything to bring to the table when it comes to the church being the church until you meet Jesus.
[time=1496] Then you have everything to bring to the table because he began a good work in you and he's going to bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.
[time=1502] That's the second contributor, you and me.
[time=1505] There's two key church contributors, number one is God, verse six, he who began the good work is his good work.
[time=1511] He started it in you, he's going to finish it in you.
[time=1513] It's his idea, the church is his, you're a part of it.
[time=1516] Number two is me and even in verse five he talks about partnership, being protectors.
[time=1522] That's who we are.
[time=1523] That's where we come in.
[time=1524] Those are the two key church contributors but today's all about this.
[time=1528] The title really is the bottom line, you've already seen it.
[time=1530] It's that church is for, that was a week, let's do it again, church is for everybody.
[time=1537] Church is for everybody.
[time=1539] The church at Philippi really began on that premise.
[time=1543] Here's what we're going to do, hold your place there in Philippians because we're coming back, we're going to re-versus nine through 11 in just a few minutes but before we do, we've really got to understand how the church at Philippi began.
[time=1554] How did it start?
[time=1555] So go to Acts chapter 16.
[time=1556] I'm not going to read all of this but it's Acts chapter 16 verses 11 through 40.
[time=1560] Be a great devotion passage for you this week if you're looking for one because it tells us a lot about this church and a lot about the church and how we can be a part of the church.
[time=1570] But to really understand the book of Philippians, it's not just that we need to know Paul's writing it from prison, we also need to know how the church at Philippi began to begin with.
[time=1579] So how did the church at Philippi begin?
[time=1581] You see that in Acts chapter number 16.
[time=1585] Now there's really three people, three characters that started, that were a part of starting, they didn't even have a clue they were doing it.
[time=1592] But there are really three characters in Acts 16 that the church at Philippi started with.
[time=1598] It was the ministry of Paul, he was there and in verse 14, I love this passage by the way.
[time=1604] You go to verse 14 of Acts 16 and you even back up a little from there, you go and you see how this starts to begin with this lady named Lydia, Lydia was the first character there and so it talks about how they arrive in Philippi and then on the Sabbath they go to verse 13.
[time=1618] On the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to the riverside where we suppose there would be a place of prayer and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together, I'll go back to that in a minute.
[time=1628] But one of those who heard was a woman named Lydia from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple goods who was a worshiper of God.
[time=1635] So here's what we're going to do, we're going to look at these characters.
[time=1637] The first is Lydia.
[time=1638] So if you're taking notes, there are three ways the church started at Philippi, first is Lydia.
[time=1643] It started with Paul going to the ladies Bible study.
[time=1647] That's really what this was, there were a group of women doing a Bible study so imagine in this day and time the Beth Moore study is taking place at the church and Paul comes in, Paul's as Beth and says I got this Beth.
[time=1659] That's really how this started with Lydia and he starts sharing with this group of ladies and they listen, one of them who heard was Lydia.
[time=1667] Now we're going to look a lot at Lydia in a minute but she's a CEO type lady.
[time=1671] Purple goods means she had the money.
[time=1673] She had a nice place, she had everything going for it but she was also religious.
[time=1677] She was a religious person probably seeking out trying to find what all this religion truly meant in her life but she is a rich lady, CEO, white collar and she would be of
[time=1688] Asian descent if you study and look at her race and her ethnicity.
[time=1693] So now knowing that, look at verse 18.
[time=1696] So she heard and then she invited Paul and his crew to come to the house after that and
[time=1702] I'm guessing she had a pretty nice little crib.
[time=1706] So Paul goes there but then afterwards we find that he meets someone else, another young lady but this one is not a white collar, CEO, fashionista type lady like Lydia.
[time=1716] It's a demon possessed slave girl who had nothing and she was enslaved and trapped by
[time=1722] these people because she could tell people's fortunes and that's how they made money off her.
[time=1727] But in verse 18 she kept driving them crazy, she was abrasive, spiritually she was abrasive.
[time=1732] Probably had, it was very, didn't care about anything spiritually, it was just angry, spiritually ever been that person where Lydia was very spiritually interested.
[time=1740] This young lady would be very spiritually angry.
[time=1743] Can I get the name in?
[time=1745] I've moved from spiritually interested to spiritually angry at many seasons of my life.
[time=1750] Sure you have too.
[time=1751] But she and so eventually she's driving them crazy, you know, yapping in their ear and in verse 18 we see that she kept doing this for many days but Paul became greatly annoyed.
[time=1760] I love when the Bible is just real.
[time=1764] We skip these verses a lot but I like that they're here because it shows us that people just got annoyed just like us, even Paul who started the church.
[time=1771] So she kept doing it, he became greatly annoyed and turned it and said to the spirit, I command you the name of Jesus to come out of her and it came out that very hour but the owners were upset and you keep reading the passage here, they were very upset about this and they said you're disturbing our city, we're going to come back to that in just a moment.
[time=1787] Now the third person and so we've moved from Lydia to this and the race, the ethnicity
[time=1794] here would have been more of a Greek, she would have been just a normal white Greek type lady here, totally different than the race, the background, the religious focus of
[time=1806] Lydia, now we get even another focus, the Philippian jailer.
[time=1810] I love this story because in verse 32 Paul and Silas were in prison because of a lot of the things that happened here and so as they're in prison they're singing and praising God.
[time=1819] Don't you just get frustrated at people like Paul, if you don't love Jesus and like the
[time=1825] church then you just can't stand people like Paul, what is wrong with you, you're in prison and you're singing and you're praising God and you're choosing to rejoice, to rejoice is a choice, he's choosing it in everything and so he wasn't, he was supposed to do this Philippian jailer, you should know, he was supposed to keep these people safe, that's what scripture says, keep them safe as we figure out what to do with these guys and we'll see why in just a minute, it really started on race, verse 20 it says these Jews, look
[time=1852] at it, verse 20, these Jews, they're disrupting our city and basically they're saying they're doing things that us Romans don't like, don't appreciate, that don't fit our culture.
[time=1863] So this really started with a racial focus to begin with, these Jews are disrupting our
[time=1870] city and not doing the things that us Romans like to see, so they're in prison for that and then enter the Philippian jailer, he's an ex-GI military guy and he's just probably
[time=1880] the more blue collar, he's the guy that probably just wants to get a beer and go home and watch the game after work, that's all he wants to do, that's his goal in life, this is the kind of guy that you're looking at, totally different than the white collar lady, totally different than the impoverished slave girl who's possessed by a demon but now the Philippian jailer is there and his one job is to keep these people confined but then in the middle of the night during the songs, if you know the story you know what happened, everything shook and a great earthquake happened and their chains were loosened, now he had already beaten these two, it says that in scripture, he was not supposed to torture them, he was supposed to keep them safe and I guess you had a lot of liberties as a jailer in this day but he beat them and the way that happened, stocks by the way were not the kind that you we had envisioned where you get to sit cross-legged and you know sit like this and you're just chained together, they would contort your body in all kinds of very painful positions and bind you tightly and leave you laying on the ground sometime for days at a time, that's where Paul was, that's the position he would have been singing from, to rejoice
[time=1943] as a choice, just ring a bell, he was choosing to rejoice but so he had every reason to get out of there because God loosed his chains, he was free to go and he knew because Paul
[time=1955] was a Roman, he knew that a Roman jailer, Philippian jailer like this guy here, if he
[time=1961] were to lose his prisoners, death would likely be the penalty and so he was going to even kill himself but Paul says hey don't do that, we're still here, there he is again, what's wrong with this guy right, why did he stay, there's a whole other sermon there, I won't preach that one this time but then he says sir is what must I do to be saved and he and
[time=1982] his whole household are saved, Paul baptizes them and the church at Philippi has begun,
[time=1988] now let's look at four key areas here, an economic background, an ethnicity, a religion
[time=1994] and then just an overall background, we went from Lydia with an Asian race, from an Asian
[time=2000] ethnicity to Greek to even Middle Eastern Jewish ethnicity, so you see all these different
[time=2006] races represented in the story and economically you have white collar, blue collar and then
[time=2013] just impoverished, poor, someone who had nothing in the slave girl, blue collar, jailer, made
[time=2019] it okay living, middle class, wanted to just go home, then white collar, CEO, hmm, religiously
[time=2027] you have religiously interested in Lydia, probably more agnostic trying to figure it out, she
[time=2033] worshiped, she didn't probably submit to the worship of all the dozens and dozens of sun gods and this god and that god, more of a monotheistic where she's looking at one
[time=2045] god and who he truly is in her life, so spiritually interested to spiritually angry in the slave girl, she's angry, probably doesn't want anything to do with it, all she's seen is slavery in her life, to a Philippian jailer who probably doesn't care a bit from a Roman background, he's just spiritually uninterested, you ever been there?
[time=2062] Some of you are here, you may be watching online and you're just uninterested, you just really don't care but this story tells us why you should care and then background, you've got a CEO, fashionista, a demon possessed, poor slave girl and a duty-bound ex-military
[time=2076] jailer and god takes all three and he defies socio-economic race, religion, all of those
[time=2091] backgrounds, he put them together the most unlikely of people and the church at Philippi
[time=2097] began and then now because of those three people that had no idea what they were a part
[time=2103] of and what God was doing in and through their lives, the church at Philippi has begun and Paul is in prison awaiting his sentence and he loves this group of people that started with the most unlikely, the most different, they look different, they smell different, they talk different, everything about them was different but God put them together and said I'm going to start a church, that's what the church should look like, that's what
[time=2128] when I look around I see a beautiful picture of diversity in his church I smile because
[time=2136] God smiles, I believe in practicing for heaven now, if you don't like different people in
[time=2143] your circle of influence and relationships you're probably not going to like heaven very much because we're all going to be there together, that's how the church at Philippi began, now here's what that means for us, I'm going to give you a homework assignment, you ready?
[time=2156] It got deep didn't it, I want to give you a homework assignment and that assignment is simply this, you know a lot of times if we're honest the way we turn inward is the people we do life with typically look just like us, if we're honest, but there are people even
[time=2171] in your circle of influence and relationships that look different than you, that have a different background than you, just like Lydia, the slave girl, the Philippian jailer, I would challenge
[time=2182] you to make a list of people in your direct circle of influence that God's already put there, you already have a relationship but you just haven't taken the steps to share the gospel with them or to be Jesus to them, it's an uncomfortable thought isn't it? Because
[time=2199] the people that came to mind it's like well that, I don't know how they'll receive that, I bet you probably won't end up in stocks and prison awaiting Nero's sentence, you might,
[time=2211] I don't know, but they need Jesus and you might be, you might be the only Jesus they're
[time=2218] going to see this week, you might be the only Bible they're going to read this week.
[time=2223] So make a list and at least one of the people that came to your mind when you circle their name, if you already wrote their name, will you just circle it, at least in your mind and commit to doing at least one thing that would point to Jesus in their life today,
[time=2236] this week, maybe start today, I'll tell you this, I have no problem at all in a sermon if God lays something on your heart, a phone call you need to make, I hope you'll just get up, I promise making that phone call will be way better than the rest of my sermon, I think it's going to be pretty good but you should still probably just do what Jesus put on your heart, if you need to go do that, go do it, go get in your car, I love when people just choose to be the church. Now let's talk about how we can do just that, you had to know how the church at Philippi started, aren't you glad you know that now? God took all of those things, all of those barriers and he cracked every one of them down the middle, put them together and formed a church and that's the church that Paul loves, that's the church that he's riding to, go back to Philippians now with me, let's look at verses nine through eleven, and here's what I want to do with these verses, I want to give you five benchmarks of an inside out church, five benchmarks, five defining things about an
[time=2290] inside out church, five things that I believe, any church that looks at least pretty similar
[time=2297] to what Jesus chose to begin with when he said I'm going to build my church and even the gates of hell can't win against it. This is some of the stuff that he would have built
[time=2307] in them. Now here's how I know that because Paul has just walked through the first eight verses of his endearment, his gratitude for his love for this church and how much he just loves and cares for them, now he prays for them, now to the church at Philippi I pray these things over you and this is that mature church that he's really not correcting behavior again, that's so important now because now we see well what is he praying for for their future, how it expands, what can he take from this church, this mature, this full of joy that's been such a blessing in his life and then pray that it multiplies so that the church, the church,
[time=2339] not just that church, the church at large grows and multiplies as Jesus intended and here is what
[time=2345] he prays, the first thing is this, stretching love, everybody stretch out real quick,
[time=2352] you've been listening to some preaching, you know it's all right, but it's time to stretch out.
[time=2357] A stretching love, here's what Paul prays for, Philippians 1 starting there in verse 9,
[time=2365] and it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, a stretching love.
[time=2373] I believe that the church should be known as the most loving place on the planet.
[time=2382] That when the world around us is filled with hatred and disunity and fingers pointing at
[time=2388] every different person that people should look at the church and see a love that's different.
[time=2393] Don't believe me, Jesus said it this way, he said the world's going to know you're my disciples if you have what? If you have love for one another, it's a defining characteristic,
[time=2405] but I'm going to be honest with you because I've been in church for a long time. I've seen fights over carpet colors, brands of toilet paper to buy, paint colors, seen people part ways,
[time=2417] and it sounds funny and we laugh, but I'm really not kidding, unfortunately, and I can laugh about
[time=2423] some of those things now, but there's some of those things I really can't laugh about, still, because they still carry those things, and I'll tell you, some of the meanest people I have ever met in life go to church every week. No, no, here, of course, you know, they went to other churches,
[time=2437] yeah, but it's true, and you know what I'm talking about, and I want to make a tough statement for
[time=2448] you today, and before I do want to give you a foundation for that tough statement, the foundation for it is this, that a person who sees as God sees, a person who looks around them and sees
[time=2458] as God sees, think about that, do you see as God sees, a person that sees as God sees will always
[time=2465] stretch, think about that, write that down, a person that sees as God sees always stretches,
[time=2472] a stretching kind of love, like Jesus spread his arms and stretched him out across the cross for
[time=2479] you and for me, we use that line a lot, but isn't it true, his love spread out across that cross for
[time=2486] you and for me, and I'll tell you this, when I think about the church that if you don't find that
[time=2492] your capacity to love all types of people is growing and stretching, post Jesus, you may need to
[time=2500] evaluate what Jesus you met. If post Jesus, your capacity to love all types of people is not
[time=2508] stretching and growing, you may need to evaluate what Jesus you met because Jesus loved all types,
[time=2516] and he proved it by starting his church, the church at Philippi, with three people who had every difference in the world, and when I look around today, the best church experiences I've ever
[time=2526] had were when people who shouldn't be together come together for the gospel because sometimes in a world that's so full of hatred and divisiveness, the only thing that can bring us together is Jesus and the gospel, and that's what he has in mind for his church. A stretching love, a stretching
[time=2546] love, a second thing, continuing verse nine is a practical growth, a practical growth. Verse
[time=2553] nine continues, he says, "I pray that your love may abound more and more with knowledge and all discernment, with knowledge and all discernment, a practical growth." And that's, here's the thing
[time=2564] about that growth is that we look at discipleship and we're going to be talking about discipleship and making disciples as a part of this series, but when we look at that term discipleship, a lot of
[time=2574] times we think it's a book. We think it's a collection of books that we've been through all these studies, and I'm all four studies. I've been through a lot of studies, I went to seminary, wouldn't take anything for all of that, but I've seen a lot of people who collect books and that is discipleship for them. I've probably been that guy at times in my life. Here's what I want to tell you, discipleship, my friend, is not a book. It is a process that requires practical steps that
[time=2598] are going to hurt, that are going to stretch, that are going to be painful, and they're going to turn you inside out. That is discipleship. It's practical growth. He says in knowledge and discernment and
[time=2609] all discernment. That means something that happens with life, not just a knowledge of what it means to be a Baptist, or what it means to be a Catholic, or a Methodist, or a Presbyterian. No, it's a
[time=2620] knowledge of the truth, of scripture, and the beauty of that is that we're called not to be hearers of the word only, but to be doers of the word. It's a practical growth that stretches
[time=2630] our love, and that's why it's all together in verse nine. Number three, commitment to excellence.
[time=2636] Stretching love, practical growth, a commitment to excellence. Look at verse 10. So that you may
[time=2644] approve what is excellent. In that word, you look it up, even in the original language, it just means
[time=2650] different. It means above, ahead, sparkling, great. That's what it means. And I want to tell you,
[time=2660] a commitment to excellence. That's why I believe the church in everything we do, we should do it with excellence. That's why we believe in having a children's ministry. That's excellent. That's why we've entered into a campaign to make sure that we can do children's ministry with as much excellence as we can for our school, for our youth, for our adult ministry, for everything that we do.
[time=2677] That's why we take pride in our facilities. That's why we work hard to take great care of that, which God has entrusted to us because a true church that's inside out is committed to doing everything we do with excellence, church-wide. Now, what about you and me?
[time=2692] That's why we should be committed to doing everything with excellence. Do everything as
[time=2698] unto the Lord. If you know that scripture, do everything as unto the Lord. That's excellence, a commitment to excellence. Sincerity and integrity is the fourth thing. Stretching love,
[time=2708] practical growth, commitment to excellence. And now sincerity and integrity. Now, the word
[time=2714] sincere came from two Latin words, which I love. I love this thought. Now, come back to this. It's
[time=2721] "sené sera." This is where we get, you see, sincere. "sené sera," "sené sera," those words
[time=2729] mean "without," "sené," "without," "sera," "wax," "without wax." Now, when you look at that word,
[time=2736] I like that because it goes back to the pot here. Now, a clay pot back in the day would be defined by
[time=2743] being pure and sincere and whole if it didn't have cracks. Because if it had cracks, water would run out, and that would be the end of it, right? Well, it's just no good to us. And so, they would hold up a pot to the light and look for cracks. And if it was free of cracks, they would stamp it.
[time=2758] "sené sera," "sera," "sera," "sera," "sera," "is whole." It would be stamped. Now, that's what Paul is talking about here, is he says, look at verse 10. He says, "pure and blameless." You can underline those words, "pure and blameless, sincere." Full of integrity is what we're looking out here.
[time=2773] And I know you're going to be blown away by this, but even back in the day where clay pots were more relevant, people were crooked. They were cheaters in the day because what they would do is they'd take wax. They'd hold it up to light. There's a crack. What they should do is get rid of it and sell the good stuff, right? No. We're going to rub wax in it, make it look kind of nice, still sell it. People would look at it, hold up the light. The light wouldn't come through, so it looks good. They'd sell it until they got home and heated it up and the wax would melt and then all the soup or whatever they were cooking would boil out and then they would know they were taken by someone. That's true in the world around us, isn't it? It's full of a lot of that. But the purity of this, and here's what I want to tell about us. I told you that we should be like a clay pot turned inside out, dumping ourselves out for Jesus. We should strive every
[time=2818] day. Hear me. We should strive every day to be the most sincere, pure, blameless, people full of
[time=2825] integrity every day because that's what's going to make us stand out in the world around us.
[time=2829] What's wrong with you? You like Paul. He's singing in prison. Why are you so pure? Is there a screw loose in there somewhere? What is wrong with you? People should look at us and say, "That's a weird person." Look at somebody say, "You're weird." You should have people
[time=2844] telling you that every day. You're weird. That's a weird dude. But here's what I know. Here's what
[time=2850] I know. There's a crack in all of our pots. Did he just call me a crack pot? Yes, I did.
[time=2858] We have cracks everywhere. The beauty is Jesus knew that even though we're
[time=2867] to strive to be a pure, blameless, clay pot with no cracks, Jesus knew we would have plenty.
[time=2874] That's why I came. Leonard Cohen's song from a long time ago, he was singing. The song was called
[time=2880] Anthem. There's a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in. Old song, been around a while,
[time=2886] I guess, but I love that statement because Jesus knew there's a crack in all of us.
[time=2890] But that crack is how the light gets in. Your sin, your shortfalls, is what brought Jesus
[time=2897] here to begin with, to give you life and life more abundant. And because of that, not because of you, you can be a cracked pot that God makes whole and pure where people still
[time=2908] look at you and say, "That dude is weird." There's something different about that person.
[time=2912] 2 Corinthians 4-7 says that we have this treasure in jars of clay. You know, these jars of clay
[time=2919] have cracks and they're not very pretty, but we have a treasure inside and that light bleeds through and it touches the world around us. The last thing I'll tell you is this, fruit from Jesus, verse 11, look there with me. To be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, what we just looked at, verse 11, filled with the fruit of righteousness. And we hear that a lot and it's like, "Go be good." Well, we have cracks. So how are we supposed to be good and sincere and
[time=2945] pure and blameless? Well, I love how the verse ends. Filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God. One of my favorite verses in Scripture is
[time=2962] 2 Corinthians 5-21. 2 Corinthians 5-21. It says, "God made him who knew no sin to be sin
[time=2972] on our behalf so that we could become the righteousness of God, not so that you could
[time=2981] have the righteousness inside of you and it would just leak out and do a decent job." No. So that you are the righteousness of God walking around on this earth. Does that mean you're going to be perfect?
[time=2991] No. That means you're going to be an imperfect pot with tons of cracks that let's the light out all around you in ways that will turn people around you inside out as they see Jesus in your life and
[time=3002] through your life. That's the fruit of Jesus. Let me just bow your heads for just a moment.
[time=3012] Close your eyes, no looking around. Just reflect. That's a tall order, isn't it?
[time=3016] Stretching love, practical growth, commitment to excellence, sincerity and integrity in the
[time=3026] fruit of Jesus. That's why I end with the fruit of Jesus, my friend. It's because that's the only way it's possible. And today, the fruit of Jesus is yours if you want it to be. Philippians 1,
[time=3036] verse 6, "He who began a good work and you will bring it to completion." Some of you don't know Jesus today, though, and you would say to me right now, "If I were to die today, I know I don't have the fruit of Jesus. I don't know that I would spend eternity with Him in heaven, but I'd like to know.
[time=3050] Why don't you know it's really as simple as the gospel says it is, that it really does
[time=3057] bow down to how you view Jesus. Who is Jesus? How you answer that question is going to change your
[time=3064] eternity like it or not. The name of Jesus every knee is going to bow and every tongue is going to
[time=3070] confess that He is Lord to the glory of God to Father. My challenge to you today is if we're going
[time=3076] to bow later, why don't we start right now? Why don't we hit our knees together right now?
[time=3082] That's what an inside church is going to look like, but for you, that step could be as simple as just
[time=3088] crying out to Jesus saying, "Jesus, I do believe you died for me. I am a broken pot. I don't have
[time=3094] anything to offer, but Jesus, I believe you died for me and I believe you're alive and I want to give you me as good as I know how to do. I don't even know how to take that step. No matter where you
[time=3104] are, no matter how you're tuning in to what God's doing in your life in this moment, I want to challenge you just to pause and do it. I'm not going to lead you in a prayer because you're already saying it. It comes from the inside out in your life. Right now, I'm going to give you a moment just to respond to Him. If you haven't yet done it, will you take that step right now? In your own words, just cry out to Him. Church is for everybody. That's been the theme of what we've looked at
[time=3132] today. And my question I'd like to ask you is how has that changed how you see yourself in light of the church? In light of how Jesus built His church to be inside out. And for that
[time=3143] to happen, it means He's got to start by turning us inside out at times. And really, that's what the gospel does, isn't it? It turns us inside out. And it, on the inside, brings things to light
[time=3154] that we would just assume at times leave hidden, leave covered up. But Jesus perhaps has uncovered
[time=3160] some of those things as we looked at the book of Philippians today. And if you're one of those people that I was just talking about, that today is that day of salvation. Today is the time where God wanted you to take that leap of faith, to just say, "Jesus, my life that's been mine is now yours."
[time=3175] That really is the gospel that we believe that Jesus is Lord, that we believe He died on the cross for our sins, paying that price for us that we could never pay because He lived that sinless life that you and I could never even begin to live. But then, not just that He died on the cross, but that He is alive. And I want you to know today, He is alive. And He's alive and well in
[time=3197] your life. When we believe those things and you just simply look to Jesus saying, "This life that's been mine, I lay it at your feet," that is what salvation is truly all about. And I challenge you
[time=3208] to take that step today. If you've been waiting, if you've been waiting and wondering if I should take that step and once I get things cleaned up or I get things in order in my life, then I want to tell you it's not ever going to happen. We're never going to be ready for salvation in our terms,
[time=3222] in our logic, in our rationale. That's the beauty of the gospel. When we're the least ready, when we have the least to offer, that's when God offers us everything through His Son Jesus. And so if you
[time=3233] haven't taken that step, I challenge you just to pause, take a moment, even do it right now, don't wait any longer. And if you have, and if you are going to do that today, then I want to get a booklet in your hands. This booklet is called Beginning Steps. It's a growth guide for new believers that simply got seven little key steps that will help you begin on a journey. Because giving your life to Jesus is not something that we do that ends something. It's something that we do that begins a new life, a new eternal life that only comes from Jesus. And even though it's focused on
[time=3263] eternity and maybe what comes after this life, it affects everything in this life today. And so I
[time=3269] challenge you just to send us a note. We're going to have some information on the screen that's going to tell you how you can email, how you can call, how you can write into us, and let us send you one of these books, let us walk on this journey alongside of you. So thank you for letting us do that. Thank you for just letting God work in your life. Churches for everybody, you're a part of that.
[time=3287] We're a part of that. We're glad that God has brought us together, at least as you have watched today. And I pray that it's been a blessing in your life. And I pray that that blessing does not end today, that it moves forward into the weeks ahead. And we look forward to digging into all that God has for His Church as we continue on our journey of Inside Out. And we continue in the book of Philippians. See you next week.
