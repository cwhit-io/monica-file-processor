[time=483] This almighty God that provides for us that protects us. I think I've told you guys before I grew up in a big family, have a lot of cousins. We were on Facebook the other day just sharing like who's your favorite cousin. And I had to break the ice by name in my favorite cousin. I probably shouldn't have done that, but I did it.
[time=505] But I could remember when we were kids and my grandparents lived on Roodlesall Street and we would go to Macmillan Park. And when we would go just by ourselves, it was just kind of this look.
[time=520] But when we would go with each other, we went like we owned the park. Our walk was different. Our swag was just a little bit different because we knew that we was together.
[time=531] I have my back, right? And so we would go, we would take over the merry-go-round, the swings, the slides. You know what I'm saying?
[time=541] And I think about this almighty God who is untouchable. He is our protector, our defender. We can go anywhere with the confidence that our God is with us, our mighty, our mighty God.
[time=560] I just want to read this scripture to you. And this is, as I was looking at this this week, it was just ministering to me, just how powerful he is, but also that same power that raised Jesus from the dead, it lives in us.
[time=577] It lives in us. And so as they bring that to the screen so that I can read the verse.
[time=586] Ephesians 1 18 through 21. I pray that your hearts will be flooded with light so that you can understand the confident hope he has given to those he called.
[time=597] His holy people who are his rich and glorious inheritance. He's talking about us.
[time=603] I also pray that you will understand the incredible greatness of God's power for us who believe him.
[time=610] This is the same, I just told you, the same mighty power that raised Christ from the dead and seeded him in the place of honor at God's right hand in the heavenly realms.
[time=622] Now he is far above any ruler or authority or power or leader or anything else, not only in this world but also in the world to come.
[time=633] I just want you to say something to your neighbor, say, in me is the same power.
[time=652] By your spirit I will rise from the ashes of the heat.
[time=658] The resurrected King is resurrecting me.
[time=664] In your name I come alive to declare your victory.
[time=670] The resurrected King is resurrecting me.
[time=676] By your spirit I will rise from the ashes of the heat.
[time=682] The resurrected King is resurrecting me.
[time=688] In your name I come alive to declare your victory.
[time=694] The resurrected King is resurrecting me.
[time=704] His resurrecting me.
[time=708] But the head that once was ground with thorns is bound with arena.
[time=721] The sick are now to watch our feet.
[time=727] Now at his feet we bow.
[time=734] The wonder of our sin and shame.
[time=740] Now rob the majesty.
[time=745] The radiance of perfect love.
[time=751] Now chant for all to see.
[time=759] Your name, your name is victory.
[time=765] I'll praise the rise to Christ our King.
[time=771] Your name, your name is victory.
[time=777] I'll praise the rise to Christ our King.
[time=789] [MUSIC] The hell last now gives way [MUSIC] To him who weighs our peace [MUSIC] His final breath upon the Christ [MUSIC] Is now alive in me [MUSIC]
[time=853] [MUSIC - 129 seconds]
[time=992] [MUSIC] Now the darkness fades into new beginnings [MUSIC] As we lift our eyes to a hope beyond [MUSIC] No creation waits with an expectation [MUSIC] To declare the reign of the Lord our God [MUSIC] But we will not be moved when the earth gives way [MUSIC] For the reason one is overcome [MUSIC] And for every fear there's an empty grave [MUSIC] For the reason one is overcome [MUSIC] Now the silence breaks in the name of Jesus [MUSIC] As the heavens cry let the earth respond [MUSIC] No creation shouts with a voice of trial [MUSIC] To declare the reign of the Lord our God [MUSIC] We will not be moved when the earth gives way [MUSIC] For the reason one is overcome [MUSIC] And for every fear there's an empty grave [MUSIC] For the reason one is overcome [MUSIC] He shall reign forever strong holds now [MUSIC] Surrendered for the Lord our God has overcome [MUSIC] Who can be against us Jesus our defender [MUSIC] He is Lord and He has overcome [MUSIC] He shall reign forever strong holds now [MUSIC] Surrendered for the Lord our God has overcome [MUSIC] Who can be against us Jesus our defender [MUSIC] He is Lord and He has overcome [MUSIC] We will not be moved when the earth gives way [MUSIC] For the reason one is overcome [MUSIC] And for every fear there's an empty grave [MUSIC] For the reason one is overcome [MUSIC] That we will not be moved when the earth gives way [MUSIC] For the reason one is overcome [MUSIC] And for every fear there's an empty grave [MUSIC] For the reason one is overcome [MUSIC] Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh [MUSIC]â™ª
[time=1442] [APPLAUSE - 4 seconds]
[time=1451] Good morning church welcome to the end of 2017.
[time=1459] I must admit to you that 2017 has been one of the fastest years of my life.
[time=1467] I know why this happened in your lives too.
[time=1471] This time last year in 2016 I was getting ready to go
[time=1477] to bed which awesome let's confess I haven't probably seen the ball drop in several years.
[time=1483] I'm definitely like 10 o'clock like let's go to bed kind of guy.
[time=1487] But this time is getting ready to welcome in the new year by waking up whenever it does hit.
[time=1494] I had no idea that I would be in Fort Wayne this year.
[time=1499] In fact I had if you had asked me where Fort Wayne was on a map I don't know a hundred percent sure I could even like point it out.
[time=1509] But God had other plans and God has blessed me.
[time=1514] It was I guess about six weeks later so we've been February the 12th after having been to Fort Wayne one time.
[time=1525] I was driving my little blue pickup truck up here to Fort Wayne to be with you and with everything I own behind me and then it was February the 14th actually on my birthday.
[time=1537] So six weeks from about today that I woke up for the first time of many times living here in Fort Wayne.
[time=1546] I had no idea when you moved to a new place there's like tons of fears and lots of things and I had no idea
[time=1552] how cold it was going to be this winter.
[time=1558] To be honest the snow I was fully prepared for.
[time=1561] So I lived as a child in upstate New York and so mostly the snow just makes me feel like a kid again
[time=1568] and it's been great and next year I'll be like old and grumpy and like be ready to be done with the snow.
[time=1572] But this year it's been great and I love the snow but this five degree weather and what in this nonsense we got going on
[time=1578] you guys can just keep it I don't want anything to do with that.
[time=1583] But anyway as you go through and you think about moving there's tons of fears that you have moving to a new place
[time=1589] especially a place where you don't really know anybody and I definitely had a lot of fears.
[time=1594] One of my fears you know important things like how's my driver's license picture going to look you know
[time=1601] like is it going to be a good one in Indiana or is it going to be like not so good like when I was in Georgia.
[time=1606] But really I think one of the biggest fears that I had was will I be welcomed I'd be welcomed.
[time=1613] And for that church I just want to say thank you because not only have you welcomed me you've loved me
[time=1621] you've embraced me you've invited me in your homes.
[time=1624] I've just been Kevin told me and said there's great people here at Black Hawk and boy was he right.
[time=1633] And so for that I just want to say from the bottom of my heart from 2017 and this crazy year that has been for me
[time=1640] thank you so much because you've been such a big blessing in my life.
[time=1646] This week I've been reflecting a lot about 2017 and the past and just what all has happened this year.
[time=1654] And God has blessed me by taking care of me by providing me a place providing me this family.
[time=1659] And he also has done just an enormous amount in the life of our church.
[time=1665] You think about when we started this year we were almost half a million dollars in debt and by the blessing of God like that's been paid off and with our Jesus birthday offering we're actually
[time=1675] as a Friday some stuff still trickling in but we're over 170,000 for our Jesus birthday offering.
[time=1681] So let's celebrate that with me guys.
[time=1683] Even more important than the money because that money allows us to expand our ministry
[time=1692] and create help with life change and helping people see Jesus.
[time=1697] And so we've had hundreds of kids that have come through here for VBS that have reached the Gospel.
[time=1702] We've baptized many many many people this year.
[time=1706] God has truly blessed Black Hawk and it's great to be a part of that.
[time=1711] I want to take sometimes in the busy season we all just it gets a little bit crazy
[time=1717] and we don't always do a good job of taking a deep breath and resting and reflecting.
[time=1723] And so I just want you to do that right now.
[time=1725] I just want you to take a deep breath with me.
[time=1728] Sometimes this Kevin has us do.
[time=1730] And I want you to sing for just a moment how has God blessed you?
[time=1734] How has God proved his faithfulness this past year?
[time=1739] And I want to take a moment just as you're thinking about it.
[time=1745] How has God blessed you?
[time=1746] And I want to take a moment now and just tell the person all across him just tell the person next to you what's one thing that God has done for you in 2017 to prove his faithfulness.
[time=1757] Go ahead.
[time=1760] It's one thing. All across the building I hear God's faithfulness.
[time=1777] Somebody tell me somebody tells me raise your hand has anybody gotten saved this year or baptized this year?
[time=1783] Yeah, all across the building, yeah, all across the building, yeah, in 2017 was that year for you.
[time=1789] Does anybody this year experience healing in them or their family?
[time=1793] Any healing, yeah, healing right here, yeah, awesome.
[time=1797] God's faithfulness and healing, yeah, has anybody been delivered of anything?
[time=1801] This 2017 was to say this is the year that I was delivered.
[time=1804] Yeah, yeah, I was delivered in 2017.
[time=1806] Anybody experienced new birth this year, 2017, new birth, yeah, new birth?
[time=1811] Yeah, all across the room, new birth, yeah, I hear a pause.
[time=1814] God's been faithful to us.
[time=1816] And I think some people in this room even struggle just a little bit because unfaithful is not really a word that we use all that often.
[time=1825] In fact, most of the time when we use the word faithful we tack on this other word.
[time=1829] This is a prefix on the beginning of it and that's un.
[time=1832] Most of the time we're talking about faithfulness.
[time=1834] We're actually talking about unfaithfulness because that we're probably more familiar with.
[time=1839] There's people in this room whose lives have been changed completely by divorce.
[time=1845] Kids whose parents were divorced, people in this room have been divorced because somebody was unfaithful.
[time=1851] There's friendships that have been broken up because somebody was found to be
[time=1857] unfaithful and not loyal in a friendship.
[time=1860] And sometimes when we sit in here and we think about faithfulness and we think about God's faithfulness, we have a tendency to attribute it to our own faithfulness or unfaithfulness that we've experienced in life.
[time=1871] One thing I want you to know is that being faithful is not something that God does
[time=1879] but who God is.
[time=1881] So follow with me for just a moment because this may be one of the more important points that we have today that being faithful is not something God does.
[time=1890] But it's who God is.
[time=1893] You see if being faithful is something that God does then that means that God can slip in and out of faithfulness.
[time=1899] If being faithful is something that God chooses to do, it's something he could choose not to do.
[time=1905] But being faithful is not something that God does, it's who God is.
[time=1909] His very essence, his very nature.
[time=1911] God can't help but be faithful to us.
[time=1915] 2 Timothy 2, 13.
[time=1917] Because if we are faithless, even when we're faithless, he remains faithful
[time=1923] for he cannot deny himself.
[time=1929] Church, being faithful is not something that God would just choose to do in your life but it's who he is.
[time=1935] How do I know that God is faithful?
[time=1937] The entire Bible is full of stories and moments
[time=1945] where God chose to be faithful, where God chose his faithfulness.
[time=1950] And so when we look even in the Garden of Eden where man sins, right, and this whole thing gets messed up, and what do you know right on time God shows up and he says I'm here, I'm with you, I will make things right.
[time=1967] I think about the Israelites when they've left Egypt with Moses and they're headed out and if you remember, they get to the edge of the Red Sea.
[time=1976] The Egyptian army is coming down on them.
[time=1980] They're all ready to be slaughtered and killed because Pharaoh had unleashed his army
[time=1986] and they get to the edge of the Red Sea and they don't know what to do.
[time=1990] And God shows up and says I am with you and he parts the Red Sea and they walk through because God can't help but be faithful.
[time=1999] He can't help but show up for us.
[time=2001] It's who he is.
[time=2004] Ruth and Naomi, if you know their story, they found that they had no husband, there was no money, there was no food, they didn't know what to do.
[time=2015] God shows up and says even in your situation, Ruth and Naomi, I am with you.
[time=2020] I am here and he provides for them a kinsman Redeemer.
[time=2026] One of my favorite stories in the Bible is the story of Hannah.
[time=2031] And so if you don't know, Hannah was without child and she longed to have a child.
[time=2037] And she came to the temple and threw herself down and was just weeping and crying and just really pouring out the pain that was in her heart,
[time=2048] just pouring it out to God for a child.
[time=2051] So much so in fact that the priest thought she was drunk or that something was wrong.
[time=2056] But it was that kind of pain that she was experiencing.
[time=2060] I don't know if in this room if anybody's had that kind of pain where it was just coming out and it was uncontrollable and you didn't know.
[time=2067] Maybe it was because of loss or death or maybe even the loss of a child or the desire to have a child.
[time=2072] But this is where Hannah found herself.
[time=2074] Just pouring herself out and the priest, she's drunk.
[time=2077] We don't know what to do with her and they're like, what? And the world is going on.
[time=2080] And she desires this child and God blesses her with Samuel.
[time=2089] And she takes Samuel and dedicates him back to God.
[time=2094] And as you know, Samuel was one of the greatest prophets that we had.
[time=2097] Samuel was the king maker. Samuel was the one that made David king.
[time=2104] And we know from David we get Jesus and from the lineage of David.
[time=2109] And so Hannah pouring out. God showed up for her.
[time=2116] Isaac, you know the story of Isaac where Abraham and Isaac and God required a sacrifice.
[time=2123] And Abraham takes Isaac as his child and takes him on to the wilderness and they prepare an altar.
[time=2128] Isaac gets an altar and Abraham tells him God will provide a sacrifice.
[time=2134] And right at the last minute when the knife is getting ready to come down, there it was.
[time=2139] A sacrifice.
[time=2141] And Jerusalem will tell you that today we still need a sacrifice.
[time=2145] And God has provided that sacrifice in Jesus.
[time=2148] That's why we celebrate this Christmas season.
[time=2151] That's why we celebrate that God came down, became a man.
[time=2154] He dwelt with us and became that ultimate sacrifice for our sins.
[time=2161] God's faithfulness is ultimately proven in Jesus.
[time=2168] We know people are faithful when they keep their promises.
[time=2171] And Isaiah chapter 7 verse 14.
[time=2175] Isaiah 4 tells therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign.
[time=2179] And behold, the virgin will conceive and bear a son.
[time=2184] And she'll call his name Emmanuel, God with us.
[time=2189] And just as Kevin preached in the first part of this series from Matthew chapter 1, and
[time=2196] Angel appears to Joseph and says, Joseph, don't worry about taking Mary as your wife.
[time=2203] Because she will bear a son and you shall call his name Jesus.
[time=2209] For he will save his people from their sins.
[time=2217] Jesus came to save his people from their sins.
[time=2222] It was foretold that Jesus would come, that he would become Emmanuel, that he would be God with us, and that he would save us from our sins.
[time=2230] And if you flip over to Luke chapter 5, Luke tells the first part of Luke is where Jesus
[time=2238] calls his first disciples and really begins that ministry.
[time=2242] And what do we see in Luke chapter 5 is that here he is, in these calling out Simon, and
[time=2248] he says to him, and he says to him to cast their nets over, you know, to collect the fish from
[time=2261] one side of the boat to the other.
[time=2263] And they go through and they do this.
[time=2265] And then Simon Peter, when he saw that the fish were filled, he says he fell to Jesus' knees saying, this is verse 8, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord, for he
[time=2275] and all who are with him were astonished at the catch of the fish they had taken." And so where James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon and Jesus said, do not be afraid, from now on you will be catching men.
[time=2287] And when they had brought their boats to the land, they left everything and followed.
[time=2292] So if you would ask people that Simon and James and John in that moment and said, hey, what's this about Jesus?
[time=2297] What can you tell me about Jesus?
[time=2299] They would say, Jesus is God with us.
[time=2302] He came just as was promised.
[time=2305] And he came and he forgave our sins.
[time=2307] They immediately knew that they were sinful and needed this forgiveness and Jesus forgives them.
[time=2314] You continue to see that Jesus cleanses a leper.
[time=2318] He goes on in the same chapter and he heals a paralytic that had to have his friends lower
[time=2325] him down to Jesus.
[time=2327] And then he calls Levi, who is a tax collector, who was seen as some of the ultimate sinners
[time=2333] in the day.
[time=2334] And if you had asked all these people about Jesus, who Jesus was and what he was there for, why did Jesus come?
[time=2340] They would have said to save us from our sins.
[time=2343] And Jesus did just that.
[time=2345] If you think about the story even as little kids, Zacchaeus was a wee little man.
[time=2351] And he climbs up in a tree just to be able to see Jesus.
[time=2355] And Jesus says, that's not good enough for me.
[time=2357] I actually want a relationship with you.
[time=2359] I want a connection with you.
[time=2360] And he bites him down out of the tree into his home and they break bread together.
[time=2365] And if you ask Zacchaeus about Jesus, he would have said he is God with us.
[time=2370] He for came to forgive me of my sins.
[time=2374] And I didn't think that I was worthy, but he called me out of a tree.
[time=2379] And there's people today, even in this room right now that are in a tree and Jesus is calling you out of that tree to say, it's not enough for you to sit there and see me from
[time=2389] afar.
[time=2390] I want relationship with you.
[time=2392] It's not enough for you to sit in the back or to sit in the balcony or just to be online or on television.
[time=2397] Whatever tree you're in, Jesus is saying, that's not enough for me.
[time=2400] I want relationship with you.
[time=2401] And he's calling you out of that tree.
[time=2404] One of my favorite stories is the paralytic at the pool of Bethesda.
[time=2411] One of the neat things about this is if you know a little background information on the story, there was a pool there.
[time=2417] And every now and then, there was an angel of the Lord that would stir up the pool.
[time=2420] And if someone got down into the pool, they would be healed.
[time=2425] And there was a man there who was paralytic.
[time=2428] And I don't know how long it took him to get just to the pool.
[time=2433] But somehow he had made his way there.
[time=2436] But because he couldn't walk well or at all, he couldn't get down to the pool.
[time=2441] Every time the pool got stirred, somebody would cut in line.
[time=2447] You guys hate it when somebody does that, like cut she in line.
[time=2451] Somebody would jump down in front of him and get in the pool and they would receive his healing.
[time=2456] And this would go on over and over and we don't know how long he was there.
[time=2461] It may have been days or months or years, but he just long he knew if he could get in the pool at the right time.
[time=2465] That he would be healed.
[time=2468] But every single time somebody comes in and gets his healing.
[time=2475] Jesus shows up on the scene and asks the man, "Why are you here?
[time=2478] What do you want?
[time=2480] You want to be healed?" He said, "Yes, of course I want to be healed." But every single time I try to get down to the water, somebody cuts in.
[time=2490] And Jesus looks at this man and says, "Well, pick up your mat.
[time=2495] Get up and walk for your healed." And Jesus gave this man a healing.
[time=2500] And if you had asked that man, "What's Jesus all about?
[time=2503] Who is this man that has come?" He would have said, "That's God here with us." And he forgiven me of my sins and now I have walked because Jesus is the water of life.
[time=2519] Peter, as Jesus is going to be crucified, he's asked, "Aren't you one of Jesus' disciples?"
[time=2530] And Peter says, "No, not that guy." And he's asked three times to associate himself with Jesus.
[time=2538] And again, he says, "No, just the ultimate form of betrayal, the unfaithfulness of Peter,
[time=2545] that here's God, the Messiah, he's our Savior." And Peter would say again and again and again, "No, I want nothing to do with him."
[time=2557] And we still see Jesus go to the cross for Peter and then serve him breakfast when he comes and rises again.
[time=2565] And if you would ask Peter, "Who is this man that they call Jesus?" And Jesus, Peter would have said, "That is God with us." And even when I was unfaithful, even when I denied him three times,
[time=2581] even when I went off and I did my own thing and I wanted nothing to do with Jesus, Jesus was still faithful to me.
[time=2587] And sure, that's because being faithful is not something that God just does.
[time=2592] It's not something that he comes in and out of, it's who God is.
[time=2598] He would have said, "Even when I was unfaithful, God was faithful."
[time=2604] There's another man that Jesus encounters actually on the cross.
[time=2608] And he was crucified, as we know, between two thieves.
[time=2612] And to one of the thieves recognized Jesus for who he was and said, "I know that you don't deserve to be here, but I do, but I do."
[time=2625] And Jesus says to him, "Sir, today you will be with me in paradise." And he was.
[time=2631] And he wasn't if you'd asked that thief, "Who is Jesus?" He would have said, "He is God." And he kept his promise.
[time=2640] And I was with him in paradise.
[time=2649] We're in this series on God with us, and I think it's pretty neat that Matthew,
[time=2657] as we started off in Matthew chapter 1 with the prophecy and the proclamation of who Jesus would be, that he would be this Emmanuel, that he would be God with us.
[time=2668] And we see him, who saves people from his sins, and then we see all the stories and the evidence through the personal testimonies
[time=2677] of all of these people that are recorded for us, that Jesus is who he said he was, that he is Emmanuel, that he was God, and he is with us.
[time=2688] And I think it's pretty neat if you look at Matthew chapter 28, and I'm going to start with verse 16.
[time=2698] At this point, and this is like the last couple, the last few verses of Matthew, you guys will recognize it.
[time=2704] Do you want to turn there?
[time=2706] But at this point, Jesus has risen from the dead.
[time=2709] So the disciples are finally just starting to figure this thing out.
[time=2715] About, wow.
[time=2718] He promised he would come back in three days, and he did.
[time=2722] And you can imagine that they just begin to reflect, kind of like we are in 2017,
[time=2728] reflecting on all that God has taught us and showed us, and how he's been there with us throughout this entire year.
[time=2733] You can imagine that the disciples were beginning to reflect on the last three years of ministry with Jesus, and as it all begins to come together, Jesus asked them to meet him on a mountain, because he had something to tell him.
[time=2748] And I imagine if I was a disciple in that moment, just realizing the gravity of all of this
[time=2754] and how big of a deal it was, that here's a guy, here's God that came to earth
[time=2761] that was crucified, that rose again, and now he has a message for me.
[time=2768] And I imagine as they were walking towards this mountain, some of them would have been talking with each other back and forth, maybe even nervously, because they're not sure what Jesus is going to say next.
[time=2780] We're not sure what the next thing is, what's the next big mission, what's he going to call us to?
[time=2788] I'm sure there are some people that would have been really reflective, and just as they're inspecting their own lives and thinking about it.
[time=2797] There would have been people there that doubted, but all of these people moving towards the mountain to listen to the one message that Jesus has for them after he's risen from the dead.
[time=2810] And here's what he says in Matthew 28, 16.
[time=2816] Now the 11 disciples went to Galilee to the mountain where Jesus had directed them.
[time=2822] And when they saw him, they worshiped him, but some doubted.
[time=2829] Now we say I love how real the Bible is, and how it's not afraid to really call things out as the way they are, because I think sometimes we're afraid of that doubt, but even here Jesus recognizes, there were doubters in the room.
[time=2844] And then there's people that are even listening right now that are doubters, that are in this room, that doubt this faithfulness of God, that doubt this whole Christmas season, that just are unsure because of the unfaithfulness that they've experienced in their own lives.
[time=2858] But Jesus, knowing that the doubters are here, he has this message.
[time=2862] In verse 18, "And Jesus came to them and said, 'All authority in heaven and on earth is given to me.'"
[time=2872] Now I love this by this passage, that Jesus doesn't share his authority with anyone else.
[time=2878] At this point, he's proved that he's risen from the dead, he has power over the grave and the death, and Jesus doesn't share this authority with anyone.
[time=2885] Church, that means that Jesus does not share his authority and his power with Muhammad.
[time=2889] He doesn't share it with our governments of this world.
[time=2892] He doesn't share it with your boss or your circumstances or your family or your parents.
[time=2897] Jesus doesn't share this power with the teachings of Buddha.
[time=2901] He doesn't share this power with the thousands of false gods that the Hindus worship.
[time=2906] He doesn't share his power with anyone because all power and all authority has been given to Jesus, and he wants you to know it.
[time=2913] And just as we sang in the song, that that same power that lives in Jesus, that rose Jesus from the dead, the same power that rose Jesus from the grave, lives in us through the Holy Spirit.
[time=2925] But Church, we worship so many false gods.
[time=2929] We want to say that, oh, well, if we just had enough money or if there was just a different person in our government or if there was just this or there was just that, but I'm here to tell you that none of those things matter because Jesus doesn't share any power, he doesn't share any authority, he doesn't share it because he has it all.
[time=2946] So he shares that they all power, all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[time=2955] And he says, here's our mission, go therefore and make disciples of all nations,
[time=2962] baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.
[time=2973] We're getting ready to enter into a series on disciple shift and we're called shift.
[time=2980] And we see right here that the heart of Jesus, the one, the one time that he has after to call everybody up on the mountain to let everybody know, here's our next mission, here's what we're called to, and we call that the great commission.
[time=2992] He says, go and share, go and make disciples of me.
[time=2997] Earlier I asked everybody to share one thing that God had done for them in 2017,
[time=3006] how's God been faithful to you and there's all kinds of things in this room.
[time=3012] That is your story, that's your testimony.
[time=3017] Just as the man at the pool, Bethesda would have gone away and told people,
[time=3024] I couldn't get to the water, but Jesus is the water of life.
[time=3029] Just as the woman that was caught in adultery when she's about to be killed,
[time=3035] the law says that she was to be stoned and all these men gathered around her,
[time=3041] which by the way, where is the man caught in adultery in this?
[time=3044] Because like the last time I checked, it takes two.
[time=3047] And in this row we need to hold our men to the same high standards that we hold women to.
[time=3055] But that's all I want to say about that, I probably want to say more, but that's okay.
[time=3059] So here's this woman that she's caught in adultery, she's getting ready to be killed, and Jesus gets down on her level in the sand.
[time=3071] And she went from there and said, he didn't condemn me.
[time=3075] I was dead, I was dead, but now I'm alive because of Jesus.
[time=3083] And that's her story, what's your story today?
[time=3087] What has God done in your life where he's proven faithful?
[time=3091] And so we're going to look more into this discipleship and what it means to share our stories
[time=3097] and what it means to build relationships in 2018.
[time=3102] But that's it, it's as simple as your story.
[time=3108] The last part of this verse, and sometimes I think we kind of overlook it, right?
[time=3113] Because we get on mission and we're ready to go, and we're going to go into all the world, and we're going to make disciples, and we're going to teach them.
[time=3119] And we leave off this last little, this little title here, Jesus says, "Behold, behold, look, pay attention." So what he's saying here, "Pay attention." This is a really important part, behold, I am with you always to the end of the age.
[time=3137] We start off at the very beginning of Matthew in chapter one where it says,
[time=3143] "There's going to be a child and his name is going to be Jesus, and he will be with you." And Jesus comes and he's with the disciples, and he's with the woman caught in adultery, and he's with the thief on the cross, and now he's telling us, "I am still with you forever, even to the end of the age.
[time=3165] I am with you always." One thing that I know about God's faithfulness is God's faithfulness is necessary for our mission.
[time=3176] You can imagine in this moment the disciples look around and Jesus says, "In the past Jesus had sent him over to this village or this village, and then they'd get a little farther and a little farther, and then Jesus shows up and he says, "Grow into the whole world." And if I was one of the disciples in that moment, I'd kind of look around at the other ten of us and go,
[time=3199] "With these guys?
[time=3201] With these guys?" The whole world Jesus, you mean just like that's a big area for us to cover the whole world.
[time=3213] But this is where Jesus says, "Behold, this is really important.
[time=3216] This is the important part. I am with you always." Because Jesus knew that this mission could not be done without him.
[time=3224] This mission, this thing that we're called to cannot be done without the Holy Spirit empowering our lives
[time=3231] to be on mission for Christ.
[time=3237] In 2017, we've reflected in 2018 we have an incredible mission.
[time=3244] To make disciples of our friends and our families and our community, to live lives that are holy and pleasing to God.
[time=3250] And there's going to be times church where that's not easy, where that's not easy.
[time=3257] But God's faithfulness is always there.
[time=3261] It's never ending because it's who He is. It's not what He does.
[time=3265] And His faithfulness is necessary for this mission that we have.
[time=3271] I don't know what 2018 will bring.
[time=3278] It shouldn't surprise you because I didn't have no idea that in 2017 I would be here.
[time=3284] So I definitely don't know what 2018 will bring.
[time=3288] But I do know the one thing is that we can't do it on our own power.
[time=3293] We cannot embrace whatever challenge it is without God, without pushing into Him.
[time=3302] I want to ask everybody to just bow their head and close their eyes.
[time=3309] I realize there's people in here right now that have a little bit better idea what 2018 is going to bring them.
[time=3325] Because there's people in this room right now that are already facing the fears of that challenge.
[time=3331] And I want to pray for you so if you're sitting there and you're thinking, Christian, I hear what you're saying.
[time=3339] I'm going to be honest, 2018 already feels overwhelming to me and we're not even there yet.
[time=3344] I need prayer. Raise your hand.
[time=3348] If you say, look, I lost my job in 2017 and I don't know how I'm going to survive 2018, raise your hand.
[time=3356] I want to pray for you.
[time=3358] If you would say, look, our family is in tatters.
[time=3361] My marriage is struggling and I don't know what 2018 is going to bring, but it sure doesn't seem like it's going to be great.
[time=3369] Just raise your hand. I just want to pray for you.
[time=3377] God, we thank you that you are faithful, that you're the same God that was the God of Moses and the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of the woman caught in adultery.
[time=3388] You're her God too.
[time=3394] And we praise you that all power and authority on heaven and earth has been granted to you and that you are with us.
[time=3402] And I pray for each person that's raised their hand to say that I don't know about 2018.
[time=3407] I pray that you would encourage them, that you would love them, that you would pour into her life in such a mighty way.
[time=3415] And so that way at the end of 2018 that they can say, I have a story, I have a testimony because I have been delivered.
[time=3422] And my marriage has been saved.
[time=3424] And I found that job and I know that God is real and I know that God is with us because what he's done in my life in 2018.
[time=3435] And Lord, as a church, I pray that you would just allow us to come alongside all of the people that raise their hands and walk with them on whatever journey, no matter how messy, no matter what it looks like, that we would be able to be Jesus to them.
[time=3453] And church with your head still bound and eyes so close, I just want to say if there's anybody in this room that's hearing me that's saying, you know, I don't have a relationship with Jesus.
[time=3465] I haven't seen him be faithful in my life because frankly, I don't really even know who he is and what this is about.
[time=3472] Or maybe I've heard the stories, but I don't have my own story.
[time=3477] And if you would say today that I need a story from Jesus, I need to accept Jesus for the very first time I need him to be the Lord of my life, just raise your hand.
[time=3488] If you say, Christian, I don't have a story, I don't have a story and I need Jesus.
[time=3493] Yeah, I see you.
[time=3497] I'm not going to lead you in a prayer, but I want you to pray and just call out to him.
[time=3503] Pray that you would repent and turn your life towards his because God is a faithful God.
[time=3511] He came.
[time=3512] He is with us to forgive us of our sins.
[time=3520] Dear God, we thank you that you are faithful even to death on the cross, that you didn't have to do it, but that you wanted a relationship with us.
[time=3532] You wanted us to come.
[time=3533] It wasn't good enough for you to see us in a tree from afar, but you wanted us to come down and have this personal connection.
[time=3541] And Lord, I just pray for each and every person that is desiring that today.
[time=3547] Each and every person that would say, "I'm ready to turn my life around." That you would meet them right here in these seats in whichever seat they are.
[time=3560] And we thank you for that.
[time=3562] In Jesus' name, amen.
