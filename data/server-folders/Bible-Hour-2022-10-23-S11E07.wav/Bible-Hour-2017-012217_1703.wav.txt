[time=0] You
[time=30] [MUSIC]
[time=60] Today's Bible Hour is being sponsored by the family of Jan Van Till, who went home to be with the Lord on January 21st, 2014.
[time=81] [MUSIC]
[time=106] In the last week, your life will shine when all else fades into the rain.
[time=117] Your glory goes beyond our face, and the cry of my heart is to bring you praise from the end.
[time=129] [MUSIC]
[time=152] Some of them, we've got four baptisms today. I'm going to get to baptize Robert, then we've got three more.
[time=156] Some of them are going to share a little bit of their testimony, but Robert, poor guy, woke up one morning, and on his TV was this face.
[time=165] And he ended up listening, and Lord knows it had nothing to do with me, but God did a little something in him.
[time=171] He came here to Black Hawk Ministries, was going through some challenges in his life, and came here just looking for God to work in his life, and guess what? He found Jesus in the process.
[time=180] [APPLAUSE]
[time=185] And so, Robert actually prayed to receive Jesus here in one of our services, and Robert is an honor.
[time=191] It's a privilege to get to baptize you today, my friends, and thank you for the privilege right now.
[time=195] So, since you've given your heart and life to Jesus Christ today, fund that profession of faith in him, Robert, and his great command, I get to now baptize you, my friend, my brother, in the name of the Father, in the name of the Son,
[time=209] in the name of the Holy Spirit, buried with Christ and baptism, raised from one with him in a new life.
[time=216] [APPLAUSE]
[time=219] Come on down, we're in.
[time=221] [APPLAUSE]
[time=224] Welcome, my friend Sue Norton, this morning.
[time=227] [APPLAUSE]
[time=234] I've known Sue for a long time, and it's just really sweet to have her share a testimony with you this morning.
[time=239] Go ahead and read Sue.
[time=242] Good morning.
[time=244] When I look back on my life, my story starts there, because God had plans for me, even in my mother's womb.
[time=252] Most recently, my journey began on March 7th of 2016.
[time=257] That is the day I took my very stubborn husband to the doctor, because he was having bad back pains.
[time=263] They told us to go to the emergency room, thinking it could be his heart.
[time=267] After a lot of tests, they came back that night and told us he had stage four cancer.
[time=273] In his lungs, his bones, and his liver.
[time=276] He was admitted to the hospital.
[time=278] We decided to try chemo, knowing it would not cure him, but maybe give us some more time on earth together.
[time=285] After three rounds of that, we decided together to discontinue the chemo, because it was making him so sick.
[time=292] He then came home, and hospice came in.
[time=296] The doctors told us at that time he had 12 to 14 days to live.
[time=302] They were wrong.
[time=304] Through the power of prayer, prayers from people we didn't even know, like you folks.
[time=310] He had five good weeks.
[time=313] He spent that time with me, his brother, and his good friends.
[time=317] Friends he has had since childhood.
[time=319] Two of those friends are here with me today, Herman Felger and Rick Wildbanger.
[time=325] From day one, Rick Raver, who is my friend and boss at work, came to the hospital and the house every week, sometimes twice a week, to minister to both of us and pray with us.
[time=337] I can't tell you how many times I was in his office at work, and he would shut the door and wrap his arms around me and pray with me.
[time=346] I know there were nights, he probably had some late dinners, and I want to thank Diane for keeping those dinners warm for him.
[time=354] My husband Steve passed away on June 25th at 9.15 in the morning.
[time=359] I will always remember that day for obvious reasons, but also that is the day I was saved.
[time=366] I witnessed so much of God's mercy and grace through the three short months of Steve's illness, and I am so grateful to God that he brought Steve into my life and that he took him home so peacefully.
[time=377] We were married late in life and only married 13 years.
[time=381] After the funeral and things settled down a bit, I approached two of my dear friends and asked them if they would like to go to church with me.
[time=390] They were all for it.
[time=391] These two ladies, Jane Felger and Deb Wildbanger, along with my sister Patty, Rittenhouse, who are all here with me today,
[time=400] have walked this journey with me and I am very grateful to God for their friendship and love, and I love them dearly.
[time=407] We found a church we like and I continue to grow in my faith in God's teachings through the Bible and through the teachings at that church.
[time=415] I am here today in front of all of my brothers and sisters in Christ as a symbol of the love I have for Jesus and the love he has for me.
[time=424] I know he loves me because he suffered and died on the cross for me.
[time=428] I am looking forward to the path he will lead me down in the future.
[time=432] In a couple weeks, I am going to be 62 years old.
[time=436] But right now, I am a child. I am a child of God.
[time=440] I have one other thing to say, Rick.
[time=443] I miss my husband every single day.
[time=449] Somebody asked me a while ago what I was scared of the most.
[time=456] And at that time I told him what I was afraid of the most is to be on this earth without my husband, without Steve.
[time=463] But I was wrong. I am scared of being on this earth without God in my life.
[time=470] God has walked with me. He's been in my life all the time.
[time=479] And he continues to walk with me and guide me and comfort me every single day.
[time=485] I know that through him and with him, my heart will heal.
[time=489] I am looking forward to the day when he calls me home and I see Jesus and I am reunited with my husband.
[time=498] But until that day, I am going to continue to walk in his path with the plan that he had for me and my mother's womb.
[time=508] [APPLAUSE]
[time=520] Wow. It's such a privilege to have your friend, as your brother in Christ, to get to baptize you today, to get to see you.
[time=532] You know what, guys? I'm just going to tell you, to see somebody like this and hear them say the name of Jesus the way I've heard in recent months is a sweet, sweet gift.
[time=543] And I'm so thankful for that. And I'm thankful that she asked me to baptize.
[time=546] I just took it. It's such a privilege as your friend to baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son in the Holy Spirit.
[time=552] I buried with him in baptism. These are what came to walk in life.
[time=557] [APPLAUSE]
[time=564] Brandon Roarge.
[time=567] [APPLAUSE]
[time=574] At the beginning of my life, I was raised Catholic by my grandfather. At a very young age, I wasn't mature enough on my own to say I was a believer in God.
[time=581] The early in life, my parents were going through a divorce that eventually led to my father abandoning me and my brother.
[time=587] Over the years, I grew farther and farther away from any kind of religion at all.
[time=591] Soon enough, at the age of 14, I found myself on the borderline of belief and unbelief of whether there even was a God.
[time=597] Then not long after that, I lost a very dear friend to suicide.
[time=602] I had lost all hope in any connection to a God of any religion and fell deep into a whole depression.
[time=607] Time after time, I felt like I never got any better and each time took a turn for the worse.
[time=611] I went through heartbreak, loneliness, abandonment, and still battled hard with the depression.
[time=616] Depression from mom and pain eventually led to drug and alcohol abuse when the drug is an alcohol didn't help, I turned to cutting and suicidal reasoning.
[time=624] As a senior with a whole life ahead of me, I grew tired with living in the dark of a shadow.
[time=628] I knew I needed help, but it's never easy to admit that you faltered and fallen.
[time=632] But with no help and support and courage, I left my head to the sky and shouted my ultimate cry to God.
[time=638] Within days, I felt relieved and felt so much weight on my shoulders taken away.
[time=642] I broke down to my knees and tears with thanks to Jesus for his mercy and forgiveness, even though the harsh things I had done.
[time=648] Now on this day, I stand here to proclaim that I have given my heart to him, Emsel.
[time=653] My life in no way can ever repay my debts to him.
[time=656] I now also see that he has never left.
[time=659] When I think about the people I care about most, I see my mother and girlfriend who I love me unconditionally like God always has and does.
[time=665] Friends from school and barracks who are examples of forgiveness like Christ, even when I'm at my worst.
[time=671] And a stepfather to guide me like he always will.
[time=674] Today is a symbol that each remaining day of my life, I will live for God and strive to never give him anything less than all of me.
[time=680] [AMEN] Brandon, as your, well, one of those guys that calls me dad in my home kind of thing,
[time=698] it's just a sweet privilege to hear you.
[time=701] Second Corinthians 5 says, "He that is in Christ is a new creation." Brandon Roar is a new creation.
[time=707] And it's because of that and your confession of Jesus.
[time=710] It's my privilege to baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[time=714] Bear in your hand and baptism.
[time=727] So for those of you that don't know, my name is Zach Raver.
[time=730] I'm Rick Son and Diane's son as well.
[time=733] I'm a senior in high school.
[time=737] I'm a senior in high school and I've grown up in a Christian home my entire life.
[time=740] I've gone to Black Hawk for church since I was born.
[time=743] I moved to Christ into my heart when I was about five sitting on my dad's lap in his lazy boy, which he still has today, 12 years later.
[time=751] Going to a public school my whole life, it was important for me to have Christian friends that I could rely on.
[time=757] For those of you that have never gone to a public school, that's not the easiest thing to find.
[time=761] We moved to Woodburn this summer before third grade and I started going to new school, which wasn't terrible because I'm fairly outgoing.
[time=768] That was the year that I would find a friend, Jordan Delegrange, that would turn into a Christian brother, that I would later walk through life.
[time=776] Growing up, we went to church every week, I learned all the right answers.
[time=780] Throughout middle school, I always went to liquid youth group and went on every missions trip possible.
[time=786] When I hit high school, we went to Uganda, Africa for a second time with my family.
[time=790] It was very eye-opening to see the fact that God provides.
[time=793] On that trip, I got to really see pure joy.
[time=797] The kids were playing with tires and having the absolute best time of their lives.
[time=802] After we got back, it was back to the usual routine of school, friends, band, and church.
[time=809] Throughout high school, I've gone to 212 on Sundays and Wednesdays every week when I didn't have band.
[time=815] My faith wasn't really flourishing until, about this time last year, when my buddy Jordan brought up the idea of starting a guy's small group with the guys it wouldn't.
[time=824] The whole point of the group was to learn how to be a man of God and how to be a leader so that one day we could lead our own groups into a possible family.
[time=833] We started with four guys, and it grew in God's perfect timing to 17 this past week.
[time=839] In the group sometimes, I'd answer questions in a certain way, and some of the guys would joke and call me a PK.
[time=846] So, of course, I corrected them and made sure they knew I was an EK, an elders kid.
[time=851] Even though we were joking around just having fun, it kind of hit me that my answers weren't necessarily mine, but they were stuff my dad had either said to me or that he would say.
[time=860] I'm not worried me a little bit, because at that time I really knew that I needed to make my faith my own.
[time=868] Throughout the past months of the group, I started using my spiritual gift of teaching that God gave me by leading lessons in the group in a few other places.
[time=877] I'm here today because one of my good friends Brandon that I've been walking through his faith told me he loved God and wanted to be baptized. This really hit me hard.
[time=885] Many people ask me how I know that God is real.
[time=888] The fact that Brandon is here today being baptized is a living example of how God is real.
[time=893] Only someone as powerful as God can bring Brandon to finally believe in Jesus Christ in his forgiveness.
[time=899] You may hear Brandon say that it's because of me or other Christian friends that he's still here on this earth today,
[time=906] but only God's power through me being his hands and feet could do such an amazing thing.
[time=910] Since I've walked through Brandon's faith with him, I decided what better time it would be baptized than with my friend and fellow brother in the family of God.
[time=918] I'm getting baptized because I want to make a public statement that now my faith is my own, and not my parents, and to show that even though I've grown up in a Christian home in this church my whole life, then I'm a sinner who needs Jesus Christ's sacrifice in God's grace just as much as anybody else.
[time=934] [APPLAUSE]
[time=944] Wow. Thank you, Jesus.
[time=948] Zach, it's a privilege.
[time=950] It's a privilege to baptize you as your dad and your brother in Christ.
[time=956] And the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=961] [APPLAUSE]
[time=965] I want to say thank you so much for watching today.
[time=967] I hope you've already been blessed, and even more blessings are on the way.
[time=971] I want to share with you about a couple of tools that we have for you here at Black Hawk Ministries just to help you stay connected to what's going on.
[time=978] God's got a lot of great things in store for us.
[time=980] He's doing things around us every single day, and we want to make sure you're a part of that.
[time=985] And we try to stay connected to you by technology.
[time=988] And so one of the best ways that we can do that is through our church app.
[time=992] So you can search on the Google App Store or your App Store for Black Hawk Church app, and when you find that, there are a lot of great tools.
[time=999] I use it. I have it on my phone, and as I do, I find ways to stay connected to past messages.
[time=1004] You find sermon notes that are on there each week.
[time=1007] You'll find information about current events or cancellations.
[time=1011] We'll be able to notify you of things through that.
[time=1013] You'll find a schedule of all of our events there.
[time=1015] You'll find our service times listing of all those kinds of areas.
[time=1018] So I encourage you, if you don't have our Black Hawk Church app, make sure you find that so that you can stay connected with us and we can stay connected with you.
[time=1026] And so along those lines as well, we're also on social media.
[time=1028] I want to invite you to find us there.
[time=1030] You can search on Facebook, search for the Bible Hour, and you'll find there our live stream of the services each week at 10.30am.
[time=1038] On Sunday mornings, you'll find the live stream there.
[time=1040] You'll find some of our videos listed there so you can access those after the fact as well.
[time=1045] You can search for Black Hawk Ministries on Facebook or look for @BeHawkMinistries on both Instagram and Twitter and stay connected with us that way as well.
[time=1055] So BlackHawkMinistries.org has links, has information to all of those areas there.
[time=1060] You can give to our ministry there.
[time=1061] You can be a part of everything that God has in store for you as well.
[time=1065] Thank you again for watching.
[time=1066] I pray you've been blessed, and I pray that today, as we continue our series on Inside Out.
[time=1071] And the concept there is simply that even though we tend to turn inward, God wants to turn us outward.
[time=1077] He wants to turn us inside out to change how we do what we do, why we do what we do, and how we look at the world around us.
[time=1084] As we go through the book of Philippians, I pray that you will be blessed today and in all the days to come. Thanks for watching.
[time=1098] [MUSIC - 38 seconds]
[time=1145] We have a better way to kick into this idea and concept of Inside Out.
[time=1149] And so really, the question that we've been trying to ask and answer within this series is what would the world look like if the church actually function the way that its founder truly intended?
[time=1161] Because at times, the church gets broken.
[time=1163] Why?
[time=1164] Well, because it's really simply put because of you and me, because we're a part of it, because we are human, and as humans, we just break things.
[time=1172] You ever been that person before? You just break things?
[time=1175] And I love that we get to send out people just like the Spence family.
[time=1180] We get to be a part of the church being whole and functioning in that way.
[time=1184] And if you want to continue to be an encouragement to them, I'll tell you as well, their household, the Johnson household, just a little ways from the church here, they're inviting all the church family.
[time=1192] Now, if we all showed up at once, that would be quite overwhelming.
[time=1195] But if you want to stop by and encourage the Spence, there's information and address where you can stop by and just give them a little encouragement today as well.
[time=1201] Don't you just love getting to send people out for the Gospel?
[time=1204] That's what it's all about. So open your Bibles with me to Philippians.
[time=1207] So we're in a series called Inside Out. We're in Week Two.
[time=1210] We're going to be in Philippians 1. We're going to look at verses 12 through 30.
[time=1214] That's our focus today. And so today, let me ask you this question as we start.
[time=1218] Anybody ever read the end of this book before?
[time=1222] If you haven't, I'm going to sum it up for you.
[time=1225] You ready? It's pretty deep and profound. Two words. God wins.
[time=1231] And I'm glad that he wins. And I'm glad that I get to be a part of that winning team.
[time=1235] Today's title and really today's bottom line as well is simply this.
[time=1239] Church is unstoppable. Look at somebody and say church is unstoppable.
[time=1245] And Paul, who wrote Philippians, we looked at the background of that.
[time=1249] If you missed our message last week, I would encourage you, go on our website, blackcaltministries.org, and you can click on the media tab and look at all those messages there. We've got them posted in a lot of different areas.
[time=1259] But I covered some key background of the book of Philippians that really will set us up well for today. But even if you haven't heard it, here's what I know.
[time=1267] Some of you have come in here today. We've all come in here today and we all have different backgrounds. And we often don't feel very unstoppable. Can I get an amen?
[time=1275] Anybody with me? And you know when you look at the church, it doesn't look very unstoppable at times, does it?
[time=1283] Because you meet people and the church doesn't function the way you think it should or maybe the way that it was supposed to function to begin with. And it looks broken. Well, Paul was writing to this church at Philippi and he really wasn't trying to correct very much. He really wanted to celebrate and encourage them in how they were functioning as the church. It's the only one of Paul's letters where he wasn't trying to correct bad behavior within that church.
[time=1307] Interesting, isn't it? So it's a good picture of us to know what an inside-out church looks like. Our tendency is to turn inward and protect what's comfortable, but Jesus calls us to step out of what's comfortable and to turn outwardly, to live an inside-out kind of life. The church builds inwardly so that outwardly we can make the kind of impact that God has in mind for his church. Paul's writing the church at Philippi and he's writing from prison.
[time=1331] Likely in the fourth year of his Roman confinement, awaiting a sentence and awaiting what God was going to do. And if you don't know the end of that story, his head gets chopped off and his life ends here on this earth. And he pretty much saw that coming. You thought you had some reasons not to rejoice. He had it pretty bad, yet he writes, "Rejoice in the Lord, always." And again, if that's not enough, I already heard you, you're in prison, you're saying, "Rejoice," so I already think you're weird.
[time=1359] But again, I'm going to say, "Rejoice." Philippi is one of the best books about joy in all the Bible. And I'll tell you this, it really reminds me that to rejoice is a choice. Say that with me. To rejoice is a choice. You can follow along in your notes. I think that's one of your blanks there if you want to follow along with us. But church is unstoppable. And if you don't believe me, I want to show you a picture of how unstoppable it was that'll lead us to a picture of how unstoppable it is. The church at Philippi, I think about this, was the first church that Paul started in Europe. So the first church that Paul really started in Europe in an amazing way. And we looked at that last week with diverse backgrounds, three very different people that God brought together for one purpose. And that purpose was the gospel and the spread of the church. And so I want to show you three pictures. I'll show you the first one here.
[time=1411] It's a map of the modern day in Paul's time. What that would have looked like. What the world really looked like. The Roman province here.
[time=1419] 45 AD. This was around the time right after the first missionary journey.
[time=1423] Paul's first church planting trip, if you will. Now what you'll see on this picture, you're going to have to look hard. I'll get your glasses on. Zoom in real quick with me.
[time=1431] I'll take a little yellow spots. There's only about two or three and they're very small. You see them? That was the known influence that the church of Jesus Christ had in that day and time. That's what it looked like. Now in 65 AD, this was about the time right after his second church planting journey, the journey that Paul went on that planted the church at Philippi.
[time=1451] This is what it looked like. 65 AD.
[time=1455] Hmm. Not bad. Pretty interesting.
[time=1459] This is what it looked like right about this time that we're reading in.
[time=1463] Right when Paul was writing this letter, it looked about like this, but then 325 AD. So you skip ahead a few hundred years.
[time=1471] What do you think the church looked like then? Even though everyone tried to stop it.
[time=1475] Let's look at that.
[time=1479] Kind of speaks for itself, doesn't it?
[time=1483] Why? Here's the thing. What you need to know is in those few hundred years where everybody tried to stop it.
[time=1491] Everybody tried to stop it. People wanted the Bible to be thrown away all these years after it and you should know there are people whose sole purpose in life is to see that the Bible cannot carry forward in the world anymore. For centuries it's been that way. Yet I hold one. You've probably got one. We've got versions on our app right now. Why? Because the church is unstoppable. During this time, every single angle tried to stop the church from spreading. There shouldn't have been that kind of yellow picture on the screen in 325 AD. But why? Because Jesus said it best. He said, "I will build my church and even the gates of hell can't prevail against it." That's the kind of team I want to be a part of. Anybody with me? That's the team you're a part of when you follow Jesus with your life. That's the unstoppable church. I want to answer two questions than today because some of you are still skeptical. And I understand that I've been the skeptic even as a PK. Zach talked about being an EK. I like that.
[time=1551] But even as a PK, a preacher's kid, I was skeptical for a large season of my life.
[time=1559] And I'm going to tell you that I know some of you are here and you're skeptical today.
[time=1563] I want to answer a couple of questions. The first simply being, what makes the church so unstoppable?
[time=1567] You can't deny that it's here. It doesn't mean I have to believe in it.
[time=1571] Some of you are thinking that right now. It doesn't mean I have to get behind it.
[time=1575] So what makes the church so unstoppable? And then I'm going to answer the question, what makes me so unstoppable?
[time=1579] How many of you are here and you would say, "I don't feel very unstoppable today?" To be honest, we try to be real. Everybody give me your best church smile.
[time=1591] There's a little fake smile. For honest, there are a lot of days we don't feel very unstoppable at all. So I want to dive into these two questions. The first question is, what makes the church so unstoppable? What made it spread that way? In Philippians chapter number one, verses 12 through 18, we see just that.
[time=1607] Who's ready for the word? Let's start with verse 12, and I just want to walk through it a piece at a time with you. Verses 12 through 18, you'll see the first thing if you want to take notes. Here's the first answer. I'm going to give you two thoughts with that question.
[time=1619] What makes the church so unstoppable? The first is that even in difficulties, even in difficulties, the joy of Jesus wins.
[time=1629] Even in difficulties, the joy of Jesus wins. Paul is writing from a prison cell, and he says this in verse 12, "I want you to know brothers that what has happened to me has really." I'm reading from the English standard version, by the way,
[time=1643] ESV. So if you want to follow along, that one, or yours has a few different words that I'd like to highlight as well. It has really, underline that word really, or maybe it's actually in your version. What has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel. Because here's what that looks like. Paul's there.
[time=1661] You are thinking that I'm probably pretty downcast,
[time=1667] and I feel like my life's falling apart because I'm in prison, Paul says.
[time=1671] But here's what it really has done. It really, it actually, that's a big word. Circle, underline, and bold that in your Bible because that's our life. Is it not those things? For honest, those things that we think is just tearing our life apart. What people meant for evil, God means for good. What we can only see as a dark cloud, God sees as a way, a venue, a foundation for something that only he can do.
[time=1695] Paul says, "What's happened to me has really served to advance the gospel. So it has become known throughout the whole imperial garden, and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ." And most of the brothers, having become confident, underline that, having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment. Let me ask you a question.
[time=1719] People became confident about Jesus because of Paul, even in his worst of moments. When people look at your life in my life, do they become confident in Jesus, or do they lose confidence in him? It's a tough question to swallow, isn't it? Paul says, "But these brothers that are in prison women around me, they become confident in Jesus because of not just me, but my imprisonment, me and my darkest of moments. And they are much more bold to speak the word without fear." Verse 15, "Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will. The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. The former, so those that do it with bad motives and good motives." You ever seen that before? People who claim to preach with good motives that they're really bad.
[time=1771] Or people who really are preaching straight from the heart, a heart of Jesus.
[time=1775] Paul has seen both, just like you and I have seen both. "The former, he says, for seventeen, proclaim Christ out of rivalry, not sincerely, but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment." What then?
[time=1787] Do I whine about it? Do I sulk about it?
[time=1791] Do I just hold on to all the darkness around me and just embrace the fact that life's dark and go through life?
[time=1799] Like this? Ever met that person?
[time=1803] Ever been that person? I know I have.
[time=1807] What then, Paul says, only that in every way whether in pretense or in truth, whether for the good or for the bad Christ is proclaimed. And in that I rejoice.
[time=1819] Yes, and I will rejoice.
[time=1823] Three things happen because of joy. You ever wondered what the difference between joy and happiness is? I'm going to tell you. Happiness is based on what happens around you. You can remember that, right? Happiness is based on what happens. It's exterior.
[time=1835] It's on the outside. And it goes up and it goes down with the waves of life.
[time=1839] Joy has nothing to do with what happens because it comes from the inside out. Paul had joy.
[time=1847] And that's what he talks of when he says I rejoice. Three things happen with his joy in this passage alone because even in difficulties the joy of Jesus wins.
[time=1855] That's how the church is so unstoppable and I'll submit to you. Here's what I tell you. This is not in your notes.
[time=1859] No extra charge for this but I think it's going to bless you. Maybe.
[time=1863] Maybe it will challenge you. I truly believe that what makes the church so unstoppable is our response to suffering and struggle.
[time=1875] The defining moments like this came in the worst of moments. The darkest of moments. The same is often true of your life and of my life as well.
[time=1883] A few things happen is the gospel spread to where it shouldn't have gone.
[time=1887] We saw that in the first few verses 12 and 13. The gospel spread to where it shouldn't have gone. He was in prison for sharing the gospel the way they did share the gospel but the gospel was only spreading more because of what happened to get him in prison for sharing the gospel. Think about that. He shouldn't be sharing. The gospel shouldn't be spreading. He should be in confinement. He should be in darkness but the gospel only spread more because of his imprisonment. The second thing is it empowered people around him. Not only did the gospel go where it shouldn't have gone. It empowered other people.
[time=1915] When you live the gospel when you live the truth of the gospel what does that mean? That means you don't shy away from it in your job. That means you don't shy away from it with that family member or that friend that doesn't want to hear about it. Doesn't mean you shove it down their throat. It means you love them and you be the church in their life. Here's what I'm going to tell you. Being the church in other people's lives is more often than not. Not about what you say but more about what you do. More about what they observe.
[time=1943] Particularly in times of struggle and suffering.
[time=1947] The third thing that we see happen here is that even in wickedness and evil the gospel exploded.
[time=1955] Paul's talking about here's what was happening when he's talking to verses 15 through 18 about how people were preaching the gospel. Preaching Jesus with bad motives.
[time=1963] Paul's in prison. Do you think people kind of lobbied for Paul's influence during this time?
[time=1967] The politics. Politics and church they don't mix.
[time=1971] Right? Well they did in the early church. And people would try to gain influence and they would preach with bad motives. We've seen that all before. People try to live with bad motives. And here's why I as a pastor very rarely if ever will criticize another pastor.
[time=1987] Here's why. What Paul said.
[time=1991] My God, this is basically what he's saying there toward the end. Verse 18.
[time=1995] My God is way bigger than people's false motives.
[time=1999] He'll even take the false wicked evil motives of people that talk about Jesus for their own personal gain and only make Jesus name get more famous. That's the God that I serve. He doesn't need any of us to begin with Paul saying to us. And I'm saying to us today he doesn't need you and he doesn't need me. And that's why I just very rarely criticize anybody who brags on Jesus. Even if they do it with wrong motives even if they're doing it the wrong way in my opinion. I'm just glad the name of Jesus is being spread and my God will sort out all the rest.
[time=2031] Even in difficulties. The joy of Jesus wins.
[time=2035] The second thing. Not just that. Even in difficulties. The joy of Jesus wins.
[time=2039] But also even in death. Even in death.
[time=2043] The joy of Jesus wins.
[time=2047] Even in death. The joy of Jesus wins. Paul was confident in the deliverance.
[time=2051] Look at verse 19. I'm going to read a few of those verses to you.
[time=2055] He says, "For I know that your prayers and the help of the spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance." And you say he was wrong. His head got chopped off.
[time=2067] Or was he?
[time=2071] I think he explains it pretty well as we move forward. Verse 20.
[time=2075] "As it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed but with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body whether by life or by death.
[time=2087] Even in death the joy of Jesus wins." Paul knew that. And here's one of the defining verses of Philippians.
[time=2095] Verse 21, "For me to live is Christ but to die is game." Think about that this week. That'll rock your world folks.
[time=2107] Verse 22, "If I'm to live in the flesh that means fruitful labor for me. I make a difference for Jesus here on the earth." That's what he's saying. "Yet which shall I choose? I cannot tell." I would be in that way too. If I were in prison I'd be like let me just go home to Jesus.
[time=2123] Paul felt that tension. I'm hard pressed between the two. Verse 23.
[time=2127] "To depart and be with Christ for that's far better." Verse 24, "But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account." That's the calling. Consider what you're called to in life. Your family. Your friends. Your workplace.
[time=2139] Paul let his calling drive. His staying. And his statement.
[time=2143] To live is Christ. But to die is game.
[time=2147] Verse 25, "Convinced of this I know I will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy in the faith.
[time=2155] So that in me you may have ample calls." There it is again.
[time=2159] Because of me, because of my ministry, you may have ample calls or you may have confidence in Jesus. Do other people gain confidence in Jesus by looking at your life? Or maybe do they lose some? "To glory in Jesus Christ because of my coming to you
[time=2173] again. Even in death the joy of Jesus wins." We did a CPR training years ago for a church staff. And I remember I had to do it and if you didn't know, Jessica and I have been in the process of adoption and preparing for that for over a year now.
[time=2189] And part of that is you got to get CPR training. And I've always tried to live by the thought that I'm supposed to do unto others what I would have them do to me. Not do unto others what I really like to do to them. Or what they did to me. Do unto others what I'd have them do to me. And I had to think about and I did do CPR training and just, you know, CPR training. Don't look to me though, probably not very good at it.
[time=2213] So we've got other people who are a lot more skilled. But I remember going through that and thinking, you know, if I'm going to do unto others what I have them do unto me, I don't really think I'd want to be brought back.
[time=2221] If I'm that close to Jesus, leave me alone. Let me go home.
[time=2225] That's what Paul felt. He was at the point of death. He was at the point of death and meeting Jesus. And he felt pulled there. But he knew his calling was to stay here.
[time=2237] He felt torn between those and in the tension of filling torn between those things. We find an ability and a call to make a difference even in death. Even in difficulties where other people see the joy of Jesus winning in our life. Now let's make it personal.
[time=2253] I'm not just talking about an unstoppable building when I say church is unstoppable.
[time=2257] There are no unstoppable buildings. A fire could take this place down in a matter of a day.
[time=2261] We hope it doesn't. We take good care of what God gives us.
[time=2265] But here's what I do know. The church would not cease to exist if our buildings tore down. Why?
[time=2273] Because of you. Because of me. Because you're the church. So I'm not talking about unstoppable buildings. I'm talking about unstoppable people. And we've already said, well I don't feel very unstoppable.
[time=2285] You with me? I don't feel very unstoppable. So let's look at this thought of what it means to be an unstoppable person. What makes me so unstoppable? First Corinthians, you can jot this down. First Corinthians 15 and verse 58. "Therefore my beloved brothers." Paul writes this as well.
[time=2301] The church at Corinth. "Be steadfast, immovable and always abounding in the work of the Lord knowing that your labor is not in vain." Listen to me for a minute. Some of you feel like your labor is in vain. Your spiritual journey you feel like you just haven't been getting anywhere. No traction. No movement.
[time=2321] I'm not seeing any fruit. You feel stuck in a rut. Some of you say, I've been in that place for years.
[time=2329] First of all, I want to tell you, I've been in that place for years too. I understand it.
[time=2333] I've walked in it. Why? You thought, well you're a pastor. You're not supposed to get in a rut.
[time=2337] Well, I'm human. Just so you know. We're in this together.
[time=2341] I understand what it's like to be stuck in the spiritual rut and not feel very unstoppable. You feel like you've had a big stop sign plastered on your forehead for a long time. I believe I've got a few ideas that can help you get unstuck, if you will, and start moving to be unstoppable, immovable and always abounding in your faith. I love the end of that verse. Your labor is not in vain. Hear me. Hear me. Your labor. Your hard work.
[time=2365] Your digging into Jesus is not in vain.
[time=2369] Keep going. Some of you came today just to hear that simple phrase.
[time=2373] Keep going. Don't stop. Your labor is not in vain. Jesus is not done with you yet. Verse number six of chapter 1. He who began a good work in you will bring it to completion to the day of Jesus Christ. He is just getting started with you. Don't buy into that lie anymore. Some of you need to let those things that have stolen your joy lead you to rejoice. Like Paul. You say, well I don't feel unstoppable enough to do that. If you plug into Jesus, I promise you he'll turn the frowns upside down. Doesn't mean you'll be happy, but it means you'll be joyful. And people will look at you and even in the darkest of moments, they'll say, that dude, that girl, they're unstoppable. What's wrong with them?
[time=2417] Like Paul. I've talked about Paul. He would be such a frustrating guy.
[time=2421] You know, you just want to complain for five minutes. Do you ever have those days?
[time=2425] I just want five. Oh, it's just me. Okay. Well, no.
[time=2429] I know it's not. I just want five minutes to complain and be negative. But then that person is like, they're not going to let me complain. They're just going to be joyful.
[time=2437] You laugh because you know some of those people.
[time=2441] But I want to tell you, we're called to be those people.
[time=2445] Just like Paul was. Let me give you some reasons why I believe that you are unstoppable if you know Jesus. What makes me so unstoppable?
[time=2453] Number one, starting verse 27. We just got to verse 26. Verse 27, we see standing together with unity.
[time=2461] Standing together with unity. Verse 27.
[time=2465] Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ.
[time=2469] That's hard.
[time=2473] Let my life be worthy of the gospel of Christ.
[time=2477] That would take an unstoppable person. I happen to know one. His name is Jesus.
[time=2481] So that, whether I come and see you or I'm absent, Paul saying, if I die, if I make it back or I get to come see you, I might hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit with one mind. I'll pause there for a moment. Standing together in unity. All of our differences made one. The church at Philippi started with Lydia, CEO, fashionista, top of the food chain, successful, semi-religious person, Philippian jailer, uninterested spiritually, blue collar, work nine to five, go home, watch TV, slave girl who's in poverty. That's how the church at Philippi began.
[time=2525] Totally different people, totally different backgrounds, but God through all of those differences, all of those barriers, all of those things that would divide us from what the church was supposed to stand on and look like He threw them all away, brought those people together for the gospel.
[time=2541] That's what He wants to do in us. He wants us to be grace filled people who no matter what, who we respect the uniqueness of every different person in the room, we live based on the word of Jesus which means we love people the way Jesus loved people and that means that no different skin color, no different religious background, no political beliefs, nothing and no dividing line keeps us from looking to Jesus and it brings us together and it brings people together that could not otherwise be brought together apart from Jesus Christ.
[time=2573] It's standing in unity.
[time=2577] It's one of the ways we can be the church, be an inside-out church the most in the world around us, is being unified when everybody around us is divided.
[time=2585] This is hard in the western world today that we live in because we live in a world that says, well my way is right. This way is the only way. In fact I'll tell you in the church world I've grown up in church and I would say we're doing inside-out or the inside-anthum the theme song of the church has always been and probably will always be, well we've never done it that way.
[time=2609] Some of you didn't laugh because you just said that this morning.
[time=2613] We've never done it that way before because this is the only way to do it. Well to be unified we throw all that away and we say, you know what, I don't care what I prefer, I want effectiveness for Jesus and I want the gospel to spread. We stand together in unity. Number two, I could preach another sermon on that, I might just do that next week.
[time=2633] Number two, striving side by side with others, striving side by side with others. Look at the end of verse 27 I stop there and say so that wherever I, whether I come to see you or I'm absent I may hear that you're standing firm in one spirit with one mind, striving side by side for the faith of the gospel.
[time=2653] A lot of times when we read the Bible we think the characters there are something different about them, like Lydia, like the slave girl, like the Philippian jailer. We think, well they just started the church and they didn't struggle anymore.
[time=2669] Why do you think Paul said striving one foot in front of the next, striving, pleading, plotting, digging, even when it hurts, even when it's painful. Let me ask you, you think Lydia is as successful as she was, she probably funded a lot of things in the church.
[time=2685] You ever think she flaunted that over people in the church? Maybe she struggled with pride?
[time=2689] The Bible doesn't say so, I'm just guessing here.
[time=2693] You think that the slave girl, Paul cast a demon out of her. She was enslaved by this group of guys. You ever think maybe she had relationship issues?
[time=2705] Trust issues perhaps that she had to work through?
[time=2709] Maybe those trust issues got translated to her faith?
[time=2713] What about that old harsh jailer who was supposed to keep Paul safe, but he beat him instead? Pretty hard guy, ex-military guy. You ever think he struggled with being gentle with people and loving people? Of course they did. I don't know if that was their struggles, but here's what I know they had them. You've got them. We strive together side by side. That's why I believe, hear me. That's why I believe that circles are better than Rose. I believe in what we're doing. We're called to not for sake the assembling of guys people together. That's in scripture. That means we're supposed to have church like this and we've had church today. I love it. We're supposed to do this and it fills you up, but I would challenge you to tell you it is not enough.
[time=2753] Some of you realize that right now it's not enough for me.
[time=2757] I need more. I run out. I get my tank filled up on Sunday morning and a lot of you are depending on me. Here's where I'm going to tell you. You're depending on me to fill up your tank.
[time=2765] It's not enough. I don't have enough for you. Scripture is enough for you, but just coming on Sunday morning is not enough. You need to be doing life alongside of people. You're not good enough to not do that. You're not good enough to do life by yourself.
[time=2781] I'm not good enough to do life by myself.
[time=2785] Striving side by side circles are better than Rose because when we're in circles we lock arms together and we have the capacity to turn outward and build inwardly so that we can be an outward focused church.
[time=2797] Last thing. Suffering.
[time=2801] This way you wanted me to end the sermon, right?
[time=2805] Number three, what makes me so unstoppable? Suffering joyfully with fearlessness versus 28 through 30. Suffering joyfully with fearlessness.
[time=2813] Look at verse 28 with me, "And not frightened in anything, and not frightened in anything by your opponents." This is a clear sign to them, your opponents, to them of their destruction.
[time=2829] But of your salvation. So it's a sign to your enemies and it's a sign to you.
[time=2833] What kind of sign? We're going to look at that in a minute. And that it's from God.
[time=2837] It's a sign to them and to you from God.
[time=2841] For it has been granted to you. Here we go. We're getting to the good stuff.
[time=2845] It's been granted to you for the sake of Christ. You should not only believe in Him, but also suffer.
[time=2857] It's been granted to you to not only believe, but also to suffer for His sake. Coming from the guy in prison.
[time=2865] Engaged in the same conflict that you saw I had and here now that I still have.
[time=2873] I want to say something to you. Some of you have been blinded by your fear in your faith journey. You've been afraid of your past. You've been afraid of your journey. You've been afraid of current mistakes.
[time=2885] Current habits. Current sin that you're living in. Maybe past sin.
[time=2889] Or maybe of something in the future. But some of you have been blinded by your fear. Today God wants to set you free.
[time=2897] Because the same Paul who was in prison
[time=2905] says to you rejoice. Again I say rejoice.
[time=2909] The thing he wanted to end with in this chapter is to say don't live in fear. That your struggle. The same conflict that you've seen me engaged in. The same struggle that you've seen for all of these years. Let it be a sign to your enemies and of your salvation that I'm not through with you yet.
[time=2933] God is not finished with you and your struggle. Think about this.
[time=2937] Write this down, wrestle with this this week. Your struggle today is a sign of God's working in your life. Your struggle is a sign today that God wants to take that which confounds the minds of the world that makes no sense that is so confusing.
[time=2953] I've sat with people on their deathbed. I've sat with people who've lost a baby.
[time=2957] I've done funerals where there was a little tiny casket of a baby that shouldn't have gone from this world in my mind.
[time=2965] But I know that God had a bigger plan.
[time=2969] And even when we don't understand and even when we're blinded by our fear, those same struggles that hold us back can be a sign in your life that you're being the church and that God's not done yet. So the closing thought with that is suffer well with joy. Buy your heads with me for a minute.
[time=2997] Just think about what that means. What a closing challenge from a pastor.
[time=3001] Suffer well with joy. But that's what Paul is saying to us. It's what he's saying to you is what God's stirring inside of you. Suffer well.
[time=3013] The struggle that you have right now is a sign to you that God's around you, that he's working and he's given you a platform to make a difference. If you know him today, live in that. Let your struggle lead you to trust, to living inside out. As you think about what that looks like even this week, what does that mean for you? I want to speak to those of you. Nobody's looking around.
[time=3037] All heads bound. Some of you today, you would say, I just need Jesus.
[time=3041] I'm lost.
[time=3045] I've been afraid to take that leap, but today is that day. I don't know that if I were to die today, that I'd spend eternity with Jesus in heaven. Some of you have been skeptics for a long time and God has prompted inside of you that today is the day of salvation. You know it. You're still afraid but you know now is the time. Here's my challenge. Take the leap.
[time=3069] Take the leap. You will not regret it.
[time=3073] Not because I say so, but because God is working inside of you. You say, well, how do I do that? What does that even look like?
[time=3081] I'm going to tell you, I'm not even going to lead you in a prayer. There's no magic prayer that saves anybody. It's the condition of our hearts that saves the scripture tells us.
[time=3089] Well, what does that look like? Well, that looks as simple as us believing Jesus came. He's the Son of God who died on that cross for you and for me after living that sinless life that you and I definitely can't live. But he did that. He did die.
[time=3105] But then three days later he conquered death and he didn't just conquer death for him. He conquered death for you. And because he's alive you can have life and have it more abundantly. That's salvation.
[time=3121] Believing on Jesus. It goes back to trust. If that's you, your heart screaming a prayer right now. In fact, some of you've already prayed it because you couldn't wait any longer.
[time=3129] If that's you, take that moment right now in this second and just pray to him where you said.
[time=3159] I am a child of God.
[time=3173] I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[time=3179] I am a child of God.
[time=3189] From my mother's room you have chosen me.
[time=3203] Love has caught my name. I've been born again
[time=3213] into your family.
[time=3217] Your blood flows through my veins.
[time=3223] I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[time=3229] I am a child of God.
[time=3235] I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[time=3241] I am a child of God.
[time=3247] I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[time=3255] I am a child of God.
[time=3261] I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[time=3267] I am a child of God.
[time=3317] I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[time=3329] I am a child of God.
[time=3335] I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[time=3355] I am a child of God.
[time=3389] I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[time=3397] I am a child of God.
[time=3403] I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[time=3411] I am a child of God.
[time=3421] Church is unstoppable, and you know as we've looked at that in the book of Philippians today, the point of that is not that there are unstoppable buildings called the church.
[time=3430] The point of that is that it's all about unstoppable people.
[time=3433] Now, if you're like me, you probably don't feel very unstoppable in your life on some days.
[time=3438] But today, as we've explored this, I pray that some of you that are watching right now, God's done something new in your heart.
[time=3444] He's done something new in your life. There's a new stirring there to just simply take that leap of faith that maybe you've been putting off for quite some time.
[time=3451] That leap of faith that means I'm going to trust Jesus with my life.
[time=3455] It really is as simple as I've outlined today.
[time=3458] You've got an enemy that's whispering in your ear that it's not that simple, that there's more to it.
[time=3463] I want you to know that the gospel is truly simple. The gospel was meant for you.
[time=3468] And if you take that leap of faith and trust him today, he will not disappoint you.
[time=3472] It doesn't mean life's going to get easy, but it means that you have a new foundation for your life that changes.
[time=3477] Not only how you look at the world around you, but how you see yourself and what God wants to do in your life.
[time=3482] I challenge you, take that step today, and if you haven't taken that step and you do that today, then we want to get a booklet in your hands.
[time=3488] The book is called Beginning Steps, a growth guide for new believers. And as we get that into your hands, we'll mail it to you.
[time=3493] You can come by the church here at Black Hawk Ministries to pick one up, but we want to get one in your hands so that you can just simply see what's next.
[time=3500] Because this is a beginning in your life. It's not an end of something. It's the start of a brand new life and a brand new future for you.
[time=3508] And you've watched today. Several people will be baptized. I would encourage you to think about what it means for you to take that big step as well.
[time=3515] Jesus modeled that by being baptized himself. He asked us to do that as a follow-up, a next step, if you will, to accepting him, to giving your life to him.
[time=3524] And when you do, not only does it do something inside of you, it also says to the world around you that you're not ashamed of Jesus.
[time=3532] And you never know what God may do through that one simple step of obedience.
[time=3535] If you're interested in finding out how you can be baptized here at Black Hawk Ministries, we'll come to you.
[time=3540] We'll work with your schedule, whatever that looks like, for you to be baptized. We would love to help you and walk with you on that journey as well.
[time=3547] I just want to say thank you for watching. Realize that you could be doing a lot of things today, but you've chosen to give some of your day to us and to celebrate Jesus with us here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=3557] And so thank you for watching. I pray you've been blessed. And I pray that you'll keep returning and keep letting us speak truth into your life.
[time=3562] And we'll go on this journey together. Thanks again. See you soon.
