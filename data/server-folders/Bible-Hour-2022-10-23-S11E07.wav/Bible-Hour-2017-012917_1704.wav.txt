[time=538] [AMEN] Thank you so much for watching today and just giving some time in your week.
[time=544] I know you've been blessed already, but there's so much more coming.
[time=547] We're going to be talking about what it looks like to be the kind of church that Jesus had in mind when he built his church, when he established his church.
[time=555] That's where inside out comes from, and we're going to be looking at how we can live inside out.
[time=559] And so I want to give you in the meantime a few ways you can connect with us here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=564] In this series, we're talking a lot about partnering with our community and how the church should be known in the community.
[time=570] And so what we're trying to do at Black Hawk Ministries is give you a venue to plug into the community and let people in Fort Wayne and around the world truly see what it looks like for a church to engage with people all around us.
[time=582] And so we've been talking some about safe families.
[time=584] You're going to be hearing some more about other venues to connect.
[time=587] If you'd like to connect with us on that, send us an email.
[time=589] We've got some information that'll be on the screen here momentarily that you can connect with us and know what it's like to plug into community.
[time=596] Plug into a family that wants to make a difference for Jesus.
[time=600] And so several ways that you can connect with us include finding us on social media.
[time=604] You can find us on Instagram and Twitter @bhalkministries.
[time=608] You can find us there.
[time=609] You can search for the Bible Hour or Black Hawk Ministries on Facebook.
[time=613] And then you can also connect with us on BlackhawkMinistries.org.
[time=617] But also I want to tell you about our church app, Blackhawk Church App.
[time=620] You can go to your Google Play Store. You can go to the App Store.

[time=652] Our goal here is family. We want to be a family that's all tied together by Jesus.
[time=658] And today we're looking at the mind of Jesus, the humility of Jesus.
[time=663] And I want you to know that He cares about you right where you are.
[time=666] And I can't wait to talk some more about that momentarily. Thanks again.
[time=669] [MUSIC - 301 seconds]
[time=981] [AMEN]
[time=983] [APPLAUSE]
[time=985] [MUSIC]
[time=1032] â™ª Forgot your bibles, look at Philippians with me.
[time=1040] You've kind of heard the whole point of what we're trying to do here at Black Hawk Ministries right now anyway.
[time=1045] And the whole point is that Jesus has called us to live a life that is inside out.
[time=1051] What does that mean? It means that, you know, we typically build inwardly in our life.
[time=1056] We typically protect the stuff that's around us to try to make life as comfortable and easy as possible.
[time=1061] Is that about right? That's kind of our natural tendencies to do that.
[time=1065] But Jesus built a church that He said in this world, you will have trouble.
[time=1070] In this world, you will not always feel like you're a safe family.
[time=1074] In this world, you will have bumps and you will have bruises, bruises.
[time=1078] But I have overcome the world.
[time=1080] And so what I want to do is I want to help the church.
[time=1083] I want to help you build inwardly so much that something happens inside of you that outwardly the world gets impacted
[time=1090] and forever changed by the Gospel of Jesus.
[time=1093] That's what we're called to. That's the point of this series.
[time=1096] And Philippians is a great book to give us a glimpse into how we can live inside out.
[time=1101] It gives us a glimpse into what it can look like for us to allow Jesus to stretch us some.
[time=1107] I love that today we talked with the acres and they shared some of those moments where they felt stretched.
[time=1111] They didn't feel qualified.
[time=1113] And what we're going to talk about today, Philippians chapter 2.
[time=1116] So that's what we're going to be looking.
[time=1117] Philippians chapter 2, in this passage, I'm just going to be honest with you.
[time=1121] You ready for this?
[time=1122] You're going to be stretched.
[time=1124] It's going to hurt a little bit.
[time=1126] Are you ready for it this morning?
[time=1128] Because it stretches us to think about what it means to be humble.
[time=1133] What it means to put me last.
[time=1137] And that's not natural.
[time=1139] But that's the beauty of getting the opportunity to be the church in the world around us.
[time=1145] Because even though it's not natural, even though we don't have what it takes, he does.
[time=1150] And that's what we're going to look at today.
[time=1152] Church is built by humility is what we're going to look at.
[time=1155] So if you're watching this online, I want to welcome you.
[time=1157] Say thank you for digging in at home, television, all of us in the room today.
[time=1161] We're one big family and it excites me that the gospel of Jesus is being made known.
[time=1166] That's what we're all about.
[time=1167] We want Jesus to be famous.
[time=1169] Jesus and Jesus alone.
[time=1171] It's his church after all.
[time=1172] It's not yours.
[time=1173] Look at somebody and say it's not your church.
[time=1176] It's not your church.
[time=1177] It's his church.
[time=1178] And I'm glad it's his church.
[time=1180] I'm glad because of that I can say I am his.
[time=1183] I am the church.
[time=1185] We are the church.
[time=1187] So we're looking in Philippians that how Jesus built his church and how we can be that kind of church.
[time=1193] What would the world look like is the question we've been asking.
[time=1196] What would the world look like if the church of Jesus functioned the way that he intended from the beginning?
[time=1202] That's kind of our goal.
[time=1203] I think Philippians is the greatest book on joy.
[time=1206] I've been using this phrase and I want to use it again.
[time=1208] It's even in your notes again for a very clear reason.
[time=1211] The phrase is to rejoice is a choice.
[time=1214] To rejoice is a choice.
[time=1217] Paul shows us that because in the book of Philippians he's writing it from prison.
[time=1222] But it's the most joyful book maybe in all scripture.
[time=1225] He says rejoice in the Lord always.
[time=1227] And again I'm going to say it.
[time=1229] He shows us that to rejoice is a choice that we can make.
[time=1233] And to rejoice in the world around us even when it doesn't make sense can sometimes be the catalyst for people to see Jesus for who he truly is.
[time=1243] That's where you and I come in.
[time=1245] So here's where we are.
[time=1246] We've looked the last couple of weeks at how the gospel, how the building of the church, how it's unstoppable, how it's a joy to be a part of that.
[time=1255] And we've looked at how Paul showed us the building of the church at Philippi came through these three people initially and in the book of Acts.
[time=1262] We looked at them and it was the Philippian jailer, that blue collar guy that just wanted to do his job and to go home and get home from work and enjoy his family and get home blue collar guy.
[time=1271] We had the slave girl who was demon possessed, had nothing to offer the world, was completely impoverished, was in slavery.
[time=1278] And then we had Lydia, the CEO, white collar, successful lady.
[time=1282] God took the most unlikely family of people with all of their different religious backgrounds, all of their different ethnic backgrounds, all of their different backgrounds, all together.
[time=1291] He put them in one place together and said, "I'm going to build my church and these people are going to be the catalyst through which that will happen." God tore down all of the barriers that we put in place.
[time=1303] All of the walls, we love the song that we sing, let the walls come down in Jesus' name.
[time=1308] And when Jesus is involved, he tears down the walls.
[time=1312] And so Paul's moving us from that thought to last week we looked at how the church is unstoppable, how Jesus said, "I'm going to build my church and even the gates of hell can't win against it." It's going to spread, it's going to win.
[time=1324] For centuries, people have tried to do away with the Bible, to do away with the church, but the church is alive because Jesus is alive.
[time=1332] Not only did Jesus build his church in a way that tears down the walls of the barriers we build,
[time=1339] it's bigger than the circumstances that we face, that's what we looked at last week.
[time=1343] Now, Paul's helping us understand how can this same joy become a way of life?
[time=1349] What's the foundation of the church being the church?
[time=1353] How can we build the church the way Jesus intends?
[time=1356] And that's where we get to this idea that church is built by humility.
[time=1360] So we're going to look at that, that's really the bottom line today.
[time=1362] Church is built by humility.
[time=1368] Any humble people in the room?
[time=1370] Nah, just a check.
[time=1372] If you raise your hand, you're probably not very humble, right?
[time=1375] Look at this big picture idea in Scripture from 1 Peter.
[time=1379] You can just jot this down, you don't have to flip there, it's going to be on the screen for you.
[time=1382] 1 Peter 5 verses 5 and 6.
[time=1385] It says God opposes the who?
[time=1388] The proud.
[time=1389] God opposes the proud, but He gives grace to the humble.
[time=1393] You see the contrast.
[time=1394] So He says, "Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, so that at the proper time He may exalt you." The way I memorize it growing up is so that He may exalt you in due time.
[time=1408] He may exalt you in due time.
[time=1409] Here's what I'll tell you.
[time=1410] Humility is not a comfortable subject.
[time=1413] That's kind of the point.
[time=1414] That's why we're partnering with, say, families that we talked about and trying to give opportunities for us to stretch.
[time=1420] Because those are some of those kind of opportunities that you don't just throw a little check in the basket and say, "Well, I feel good because I helped a good ministry." Those are opportunities where you've got to go get your hands dirty.
[time=1429] That's the kind of opportunities that Jesus had in mind for us to engage our community, do whatever it takes to make Him known in the world around us.
[time=1437] But it takes humbling ourselves.
[time=1438] And here's what that verse really tells us is that to live in arrogance or to live in pride, you're really opposing God because He opposes the proud.
[time=1447] You ever been in a season of life where you felt like you were fighting God?
[time=1451] If I'm honest, I would say, "Yeah, I have." There's times where I want what I want and what I want's best for my life.
[time=1458] I know it is.
[time=1459] It's got to be, right?
[time=1461] Humm.
[time=1462] But when I do that and it goes against what God's trying to teach me or do through me, I'm literally fighting against God.
[time=1470] You ready for this?
[time=1472] If you're in that boat today, stop it.
[time=1476] You want to know why you should stop it?
[time=1478] You're not going to win.
[time=1480] We already talked about, I've read the end.
[time=1481] Anybody ever read the end of this book?
[time=1484] He wins.
[time=1485] I don't want to fight against him.
[time=1487] I want to get on that team.
[time=1489] And to do that, it requires us to stretch.
[time=1491] To do that, it requires us to build our lives around this idea, this concept of humility.
[time=1495] I want to give you a few thoughts on humility today.
[time=1498] The first one is this.
[time=1500] Drop this down if you're taking notes.
[time=1501] The first one is that humility is going to do some stuff to you.
[time=1504] It's going to stretch you.
[time=1505] It's even going to hurt sometimes.
[time=1507] But this humility that Jesus talks about, that Paul writes about in the life of Jesus, is going to do some key things.
[time=1512] The first one is that humility puts unity before apathy.
[time=1518] Humility will put unity before apathy.
[time=1522] We see that really clearly in verses one and two.
[time=1525] Anybody ready for some scripture this morning?
[time=1527] In verse one, Philippians chapter two, I'm going to read from the English standard version.
[time=1531] ESV, if you've got your Bible apps, you can get those out with me if you want to follow along or in whatever version you have.
[time=1537] Verse one.
[time=1538] So if there is any encouragement in Christ, by the way, I love how Paul writes.
[time=1543] Because he's kind of got a little bit of what I call the spiritual gift of sarcasm.
[time=1548] I think that got left out of the Bible because I got that gift.
[time=1551] The spiritual, you know anybody that has that gift?
[time=1553] You do know.
[time=1554] Of course there's encouragement in Christ, right?
[time=1558] So here's what he says.
[time=1559] If there's any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the
[time=1565] spirit, any affection and sympathy, I think that is all there.
[time=1570] It's all clear.
[time=1571] Paul has shown us that.
[time=1572] Now verse two.
[time=1573] So what then?
[time=1574] "Complete my joy," he says to the church at Philippi.
[time=1576] "Complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord,
[time=1583] and of one mind." That's where that idea of unity comes from.
[time=1589] But unity never gets birthed from apathy.
[time=1592] Apathy is this.
[time=1593] Apathy is the lack of emotional connection to something.
[time=1597] It's basically saying, you know, I really don't care.
[time=1599] And a lot of times, here's what I found in the church world and in my own life, is when
[time=1605] I'm a contributor to or in the middle of times where this unity is in place, where division is in place within God's church, now that would never happen at Black Hawk.
[time=1615] But it does happen in some churches where people go their own directions.
[time=1619] You know, you've seen that.
[time=1621] I'll tell you, some of my best memories in my whole life came from church.
[time=1625] I remember Sunday school, Miss Judy.
[time=1627] Miss Judy Aubrey.
[time=1628] She was my Sunday school teacher.
[time=1630] And she pulled us together and unified us in that room.
[time=1633] These little bitty kids had the flannel graph.
[time=1636] Anybody ever grew up on the flannel graph?
[time=1638] Okay.
[time=1639] Yeah.
[time=1640] Where you put the little flannel pieces on, this is Mary and this is Joseph.
[time=1643] Yeah.
[time=1644] That was my background.
[time=1645] But what a picture of unity.
[time=1647] Some of my best memories, the song that leads you through the books of the Bible.
[time=1652] I'm not going to sing it, but I know it now because of that song.
[time=1655] Right?
[time=1656] I've already sang "Let It Go" here once, I think.
[time=1657] So I might as well write at this point.
[time=1660] But you know, some of my worst memories came from the church, too.
[time=1665] Because people go there.
[time=1667] I always hear the phrase, "Why don't you go to church?" Well, it's just full of hypocrites.
[time=1673] What I always want to say is, "Come on, one more won't hurt."
[time=1684] But those tough memories, those tough memories that come from the church world, you probably
[time=1693] have them, too.
[time=1694] And you would say, "It was a big stretch for me to be here because I've met a few of those hypocrites." You don't have to amen.
[time=1701] I know you did in your head and your heart already.
[time=1703] As some of our toughest memories, usually they're going to come back to a sense of apathy, of
[time=1709] not caring at all, or about the things that God cares about, or caring too much about the things that I just want to care about my own preferences.
[time=1718] And we start to put those above the preferences and the heart of God.
[time=1723] So humility brings us to a place where unity overcomes apathy.
[time=1727] Apathy is overcome when we care about the right stuff.
[time=1732] Think about that.
[time=1733] Apathy goes away when we're unified and we care collectively about the right things.
[time=1738] I love there's a song that says, "God, break my heart for what breaks yours." I think I let my heart break so many times over things that I want, over the things that
[time=1749] I desire.
[time=1751] And you know, we have a God that cares about the desires of your heart too, by the way, just so you know.
[time=1756] But all of that flows through this concept and this idea that I care about the things that God cares about.
[time=1762] Think about the word apathy.
[time=1764] You know, a lot of times that's really what it boils down to.
[time=1766] I care about the wrong things.
[time=1768] I'm channeling my passion.
[time=1769] I'm channeling my energy in the wrong directions.
[time=1772] The word apathetic.
[time=1774] I want to tell you that if you're apathetic about the things of Jesus today, you're one letter away from pathetic.
[time=1785] That can be a disease.
[time=1786] Apathy can be a disease that creeps into the church when we start caring about the wrong stuff so much that we miss the stuff that Jesus uses to bring us together.
[time=1795] Paul says, "Be of one mind, the same mind, full accord, one mind, same mind.
[time=1800] You hear it over and over, us being together is such an important thing." And that's why I always challenge this.
[time=1806] I always send out emails and I always challenge you from the stage.
[time=1808] And we baptize people, erupt, be proud, be excited at the end of our services when people
[time=1814] come to know Jesus in this place.
[time=1816] By the way, we're blessed because at the end of our services, we see people coming to know Jesus week in and week out.
[time=1822] When that happens, we should rejoice because that's what God cares about.
[time=1828] That's what God's heart is built for, is seeing people come to know His Son.
[time=1833] And if you're here today, I want you to know, we have one agenda for you.
[time=1836] If you don't know Jesus, I'm going to show you what I want you to know.
[time=1838] I want you all my cards before we even get to a time of response for you.
[time=1843] You don't need a time of response.
[time=1844] You can respond right now.
[time=1845] And if God's tugging on your heart, step out, go do some business with Jesus.
[time=1849] Our one agenda is for you to know Him and know Him alone today.
[time=1853] We want you to lay your life down before Him.
[time=1856] And that's the stuff that God cares about and that's why I challenge us.
[time=1860] Let's never get complacent, let's never get tired of, let's never get comfortable with seeing people come to Jesus, seeing people baptize because that is what gets God excited and less rejoice with the angels in heaven.
[time=1873] Here's what I'll tell you about that.
[time=1877] We often try to please ourselves.
[time=1879] We try to please other people.
[time=1880] There's a statement I heard a long time ago in my share with you, be on the screen.
[time=1883] If you please God, it doesn't matter who you displease.
[time=1891] Think on that some this week.
[time=1894] Everybody boils down to pleasing God, caring about the things that the heart of God goes after.
[time=1900] And I'll tell you, you can't pursue a good thing with bad motives and in a bad way and it please God.
[time=1905] We do that.
[time=1906] A lot of times in church, we mask it.
[time=1907] With what I'm coming to church, I'm doing the right stuff.
[time=1911] I look religious and I look spiritual, but you can't do good things, i.e. come to church.
[time=1917] Share the gospel even.
[time=1919] Those kinds of things.
[time=1920] You can't do good things with the wrong heart and God be fully pleased.
[time=1924] You don't fool God.
[time=1925] It's basically what I'm telling you.
[time=1926] Have you ever tried to fool God?
[time=1928] I think I have.
[time=1930] The church smile.
[time=1931] Everybody show me your best church smile.
[time=1932] I think we do it every week, but let's do it again, right?
[time=1936] You know, the knockdown, drag out fight to happen in the car, but as soon as you get out, "Hey brother, everything's perfect.
[time=1942] You're not fooling anybody.
[time=1944] You're probably not fooling the people you're trying to fool, but you're definitely not fooling God." Number two, humility is about to get real.
[time=1953] Humility puts people before preferences.
[time=1960] Look at verses three through eight, it's where we see this idea.
[time=1963] Humility puts people ahead of preferences.
[time=1966] Paul says, "Do nothing from rivalry or conceit." Those two words, really, what they mean is rivalry means, "I can't let you beat me.
[time=1974] I can't let you beat me.
[time=1975] I've got to outdo everybody around me." Humility is if someone beats me, I can't stand them and I hate them, basically.
[time=1984] Do nothing from rivalry or conceit, but in humility, in humility, count others as more
[time=1990] significant than yourselves.
[time=1993] Let each of you look not only to his own interests, preferences, but also to the interests of
[time=2000] others.
[time=2002] I figured it'd be pretty quiet there.
[time=2007] It's hard to do, isn't it?
[time=2009] It gets real to put other people ahead of myself.
[time=2012] Consider them more significant than me.
[time=2013] Does that mean they're more significant than you?
[time=2016] No.
[time=2017] But Jesus says, "If you know me, you will always consider other people as more significant than yourself," because that's what he modeled for us.
[time=2022] That's, go to verse five, "Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to
[time=2033] be grasped," means he didn't pull rank, he put aside what he actually had at his fingertips.
[time=2040] He could have snapped his fingers and all of those opposers of his would have fell dead to the ground, but he put all of that aside.
[time=2047] Why?
[time=2048] Because he thought about you and he thought about me.
[time=2052] But made himself, verse seven, "But made himself nothing," this is the Son of God, but made himself nothing.
[time=2059] Being the form of a servant, that word means bondservant, literally slave, made himself a slave.
[time=2066] Being born in the likeness of men and being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
[time=2079] Humility puts people before preferences.
[time=2082] Jesus left the comfort, the preferences of being in the presence of God and being worshiped by angels to come to this place where those that he came for would spit in his face.
[time=2094] Those that he came for would put him on trial.
[time=2098] What did we repay him for all of that?
[time=2100] Well, we murdered him.
[time=2102] It was your sin and mine that did that, even the way he came.
[time=2107] He didn't come to a throne, he came to a barn.
[time=2110] He's the king of kings and the Lord of lords, the son of the living God, but he came from a throne and landed in a barn.
[time=2118] He came from being worshiped to being hated.
[time=2122] Why?
[time=2123] Why would he come with that in mind?
[time=2124] It's because of you, it's because of me, it's because he modeled for us what it looks like to put other people before our preferences.
[time=2134] You may say, "I've looked at the church world and I don't have anything against how people do parking in different places, but I'll tell you, we won't ever have as long as I'm around, we won't have past or parking at Black Hawk." Just so you know.
[time=2147] Some of you may say, "Well, I was going to offer that until you don't offer it to me, I don't want it." Why?
[time=2153] Because we have to lead the way.
[time=2154] When we know Jesus Christ, we've got to put other people before ourselves.
[time=2160] You can amen that sometimes because it's like, "Yeah, I like that.
[time=2162] Our pastor wants to put other people first, but here's what I'm going to tell you.
[time=2165] If you're a member of this church, a lot of times we even hear the phrase, we live by the phrase membership has its privileges, maybe, but here membership has its partnership.
[time=2177] Membership has a lot of work to be done to get the gospel of Jesus to people that don't yet know him, to help people around you in your circle of influence and in your life find the same Jesus that radically transformed everything about you.
[time=2192] Membership means I'm going to partner, I'm ready to work, I'm going to park far away to leave those parking places open for those people that don't yet know Jesus, too.
[time=2200] I'm going to make sure they're way ahead of me.
[time=2203] I'm going to make sure that I put myself last, that I put their interests ahead of mine, that I treat other people, as Paul says, is more significant than myself.
[time=2213] So that the world can know, so that the world can know who we are, so that the world can see his church for what it truly is.
[time=2220] Here's what I love about Jesus.
[time=2222] Jesus showed us the way, he showed us what it looks like to live in humility.
[time=2228] Verses 5-8 shows us that, I love this verse in Hebrews, Hebrews 4-15, you can drop that down.
[time=2234] Hebrews chapter 4, verse 15, it says for we do not have a high priest, that's Jesus, who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted
[time=2245] as we are yet without sin.
[time=2250] That's pretty impressive to me, that he could be tempted and live in the same world, the same life that I try to lead, but do it all without sin.
[time=2258] It's pretty impressive.
[time=2260] Jesus did that for you and for me, but here's the thing, he never pulled a rake.
[time=2265] He created you.
[time=2267] Your parents ever tell you, "Hey, I brought you into this world, I can take you out of it." I think I've heard that several times.
[time=2273] Jesus could have done that over and over, and if I were Jesus, you better be glad I wasn't Jesus, just so you know.
[time=2280] I would have pulled a rake and said, "That's it.
[time=2281] I did all this for you and you spit it in my face.
[time=2284] I'm going to pull a rake and remind you who I am." But Jesus did remind us and show us who he is by being humble, by coming as that sweet
[time=2293] little baby in a manger and a smelly, nasty barn from a throne to a barn, by coming and
[time=2299] allowing those very people he came to serve, to crucify him, and to kill him and to put
[time=2306] him on trial and to beat him.
[time=2309] He did that because he was modeling what this is supposed to look like.
[time=2312] And here's the thing, a lot of us equate, I think, at times humility with fear.
[time=2317] We think, "To be humble, I've got to be weak.
[time=2319] To be humble, I've got to be fearful." Jesus was, think about this person that we call Jesus.
[time=2324] He was the strongest leader in all of history.
[time=2328] No leader in all of history has ever, nor will ever, changed the course of history like Jesus did.
[time=2335] He tackled whatever he had to tackle to change the course of history.
[time=2338] He was the strongest leader to ever live, but he was also the meekest.
[time=2342] I didn't say weakest, I said meekest of leaders.
[time=2346] He was the most humble leader, the most servant leader of all time, to the point where he
[time=2352] said, "I didn't come to be served but to serve." That's the God that we serve.
[time=2358] So how far do we take this humility thing then?
[time=2360] That's what we talk about.
[time=2361] Well, if I'm going to be humble, how far do I go with this idea?
[time=2364] Well, verse 8 kind of reminds us of that.
[time=2367] Jesus says, "Jesus was obedient and humble to the point of death, even death on a cross."
[time=2375] Jesus died that death for the most annoying person in your life.
[time=2381] Think about that for a minute.
[time=2384] So how far do we take this idea of putting other people first?
[time=2388] And Jesus is saying basically to us that I'm not asking you to submit to other people,
[time=2395] to put their interest above your own, out of reverence for them, but out of reverence for me.
[time=2400] Ephesians 5, 21 says this, "Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
[time=2406] Submit to one another out of reverence for Him." And I get asked a lot in the church world, "Well, why is it, why is it them that we're supposed to put the interests of others ahead of ourselves?
[time=2420] Put my preferences aside.
[time=2421] I've been going to this church all of my life.
[time=2423] Why is it that I should have to put my preferences aside for the sake of all those people who don't know Jesus?" I've asked that before, and here's my answer to that, because I don't expect somebody who doesn't know Jesus to live out of humility and reverence for Him.
[time=2440] But Jesus does look at all of us who know Him, and so I expect you to put other people first to count them as more significant than you, because it's not about you.
[time=2452] You're now a part of the family.
[time=2453] Now it's about making sure other people have that opportunity, and that they see me through what you do, and the only way they do that is if you put yourself aside, you take up your cross every day, daily die to you so that I can live, and as I live in your life,
[time=2467] and through your life, then those people that don't know will see who I am.
[time=2474] That's the church that Jesus came to build, and that's why our preferences have got to go second to people.
[time=2480] A lot of the worst fights, I've seen fights in church conferences over the paint colors before.
[time=2488] You kind of chuckle because you've seen some of those things.
[time=2490] I've seen it that this unity comes from somebody saying, "My preferences matter more than the
[time=2496] people for which Jesus died." I don't want to be in that camp.
[time=2501] Humility doesn't let me be in that camp.
[time=2504] I've got a great illustration of this, I still remember next Sunday, I'll tell you a little more about this in a moment.
[time=2509] We've got a very special guest.
[time=2510] I'll still be here next week, but my pastor, Todd, is going to be here with me next Sunday.
[time=2515] You're going to get to hear from him next week, and you're going to be excited to hear from him.
[time=2519] But his dad passed away a while back, but he always told the story, one of the greatest men of God that I've known, and he did not like the music at our church at all, at all.
[time=2532] He didn't like it, but he came every week, and he sat on the front row just about, every week, not the front row, because the back row is bad, somewhere in the middle, I guess, but he'd sit up toward the front every week, and he didn't like the music.
[time=2545] He would tell the story of how people from his hometown would say, "Do you like that music out there?" "Nah, I hate it." That's what he'd say, and he'd say, "But you know why I go every week," and that's
[time=2558] what they'd say.
[time=2559] "Well, then why you go there?
[time=2560] You know why I go every week?" Because I can listen to my kind of music on my 20-minute ride to church, and on my 20-minute
[time=2568] ride home from church.
[time=2570] But if that music is a part of what I see at that place, because we are seeing people come to Jesus every week, and here's what I see.
[time=2577] Why I do that?
[time=2578] Why I don't care about the music, and I just listen to my music on the road, is because I love seeing people come to know Jesus every week and be saved and baptized every single week I'm there.
[time=2585] So it really doesn't matter what I like.
[time=2588] That was his life song.
[time=2589] He put people over preferences that's hard to do.
[time=2593] If you want to get some church folks mad, mess with the music.
[time=2600] I know how this goes, but here's what I'm going to tell you.
[time=2607] When we truly experience the humility of Jesus, you start to see your preferences, whether it's in music, whether it's in what paint color is on the wall, whether it's in what
[time=2618] we call this thing, or that thing, or this ministry, or that ministry, you see all of those preferences kind of start to drift.
[time=2625] And you say, "You know what?
[time=2627] I want to do what works.
[time=2630] If it's not what I want, it really doesn't matter, because it's not about me." And I know that because that's what Jesus did when he came to this earth for me and died for me.
[time=2641] That'll change how you do church, that'll change how you do life.
[time=2646] And humility leads you to that kind of a place.
[time=2649] And here's the beauty.
[time=2650] Jesus is looking at you and I right now when we talk about preferences, and it's hard.
[time=2654] We don't like talking about preferences.
[time=2656] I like what I like.
[time=2657] And I like building bad.
[time=2658] Again, I like building what's comfortable, what I like around you.
[time=2660] But here's the thing.
[time=2661] Jesus is looking at you in this idea of putting people above preferences, and he's saying, "I'm not asking you to die for them, that's been done.
[time=2671] I'm asking you to tap into the power, the strength, and the example of what's already been done and just show them who I am." And if that means I got to lose my parking spot or somebody sits in your seat, that's
[time=2687] okay.
[time=2688] And just so you know, I'm about to ruffle some feathers.
[time=2691] Some of you've sat in the same seat, and I'm fine with that.
[time=2694] But don't get mad if somebody sits in your seat.
[time=2697] It's not your seat.
[time=2699] This is his place.
[time=2703] Go ahead, yeah, if you're going to celebrate, do it right, do it right.
[time=2710] Number three.
[time=2712] Some of you are looking at your seats right now.
[time=2713] I see what you're doing here.
[time=2715] Like I got to get a plaque for this thing or something.
[time=2719] Number three.
[time=2720] Humility is possible.
[time=2721] Anybody feel like that sounds pretty impossible at this point?
[time=2725] Okay.
[time=2726] Well, it feels impossible to me sometimes.
[time=2729] And here's what I'm going to tell you, humility is possible because of Jesus.
[time=2734] I love the name of Jesus.
[time=2736] I just love saying his name.
[time=2740] And there's a lot of times that we just kind of just don't do that sometimes in our life.
[time=2745] Because the name of Jesus makes people uncomfortable, but really and truly for honest, sometimes we shy away from it because it makes me uncomfortable.
[time=2751] Because if I think about the what would Jesus do phrase or just the name of Jesus alone, it part sees, it tears down walls and it stretches me and leads me to humility.
[time=2764] I love the end here of this passage, verses 9 through 11.
[time=2767] This is where we see that humility is possible because of Jesus.
[time=2771] Look at verse 9.
[time=2773] "Therefore," by the way, if you see the word "therefore" in Scripture, it's "therefore" a reason.
[time=2779] It means what's coming really matters.
[time=2781] It's usually a call to action.
[time=2783] It's usually a call to let's do something with this.
[time=2786] So "therefore" is "therefore" a reason.
[time=2788] "Therefore" God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every
[time=2795] name.
[time=2797] So that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth.
[time=2805] And every tongue confess that Jesus is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[time=2811] I'm sorry, I just can't read that without being a little dramatic because I love the name of Jesus.
[time=2815] It changes everything.
[time=2817] It even gives you what it takes to be the humble person that God has called you to be.
[time=2824] I believe this.
[time=2825] I heard this statement a long time ago that we stand tallest and strongest on our knees.
[time=2832] We stand tallest and strongest on our knees.
[time=2837] Now with that passage, verses 9 through 11, it's important to know that when Paul is writing this he was in Roman captivity awaiting basically the sentence, "What is the Emperor Nero going to do with me?" Now the Emperor Nero had put into place some pretty hefty rules and commands about the
[time=2854] name that was his own, Nero.
[time=2857] So if you were at a sporting event or a political meeting or whatever that might look like during that day and time, you would always, when you heard the name of Nero, you would bow and show your allegiance, show that he's the boss, that he's the Lord basically overall.
[time=2873] That was a very common practice, it was expected if you didn't do that, there were consequences.
[time=2878] So for Paul, does that change the way you read that passage a little bit now knowing that?
[time=2882] Paul is in his prison under his name, the name that really was above every other name in
[time=2888] his day and time, the Emperor Nero, saying that at the name of this other guy named Jesus,
[time=2894] then Nero will bow before him.
[time=2898] That'll change how much you realize that the church is unstoppable, that your own winning team, it lets your humility not look so much like fear, but your humility that leads you to power because when I bow to him, and it's the same name that at which every person's going to bow, every tongue's going to confess as Lord, then my humility then
[time=2917] becomes an empowering part of my life.
[time=2920] The more humble I am, the more I bow before him, the more power I have to be the person
[time=2926] that he's called me to be.
[time=2930] So really the key humility question comes back to this, when will you bow?
[time=2935] It's kind of an offensive question because I'm looking you in the eye and saying you're going to bow.
[time=2941] I'm not saying it, he did.
[time=2944] What we're all going to bow before Jesus one day, and so really the key humility question
[time=2950] is when will you bow, now or later?
[time=2956] The challenge I want to give to you today, if you don't know Jesus, is to get on your knees before him and do it now before it's too late and to not miss what life can look
[time=2968] like from down here on your knees, life looks so different from here than it does up there.
[time=2976] We stand the tallest and the strongest from our knees and that goes against everything the world's going to tell you.
[time=2983] The world says stand tall and puff your chest out and even if you're not confident, be confident.
[time=2988] I'm going to challenge you if you're not confident, I'm really not either because I look in the mirror every day and the same guy looks back at me and everywhere I go, there I am and I'm always my biggest problem, can I get any men?
[time=3001] That same guy is always there and I don't feel very confident.
[time=3004] That's not what I'm saying.
[time=3005] I'm saying in the lack of confidence that you bring to the table, get on your knees and find confidence and strength in the only reason we can truly draw confidence for all of eternity anyway and his name is Jesus.
[time=3017] And Jesus looks best, the world looks better from this stance than anywhere else.
[time=3022] That's really the key question of humility.
[time=3024] Will you bow now or will you bow later?
[time=3027] What I love about this passage is that not only is humility exemplified by Jesus, it's also enabled by Jesus.
[time=3035] A lot of times we like to talk about what Jesus said without actually doing what Jesus did.
[time=3042] Think about that.
[time=3043] Well, Jesus was humility, yes.
[time=3045] He exemplified it.
[time=3046] He was a picture of it.
[time=3047] I see a humble person when I see Jesus, but Jesus is saying I didn't just exemplify humility so that you could, ooh, and awe over it.
[time=3055] I exemplified humility so that you could be enabled to go be humble, so that you could go and be a picture of me in the lives of those I put in your path.
[time=3065] Romans 5.8 tells us that God demonstrated His love for us and this is that while we were yet sinners, He died for us.
[time=3074] It's that name.
[time=3075] It's that humble God.
[time=3076] That's one of the reasons I know the Bible is true.
[time=3078] A God shouldn't be humble.
[time=3080] If I were the creator of the universe, I wouldn't be very humble, most likely.
[time=3086] That's why you should be glad I'm not God.
[time=3089] But we serve a humble God.
[time=3096] Because of that, I trust Him.
[time=3099] Because of His humility, I want to follow Him with all that I've got.
[time=3103] I don't have anything to offer Him, yet He gave me everything that He had.
[time=3108] I trust Him.
[time=3110] He's my God.
[time=3111] He's my Creator.
[time=3113] He's my Savior.
[time=3114] He's my Lord.
[time=3115] He's my boss.
[time=3116] And you may say, "Well, that sounds like a weak position.
[time=3118] It's the strongest place I could ever be in in my life." Is Him being Lord over it.
[time=3126] And today, a lot of you bring a lot of worries to the table.
[time=3131] Maybe you're consumed with politics.
[time=3132] You've never heard anything about politics on the news lately.
[time=3138] Maybe that's consuming your life.
[time=3141] Maybe that job that you wish you had is consuming your life.
[time=3144] Or that relationship that's falling apart is consuming your life.
[time=3148] Or maybe that tension that you just can't seem to get rid of with some of the most important
[time=3154] people in your life is consuming you.
[time=3157] And you drug it in here like a ball and chain.
[time=3160] You just drug it in.
[time=3161] Nobody can see it because you had your church smile on.
[time=3164] But you drug in that ball and chain and it's consuming you today.
[time=3167] My encouragement to you is this.
[time=3170] Here's what can Black Hawk offer me.
[time=3171] Some of you came saying, "What can I get out of today?" What can I get out of today?
[time=3176] Well, here's what you can get out of today.
[time=3178] The name at which every single person's knees will bow.
[time=3183] The name that every tongue is going to confess didn't just ask you to be humble.
[time=3189] He was humble on your behalf.
[time=3191] That powerful name that's above any political power, that's above the Emperor Nero, that's above any office this world could ever bring to the table.
[time=3200] No authority compares to the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords, yet he looks at you and says, "I humbled myself to the point of death." Yes, even death on the cross because I love you.
[time=3214] You were the point of that whole story.
[time=3218] I'm going to ask you just to close your eyes for a minute and think about that thought, that you were the point of that whole story.
[time=3226] You were the point of the humility of Jesus.
[time=3230] That same Jesus that we read about is the same Jesus that died for you.
[time=3235] Here's what I want to tell you.
[time=3237] The last thing that all this ties together, I want you just to close your eyes and think about this for a moment.
[time=3242] This is the thought.
[time=3243] The challenge of humility is bow now.
[time=3248] That's my challenge to you today.
[time=3250] The challenge of humility is bow now.
[time=3255] If you know Jesus today, I want to ask you what steps do you need to take right now in order to just simply bow now, bow before him?
[time=3264] How do you need to humble yourself this week?
[time=3266] What phone call do you need to make?
[time=3268] What person do you need to tell about Jesus?
[time=3272] What do you need to lay at the feet of Jesus today?
[time=3274] I don't know what all that means for you, but you do.
[time=3277] I challenge you to take that step.
[time=3278] I also want to talk to those of you who would say, "My bow now step for the week is really to bow for the first time." It's really to say, "Jesus, I do need you to save me, and I just haven't counted you as Lord and Master of my life, but I'm here today because I think that's my day."
[time=3296] In your head right now is a swirling storm of questions and uncertainties.
[time=3302] You say, "Well, I can't do it today because I've got the sin in my life, because I've got this in my life, because I've got this confusion, this complication." He already knows about the skeletons in your closet and every complication.
[time=3313] He knew it when you came in, and a lot of times we try to clean up so that we can accept Jesus.
[time=3318] It doesn't work that way.
[time=3319] We don't even have the capacity to begin to clean up until Jesus is in the picture, so I would tell you, "Jump off that ledge and bow now before him." What does salvation look like?
[time=3328] It's to simply acknowledge that you need Jesus to be saved.
[time=3332] You're not good enough to save you, but that Jesus is.
[time=3335] He did that by dying on the cross for your sins and mine after living that sinless life that you couldn't live and I couldn't live, and after three days he rose and he's alive.
[time=3349] In the Word of God promises that if you acknowledge that in your life, if you believe, it doesn't
[time=3356] just mean know it in your head, but believe it in your heart.
[time=3358] That means laying your life down before him in a form of trust that not you might be saved
[time=3364] if God's in a good mood, know that you shall be saved.
[time=3370] Today is that day for some of you in this room.
[time=3371] I'm not going to give you a moment.
[time=3372] I'm not going to lead you in a prayer because I believe your heart is already screaming it.
[time=3375] You can't get the words wrong because it's your heart anyway, so just scream out to him.
[time=3379] It can be silent.
[time=3380] He knows the thoughts of your heart.
[time=3381] Will you take a minute if you don't know Jesus if today is that day of salvation, to humble yourself, bow now and say, "Jesus, I give you me." Will you do that right now?
[time=3394] Thanks so much for tuning in today.
[time=3395] I pray that as we've looked at what salvation truly is all about, as we have looked at what it means to surrender to Jesus, that maybe God's done something in your heart.
[time=3405] And if that's you and you're watching today and God's just stirring and something's different today, I want to speak to you.
[time=3410] I know sometimes the things that goes through our mind is it really can't be that simple.
[time=3415] Or if I get things cleaned up in my life first, then I'll take that step, that leap of faith that it is to follow Jesus or give my life to him.
[time=3422] I want to challenge you, don't wait, don't wait any longer.
[time=3426] There's no day like today, and God loves you right where you are.
[time=3429] His grace is sufficient for you.
[time=3432] And the gospel really is as simple as we've talked about today.
[time=3435] I've given you the challenge to bow now.
[time=3438] One of these days, all of us are going to bow before Jesus.
[time=3442] One of these days, every knee's going to bow, every tongue's going to confess, and my challenge you would be to take that bow right now.
[time=3449] And you can do that.
[time=3450] Jesus, do whatever you've got to do to step aside and just say, "Jesus, I truly believe what I've heard from your gospel today.
[time=3456] Jesus, I want to give you all of me." So far in life, it's really been mine.
[time=3461] It's been all about me, but today is my day of salvation.
[time=3465] I want to give you my life, surrender to you.
[time=3466] I believe you died for me.
[time=3468] I believe that you're alive.
[time=3470] And that really is what salvation is all about.
[time=3473] It really is that simple, and I challenge you to take that step.
[time=3475] And if you have, or if you're contemplating that, we're going to put some information on the screen for you to connect with us, email addresses, phone numbers, so you can stay in touch with us.
[time=3483] But here's one of the things we want to do.
[time=3484] We want to get this booklet into your hands.
[time=3487] If you've taken that step, even if you're just thinking about it, it's called beginning steps.
[time=3491] It's a growth guide for you believers, and all it's really going to do is show you what's next.
[time=3495] Because when you give your life to Jesus, it's not an end point, it's a beginning point.
[time=3500] It's an on-ramp into a new life that only Jesus can give to you.
[time=3503] We want to help you discover what that life's all about.
[time=3506] So we want to get one of these books in your hands.
[time=3508] We'd love to give it to you in person.
[time=3509] If you want to stop by our services every Sunday, we have service at 10.30 a.m.
[time=3513] And then we've got group opportunities so you can connect with other people at 9 a.m.
[time=3517] Every Sunday morning.
[time=3518] So we'd love to put one in your hands in person, but we'll also mail one to you.
[time=3521] So let us know how you've given your life to Jesus, what that's looked like in your life, how we can serve you.
[time=3527] And we promise we'll do our best to connect with you and walk with you every single day.
[time=3531] Because we've looked at this challenge, this thought of humility, that Jesus humbled himself
[time=3537] to the point the Bible tells us of being a slave.
[time=3540] And why would he do such a thing, a God that's humble, what a concept.
[time=3543] He did that because he had you in mind, he had me in mind.
[time=3546] And so we at Black Hawk Ministries want to explore that truth together and really live that out in an inside-out kind of way, all around Fort Wayne, all around the world.
[time=3556] And so no matter where you're at in your life, please allow us just to connect with you and know that we care about you right where you're at.
[time=3563] Connect with us how you can and we'll see you soon.
[time=3564] Thank you.
[time=3565] God bless.
