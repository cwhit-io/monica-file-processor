[time=0] You
[time=30] [MUSIC - 60 seconds]
[time=115] As part of our Inside Out series, we've been looking at groups in Fort Wayne doing the work of Jesus, groups that we can come along and partner with and this week, after looking at Safe Families for Children for the last couple of weeks, we're looking at City Life. Will you please welcome Chip Clark, the ministry's director of City Life here in Fort Wayne.
[time=133] [APPLAUSE]
[time=136] Right, he's good to be here.
[time=138] Chip, great to have you. City Life started about ten years ago in Fort Wayne and the economic downturn, just after that, hit hard.
[time=147] And at that time, Chip was working for youth for Christ at Black Hawk and Lane but is a native of the inner city of Fort Wayne and so you felt the call to go back.
[time=157] Tell me what that was like right at the beginning of City Life.
[time=162] Your time there, it was a broken picture when you got there.
[time=167] Certainly. One of the things we believe in is indigenous leadership, which means live here, lead here. So when the opportunity came, it was one that I jumped at immediately because it's the community that grew me up but stepping into the gym, I was met with what I would call
[time=184] about 20 thugs that I didn't know if I jumped on the basketball court if they were going to shoot a brother if I followed him or what.
[time=191] [Laughter] But we had a good time and I just began to build relationship with those guys and still know a lot of them to this day.
[time=198] And from that time, it has really grown.
[time=200] Today, every day, you guys serve about 125 kids.
[time=206] Tell us about the ministry you've got going now.
[time=208] Certainly. So from those 20 young men, we just begin to set standards as I got to know them and everything from profanity to education and things of that nature, what we wanted the culture to look like at the City Life Center.
[time=221] And now 125 kids, grace are a facility each and every day.
[time=226] And it's a beautiful thing to watch because when they come in, not only are they greeted to be in a safe environment, they also get to experience the love of God.
[time=235] Each and every loving adult that we have in the building, we feed them and we don't just give them a plate and say, "Hey, go eat." We sit around the table, we have conversation.
[time=246] We ask, "I believe the life-changing question of how was your day?" That food is a big part of the ministry.
[time=252] What's the saying you guys have?
[time=254] Yeah, so before we eat, we always pray like every good Christian should do.
[time=259] And then we say, "In my family," and then the response is, "We all eat."
[time=267] So it's pretty fun.
[time=269] But it's so much more than food.
[time=271] You mentioned indigenous leadership, this is what you're trying to do.
[time=274] You're trying to invest three big core beliefs back into these kids and grow up leaders to lead in the community that they're from.
[time=282] Yeah, a lot of times when we look at the urban communities, we look with eyes of deficit, crime.
[time=290] We look at homicides, we look at teenage pregnancy, we look at education, and those things are very real things, and I don't say we disregard them.
[time=302] But at City Life, we try to look with the eyes of assets.
[time=305] I believe that there's an asset there.
[time=308] It's much like Nehemiah coming to the city and seeing the wall torn down, but there was still a wall, right?
[time=316] And because there was still a wall, they were able to build up on that.
[time=319] And when we see these kids and the things that they've gone through, very real story, but I still see a leader.
[time=325] I still see someone that is worth investing in, and because we see what the future could look like for them because of the hope that resides in all of us.
[time=335] And so we go after that.
[time=337] And so we see the decency, stability, family.
[time=340] These are the core beliefs of what you guys try to invest in these kids every day.
[time=344] And it's working.
[time=345] You, just this morning, had a story from Facebook, where you got to feel the power of changing someone's life.
[time=353] Share that with us.
[time=354] We don't always get to see the outcome of the things that we get to do.
[time=358] But this morning, this past week, given the privilege of serving with 28 other youth leaders across Indiana.
[time=368] And so they put a Facebook post out about it and just celebrating.
[time=373] And a lot of my friends shared it and a lot of co-workers and people shared it.
[time=378] But this morning, I woke up to about five different kids who shared it.
[time=382] And one particular kid, he shares it and he says, Chip Clark, you raised us and then he put FR FR.
[time=393] And if you don't know what that means, it means for real, for real.
[time=397] And by the way, we don't know what that means.
[time=400] Okay.
[time=401] Yeah.
[time=402] Most of the students know what I'm talking about.
[time=405] So FR, for real, for real.
[time=407] So I got to know the lingo.
[time=409] Yeah.
[time=410] Good.
[time=411] Thanks for sharing it with us.
[time=412] Yeah.
[time=413] But I responded to it.
[time=416] And I was like, man, y'all about to make a brother cry, you know?
[time=420] And he says, Chip, you don't understand.
[time=425] You're the reason why I got my first job.
[time=429] You're the reason why I wouldn't act up in school.
[time=434] You would literally come to his class and say, Nick, sit down.
[time=440] So it is a blessing to see him continue on.
[time=443] And it's a blessing to get to do what we do.
[time=445] It's great to hear it.
[time=446] We got to thank Chip for his work.
[time=448] Thanks, Chip.
[time=470] [MUSIC]
[time=500] Thanks so much for watching today.
[time=515] You're in for a treat today as we've got a special guest that I'm going to be sharing about.
[time=520] But before I do, I want to tell you, if you're catching us today, we've recently changed stations.
[time=525] We're now on my TV, channel 21.3, 9 a.m. on Sundays.
[time=529] And so we've changed from where we were in the past.
[time=531] And so if you're friends and those that you know of that have watched us, please share the word and let people know where they can find us on my TV, channel 21.3, every Sunday at 9 o'clock.
[time=541] Thank you so much for being a part of this with us today.
[time=543] I'm really excited because I've got a very special guest, someone that actually has had quite an impact in my life, my former pastor, my current pastor in many ways.
[time=553] Todd Wright is going to be preaching the sermon today as a part of our Inside Out series and Focus.
[time=558] You're going to be blessed by what he's going to share with you.
[time=560] Todd has been the lead pastor at Midway Church in Villa Rica, Georgia for over 20 years and has led that congregation to grow from just 200 people to over 2,000 people.
[time=570] God has just really blessed his ministry and he's going to be sharing today about relationships.
[time=575] The title and the focus today is that church is all about relationships.
[time=580] Now I'm guessing you've got some relationships and I'm guessing that some of them could probably use a little bit of work if you're like me.
[time=587] And so he's going to be sharing about some relational behaviors that are destructive, relational behaviors that will help you be the church, that will help you be the person, the part of the church that Jesus had in mind.
[time=600] So Inside Out again our focus for these weeks is that we tend to build around what's comfortable, we tend to protect what's comfortable, but God has called us to build inwardly as he builds his church so that we can outwardly make the impact in the world around us that he has in mind.
[time=615] Maybe the best venue for that in the whole world is your relationships.
[time=620] Think about that for a minute.
[time=621] What relationships could you use to pour into and see God make a difference in so that you could be Jesus in the lives of those people around you.
[time=630] And so that's what we're going to be looking at today.
[time=632] You're in for a treat and I want to remind you there are a lot of ways you can connect with us.
[time=635] So many events are happening right now at Black Hawk Ministries and so one of the best ways you can connect with us is first of all our website, BlackhawkMinistries.org.
[time=643] You can connect with us on social media at @bhawkMinistries for Instagram and Twitter or you can search for Black Hawk Ministries or the Bible Hour on Facebook.
[time=653] So lots of ways you can connect there.
[time=655] And one of my favorite ways you can connect with us is our Black Hawk Church app.
[time=659] You can just go to your app store and search for Black Hawk Church.
[time=662] And when you do that you'll find our app and when you do you're going to find a lot of ways to stay connected with our events.
[time=667] You're going to find sermon notes there.
[time=669] You're going to find pass messages there.
[time=671] You're going to find ways to put in prayer requests.
[time=673] Let us know how we can pray for you.
[time=675] So lots of ways that you can stay connected.
[time=677] So thanks again for watching today.
[time=679] I know you're in for a treat.
[time=680] My prayer for you today is that you just open your heart to all Jesus has for you because I promise you you will not be disappointed.
[time=688] He's got something for you today.
[time=689] Thanks again.
[time=694] I've been wanting to come up here and check you folks out because you came down south and stole Kevin and took him off up north.
[time=705] But very deeply grateful for what God is doing for great things about you and how you have loved and embraced Kevin and Jessica and their family and what God is doing.
[time=718] And it was really my joy.
[time=721] I was a great benefactor in Kevin coming and serving alongside me in a variety of roles.
[time=729] And whatever role he served in he always served with faithfulness and diligence and productivity and humility and boldness and confidence and pureness of heart.
[time=741] All those things that many of us would be thrilled to just be able to grab one or two of.
[time=746] He seemed to have a whole lot of them.
[time=749] And I know you're greatly blessed and just to have him as your pastor and I pray God's hand and God's blessing over the years ahead together as you serve here in this area.
[time=762] And just he's just an extension of my family and our heart.
[time=766] And so thank you very much.
[time=768] And I'm glad to be here.
[time=770] Last time I was up this way at all was several years ago.
[time=774] I used to be a part of my life.
[time=777] I have different segments of life.
[time=779] And one of the segments of my life is I was a professional coon hunter for a period of time.
[time=784] And so I found my way up to the corn fields of the Midwest many years ago and hunted several big hunts up here.
[time=791] And for those of you who aren't familiar with that type world it's not that big of a deal but for those of you who are we can talk after church, all right.
[time=799] But I'm glad to be back.
[time=801] And I really want to share with you.
[time=803] I was excited when Kevin shared me a little about the series that you're talking about inside out.
[time=807] I love the church.
[time=811] I have a deep passion and love for the body of Christ.
[time=815] It's been my great privilege to travel the world over the last several years in numerous countries.
[time=821] In any country I go to and I find people to serve alongside as part of the body of Christ.
[time=827] I find there are so many similarities in the church.
[time=830] And no matter what race you are, what language you speak, what denomination it may be.
[time=835] When I find a group of people who have a passion for Jesus who no Christ is Lord and Savior, you just put it right there.
[time=842] I'm with you.
[time=843] We may differ on some details but there's been one great commission given by one Savior.
[time=851] And that's the very essence as to why we exist.
[time=854] And so this series inside out
[time=860] is an understanding, as best I can grab what you guys have been studying, is an understanding that too often the church has turned inward.
[time=872] Therefore across the world today, while one-third of the world's population professes to be followers of Jesus Christ, it is a clear understanding that among that one-third there's an indicative of problem.
[time=887] And that problem is that so often in every culture, every nation, on every continent the church exists, too often the church has turned inward rather than remaining outward.
[time=900] And so the goal of this series at Black Hawk, as I understand it, is to turn the church inside out, to turn this church inside out, to take what we have on the inside that we so treasure and hold in high steam and greatly value and make sure we're getting into the hearts and homes of the people of this region out around the world.
[time=920] So we're in Philippians chapter 2 this morning, and I'm going to begin in a few minutes in verse 12, and we're actually studying through the end of the chapter, and Kevin has done it to me.
[time=931] This time, like he's done several times, he's packed about a full series of sermons in this one passage here.
[time=939] One of the great challenges in Kevin's early years at Midway, I would allow him to preach, and he'd say, "So what do you think about that?" We always have to have critique time.
[time=946] I have critique time every Tuesday morning with my staff, and they critique my sermons, and I want to make sure I'm always communicating better, and so Kevin, if he would ask me, I'd say, "What do you think of that sermon?" I said, "You mean that series of sermons you just preached in 30 minutes?
[time=960] It's just packed full. My mind couldn't hold anymore." And so I have from verse 12 through verse 30, I'll do my very best to highlight a few key points in this message this morning.
[time=971] But here's what I know about the church.
[time=973] When the church works well, there is nothing more beautiful.
[time=980] But when the church does not work well, there's nothing more ugly.
[time=987] When the church works well, there's nothing that adds more value that creates more help and hope into the lives of people, but when the church does not work well, there's nothing that's more damaging access to a community.
[time=1005] And it rests upon you and me to make sure that our church works well.
[time=1013] In this particular passage, Philippians chapter 2 beginning in verse 12, I believe the apostle Paul highlights some principles that reminds us
[time=1023] that whether a church works well or whether it does not work well, usually we can trace the problems back to some key relationships in our life.
[time=1034] And I believe there's three relational insights
[time=1040] that he highlights here for a healthy church.
[time=1045] First thing I want to notice here is the circle of relationships, the circle of relationships.
[time=1053] He says in verse 13, I'm going to sort of skip around, but I'll cover most all these verses.
[time=1057] But in verse 13, it says, "For it is God who is working in you, enabling you both to will and to act for his good pleasure." Everything about our life and ministry, every foundation, the very essence is why we exist as a relationship with God.
[time=1078] God sent Jesus to the world, so we could have a relationship with him.
[time=1082] When Jesus was asked the question in Matthew by a group who was standing there, they said, "Which is the greatest commandment of all?" They're waiting on, "Is it going to be murder?
[time=1092] Is it going to be stealing? Is it going to be adultery?
[time=1095] What exactly is it going to be?" He said that you love the Lord, your God, with all of your heart, with all of your soul, with all your mind, with all of your strength.
[time=1102] He reached way back into Hebrew history to Deuteronomy chapter 6 and verse 5, a childhood verse that virtually every Hebrew child had memorized up under that point.
[time=1112] All of them were very familiar with it, called the Great Shema, and they were very familiar with this concept, and he just reminded them that everything and every reason they exist is all centered around having a right relationship with their Creator.
[time=1127] And it would do us very well to remember, constantly, and remind ourselves consistently, that we have to constantly nourish and nurture that relationship with God, and understand that everything that's of any word flows out of that relationship.
[time=1140] For it is God who is working in you, who enables you both to will and to act for His good pleasure.
[time=1148] That's the foundation of all of our relationships, whether good or bad.
[time=1152] And if that one goes awry, you can expect some of the others to go awry also.
[time=1158] Number two, not only does he focus on our relationship with God as a part of that circle, but also our relationship with each other.
[time=1167] For in verse 14, I love the way he sort of lays this out there in Philippians 2, verse 14.
[time=1172] After talking about God working in your life, then he just simply makes a statement, "Do everything without grumbling and arguing." So what does that mean in the Greek?
[time=1181] It means do everything without grumbling and arguing.
[time=1186] It doesn't require rocket science.
[time=1189] It's much easier said perhaps than it is lived, but do everything without grumbling, complaining and arguing.
[time=1201] So following our relationship with God, we oftentimes as followers of Christ, we even can develop the mindset, "Well, I get along with God pretty well, but it's people I struggle with."
[time=1215] The Bible even addresses that if you can't love men who you have seen, how can you expect to love God whom you haven't seen?
[time=1227] We sometimes want to separate the two, and we think it's okay to have a right relationship with God and gather in buildings like this with our Bibles open and go to Bible study or small groups and serve and sing, but have neighbors we don't talk to, have family members we haven't met with or talked to in a long time, and we've got bitterness and resentment or someone on the job.
[time=1247] We can't stand it when they walk in the room or a close relative or someone who used to be our best friend that literally we despise and are angry and bitter at, and the Bible says you can't separate those two.
[time=1258] It's a circle, and you've got to make sure you are maintaining a right relationship with God and a right relationship with people and each other, especially in the body of Christ.
[time=1271] Church life is one of the places where seemingly we struggle the most sometimes in relationship.
[time=1276] My goodness, I've grown up in the church, my whole life has been in the church.
[time=1279] My grandfather was a pastor, my dad was a deacon, my grandmother played the piano, my mom taught Sunday school my entire life from birth, even at this very moment.
[time=1288] There's never been a week that I wasn't connected to a church somewhere.
[time=1291] We live next door to the church, we walk the church every day of my childhood with my father.
[time=1298] And yet, oftentimes tell people, "My worst experiences in life all happen to church."
[time=1313] I can on the other hand say that my best experiences in life happen to church.
[time=1320] We had a little country church, sometimes struggle, but we had great spurts of growth and movements of God from time to time.
[time=1328] We watched it when I was a child grow from about 40 in attendance, a little wood frame building.
[time=1335] My great grandfather helped build the original church, and they had floated the logs down the Talapusa River and set up a makeshift sawmill and made the lumber.
[time=1343] And I remember the old hardwood floors and the old hard pews.
[time=1346] I still have one of the old pews in my home today because they built a new building in 1977.
[time=1352] And I watched that church just come alive and explode.
[time=1355] My wife didn't grow up in church, but she gave her life to Jesus at vacation Bible school at our church down the road.
[time=1361] And I just remember as scores of people and people I went to school with would give their life to Jesus, and there was a real revival, and there was great things taking place at our little church.
[time=1371] Well, country church down the road.
[time=1375] And then something happened.
[time=1376] I was 12 years of age.
[time=1378] I could not tell you what the issue was, but I heard the rumblings.
[time=1383] I heard the arguing. I heard the complaining.
[time=1385] As a matter of fact, we had one of those, what was that called?
[time=1388] Special call business meetings.
[time=1390] You ever been to one of those?
[time=1393] You know, that's when the wise people stay home often times.
[time=1399] You know, special call business meeting because we walked the church.
[time=1405] My dog walked the church with us.
[time=1408] He's more faithful than a lot of deacons.
[time=1413] He would lay out on the front porch of the church until we got finished with church and then he'd walk back home with us.
[time=1418] We got this dog when I was one year of age, and he died when I was 18.
[time=1424] So literally, he was part of the family.
[time=1427] The name was Banger.
[time=1429] It was spelled B-A-N-J-O.
[time=1433] But we were in the south.
[time=1437] And his name was Banger.
[time=1442] So that's Sunday.
[time=1446] Just as usual, Banger followed us to church.
[time=1448] And we had this special call business meeting followed in the church service.
[time=1452] And right in the middle of this church service, one person would stand up and I could tell
[time=1458] tempers were flaring and again have no idea what the issue was.
[time=1461] But I remember the difficulty and I could feel the tension in the room.
[time=1464] And people who had known each other all their lives.
[time=1466] Many of them relatives, many of them neighbors who served together.
[time=1469] All of a sudden we're arguing with each other openly in the church across from one aisle to the other.
[time=1475] About that time Banger made his way in the door.
[time=1481] The doors were open.
[time=1482] He made his way in the door.
[time=1484] And he by this time, he couldn't stay out of the highway.
[time=1487] By this time he only had three legs.
[time=1489] True, okay.
[time=1491] So Banger comes hobbling in the door and he's hopping down the aisle.
[time=1495] He stood about halfway back in the middle of the church service.
[time=1499] And he's just standing there looking from one side to the other.
[time=1502] People were standing up and arguing, debating inside the church.
[time=1507] And about that time one sweet lady stands to ask a question and the poor pastor had very poor timing.
[time=1515] She stood and just as she started to say something, the pastor pointed back that direction and said,
[time=1522] "Would somebody please get that dog out of the church?" Most of the church didn't know Banger was in the church.
[time=1531] And so I'll never forget one person standing up on the other side and said, "Don't you call her a dog?" The pastor was very quick.
[time=1541] He said, "I wouldn't refer him to her.
[time=1542] I wouldn't refer him to her.
[time=1543] He's the dog in the church." That's how bad church life can get.
[time=1549] I wonder what God's thinking when things like that take place.
[time=1554] No direct connection to why Jesus died.
[time=1558] I assure you, and by the way, the church, that church I grew up in, I was ordained in.
[time=1563] My grandfather many years ago had been a pastor in.
[time=1566] Our family sacrificed to help build the buildings and to lead people to Jesus and carry on bus ministry and teach Sunday school all those things.
[time=1573] Today has about 35 people attending in a worship building that has about 450 seats available.
[time=1583] That's not a rare story.
[time=1585] It can be multiplied over and over and over again.
[time=1588] And all I'm reminding you here at Black Hawk Ministry as this church grows, as this church continues to expand and reach this community and make a difference in the world God has placed you in to make that I just want you to understand, you're going to have to work diligently to maintain those right relationships, both with God and with one another.
[time=1607] And it won't be automatic.
[time=1609] It will not be natural.
[time=1611] It won't be easy.
[time=1612] It's something you will have to work at consistently in your personal journey.
[time=1616] That's why the Apostle Paul says, you bear with one another.
[time=1619] You be kind to one another.
[time=1621] You pray for one another.
[time=1623] You encourage one another.
[time=1624] Love one another.
[time=1625] Be patient with one another.
[time=1627] Our relationship with God.
[time=1630] Our relationship with each other.
[time=1632] The third part of this relational circle is our relationship with unbelievers.
[time=1639] It's one of the great problems among those who say they have a great relationship
[time=1650] with God and each other.
[time=1651] Sometimes they struggle then to build relationship with unbelievers.
[time=1657] No matter fact, there are some churches who have the mindset.
[time=1659] We have a sweet little fellowship.
[time=1664] We have such a spirit of unity and oneness and we just love to get together and pray together and hold hands and sing and sing kumbaya and just love.
[time=1675] We just have a sweet fellowship over and over and over and over and over and over
[time=1681] and over again.
[time=1682] Reminds me of Peter there on the mountain with Jesus.
[time=1685] Let's just build some tabernacles and stay up here on this mountain.
[time=1688] But God has sent us out into this world.
[time=1693] This church does not exist unto itself.
[time=1700] This is not a holy huddle.
[time=1701] This is not a gathering, a safe place, a safe place where we and our children
[time=1708] don't have to rub shoulders with unbelievers and people who say bad words or people who do bad things or people who smell bad or people who have bad habits or people who don't dress the way we like to dress or do what we like to do.
[time=1722] This is a place we have to decide is our church going to be a hotel for saints or a hospital for sinners.
[time=1732] It's the next great dilemma that every church has to decide.
[time=1735] And many of them love God they'll say and they have a right relationship with God and they'll pray long prayer meetings and they'll sing great worship songs hands raised and they'll have a great time together, fellowship them together.
[time=1746] They'll open up their Bibles and they can dissect the scripture and they love one another and they encourage one another and they are patient with one another.
[time=1753] They just never tell a single person or build a single bridge into anybody's life who's really in desperate need of a Savior.
[time=1762] And Jesus didn't die so we could become isolated from the world.
[time=1766] He died so we could be powerful in that world and share the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=1771] We know that and the Apostle Paul reminds us of this in Philippians chapter 2 here when he says you need to understand that you've got to not argue and don't be grumbling so that you may be blameless and pure children of God who are faultless in a crooked and perverted generation among whom you shine like stars in the world.
[time=1796] You know the song? This little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine.
[time=1810] This little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine.
[time=1816] Let it shine under a bushel, hide it in the saints you wear it from the world out there.
[time=1828] You see in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 20 the Bible tells us that we are ambassadors into this world.
[time=1840] The ambassadors are not supposed to always be huddling together.
[time=1845] Ambassadors around the world are building relationships and building bridges
[time=1851] from one country and government to another.
[time=1857] It isn't about the ambassadors all from the same country sitting in the same building the same place.
[time=1863] Now they're sent to these foreign lands to go and build bridges of partnership
[time=1870] and relationship and for us we are ambassadors for Jesus Christ here to share
[time=1876] the gospel of Christ to a world in desperate need.
[time=1883] Matthew 5, 14 you are the light of the world.
[time=1890] A few years ago I went through a process having grown up in church and being a
[time=1897] pastor now these several years I had to go back and evaluate several things
[time=1904] about my own mindset.
[time=1906] It was about 2003 through 2005 God took me through a process of realizing as I
[time=1916] read the gospels that I actually closer identified with the Pharisees than I did
[time=1925] with Jesus.
[time=1930] It was a humbling process.
[time=1937] That issue after issue attitude after attitude I began to realize that I was
[time=1945] actually a Pharisee.
[time=1946] I was one of the guys that Jesus in our day and time would have been
[time=1953] scolding.
[time=1958] And so I present this challenge as a follower of Jesus Christ when you read
[time=1965] the gospels and you look at your attitudes you look at your response to sinners you look at your ways of dealing with people who struggle through the issues of life and you look at your value what you prize what you say is
[time=1981] important to you does your spiritual journey more identify with that of the
[time=1987] Pharisees or the very heartbeat of Jesus Christ.
[time=1991] I think it's a question the entire body of Christ has to constantly ask itself religion doesn't matter the denomination doesn't matter if you're independent doesn't matter which translation the Bible whatever those
[time=2005] little details may be religion has a tendency to take over the human heart
[time=2014] and stamp out the real heart of mercy and love and grace that God wants to
[time=2020] share with the world in which you and I have.
[time=2028] And you have to monitor that for you you have to overcome that for you you
[time=2035] can't no one else can fix that for you.
[time=2040] Those are the three pieces of that circle of relationship our relationship with God our relationship with unbelievers our relationship with each other.
[time=2051] Number two we talk to you second about the ideal models of relationship we
[time=2057] talk about in this story beginning in verse 19 he said.
[time=2061] Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send it Timothy actually there's two individuals who are mentioned here as examples of great relationship.
[time=2070] He said I hope to send.
[time=2073] Timothy to you soon that also I may be encouraged when I hear news about you
[time=2079] and then he begins to describe Timothy for I have no one else like minded who really care about your interest all seek their own interest not those of Jesus Christ but you know his personal character you know how he's served me in the gospel minister like a son to a father and therefore I hope to send to you as soon as possible.
[time=2098] Timothy we all know the relationship if you've been around a red the Bible you know there's been a unique relationship between Timothy and the Apostle Paul.
[time=2106] There are people who come in our life like me in Kevin's life or Kevin in my life there are people in my life throughout my lifetime who've come into my life there are others who will still come into my lifetime and those are people who stand with us over long extended periods of time my goodness I so value and treasures and people who've invested in me who've been patiently there's a man named Bob came in my life when I was in my twenties.
[time=2132] Bob was a leader in the church where I was a young pastor I was 23 years old way over my head we too had a large private Christian school we had a growing church but we had lots of difficulties and problems and I had others who sometimes were a little bit difficult because they had previous experiences and they just didn't like pastors because the last couple they had they had problems with and so even though I'm new they didn't like me either before I even had a chance and I know none of you ever been like that but sometimes we do get like that don't we.
[time=2161] We put other people in the place of someone we've had a bad experience with.
[time=2165] I didn't know who to turn to and one day a man named Bob who was about twice my age
[time=2171] he took me to lunch and when I got finished with this
[time=2177] conversation with Bob there were some significant issues we were addressing and dealing with when I got finished with this conversation and left I thought I liked that man and secondly I thought I think he just chewed me out but I liked it he helped fix me it was a gift it was a treasure that I value to this day to this day Bob is still a mentor in my life he's in his 70s Bob still to this day
[time=2220] calls me his pastor how's my pastor doing I'm no longer his pastor I've moved we live over an hour away but still to this day you'll call just call to check on my pastor how's my pastor doing been praying for my pastor
[time=2240] over and over again I would have those conversations Bob and Bob would invest in me and when we would get finished not one time that I feel like he was belittling me he was disrespectful he was always adding value to me here's the fact Bob wanted me to succeed as much as I wanted me to succeed not one sense of him warning over me just a partner in ministry and to this day I so value that partnership don't you treasure people like that I had another man in the same church almost the same age he was also a leader in our church I never had a single conversation with that man that he didn't chew me out and I didn't like it and I never felt like he was wanting me to win he didn't have the gift he didn't have the heart to be a mentor
[time=2294] I always felt less than smaller than when we had a conversation he could say the same things that Bob said but they were totally heard totally different you know all right you have an opportunity when it comes to real relationship and iron sharpening iron and walking alongside one another in the body of Christ to make sure that you're communicating in a way that the people around you know that you want them to win and that's part of that relationship it's an ideal that the Apostle Paul gives here Timothy and Paul they've served through thick and thin together and they're getting on the other side together and they're serving marvellous together and they've done it over an extended period of time and they're going to keep on serving until death separates them there's another one here we find his name a unique name it paphroditis we don't know anything about paphroditis is that what's written in this passage but he does give him several titles here these titles are things like my brother titles like in verse 25 through 30 co-worker fellow soldier messenger or minister and in verse 30 refers to him it says as a risk taker says he's risking his life to make up what was lacking in your ministry to me it's part of that relational life that relational circle I've investing in one another I look back through the years and there have been some risk takers in my life who just partnered with me sometimes the decisions we make in the body of Christ in the church are risks are risky I look at this facility I don't know the history I don't know the story I don't know the background I know they don't give facilities like this away they aren't free it's risky when we step out there it's risky for pastors it's risky for elders it's risky for team members it's risky for those who jump in and say I want to be a part of this sink or swim I'm in and when we find those kinds of people we have to learn how to value them and hold them in high esteem in the Apostle Paul saying Timothy and Epaphroditus as men just like that in his own life who are a couple people in your life that you know have gone the extra mile to invest that you might succeed there's a third particular insight I want to talk about in some real practical issues here let's deal with some good relational advice as I enter this relational advice this is not one of the key notes I just want to give a summary of relational advice in fact I'm going to give you seven just seven key relational principles we find here in this passage and we'll be finished but as we enter this keep this statement in mind if you don't hear anything else I've said all day in every relationship there are two halves no exceptions in every relationship there are two halves with your wife with a friend with the person seated next to you and if there are two halves to every relationship make sure your half is the better half did you get that if there are two halves in every relationship make sure your half is the better half anybody I've ever counseled with anyone who's ever met with me about some particular issue or problem with their wife or with their kid or with their mom or dad or with a neighbor or a person on the job it's always about the other half they're always frustrated about the other half they're always complaining about the other half they're always wanting somebody to fix the other half and my challenge to you is make sure your half is the better half and if everybody makes sure their half is the better half the church has marvelous relationships both with God with one another and those outside the family of God now to wrap things up this morning I want to give you seven pieces of good relational advice all right here in this text number one be complimentary all the way back to the beginning verse 12 Paul begins the entire text by saying so then my dear friends just as you've always obeyed not only in my presence but now even more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trimming what's he doing he's beginning by complimenting them I'm so proud of you guys you've been obedient to the gospel one year when I'm watching your obedient to the gospel when I'm not just be complimentary we're not a very complimentary society anymore we're losing that sense of when someone walks in sharing a sense of gratitude as to what someone means to us or how grateful we are for them in our life or sharing some quality trait in their life that really stands out be looking be finding something every day in every relationship where you can just simply be complimentary when you walk in and see somebody don't start arguing complaining remember but instead be complimentary number two also on verse 12 good relational advice be devoted to obey
[time=2629] God be devoted to obey God in other words live out your
[time=2635] faith God is all about people value people God is all about relationship
[time=2641] it's what center front and center in his very heartbeat of sending Jesus Christ into this world so that he could have a right relationship with us and us with him and so therefore work to maintain those relationships constantly and obey God if you've got a problem with someone in relationship go fix it you may not can guarantee that all of it goes away you can't change somebody else's mindset I've learned that through the years I can't necessarily guarantee that everything go back the way it used to be but I can make sure my half is the better half I can make sure that you're forgiven I can make sure you don't owe me anything I can make sure that I don't think less of you when you walk in the room I can make sure that I release you from some hurt feeling or some difficulty that may have happened in time past I can't fix you but I can fix me obey the gospel that's why he says it's so important that if you come to bring your your arms and pray make sure that you get things right with one another and then come bring your offering then come forward and pray these things are vitally important in the life of every church and you'll have to work to maintain those number three don't complain and argue you've already addressed that one Adam was the first complainer is that woman you gave me she messed me up then came complain because God lacked Abel's sacrifice better than his and he complained
[time=2737] statement I wrote this week if you're a complainer you're a contaminator if you're a complainer you are a contaminator you will contaminate your marriage if you complain you'll contaminate your friends you'll contaminate your your church you'll contaminate your children you'll contaminate yourself you'll contaminate unbelievers complaining and contamination go hand in hand because complaining flows from a heart that's not in right relationship with God nor people number four sacrifice for each other I love the phrase here in verse 17 Paul says but even if I'm poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith even if I'm giving of my life so that you might have a right relationship with God I am glad and I rejoice with all of you Paul is excited to have had the sacrifice to give up something to have gone through pain that their faith might be stronger when have you sacrificed if someone else's faith might be stronger when have you gone the extra mile to invest or to pour into the life of someone giving up time giving up treasure giving up something that was important and of great value to you so that someone else's life could be the benefactor be the better sacrifice for each other's great relational advice number five celebrate with each other also in the same passage Paul said I'm glad and with all of you and in verse 18 in the same way you also should rejoice and share your joy with me learn how to celebrate with each other not not be jealous of one another but celebrate one another someone has something great happen in their life don't don't be resentful someone else gets a promotion don't be resentful or jealous but celebrate look for ways listen for things that you can champion in other people's life and I'm I'm gonna tell you this when you become that champion in other people's lives in such ways you'll find your life becomes like a magnet people just want to be around because this world is hurting for somebody to tell somebody just just one kind word just one thing about how good life can possibly be today and still how bad it is celebrate with each other number six value unbelievers value unbelievers verse 15 Paul reminds them don't forget you shine like stars in this world in verse 22 we find this phrase where Timothy had shared in the gospel minister with him as an evangelist do you value lost people when was the last time you brought a drunk to church or someone who obvious under normal circumstances might feel like they don't fit here in this room this is to be a hospital where people whose lives are upside down messed up in every way you can imagine who got every sin have every sense of bad reputation have bad character have bad integrity have bad everything this is where they're supposed to be in Fort Wayne, Indiana the worst of the worst shouldn't be out there they should somehow find a way to be in here and it will only happen if the people in here build bridges to their life to their heart to their home building walls around this building to keep them out
[time=2985] it's a
[time=2991] part of that fair cycle problem of religion that has a tendency to take over what we know is not the gospel of Jesus Christ and we begin to prioritize things that were not the senior priority of Jesus and Jesus reminded the Pharisees over and over again you've got all the theology you know all the rules you know all the history you dress and all the right clothes you've got the right haircut you listen to the right music you go to all the right places but you're just not right with God you're like you're like full of dead men's bones you look right on the outside you're just filthy rotten on the inside to the core and you're not doing God's will you think your God's representative is to our society and you're the reason nobody around here knows God that was Jesus' words to the Pharisees and over and over again we have to ask ourselves God help me not evolve into a modern day Pharisee
[time=3049] help me to maintain a heart that's constantly building bridges into people's arts that don't know Jesus. I'll finish with number seven
[time=3061] honor those who serve with diligence honor those who serve with diligence in verse 29 and 30 I love how he sort of gives a tagline for the path for Titus says welcome him and the Lord with all joy and whole men like him in honor and high esteem because he came close to death for the work of Christ risking his life to make up what was lacking in your ministry to me what a tagline nowhere else mentioned in scripture what a tagline hold men like him in high esteem I want to ask you about your husband close your eyes for a minute
[time=3107] some of you were in this room perhaps
[time=3113] God's spoken to your heart and your life your believer but in some area of this challenge on relationships with God or relationships with one another or relationships with unbelievers God's address something the Holy Spirit's address something in your own heart your own life would you just pause for a second and build this imaginary circle around you right there in your seat and say God fix this inside of me give me the courage to address this issue inside of me strip me from those wrong attitudes and actions in my own soul give me courage to address that with that individual there are others of you who are here today and you've never given your heart to Jesus you don't know if you die today you go to heaven I want to invite you to a right relationship with God it's why this church exists it's why Jesus came will you embrace that relationship it's not just one sided God loves you passionately in spite of your sin while you were still a sinner Jesus came to die for you but it doesn't really become a relationship until you reciprocate and receive him and embrace him so while our heads are about eyes are closed if you want to give your heart Jesus this morning just pause with me for a second and call upon him invite him into your life prayer press something like this there's no magical prayer to pray you know exact words to say just open up your heart and prayer prayer something similar to this Lord Jesus I give you me today
[time=3221] I invite you into my life to take over forgive me of all my sin
[time=3231] thank you for loving me and dying for me
[time=3237] I now turn to you and I'm all yours from this day forward
[time=3247] while our heads are still bowed and eyes are still closed
[time=3253] not coming out to where you are but as an extension of the faith in your heart I'm going to ask you boldly and confidently if you've just given your heart and life to Jesus and you prayed and invited Jesus Christ in your life and you're embracing Jesus Christ this morning's your Lord and Savior I want to ask you just lift your hand and lift it up high not coming out to where you are lift lift your hand up lifted up high God bless you ma'am there are others of you I'm giving my life Jesus lifted up high lifted up high God bless you others of you I've seen three others of I see four or five I see five of you lifted up high I see six others of you and giving my life to Jesus I see seven eight can't see in the balcony very well wave at me if you're in the balcony I see nine ten awesome you can put your hands down and here's what I want to ask of you two things there's a little card in your seats there in front of you please don't leave here today without filling out that little card and just check there at the bottom left it says yes I want to speak with someone about fully surrendering my life to Jesus Christ they'll help explain exactly what that means you're going to receive a booklet matter of fact bring that today fill it out completely bring it by this stage here or give it to pastor Kevin on your way out you can receive a booklet that will help you get started this very days to what it means to be a follower of Jesus Christ this church is here to help you and walk alongside you in that journey so make sure you don't leave without that I've seen ten I'm going to ask ten cards okay as an extension of your faith they're not going to do anything crazy with you they're trustworthy people what right alongside you just encourage you so please fill that out completely make sure pastor Kevin or someone here at the stage or on your way out receives that card that you've given your life to Jesus today Father thank you for this time that we've had together studying Lord we celebrate rejoice over those who've given their hearts to you today your word reminds us that when one sinner turns to you there's rejoicing in the presence of the angels in heaven and we celebrate and rejoice together today and all God's people said amen what a word we've received today that's what God's word his word to you that's why we're here that's what the Bible our exists for that's why we have this on your screen each and every week and so I want to encourage you no matter what God's doing in your life we've looked at relationships today and pastor Todd has walked us through a lot of principles a lot of thoughts that have probably challenged you in one way or another and so here's the challenge if you know Jesus how can your relationships better model better look like Jesus in your life or perhaps you're one of those that he was just talking about maybe you're here and God stirred in your heart today telling you today is the day of salvation it's time to take that leap of faith to find salvation in Jesus and in Jesus alone maybe you've been looking for salvation looking for what it looks like to have eternal life all of your life and maybe you've just been over complicating it and maybe today God made it as simple as it truly is and so today no matter where you're at I challenge you take that leap of faith don't wait until everything's lined up because it will probably never be lined up just like you would want it to be but Jesus is waiting right there for you this day and so I challenge you to take that step trust him as your savior and he will not disappoint he will save your soul today and you'll have eternal life in him and if you did that I've got a booklet that I want to get in your hands this is something that we use every week at Black Hawk Ministries it's called beginning steps a growth guide for you believers and really what it's going to do is show you just how you've heard us say perhaps that salvation is a beginning step it's not the end of something it's the beginning of something new that God has started in your life well that's why we use this book it'll show you how that's the case what steps you can take from here and we'd love to get one of these in your hands we'd love to have you come and take one here at Black Hawk Ministries we'd love to have you in person anytime you're able to join us or if you're watching us and would like us to mail one of these to you there's going to be some information on your screen where you can either call us or email us reach out to us so that we can get
