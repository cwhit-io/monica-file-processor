[time=0] You
[time=30] [MUSIC - 270 seconds]
[time=304] [APPLAUSE]
[time=308] I just want to tell you thank you for watching today and giving a little bit of your time, and I pray that it's already been a blessing to you, and as you've been seeing, we've been talking a lot about what it means to live inside out.
[time=320] And you may wonder, "Why are we even doing all these interviews, pulling in all of these other organizations and ministries?"
[time=326] And I want to just speak to that for a moment and tell you, our goal in this series is not just that we would hear truth,
[time=332] but that truth would really do something inside of us to the point where we wouldn't just turn inward. That's the point of the series that church and people naturally turn inwardly.
[time=341] But that we would live inside out. When you meet Jesus, it turns you inside out.
[time=345] And so our goal with all of these organizations like Mission Church, like City Life, and like Safe Families, and all of the other ministry partnerships that we have here at Black Caucus Ministries
[time=355] is to give venue for your faith to be lived out, to be lived inside out, in fact, where you can actually engage in ministry, get your hands dirty the way that Jesus did, and make a difference in the world around you.
[time=367] We love to help you plug in to all the different ways that we minister, all the different ways that we just make a difference in our community.
[time=373] I believe that the church should be known in our community.
[time=377] I believe that we should be the reason the church is known in the community, because when people look at the church that's following Jesus, they see even if maybe I don't believe everything that they believe, I still see a church that is known in the community making a difference in the community is better because the church is there.
[time=396] And that's our goal. That's what we want to build.
[time=398] That's what we want to be in the community and the world all around us.
[time=402] And so we invite you to plug into that.
[time=404] We've got a lot of ways you can connect with us.
[time=406] No matter what God's doing in your life, let us know. Let us know how we can serve you.
[time=410] Let us know how we can plug you in.
[time=412] And so we've got some different ways that you can connect with us.
[time=415] You can find us on Twitter and Instagram @BHawkMinistries.
[time=418] You can search for us on Facebook, look for the Bible Hour, and/or Black Hawk Ministries on Facebook. We stream our services live there as well every single week
[time=428] at 10.30 a.m. every single Sunday.
[time=430] And so we invite you to engage and plug in in whatever way that we can help you do so.
[time=435] Look for the app on the App Store as well. Black Hawk Church app.
[time=438] You can find it on the Google Play Store, your App Store.
[time=441] You can find us there and you'll find sermon notes.
[time=443] You'll find community involvement, things there.
[time=446] You'll find all the different ways that you can connect and plug in.
[time=449] All the stuff God's doing at Black Hawk. I pray that today God's going to bless you, that God's going to do something inside of you as you listen to truth, as we worship together, and we just celebrate all the stuff God's doing here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=461] See you soon.
[time=463] A definition of indigenous leader is simply from here, lead here.
[time=477] It's understanding that their environment is not one that molds them to lead, so they're choosing to be molded so that they can lead.
[time=486] I mean, they understand that nine times out of ten they're going to be in this community.
[time=491] And if they're going to be in this community, we want them as leaders.
[time=494] It's definitely easier for a 70-year-old male in Fort Wayne to get into trouble.
[time=499] I feel like there's much more things you can do wrong than right.
[time=506] It's much easier to fail than it is to succeed.
[time=511] Just having that older adult male to just look up to or go to when you need it
[time=518] and know that they're always honest and they always want what's best for you, it's second to none.
[time=526] We let them see what we do.
[time=528] They give an opportunity to allow them to do what we do.
[time=531] And you just continue to mold and shape that.
[time=535] His leadership is what I've been following.
[time=540] To see him do that and he's telling me his mistakes and he goes along, so I won't make the same mistakes.
[time=548] He's telling me what he did right in order to get to where he is at.
[time=552] And now he's impacting those around the epitome of indigenous leadership.
[time=564] For the second week in a row, we're looking at City Life as an organization that we can partner with and come alongside and worship God with here in Fort Wayne doing great work.
[time=573] Will you please welcome to the stage Chip Clark, Amy Binkley and Renee Biler.
[time=577] (applause)
[time=583] Chip, you're the Director of Ministries at City Life and you were with us last week.
[time=586] For those who may have missed it or even for those who remember it, give us kind of a nutshell overview of City Life and the work that you're doing down there.
[time=595] Certainly.
[time=596] Before I do that, the young man that was in the video, he went to Snyder High School.
[time=602] He is now a freshman at Butler University and is doing really, really well.
[time=608] If you knew his life, it's just a miracle that he's even there.
[time=612] That's awesome.
[time=613] But just to recap from last week, we just talked about what City Life is and I can go deep into that.
[time=621] But the main thing is that we are an asset base community.
[time=626] Like we're looking for the leadership that may not be seen from the news
[time=632] or from articles or from stats that we may read about the urban communities.
[time=637] But it is an asset base community.
[time=639] So our goal is to find those gyms, those young people who have leadership potential
[time=645] and really invest in them.
[time=647] And this week you've got Amy Binkley with you, a member of your staff.
[time=651] Amy, you are the real talk and adult empowerment director.
[time=654] Now I can sympathize with having a title that no one understands.
[time=658] What does that mean?
[time=660] Okay.
[time=661] So real talk is a girls ministry, our mentoring program that I am in charge of leading, and we get to go into the school.
[time=668] So we get to go where the girls are and meet with them over the lunch period.
[time=672] And we have groups at Southside and Wayne right now.
[time=676] And the adult empowerment side is honestly just a fancy way of saying recruiting volunteers.
[time=682] And retaining them.
[time=684] And retaining them, yes, yes.
[time=686] Ships right there with that.
[time=688] Amy, tell us about that.
[time=690] Obviously a group like City Life needs volunteers.
[time=693] What is the specific need that you guys have?
[time=696] Well, at City Life we cultivate just a home environment.
[time=701] So every room has a purpose.
[time=703] So whether that's just the lounge, hangout room, tutoring, place to go do your homework.
[time=709] We're looking for adults of all ages.
[time=711] So college age on up to 80 or 100.
[time=714] I don't care.
[time=715] Just anybody who loves kids.
[time=717] We are, as youth for Christ, just all about loving relationships and finding those adults
[time=724] who understand the importance of building relationships in whatever capacity they're serving.
[time=730] And there is a specific need in terms of time of the day.
[time=734] When do you have that highest need?
[time=736] We're open after school.
[time=738] So we look for volunteers who are available from 4pm to 730.
[time=743] And that does not mean they have to stay that whole time.
[time=746] But the main thing that we're looking for is consistency.
[time=749] So the one thing that will tell a kid that you care the most is you showing up.
[time=755] So we really ask that volunteers look at their schedule and kind of identify, can I give
[time=761] one time a week, just a couple hours consistently showing up to help?
[time=767] That's Monday through Thursday.
[time=769] And then Friday we do some more deeper leadership type things.
[time=772] And typically you need about 15 liters, ideally, a day.
[time=776] Where do you usually fall?
[time=778] Short.
[time=779] How short?
[time=781] So right now we're about average about 6 per day.
[time=785] And with 125 students, we would love to have our goal is to be about 15 to 20 adults per
[time=793] day helping out.
[time=794] And I would just add that when he says 100 some students, that can be overwhelming.
[time=800] And so not to get freaked out by the masses of all these students.
[time=803] And how do I pay attention to all this?
[time=806] It really is you honing in on your one or two, depending on what your capacity is.
[time=811] If you can handle five or 10, great.
[time=814] But just noticing that one kid here and there that you can connect with.
[time=820] And this is Renee Biler.
[time=821] Renee is a volunteer at City Life.
[time=823] She's a member of our family here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=826] And full disclosure, Renee cuts my hair.
[time=829] I don't want you to hold that against her.
[time=831] I don't give her much to work with.
[time=833] So pray for me.
[time=836] Renee, you got plugged into City Life about a year ago.
[time=840] How did that happen?
[time=842] My husband attended an event at City Life and toured the facility and fell in love with it and said, "Okay, we got to do this." And I attended and fell in love with it.
[time=852] And here we are.
[time=853] And so you're down there every Tuesday.
[time=855] Tell us about that time.
[time=856] What do you do there as a volunteer?
[time=858] I do a couple different things.
[time=859] When the kids come in every day, I am checking them in, high-fiving them.
[time=863] How is your day?
[time=864] Which is really fun.
[time=865] And then on the flip side, I am in the economics area.
[time=869] So I get to work with student interns.
[time=873] And I get to teach them life skills of what it means and what it looks like to work in jobs.
[time=879] What has this meant to you?
[time=881] You've been doing it for about a year now.
[time=883] How has it impacted you on a heart level?
[time=886] I just can't -- when I'm not there, I want to be there.
[time=890] And I try not to go every day, but I think I could go every day if I had the time.
[time=894] I just love it.
[time=895] And I love those kids.
[time=896] And there's a Bible verse that kind of speaks to your heart for this mission.
[time=900] Proverbs 22-6, "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not turn away."
[time=906] So I just say, "Gosh, if you have the ability to love others, especially children, come love on these kids with your time and your talents and your treasures, you won't go wrong."
[time=915] Our family is so involved.
[time=917] It's exciting.
[time=919] So we've been talking about city life for two weeks.
[time=921] If you would like to get more information, there's going to be a table out in the foyer.
[time=925] Amy, one of the really great ways to see it up close and personal is to see the story tour.
[time=931] Right.
[time=932] And last week, we had several people sign up, and I'm super impressed.
[time=936] There was this one gal who replied through via text.
[time=939] I'm so pumped I can't wait.
[time=941] And so I said, "Okay, well, do you want to come today?" Because we were lining up for next week.
[time=946] And she's like, "Yes." So she came that very day.
[time=949] So we've already had two people come and do tours.
[time=951] And then next Monday and Tuesday, we have other people already coming.
[time=955] So what you do is just sign up.
[time=957] You put your cell number, an email.
[time=960] I will contact you.
[time=962] I will hunt you down and get you there.
[time=965] That sounds more threatening than you probably wanted to sound.
[time=968] Well, I'm sorry.
[time=969] I would just make it happen.
[time=971] But if you are interested in city life, hit the table in the foyer after church.
[time=974] It's a great way to find out more, get down there, see the story tour.
[time=978] I think it's a great way to get plugged in.
[time=980] We guys thank Chip, Amy and Renee for joining us.
[time=983] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1013] [MUSIC]
[time=1041] Well, welcome to Black Hawk.
[time=1043] Glad that you're here.
[time=1044] What a blessing it has already been today.
[time=1047] I love that we're featuring, if you're wondering, why do we have these interviews?
[time=1050] Why are we featuring these ministries?
[time=1052] It's because we believe in not just talking about the stuff that Jesus said in his word, but actually doing the stuff that Jesus did that he modeled for us.
[time=1061] And that's why we're featuring all these ministries.
[time=1063] To give you an opportunity to get your hands dirty in ministry, so to speak.
[time=1067] To give you the opportunity to stretch and to grow.
[time=1070] Just so you know, I'll tell you, I'll give you our agenda behind the scenes.
[time=1073] We purposefully featured some things that we know would stretch you, make you a little bit uncomfortable.
[time=1079] And I love that you're responding, so I want to tell you thank you for responding the way that you have been Black Hawk Ministries, just to plugging into ministry.
[time=1086] I think people are being mobilized, and we're seeing lives change every week, and you're a huge, huge part of that.
[time=1092] So my name is Kevin Pastor here.
[time=1093] If you don't know me, if you're a guest, I want to welcome you here today.
[time=1096] Anybody that's watching us online or television or at home, welcome to you as well.
[time=1101] We're a big family here, and we love that God's just growing that family every single week.
[time=1106] Now it's a big day today.
[time=1108] Has anybody heard about a little game that's supposed to be happening?
[time=1111] Super Bowl is tonight, and I just want to say I'm a little uncomfortable about one thing.
[time=1117] And that one thing is this orange Gatorade thing that's on the front row.
[time=1122] And if you don't know, because most of you do, because I got this little meme, anybody know what a meme is, right?
[time=1129] There's this picture with the words on it that says, "We should be as excited about church as we are about the Super Bowl." So this Sunday, when your pastor makes a good point, poor Gatorade over his head.
[time=1139] Hey, whatever it takes for Jesus, right?
[time=1143] So I want to ask you, how many of you are New England Patriots fans in the building?
[time=1148] All right? Okay.
[time=1152] If you don't know my story, I came from Georgia.
[time=1156] And so I'm a Falcons fan, and here I want to educate you on something, just so you know.
[time=1161] You ready for this?
[time=1162] This has nothing to do with the series, but I promise I'll get there in a minute.
[time=1165] I want to tell you that I found out this week that Jesus is also a Falcons fan.
[time=1171] It's true, you can laugh if you want, but it's true.
[time=1174] Because Jesus, while he was here on this earth, even looked at Lazarus, who was dead in a tomb and said, "Lazarus, rise up." And if you don't know what rise up is, it's all about the Falcons.
[time=1185] So anyway, now, yeah.
[time=1187] All right, you didn't even know that because there are too many Patriots fans in the room.
[time=1190] But I'm so glad, I'm so glad that Jesus is bigger than football, aren't you?
[time=1196] No matter who wins or loses, we always win when we're on Jesus' side of things.
[time=1201] So thanks for being here today. That's what this series is about.
[time=1204] And so I want to dive in.
[time=1205] We're in our fifth week of this series called Inside Out.
[time=1208] We're in the book of Philippians.
[time=1209] So if you brought your Bibles, look there with me.
[time=1211] Philippians chapter three.
[time=1213] And if you did not bring a Bible, if you don't have a Bible, there are Bibles in the seats around you.
[time=1218] And you are welcome to not only use that, but take it home with you if you need a Bible.
[time=1221] That is there for you.
[time=1222] I'll be reading from the English standard version today if you want to follow along on your apps or whatever that looks like for you, ESV.
[time=1229] Philippians three, one through eleven.
[time=1231] Today's title and really the bottom line of what today's about is that church is not about religion.
[time=1238] Church is not about religion.
[time=1241] In the series so far, we have looked at how the church naturally turns inward.
[time=1248] We naturally look out for me.
[time=1250] We naturally like what's comfortable.
[time=1253] We naturally turn inward because we're human.
[time=1256] But Jesus said, I came to build my church and it's going to be a winning church.
[time=1260] Nothing's going to prevail against it.
[time=1262] Not even the gates of hell, but for that to happen, the natural inwardness has to turn outward.
[time=1267] I want to build my church inwardly so that we make a huge impact in the world around us outwardly.
[time=1274] Jesus will turn you inside out.
[time=1276] Anybody ever noticed that?
[time=1278] Those of you who have met him, he will turn you inside out.
[time=1281] So we look in the first week about the fact that church is for everybody.
[time=1285] Jesus tore down the man-made barriers by bringing the CEO fashionista named Lydia.
[time=1291] White collar, a jailer, Philippian jailer who's just a blue collar worker who wanted to go home and catch the Super Bowl at the end of the day.
[time=1299] A slave girl who had nothing to bring to the table.
[time=1302] Completely different races, different backgrounds, different spiritual approaches in their life.
[time=1308] Different views of what religion was even all about, but Jesus tore all of those walls down.
[time=1313] The Gospel blew up the man-made barriers and it shows us that church is for everybody.
[time=1318] Second week we saw that church is unstoppable.
[time=1321] Not only did it tear down those barriers, it's bigger than our circumstances.
[time=1326] Church is something that gives you joy.
[time=1329] Paul was showing us this.
[time=1330] This is perhaps the greatest book in all scripture on joy.
[time=1333] And we said it over and over and it's in your notes again for a reason.
[time=1336] Say it with me if you know, if you've been here with me, to rejoice is a choice.
[time=1342] Paul showed us that.
[time=1344] Jesus is bigger than our circumstances.
[time=1347] Church is unstoppable.
[time=1349] The third week we looked at the fact that church is built by humility.
[time=1352] Now Jesus humbled himself to the point of death, even death on a cross.
[time=1356] And in that we looked at the fact that to do that, to live that out means that people come before preferences.
[time=1363] Anybody got any preferences?
[time=1365] I'd prefer that the Falcons win today.
[time=1369] I'd prefer church be built around my schedule with my preferences, with what I want.
[time=1375] But you know what I've learned the more I've gotten to know Jesus?
[time=1378] Can I go southern accent on it for a minute?
[time=1381] It ain't about me.
[time=1383] I've learned it ain't about me.
[time=1385] It's not about me.
[time=1387] And then last week my pastor Todd Wright shared with you about how church is about relationships.
[time=1393] Now I want us to take that message and go into today and talk about how church, if it's about relationships, it is not about religion.
[time=1401] That's what I want us to look at today.
[time=1403] And so about this idea that to rejoice is a choice.
[time=1406] Joy is a big part of the Bible.
[time=1408] There's a few of our life groups that have shared with me a couple of definitions that you've come up with for joy.
[time=1413] And I just thought I'd share them with you because it's coming from inside of our church family here.
[time=1417] And I think they're very good.
[time=1418] First of all, I've heard this one before.
[time=1420] It's just simply J.O.Y.
[time=1421] Jesus others yourself.
[time=1424] Great definition of joy.
[time=1426] Jesus first, then it's others, then it's me.
[time=1429] Another one I like this one too.
[time=1431] Joy is Holy Spirit positivity based on awareness of true reality.
[time=1437] Two on that one, so when we're aware of the true realities of Jesus, it makes life look a lot different than it once did.
[time=1447] Think about that.
[time=1448] I just thought I'd throw it out there.
[time=1449] And I've wondered this week, what would Philippians look like if I wrote it?
[time=1453] Paul wrote it from a prison cell.
[time=1455] He had no reason to choose to rejoice.
[time=1458] We say to rejoice is a choice.
[time=1460] Well, he chose it.
[time=1461] I wonder if I wrote it.
[time=1463] If we wrote it, if typical Americans wrote it today, what would Philippians look like?
[time=1468] My guess is that it would look a lot more like our social media feeds.
[time=1472] It would look a lot more whiny than winning.
[time=1478] And I'm throwing that at Rod at myself.
[time=1480] Because, you know, I wonder if I were in Paul's shoes, what I had chosen to rejoice the way that he did.
[time=1485] And you may say, well, I can't choose that either.
[time=1487] That's just not who I am, but I want to tell you today that yes it is.
[time=1490] Because we serve the same God that Paul served.
[time=1493] First thing I want to give you to take notes with.
[time=1495] Paul sets the stage in verses one through three of Philippians three.
[time=1498] And the first point I want to make today is that living inside out takes a shift from a religion to relationship.
[time=1507] And that's in your notes there, because that's really what today is all about.
[time=1510] Living inside out takes a shift from religion to relationship.
[time=1516] How many of you here have ever struggled with religion before?
[time=1523] If you raised your hand, you might be on the same track as Jesus.
[time=1528] You might be on the right track, and we're going to see why today.
[time=1531] And there's a quote that I was reminded of this week, and it says this, "To try to find life in dead religion is like trying to quench your thirst with salt water."
[time=1543] You ever been to the beach before?
[time=1545] You used to live a lot closer to the beach.
[time=1550] But man, when you go there, you leave thirsty.
[time=1553] And if you get that salt water in your mouth, it just leaves you more thirsty than you were to begin with.
[time=1557] And here's what I know, listen to me, if you're here today and you're a guest, especially if you're here and you would say, I don't do church.
[time=1563] I don't like church.
[time=1564] It's a huge deal for me to be here today.
[time=1566] I know that there have been so many experiences in the church world where you have gone in, you're thirsty for something more, but you left more thirsty than you left to begin with.
[time=1576] And if that is your experience, if that's the case for you, then you did not meet Jesus.
[time=1581] You probably based what you saw church to be on religion, which has to do everything with all the people around you,
[time=1587] and you missed the real reason we do church to begin with, and his name is Jesus.
[time=1592] We can't define our faith on what God's people do.
[time=1598] We define our faith, and we define what the church looks like based on the person of Jesus Christ,
[time=1604] who is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[time=1607] When people fail you, he will never, ever fail you.
[time=1612] That is the God that we serve.
[time=1614] That's how you can learn why religion may not be the answer that you were looking for after all.
[time=1621] You thought, you know, the religion of your parents would be the answer.
[time=1625] If Paul wants to tell us about his own personal journey of religion, so he's a perfect example of this.
[time=1631] Religion, by the way, is all about the outward appearance.
[time=1634] We've looked at how Jesus, his main complaint against the Pharisees is you look perfect on the outside,
[time=1640] like a whitewash tomb.
[time=1642] It looks beautiful on the outside, but on the inside is just simply full of dead man's bones.
[time=1647] It's a dead religion because you look the part, you put the church smile on, do your best church smile.
[time=1652] You put every week, right? You put the church smile on, but on the inside you're cracking and crumbling and falling apart and you're basing your life on things that don't last.
[time=1662] I don't want to be in that camp.
[time=1664] I don't want to be a modern day Pharisee.
[time=1666] I want to be someone who understands Jesus for who he truly is.
[time=1670] And Paul is a great example of that.
[time=1672] He was as religious as it gets, but he met this guy named Jesus and it turned into a relationship
[time=1679] that changed his life forever and forever.
[time=1682] So let's look at verses one through three.
[time=1684] To just think about this thought that living inside out takes a shift from religion to relationship.
[time=1689] Paul sets it up this way, verse one of Philippians three.
[time=1692] Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord and write the same things to you.
[time=1697] It's no trouble for me and it's safe for you.
[time=1701] Look out for the dogs.
[time=1703] We're going to come back and have some fun with that in a minute.
[time=1706] Look out for the dogs.
[time=1708] Look out for the evil doers.
[time=1710] Look out for those who mutilate the flesh.
[time=1712] For we are the circumcision who worshiped by the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus
[time=1718] and underline these words here and put no confidence in the flesh.
[time=1725] That's a lot of words and a lot of your life.
[time=1727] I do not understand where Paul's coming from because here's what was happening.
[time=1730] When Paul's writing this, there were people who were entering the culture, this Jesus culture that was building, this idea that Jesus changed your life drastically.
[time=1739] They were entering the culture wanting to bring their own customs, their own traditions, their own ways of doing faith, really religion.
[time=1746] They were bringing their own religion and forcing it down the throats of these new believers, these new followers of Jesus
[time=1752] and making life, making church, making this faith that people were entering into called Christianity
[time=1759] and all about the things that we do, not the things that he already did.
[time=1764] That's what Paul was talking about.
[time=1766] That's the culture he was in.
[time=1768] A lot of that had to do with circumcision.
[time=1770] You may say, well, what's the big deal about circumcision?
[time=1773] Preachers, a lot of times, just skip over those passages because we don't want to talk about them.
[time=1776] But I'll tell you, it's very simple.
[time=1778] It is a religious tradition and custom that defined the Jewish faith back in the day.
[time=1785] And Paul knew that people were building faith on that to the point where that became the point, more than Jesus being the point.
[time=1793] It's a religion-driven faith that really boils it down to pride because it's really all about me.
[time=1799] We're going to look at that more in depth, and so people are bringing all those things there.
[time=1802] And Paul looks at them and calls them, what was that word?
[time=1805] Dogs, you dog.
[time=1807] You dog.
[time=1809] Have you ever met a religious barker?
[time=1814] You know what I'm talking about.
[time=1817] There he is.
[time=1818] Yeah, that one there.
[time=1819] So I did all of my research this week, and that's what I found.
[time=1823] That's probably what he would look like.
[time=1825] You ever met that guy?
[time=1826] You know that lady?
[time=1828] Yeah, you have.
[time=1829] It's those people that all they want to do is throw at you the do's and the don'ts.
[time=1835] And hear me.
[time=1836] Hear me out.
[time=1837] We probably should take that down because you're not going to hear me if that's there, right?
[time=1841] Hear me.
[time=1842] I believe in today's culture.
[time=1844] The church is often known more for what we are against than what we are for.
[time=1849] And that is not the church that Jesus is building.
[time=1852] Jesus wants us not to be built on this idea of religion, knowing what we're against.
[time=1857] You do this and you don't do this, and yes, the Bible is full of do's and don'ts, but it's not the point of the Bible.
[time=1863] Jesus is the point of the Bible, and Jesus brought the gospel to us so that we would be changed from the inside out.
[time=1869] You notice there is an outward part of that.
[time=1871] That's because what he does on the inside starts to show up on the outside, not because of what I bring to the table, but because what he did in me.
[time=1880] So don't be a religious barker.
[time=1882] And when you meet Jesus and faith becomes about relationship, we go from that guy you just saw to this guy, the happy dog.
[time=1892] That's the kind of Christian I want to be.
[time=1895] Right there, just resting, relaxing in Jesus, this guy doesn't have a care in the world, does he?
[time=1901] He's found joy, and his joy is bigger than the circumstances of his life.
[time=1906] His owner may have forgotten to feed him, but he doesn't care.
[time=1909] He doesn't even know.
[time=1910] The same can be true of us.
[time=1912] This is what Paul is talking about when he says, "I put, we are the circumcision.
[time=1916] We are the reason Jesus came.
[time=1918] We are the point of the faith and the Christianity that Jesus came to build." So because of that, I put no confidence, verse 3 in the flesh.
[time=1927] I put no confidence in me.
[time=1930] I put all my confidence in him.
[time=1932] So I want us to look at the shift that Paul makes because in his own life, here's what he does from here.
[time=1936] He walks us through this journey of how his faith, his life was confident in religion, but how it became confident in a relationship with Jesus.
[time=1946] He walks us through that very journey.
[time=1949] Paul's basically telling you when you look at verse 4, we're going to look at verses 4 through 6.
[time=1954] The next thing I want to talk to you about is we're going to look at that contrast, religion relationship.
[time=1958] We're going to look number one at a life that's confident in religion.
[time=1961] A life that's confident in religion, verses 4 through 6.
[time=1964] And so when you look at Paul's life, he's going to walk us through this.
[time=1967] And he starts by saying, "Look, all of you people, you think you get it.
[time=1971] You think you have a reason to boast.
[time=1975] But if you have a reason, I have more of a reason." Let me say, well, that's kind of arrogant.
[time=1981] Well, if you're Paul, you could probably say that because when you look at his life, he's probably right.
[time=1986] And so we're going to look at his life that was confident on religion in the next few verses.
[time=1990] Then we'll see how he ends his life and what his point and his admonishment, his encouragement and his challenges to you and to me.
[time=1997] So that's what today is going to be all about.
[time=1999] Let's look at a life confident in religion.
[time=2001] Look at verse 4, picking up where we left off.
[time=2004] He had said, "I put no confidence in the flesh." Verse 3, "Though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh." Also, I get it.
[time=2012] If anyone else thinks he has a reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more.
[time=2018] Wow.
[time=2019] Okay, I'm listening.
[time=2020] Tell me what you're talking about.
[time=2022] Verse 5, he goes and gives this list of several reasons, four big reasons.
[time=2027] And I want us to look at that.
[time=2028] Four reasons Paul used to be confident.
[time=2030] Here they are, starting in verse 5.
[time=2032] I was circumcised on the eighth day of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews.
[time=2039] As to the law, Pharisee, as to zeal, a persecutor of the church.
[time=2044] As to righteousness under the law, blameless.
[time=2049] Wow.
[time=2051] How many of you could make that list?
[time=2053] I couldn't.
[time=2054] Well, Paul says I could and I was confident in these things, but I'm no longer confident in those things.
[time=2060] There's four key reasons Paul used to be confident.
[time=2063] I want to give those to you.
[time=2064] Four key reasons we see in verses 4 through 6.
[time=2066] The first is religious ritual.
[time=2068] Write that down.
[time=2069] Religious ritual.
[time=2070] Paul says I was circumcised on the eighth day.
[time=2072] That was a very common religious ritual.
[time=2075] We have a lot of religious rituals in our world today.
[time=2077] Well, this was one of Paul's.
[time=2080] I was a Jew of the Jews.
[time=2082] I was circumcised on the eighth day exactly like I was supposed to be.
[time=2086] I was fitting.
[time=2087] I was checking all the right boxes.
[time=2089] Anybody ever done that in your life?
[time=2090] You checked all the right boxes.
[time=2091] You were the church kid.
[time=2092] All of your life.
[time=2093] That was my story.
[time=2094] You checked all the right boxes.
[time=2096] But eventually you started realizing it's not about checking boxes because you could never check enough boxes.
[time=2101] Well, Paul was realizing that and he talked about how he was circumcised on the eighth day.
[time=2105] He was all about those religions.
[time=2107] I want to talk about a few of our rituals.
[time=2109] And before I do, I want to preface it by saying all of them are good.
[time=2114] I do all of the rituals that I want to walk us through.
[time=2117] Let's talk about baptism.
[time=2119] We do baptism.
[time=2120] We've had several baptized last week.
[time=2122] We've got some more people being baptized next Sunday.
[time=2124] If that's you and you need to take that step, I challenge you to take it.
[time=2127] But I want to tell you, it does not save you.
[time=2130] A lot of you are here and you have maybe a Catholic background.
[time=2133] We have people here from all different denominations, all different religions.
[time=2137] And here's what I'm going to tell you.
[time=2138] Before you tune me out, Jesus doesn't care what background you came from.
[time=2142] He proved that with Lydia, the jailer, and the slave girl.
[time=2146] Those were the people he used to start the church at Philippi.
[time=2149] He doesn't care about your background.
[time=2151] So I want to tell you now that maybe you were baptized as a child or as an infant.
[time=2156] You would say, well, why is that a big deal?
[time=2158] Is that a bad thing?
[time=2159] No.
[time=2160] It says a lot about your parents.
[time=2162] It says a lot about your background.
[time=2164] To be baptized now, we had two guys that were baptized with a Catholic background.
[time=2168] They were baptized as infants last Sunday.
[time=2170] Why did they take that step?
[time=2172] Because they realized that baptism doesn't save them.
[time=2175] The faith of their parents doesn't save them.
[time=2177] Though that faith, and though that step that they took as children, made them in such a
[time=2183] large part who they are today, it doesn't negate that.
[time=2185] It doesn't do away with that.
[time=2187] They took that step because since then they truly made their own decision to own their own faith, make that step of faith to give their life to Jesus, to lay it down at His feet.
[time=2196] And then they wanted to publicly declare that to the world around us.
[time=2199] That's why Jesus was baptized.
[time=2201] Now He asked us to be baptized.
[time=2203] It's not some religious ritual that we do.
[time=2205] It's something that shows the inside outwardly.
[time=2208] It's an outward expression of something that happened to me on the inside.
[time=2213] Some of you need to take that step.
[time=2215] And that may be one of the things that God brought you here for today.
[time=2218] We want to help you take that step.
[time=2220] We don't pressure people to take that step.
[time=2222] But God's working in some of you and you might need to take that step even this week.
[time=2226] And so we would love to help you with that.
[time=2229] It doesn't negate what once was with your faith.
[time=2231] It builds on that and does what Jesus did.
[time=2234] That's what I want to do with my life.
[time=2236] I want to do the things Jesus did.
[time=2238] I want to follow His way.
[time=2240] And I say that not to single anybody out.
[time=2243] Because we're all in this together and Jesus has already proven that church is for everybody.
[time=2247] It doesn't matter where you come from or what that looks like.
[time=2250] And so that's why we do baptism here after salvation.
[time=2253] Does it happen on the inside?
[time=2254] Now let's declare it on the outside.
[time=2256] When you go under the water, it symbolizes the death and the burial of Jesus.
[time=2260] By the way, that's just bath water up there in case you wander or sins floating around in there afterwards.
[time=2266] It may stink a little bit more afterwards because some of us might have needed a bath, but it's not sin.
[time=2271] When you go under the water, it symbolizes the washing away of your sins and it happens because Jesus died and was buried.
[time=2277] And as you come out of the water, that's why I always say, "And raised to walk with Him in a new life." It symbolizes the resurrection of Jesus that He is alive today.
[time=2287] What's your religious ritual that you put confidence in?
[time=2291] Paul was confident because of all the religious rituals that he had in his life.
[time=2295] It may be baby dedication.
[time=2297] We've dedicated both of our kids where babies line up on the stage.
[time=2300] We'll have some of those here where we dedicate our kids to the Lord.
[time=2303] And we say, "These kids, God, they're your kids." And I give them to you. They're yours.
[time=2307] They're not mine.
[time=2308] You gifted them to me and I want to be a good steward of them.
[time=2311] But I want you to know if you're dedicated as a child, that doesn't give you a home in heaven.
[time=2316] It's a great foundation that says a lot about the faith of your family, but it doesn't give you a home in heaven.
[time=2322] Communion, we do that once a month here publicly in front of everybody.
[time=2326] That doesn't save you.
[time=2328] If your confidence is in that, then your confidence is in the wrong stuff.
[time=2332] We do that because Jesus said, "Do this in remembrance of me." Notice he said, "Do this in remembrance of me." Because it's about him.
[time=2340] It's about the faith, the Christianity, the righteousness that we can't bring to the table that he gave to us.
[time=2348] Anybody think you're righteous here?
[time=2350] If you raise your hand, you're wrong because you're not.
[time=2354] Unless you know Jesus, and then I want you to know you can raise your hand.
[time=2358] Because when Jesus looks at you, if you know him, he doesn't care about how many rituals you've gone through.
[time=2365] When Jesus looks at you, if your life has been laid at his feet, he sees the blood and the righteousness of Jesus,
[time=2371] not the sins and the skeletons in your closet.
[time=2375] I don't know about you, but I don't deserve that.
[time=2378] I don't deserve that.
[time=2379] My religion could never get me to that kind of place.
[time=2381] Some of you, it's church attendance.
[time=2383] That's your religious ritual, and you would say, "I go to church three times out of the month."
[time=2389] Some of you would say, "I went to church that one time a month, so I'm good." Right?
[time=2396] But you know what?
[time=2397] You can't attend church enough to make your way to heaven, to make your way to Jesus.
[time=2402] We believe in it, and this is a beautiful place for us because we're here, and Scripture reminds us, "Don't forsake the assembling together.
[time=2409] Don't forget to celebrate together and do what we're doing here, but this can't get you there."
[time=2415] So what religious ritual are you finding confidence in?
[time=2418] That's what Paul's reminding us of in all of those regards.
[time=2422] Not to put your confidence in religious ritual.
[time=2425] Now, here's the thing.
[time=2426] I can't preach the rest of them like I just preached that one, or we're going to be here till about three o'clock today.
[time=2430] So you guys better listen faster.
[time=2434] Religious ritual is one of the reasons that Paul used to be confident.
[time=2438] The second one is national identity.
[time=2441] Write that down.
[time=2442] National identity.
[time=2443] He says, "I'm of the people of Israel." Here's the thing.
[time=2448] I love living in America.
[time=2450] I love it.
[time=2451] It's a beautiful place.
[time=2453] We're free to do this.
[time=2454] Every single week, we're blessed.
[time=2457] And in America, we have the most national pride, I would say.
[time=2461] It would definitely at least rival that of any other country.
[time=2464] Am I right?
[time=2465] We love the nation we're in, and we have something special and unique.
[time=2470] But I want to give you a statement, and I thought to chew on.
[time=2473] No one has ever gotten into heaven based on their national identity.
[time=2478] Ever.
[time=2480] And so many times we base who we are based on who we're from.
[time=2484] And I'm all for patriotism and loving where I'm from.
[time=2487] But Paul reminds us in the next passage we'll look at next week.
[time=2490] My citizenship is in heaven.
[time=2493] I live in the United States, and I'm a proud member of the United States of America.
[time=2497] I love that I live here.
[time=2499] But that's down here on my excitement level.
[time=2502] My excitement's through the roof to be able to say, "I'm a citizen of heaven." My national identity.
[time=2508] Here's the thing.
[time=2509] We say, "Well, Jesus wants us to make people that conform to how we feel about our national identity." And here's the thing, some of you are defined.
[time=2516] I believe this.
[time=2517] I believe somebody in this room has been being defined by the direction of our country today.
[time=2523] I see that on my social media feeds.
[time=2525] I do look, and I've been guilty of it myself.
[time=2528] Some of you are consumed by the direction of our nation.
[time=2532] Should you be concerned?
[time=2534] Should you be invested?
[time=2535] Should you be the church in the midst of that?
[time=2537] Yes.
[time=2538] Should you be consumed by that?
[time=2540] Absolutely not, if you know Jesus.
[time=2543] I'm not defined by my national identity.
[time=2546] I'm defined by Jesus in the fact that I'm a citizen of heaven.
[time=2550] We often say, "Go and pass that passion off to other people." We say, "Go out and make a Catholic," or, "Go out and make a Baptist," or, "Go out and make a Presbyterian," or, "Go out and make a Methodist," or, "Go out and make this," or, "Go out and make that." Jesus never said, "Go and make Baptists." Jesus said, "Go make disciples." That's why we're here.
[time=2570] And some of us today, maybe one of the things we needed to hear is, I'm not defined by anything that the world around me looks like.
[time=2578] I'm defined by Jesus and Jesus alone.
[time=2580] And so what I would challenge you to do is the things that you're seeing posted on social media, all the problems, go out and be salt and be light and be the church and be the solution.
[time=2590] And then you'll start to see those things fade to the background and Jesus fade to the front.
[time=2594] National identity.
[time=2596] He's a Hebrew of the Hebrews.
[time=2598] He's the next part, tribe of Benjamin, before we get their family name.
[time=2601] Number three, family name.
[time=2603] He said, "I'm of the tribe of Benjamin." You ever met a name, dropper?
[time=2608] Well, you know, last week I was having lunch with so-and-so, you know.
[time=2613] And we think we're special because of the family that we come from, or because of this or because of that. Well, you know, my dad was a pastor.
[time=2620] I was a P.K. and he's here today with me.
[time=2623] But you know what? My faith is not defined by his faith.
[time=2627] His faith and my family's faith doesn't get me to heaven.
[time=2631] That doesn't give me a relationship with Jesus. I've got to choose that on my own.
[time=2635] And Paul is saying, "I used to have confidence because I was of the tribe of Benjamin." That was a big deal. That was a big name.
[time=2640] Number four, personal ability.
[time=2643] Personal ability. And then Paul lists out four things within that thought of personal ability.
[time=2648] He says, "I was a Hebrew of the Hebrews. I was a Pharisee. I was a persecutor of the church." That's how zealous I was. That's how passionate I was.
[time=2657] And then I was blameless.
[time=2659] So here are four things that he had personal ability towards.
[time=2662] It was tradition, religious law, religious behavior, and self-righteousness.
[time=2671] Tradition. He said, "I was a Hebrew of the Hebrews. I've often been a church boy of the church boys." That was one of the names I got called in high school at times.
[time=2680] You little church boy.
[time=2683] You P.K. Preachers kid.
[time=2688] And I've been that on many occasions where I thought the traditions.
[time=2691] He said, "I was a Hebrew of the Hebrews. I kept all the laws. I did all of the right stuff." And there's so many times where I've made it about what I think church should look like.
[time=2700] My own preferences as I've led in the church.
[time=2704] I think that's been a problem at times for me.
[time=2707] Where I led from a preference and not about the person of Jesus.
[time=2710] Or in a way that makes life and makes faith and makes the church about the people out there.
[time=2715] That was the challenge of last week when it comes to relationships.
[time=2718] Is that we're not here to build walls around this place to keep people out.
[time=2722] That might contaminate what we've got going on. If we do that, we're contaminating the church that Jesus is building.
[time=2727] We're here to build bridges to the community. And the worst of the worst.
[time=2731] Every different skin color, every different background, every different approach to religion.
[time=2735] It doesn't matter. Jesus throws that stuff out the window and brings us together with unity.
[time=2740] And we're unified in that purpose and it changes the world.
[time=2744] That is what an inside out church truly looks like.
[time=2751] It's not built on all of these things. It's not built on your personal ability.
[time=2754] If you felt inadequate to be a part of the church, guess what? You're right.
[time=2758] You are. You're inadequate. But he's more than adequate.
[time=2763] And if you know Jesus, scripture reminds us that we have all we need pertaining to life and godliness.
[time=2770] Everything you need. We have that because of Jesus.
[time=2775] God doesn't look at the outside. He looks at the heart.
[time=2778] Now, you want a little bit more encouraging stuff? I do. I love how Paul takes it from there and he showed us.
[time=2785] That was the life that was confident in religion.
[time=2789] Now he takes it to a life that's confident in relationship verses 7 through 11.
[time=2794] Look there with me. I want to read these. Start with verse 7 and then I want to read a verse at a time and talk about them and give you four spiritual benefits that we can get from a life that's confident in relationship.
[time=2804] Paul says, but whatever gain I had, again, those were the things he was confident in.
[time=2810] He had all that stuff figured out. Whatever gain I had, I counted as lost for the sake of Christ.
[time=2817] And I'm blown away in my own life when I realized as a young kid,
[time=2832] that all the stuff that we get so caught up in this life is worthless compared to Jesus.
[time=2840] My heart breaks because I know many of you are in the room right now.
[time=2847] And your life's been consumed by all these things that don't matter.
[time=2851] You're building your life, your foundation on a foundation of sand.
[time=2857] It's going to shift. It's going to change. It's going to crumble.
[time=2861] But I want to challenge you today to build your life on the rock that is Jesus.
[time=2866] And it changes everything. He gives us a few things, spiritual benefits.
[time=2871] The first one is knowledge that goes from the head to the heart.
[time=2874] Write that down if you're taking notes. Knowledge that goes from the head to the heart.
[time=2877] Look at verse 8 there with me.
[time=2879] Indeed, I count everything as lost because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus, my Lord.
[time=2887] For his sake, I've suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish in order that I may gain Christ.
[time=2893] If you look at that word rubbish, he's not just talking about the trash that you go put in your trash can.
[time=2898] It literally equates to poop.
[time=2902] You call it what you want.
[time=2904] Experiment. Poop. It's nothing. It's the lowest. It's the dirtiest of the dirty things you can think of in this life.
[time=2912] It means nothing to me anymore. That's what knowing Jesus does.
[time=2916] It takes that knowledge of him from your head to your heart.
[time=2920] And when it does that, it changes your value system.
[time=2923] How you look at the world around you. It's not about what I bring to the table.
[time=2927] It's about what he already did. The second thing is righteousness that comes from him, not from me.
[time=2933] Verse 9.
[time=2936] And be found in him not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Jesus Christ, the righteousness of God that depends on faith.
[time=2948] 2 Corinthians 5, 21 tells us that God made him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
[time=2959] Wow, not get to see what the righteousness of God is all about, but get to become the righteousness of God.
[time=2967] That sounds like an inside-out kind of believer.
[time=2970] We become the righteousness of God. Ephesians 2, 8 and 9.
[time=2973] If you thought or made it about you or maybe your confidence has been in the flesh and the religious rituals in you and any kind of way today.
[time=2982] Maybe this is for you. Ephesians 2, 8 and 9. Paul writes this to the church in Ephesus.
[time=2987] And he says, "For by grace you've been saved through faith. This is not of your own doing. It's the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast."
[time=2999] Go back to verse 3 of Philippians 3. "Have no confidence in the flesh. It's not about me, so that I can't boast."
[time=3008] God did what I could never do. I want to show you a picture on the screen.
[time=3012] And this picture actually comes, it's a redesign, if you will, of a picture that we use in this book, and you'll hear me talk about this book in a minute.
[time=3018] This picture talks about any of your notice that within faith, sometimes your biggest nemesis is feelings.
[time=3023] You ever gotten up and not felt saved or not felt like Jesus was there, even though you know in your head that he's supposed to be.
[time=3031] You never leave me or forsake me. Anybody have those days where he just feels a million miles away?
[time=3036] Less based on feelings. You ever notice feelings do this in life? They're up and they're down, and if you depend on feelings you get nowhere.
[time=3043] And so this picture I want to show you, it has some core components. It says don't depend on feelings because there's a fact that starts this process.
[time=3051] The fact is God's Word. The fact is that you don't have anything to bring to the table in this relationship with God.
[time=3057] Being right with God does not and cannot depend on you. The fact is you're a sinner who needs Jesus.
[time=3062] The fact is Jesus lived that sinless, perfect life that you could never live to down across, to pay a price that you and I could never pay,
[time=3070] raising himself from the dead after three days that he is alive. The fact is he is alive.
[time=3075] When that becomes the engine of the train of your life, when that drives what you do and who you are, you put your faith.
[time=3081] This is the second thing. You put your faith in the facts of God's Word.
[time=3085] If you put your faith in the facts of who Jesus is and what he's already done, then the feelings become the caboose.
[time=3092] They just bring up the rear. They just follow along and they may sway and go back and forth and go up and down.
[time=3098] But it doesn't matter because they're not driving your life. The fact of who Jesus is drives your life and my faith is in that fact, not in how I feel.
[time=3108] Some of you today, somebody in this room, have been letting feelings drive your faith.
[time=3115] It hasn't been the caboose, it's been the engine. Today is the day to change that, to reverse that cycle and allow their facts of who Jesus is to drive you forward in your life.
[time=3126] In verses 10 and 11, he says that I may know him in the power of his resurrection and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death.
[time=3137] That by any means possible, I may attain the resurrection from the dead.
[time=3141] The last two things that I'll give you, number three, is the same power that raised Jesus from the dead, to know him in the power of his resurrection.
[time=3148] Think about that for a minute. If you don't feel adequate, if you don't feel strong enough, you have inside of you the same power that raised Jesus from the dead.
[time=3155] You live in that every day. Now, do you tap into that? I don't know. There are days that I do and there are days that I don't, but it's always the same.
[time=3166] It's always there, that same power. The last thing, verse 11, we share in his sufferings and that by any means possible, I may retain the resurrection from the dead.
[time=3176] That's the ultimate goal that we have eternal life. That's what Paul is talking about here. There's a lot of implications for this life, but to get there is the ultimate goal.
[time=3185] Next week, he talks about striving for that goal and that's where we'll pick up.
[time=3188] But the last, the fourth thing is this spiritual benefit of a life that's confident in a relationship is a life-altering relationship.
[time=3199] A life-altering relationship. I want to ask you close your eyes for just a moment and reflect on what that life-altering relationship means for you.
[time=3214] We did a lot of teaching stuff today. We looked at a lot of details of the culture and the context, but I hope that it tied to some of the things that maybe you've been confident in, that maybe your confidence should shift from.
[time=3228] Some of you are here and you know you have a relationship with Jesus. You've had that for quite some time, but you still realize that your confidence got shifted to some of the religious things in your life, to religious rituals, to national identity, to what I bring to the table to begin with.
[time=3245] Today God stirred something in you. I pray that right now you could just lay that at the foot of the cross and say, "I'm putting that stuff to death today in this moment.
[time=3256] I'm not going to be defined by anything to do with this world or by me at all. I'm going to be defined and consumed by Jesus and Jesus alone.
[time=3263] I'm going to be consumed by that relationship." And some of you are in the room and you would say, "If I were to die today, I don't know that I'd spend eternity with Jesus in heaven."
[time=3271] You would say that right now I need to know how I can shift from religion to relationship. I've known for a long time that my religion, what I bring to the table, is not going to get me anywhere when it comes to eternal life.
[time=3283] But today God stirred something in you and you say, "I need that relationship. Will you show me how?"
[time=3289] Here's what I'll tell you. I'm not even going to lead you in a prayer because I think your heart is screaming it.
[time=3295] Salvation doesn't happen by a prayer. Prayer is the way we talk to God. Salvation happens by the condition of your heart that turns to Him and says, "Jesus, you did die for me. You did raise from the dead. You are alive."
[time=3312] And this life that's been mine, I don't want it anymore. I give it to you. I lay it at your feet. My life is your life. I give you me.
[time=3320] That's salvation. When your heart is saying that, the scripture promises that you shall be saved.
[time=3328] Some of you are here and today is the day of salvation for you. It's time for you to take that step, that leap of faith.
[time=3334] Nobody's looking around right now if that's you. I want to give you just a moment to cry out to God.
[time=3339] He hears the cries of your heart. You can pray out loud. You can pray silently. It doesn't matter because he knows your heart right in this moment.
[time=3346] When you cry out to Him, if that's you and you say, "I need to acknowledge Him as my Savior." Do that right now.
[time=3351] Church is not about religion. That's been our focus today. And I don't know what God's been stirring inside of you, but today we've looked at a lot of different things.
[time=3363] We've looked at a lot of different components of what faith built on a relationship versus being built on religion, what that looks like.
[time=3371] And maybe you've seen some things today for the first time. Maybe God has stirred something new inside of you today.
[time=3377] And maybe you're that person that I was just referring to that it's time to truly build just like Paul did as we looked at Philippians 3.
[time=3384] Build your life on a relationship with Jesus, not on religion. Religion's all about what we bring to the table.
[time=3391] And I don't know about you, but I truly know in the depths of my heart that I bring nothing to the table when it comes to a relationship with God being right.
[time=3400] That's what Paul showed us through the word today, is that he went from a life that was confident in religion to a life that's confident in a relationship.
[time=3411] And if that's you, if today's that day where you need to take that leap of faith, I challenge you, don't wait any longer.
[time=3417] Take that step right now where you are. You don't need anybody to facilitate that. Your heart's already screaming it.
[time=3422] So don't hold back. Don't hold back any longer. Take that leap. And if you did, if you did that today, we've got a book that we want to get in your hands.
[time=3429] It's called beginning steps because when you make that shift from a life that's confident in religion to a life that's confident in relationships, it changes everything.
[time=3438] It's not an end. It's not just fire insurance that gives me assurance I can live in heaven when I die.
[time=3444] It's something that affects life in every way right now. So we want to get this book called beginning steps, a growth guide for new believers.
[time=3451] We want to get that into your hands. We will be more than honored to mail this to you. I'd love to give one to you in person here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=3457] But I want to challenge you. Don't hold back any longer from taking that next step in your journey of faith.
[time=3463] I want to show you that image that we've looked at again, this image of a train. Consider the train of your life like this image shows you where you see at the front is the facts of God's Word.
[time=3473] It's a fact that Jesus loves you. It's a fact that Jesus died on the cross for you. It's a fact that he is alive today.
[time=3480] We then put our faith in the facts of God's Word and then the feelings that are like this in life, they go up and they go down, they'll follow that.
[time=3488] I want to remind you of that and not to depend on the feelings when you feel like this really couldn't be this simple. It really couldn't be this real.
[time=3496] Just remember the facts of God's Word is what drives us forward. It's what drives your life and it's what will drive you into an eternal life that only Jesus can give you.
[time=3505] I hope you've been encouraged today. I hope that that does something inside of you that gives you a little bit of strength for this week.
[time=3510] That gives you a little bit of hope for future. That gives you a little bit of peace, a little bit of contentment and a little bit of joy.
[time=3517] Jesus, others and yourself, we even looked at today. A little bit of joy in your life that maybe wasn't there before you called us today.
[time=3524] So thank you for watching. I pray God will bless you as we move forward together. See you soon.
