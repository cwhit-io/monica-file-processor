[time=338] Connect with us every way that you can on those things.
[time=341] I want to plan a seat before I tell you a little bit about what to expect today as a part of this series.
[time=345] The next series we'll be digging into is going to be about one of my favorite characters in the Bible.
[time=350] His name is Elisha.
[time=351] And we're really going to be looking at how he had bold faith.
[time=354] And you know, in the uncertain times that we live in, it sometimes takes bold faith to live for Jesus
[time=360] the way that he has asked us to do, to live inside out, if you will, which is the current series that we're in.
[time=366] So I wanted to plant that seat about our upcoming series.
[time=368] But let me tell you about today, about inside out.
[time=371] We've talked about how church is not always what you think it is.
[time=374] Sometimes it's a lot different, it's a lot more than what we envision it to be.
[time=379] Some of you have been hurt by the church.
[time=381] Maybe why you're watching on television right now, because there's no way you're setting foot in a church building.
[time=386] You know, I could identify, I can relate, I could understand.
[time=389] But we're looking at in this series what the church could look like.
[time=392] And really even bigger than that, what would the world look like if the church functioned the way that Jesus intended?
[time=398] And so he intended for the church to live inside out.
[time=401] He wanted to build us inwardly so that we would outwardly change the whole world.
[time=406] And today we're looking at the goal of church.
[time=408] What is the goal of church to begin with?
[time=411] It really boils down to one thing.
[time=413] Paul talks about it in the book of Philippians and it's just eternity.
[time=416] It's just eternity.
[time=418] We want to see people's eternities change, not just this life.
[time=422] But the eternity that goes on so much longer than this speck that we call our own lives.
[time=428] Jesus can change every bit of that in you today.
[time=430] And I pray that he will do just that.
[time=432] And so we've given you some opportunities to engage with ministries, to live, if you will, inside out.
[time=438] And so as a part of our church and for you, we want to invite you in to participating in great ministries throughout Fort Wayne and around the world.
[time=445] And we featured three key ministries throughout this series.
[time=448] We started out looking at safe families.
[time=450] We then moved to City Life, an organization of youth for Christ.
[time=453] And then this week, and today you're going to hear about the Mission Church.
[time=457] It's really making an impact in the inner city of Fort Wayne in a lot of unique and special ways.
[time=462] And I can't wait for you to hear a little bit more about that. Thanks for watching today.

[time=937] - Of course, poverty and whatever brand of poverty you wanna talk about, but our focus is often and primarily on the children because we believe that if we can catch those kids when they're, before they get into the fifth grade we can actually bend the trajectory of their life.
[time=961] But if they get a little bit older and they kind of get set in a pattern of generational, multi-generational poverty it's hard to get them out of that. So we try to really focus on the children in whatever way that may be in their nutrition, their hygiene, just brushing their teeth and some of those things.
[time=985] - And Michael, I know that's gotta be especially poignant for you. Your kids were a big part of the reason you ended up here at the Mission Church. They're Black Hawk as of school. They've grown up here at the Mission Church.
[time=997] That has to really speak to you on a heart level. - Yeah, it was really our children that brought the connection. We were in a position of transitioning from a different church and we thought we would kind of do some church shopping. We usually hadn't done that before and Tim, I had met through a mutual friend and invited me to come down and talk about some work I'd been doing in South Africa and we went into this place on Pearl Street and the boys, so I spoke and after the boys I said well if we're looking for a church, what's wrong with this one? I said well there's lead paint on the walls and it's peeling off and it smells like mold and they're like yeah but Jesus is here and we're listening to our kids and we went oh and we never left.
[time=1037] - That is great. The Mission Church is bringing Jesus to Fort Wayne. It's a message everybody needs to hear no matter where you are and next week we're gonna talk more with Tim and Michael and find out about exactly what they're doing here in Fort Wayne to bring Jesus to people and exactly how we at Black Hawk can come alongside, partner with them and spread the gospel.
[time=1079] [MUSIC]
[time=1109] - Welcome to Black Hawk today. I hope you've already been
[time=1117] blessed. If you don't know me, my name is Kevin Pastor here and it's an honor to just share the word with you today. We're in a series of messages called Inside Out and so if you brought your Bibles, turn to Philippians chapter 3. Book of Philippians chapter 3. In our sixth week now of this series of 8 weeks and each week stands alone so if you've joined us now and this is your first time, I think you'll still get a blessing. I think God's still gonna meet you right where you are. I know he will as we listen to him today. I want to welcome everybody listening online as well. Our family is a lot bigger than just the room that we're in. So if you're watching us at home online television, thanks for watching and just being a part of everything God is doing at Black Hawk. God is just blessing us in a good looking crowd here too, right? Love it. Thank you for being here, being a part of today. So I want to talk today about how Church really has one goal. Church has one goal. You say, well, no, it has lots of goals but every goal really goes back to one thing. It's the one thing that Paul talks about in Philippians chapter 3, the end of Philippians 3 is where we'll be starting in verse 12 and that one goal is eternity.
[time=1181] Church is all about eternity. Let me ask you a question.
[time=1185] I know that Paul felt this way and so we've been looking in the book of Philippians and in case you didn't know about Philippians, he wrote that book, it was better to the church at Philippi while he was in prison.
[time=1197] So that's where Paul's writing from. Without in mind, I want to ask you, have you ever felt like giving up? I think every week something new comes along that challenges us to give up, that challenges us to just throw in the towel and say, I can't handle it anymore.
[time=1217] And I know in a room this size, there are people on all different ends of the spectrum. We like winning.
[time=1221] There's nothing much better than winning, but there's nothing much worse than losing.
[time=1225] Coming from an Atlanta sports fan, it's a good thing my significance and joy is not tied up in sports as an Atlanta sports fan sometimes. But I know in this room, a lot of you are at different places with that idea. A lot of you feel like giving up, a lot of you feel like you're a long way from giving up, but we all have those times, we all have those seasons. And so I can remember particularly a time in middle school. In middle school, I wanted to play basketball.
[time=1253] I really wanted to play basketball. I was mainly a baseball guy, but I decided I wanted to play basketball. I tried out for middle school. I was coming from a home school background.
[time=1261] I tried out, and I got cut from the team.
[time=1265] I just wanted to give up. Never do it again. But I had some people in my life that said, don't give up. Don't give up. And I want to show you, found this this week. This is a certificate of achievement for participating in middle school basketball at Heard County High School in Georgia. And you say, well, why would you bring that? Well, I decided this was one of the times in my life I didn't give up that I wanted to be on that team.
[time=1289] So I said, well, can I sweep the floors and just practice with the team?
[time=1293] I was determined. And you know, you say, well, wow, that's impressive. It was really just because I had a lot of people kicking me saying, go, don't quit. Don't quit. Keep moving.
[time=1301] Keep moving. And so I swept the floors during practice. And eventually they let me do a lot of drills. And then I started getting a little bit better. And so they started letting me practice a little bit more and a little bit more. And eventually, about halfway through the season, coach comes up to me, tosses me a jersey and says, put this on for the game today.
[time=1317] And you're going to go in. I scored two points the whole season.
[time=1321] But I scored two points that I wasn't supposed to score because I didn't give up.
[time=1325] Now, you know, here's the thing. A lot of times in my life, that story characterizes my spiritual journey where I wanted to give up, but I didn't, and I kept going. But let me tell you something. I think this might connect with somebody in the room today. There are just as many, probably a lot more stories where I didn't go sweep the floors spiritually.
[time=1345] Or I did just throw in the towel and say, God, this is all I've got. I'm just going to give up and leave this be. But God never left me every time I've done that.
[time=1353] You guys with me? He's always been there. Even when I'm faithless, he's faithful. Yet spiritually, there's a lot of times, a lot of seasons where we just want to throw in the towel. And you know, it's this goal of eternity that keeps us going. I know Paul understood this because think about Paul. When he's writing the book to this church, or this letter, to the church at Philippi, he has, at this point of his life, been following Jesus for around 30 years. That's a long time to be doing the kind of stuff that Paul had been doing. Planting churches, getting beaten, thrown in prison, seeing God do miracles.
[time=1389] So 30 years he's been serving this Jesus. And then all that's done for him really is getting him in prison. And he's in what's likely his fourth year of Roman confinement awaiting his sinice that he really knew in his heart of hearts would really end up in death. And it did.
[time=1409] But we've been saying this little phrase because Paul made a choice not to give up. Paul made a choice to stay focused on his goal. Paul made a choice to rejoice.
[time=1421] And so we've been saying this as a senior notes every single week, say it with me if you know it.
[time=1425] To rejoice is a choice.
[time=1429] Paul proved that to us. We can choose to rejoice no matter the circumstances in our life. And so we've looked a lot at the why, the why behind that statement.
[time=1441] Why is it that we can rejoice even as a choice, even when it makes no sense? Paul's shifting now in the latter part, the later parts here of the book of Philippians that we're looking at to the how and the when.
[time=1453] It's one thing to know the why. You know why you're here. You know what you're looking for.
[time=1457] And I know some of you have already given up on church and it's just a big deal just for you to walk through the doors today. I fully recognize that. I've been in those shoes where I just wanted to give up on ministry. I won't tell all those stories but I quit ministry twice. The first one was before I ever started when I said God the one thing I'll never do or be is a pastor like my dad. Here I am.
[time=1477] Be careful what you say to God. The second one was after I started and things really didn't go well. We brought in people of different skin colors to this youth group and some people just really didn't like that. It's why I love when I look around and see diversity in the room because it looks like heaven. It looks like the church was intended to look like the church. Philippi, I got started with different races, different religious backgrounds, the Philippian jailer, Lydia, the CEO, and then we had the slave girl. Every different background you could imagine, different races, different skin colors came together and that's why Paul is writing to the church at Philippi.
[time=1509] I'm glad God threw all that away but after I ran into people who felt the opposite I said see God? You ever said that? See God?
[time=1517] I told you. This is exactly why I said I would never go into ministry. I quit again but God kept pursuing me because he's faithful even when I'm faithless and it's because of this goal of eternity that we can truly have that kind of faith that the statement to rejoice is a choice becomes a reality in our life. Let me give you a statement that today's all about and you've heard me say it before and you'll hear me say it again is simply live in light of eternity. Live in light of eternity. Here's what that's going to do and we're going to look at Philippians 3 starting in verse 12 and I'm going to give you three areas that your life is going to be transformed within. Three things that living in light of eternity is going to transform your approach to in your life and I'll tell you what all three of them are. It's my past, it's my present and it's my future. Then I'll leave anything out.
[time=1569] It's my past, it's my present and it's my future and Paul walks us through that in this passage. For some of you it'll be a well-known passage but I think we miss some of the elements of application to our past and our present and our future within this passage. Let's look there together. The first thing is my past. Living in a lot of eternity is going to change my approach to my past, verses 12 and 13. Look there with me. Anybody ready for the word this morning? Starting in verse 12 I'll be reading from the English standard version. Same version as the Bibles in your seats. If you don't have one we welcome you to use that one. You could even take that one home if you don't have a Bible and so that's the version I'll be reading alone so you can follow along with me. Verse 12. Paul says not that I have already obtained this and we're going to go back to what this is in just a few minutes but it's this eternal life idea that he's been talking about. Not that I've already obtained this or am already perfect but I press on I don't give up. I press on to make it my own because Christ Jesus has made me his own brothers. I do not consider that I have made it my own but one thing I do for getting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead.
[time=1641] Paul's there. Let's talk about my past for a moment. I love this that Paul says because Paul you think about it. He's really at the varsity level of Christian faith. I mean isn't he's the apostle Paul. He wrote most of our New Testament. He's at the end of his journey.
[time=1657] He's in prison. He knows the end is in sight but he has held true to what God has asked him to do when he met Jesus on that road to Damascus and he blinded him and he changed his life. He's at the varsity level.
[time=1669] He's at the professional level if you will of Christianity.
[time=1673] We would all love to have the kind of faith. The kind of to rejoice is a choice mindset that Paul has had. Would we not yet?
[time=1681] Paul is reminding these people that he's writing to. Yes I know you think highly of me perhaps but you need to know that even though you think I've arrived I haven't arrived. Every day I wake up and I realize I don't have it yet. I haven't attained it. That's why he says that there. He's saying I don't have the ultimate goal accomplished yet but I'm getting there. Even talking through people's stories this week I've been so blessed to hear so many of your stories of what God is doing. One of the themes that's come up at least in three conversations I know I've had just this last week is gosh I just wake up pastor and I feel like I've got so far to go I've got so far to go and every time you know what my response was me too. Me too.
[time=1729] And you know what Paul's response is? Me too.
[time=1733] My brothers it's not that I've already attained this I have a long way to go but I can get there because Jesus has gotten a hold of me. I can attain it because Jesus attained me. Jesus purchased me and so Paul even though he's at that spot is still yearning for something more. You ever feel like it's a negative thing like you just wake up and you feel like something there's got to be something more in this life. There's got to be something more and you feel like well something must be wrong with me because I met Jesus a long while back but I still feel like there's something more. Something's got to be wrong with me and we associate it with a negative thing. Here's what I challenge you to do. Tie it to what Paul's talking about.
[time=1769] Tie it to this one goal of eternity and know that that yearning inside of you is something that's of God and from Jesus because you haven't yet arrived because he's not yet done with you. You may think your story has ended because of things in your past. Skeletons in your closet but God is just getting started just like he was with Paul even at this late varsity level season of his life and his Christian faith. So that yearning that's only inside of you harness that and ask God to fulfill it and to give you that next step in your life and he will do just that. Don't let your past hold you back from it.
[time=1805] Let me give you a couple of things here. Two parts of your past that I believe can really get you off track. One of them may surprise you a bit but before I tell you what they are, let me give you a statement. If you think you've had all of Jesus there is to have. I've been a church boy of church boys at times for sure. I knew the lingo I know the ends and the outs of the church. I've grown up in it.
[time=1829] My best experiences in life have been attached to the church. Some of my worst ones have too. I love the church. I love the church because it's eternal and it's gold last far beyond this life and there's a statement I heard recently that I think characterizes this idea I'm sharing with you about and it's this that since Jesus is infinite there will always be more of him to be had.
[time=1853] Since Jesus is infinite there will always be more of him to be had. Let me share a couple of things that can get you off track when it comes to your past.
[time=1861] The first one may surprise you. The first one is victories of the past.
[time=1865] Immediately go no I don't get off track because of victories.
[time=1869] I like those. I like when my team wins.
[time=1873] I like when I get the promotion. I like in the good old days have you ever heard that? In the good old days? Well back in the day but let me share something with you and I think this applies to a church setting as well because we're looking at being inside out and what does that mean?
[time=1889] Well we tend as a church to turn inwardly where Jesus wants to turn us inside out and turn us outward so that we change the world around us. That's the whole point of this series and that's what Philippians is all about but a lot of times in the church world we look back at the good old days and I think that's a good thing. It's a very scriptural thing to thank God for the victories of the past. Now that I've said that it's not a good thing to live so much in the past and to try to draw all the strength you need for today from what happened yesterday. I'm gonna say that again. It's not a good thing for us to try to draw all the strength we need for today from what happened yesterday. Sometimes we get caught up in the good old days and we say man if it could just be like it used to be or those kind of things in our life and I want to tell you that's a good thing but I think that God every day wants to far exceed the good old days and do something new and fresh today that will lead you into a new tomorrow that only he could do.
[time=1941] So sometimes the victories of the past can trip us up and we just live there and we never get out of the celebration of that. I'm not saying we don't celebrate.
[time=1949] I love that we celebrate. We look back every year we're gonna look back and see how many lives God's changed. How many people we've baptized. All those kind of things. Yes you do that but that is not what drives us to tomorrow. Tomorrow drives us to tomorrow because even though people's lives are changed every day in this place there are still hundreds thousands and millions of people who are outside of our walls who would say I gave up on church a long time ago that still need to hear the gospel and they need to hear the word of Jesus and he's not done with them yet.
[time=1981] So don't get tripped up by the good old days but number two the failures of your past. That's the one you expected, right? A couple of things that can get you off track as you're the victories of the past but also the failures of the past.
[time=1993] I want to ask you to do something tough with me for a minute. You ready?
[time=1997] I want to ask you to think of the worst skeleton in your closet. Don't write it down. Don't share it with anybody else around you. It's just you and Jesus. I won't know what it is either.
[time=2009] He's not passing it to me up here or something like that.
[time=2013] I've got plenty myself but I want you to think of some of those worst failures of your past. Some of them still haunt you today. Some of them you drug in like a ball and chain. Some of them have held you back for years and they still consume you.
[time=2033] I've got some good news for you today.
[time=2037] God has already won the victory over those skeletons.
[time=2041] He's not done with you. I don't care what they are and I know in your mind you're going, "Yeah but you don't understand it was this." Yeah, I don't. He does and he doesn't care. He's bigger than those things. He's bigger than the failures of your past. He already won the victory. A lot of times we feel like as a follower of Jesus we're having to fight for the victory.
[time=2061] I want you to know today you can fight from victory because he already won it.
[time=2065] And it's time to put that stuff in your past and let it be there.
[time=2069] Learn from it and grow from it but the way you learn from it and you grow from it is that you understand Jesus already won that battle.
[time=2077] And if you don't believe me I've got some examples. I love these.
[time=2081] And you know I want to tell you this statement. I was thinking about this before I shared these interviews that for us to say that the grace of Jesus is not enough for me and my failures is the same thing as taking the prideful approach of saying "I don't need the grace of Jesus." It's the same thing. That's a harsh statement but think about that for a minute. If I'm to say that well the grace of Jesus isn't good enough to cover my mistakes I'm saying the same thing as just looking at Jesus and saying "I don't need your grace. I don't want to be in that camp.
[time=2113] I don't want to be in that boat. I need the grace of Jesus." And here's what some of you came here today to hear me say.
[time=2121] The grace of Jesus is enough for you. His grace is sufficient even in your weaknesses. There's a lot of people that we associate with success and I want to read a few of these to you and I'm not going to tell you who they are until after I tell you about their failures. You might know some of them. Some of them might surprise you.
[time=2137] I'm going to give you four names here. This guy failed in business two times he was a nervous breakdown and was defeated in eight elections.
[time=2145] His name was Abraham Lincoln.
[time=2149] This group was turned down by a recording company who said we don't like their sound and guitar music is on the way out. It's the Beatles.
[time=2159] This guy was cut from his high school basketball team and reportedly went home, locked himself in his room and cried. Sounds like me didn't it?
[time=2167] He didn't give up either. His name is Michael Jordan.
[time=2171] This was probably my favorite one. This guy was fired from a newspaper because he "lacked imagination and had no original ideas.
[time=2179] Walt Disney." And then I love you compare those. Those don't even scratch the surface compared to the knuckleheads.
[time=2191] We know what that is in the North knuckleheads, right?
[time=2195] The knuckleheads that Jesus uses every single day and throughout scripture and even in our life today. But when you read the story of Jesus, look at the people he chose to use.
[time=2207] The people that had nothing to bring to the table. That's who God often uses the most. Flip with me to 1 Timothy if you will. Hold your place in Philippians but go to 1 Timothy.
[time=2215] Paul's at the top of that list. He was one of those knuckleheads, if you will. 1 Timothy chapter 1. Onary verses 12 through 17 to you because this is Paul's story about failures.
[time=2231] I love this about Paul because he is in so many ways the father of the church. God used him to plant the church that spread throughout the world. That's why church is unstoppable. We've looked at that in this series.
[time=2243] But I love this transparent picture that Paul gives us of his life and how he even feels like he doesn't deserve this Jesus that has called him that's changed his life.
[time=2255] Look at verse 12 of me, 1 Timothy 1. Paul says to Timothy, he says, "I thank him who has given me strength Christ Jesus our Lord because he judged me faithful, appointing me to his service. Though formally I was a blasphemer. I was a persecutor an insolent opponent but I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly and unbelief the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and the love that are in Christ Jesus. That saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am the foremost." He's saying, "I'm the biggest loser of them all." Verse 16, "But I received mercy for this reason that in me the foremost Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life, to the king of ages immortal, invisible, the only God be honor and glory forever and ever. And everybody said, "Amen." If you didn't believe me I just thought you should hear from Paul directly, that his grace is enough for you. And I want to show you a picture on the screen. Look at this.
[time=2335] This is a windshield. You had some of these this morning. There's a reason that in this picture the little mirror is smaller than the big window because in a car the rear view mirror is meant to glance at. It's a good thing to glance. You need to know what's behind you sometimes to know how to get where you're going. Can I get amen?
[time=2355] But the windshield is bigger for a reason. And I love this about Paul.
[time=2359] He wrote in 1 Timothy chapter 1. He's talking about the windshield of his life.
[time=2363] He did not deserve the windshield that Jesus had given to him because his rear view mirror showed him a lot of things that should have held him back.
[time=2371] But Jesus said, "I'm going to win the victory over those things." The dark things from his past did not darken his present and his future because he knew Jesus. The same thing can be true in your life.
[time=2383] Let's talk about the second thing. My present, verses 14 to 18.
[time=2387] Let's look there together. Go back to Philippians chapter 3. Let's look at verses 14 through 18 and we see Paul talk a little bit about his present.
[time=2395] As you find your place back there, I want to read verse 10. We already looked at this last week.
[time=2399] But this is really the goal, the goal. And it's this that Paul says, "My goal really at the end there of this last passage," verse 10 of chapter 3, "that I may know him in the power of his resurrection and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death." That by all means possible, I may attain the resurrection from the dead. That was the goal that Paul based his life on. That's that goal of eternity. Church has one goal.
[time=2423] That's the goal that Paul was pursuing. Look at verses 14 through 18 with me now and we'll see how Paul talks about his present. He says, "I press on again." The second time he said that.
[time=2435] Some of you need to press on, not give up. He says, "I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. Let those of us who are mature in the way." Any mature people in the room? Some of us need to boost in maturity today. And that's why we're here. And Paul's going to help us out with that.
[time=2455] Think this way. And if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal that to you also. I've found that out to be true. When I act immature, God chose me. I look in the mirror and go, "Good grief." You ever had those days? You look in the mirror and say, "Good grief." What am I doing? Who is that person staring back at me?
[time=2475] I've said this several times, but I'm always my biggest problem.
[time=2479] Everywhere I go I show up there and I bring all those same problems.
[time=2483] And God shows us what those are sometimes. We're going to come back to verse 16. I love verse 16.
[time=2487] It says, "Only let us hold true to what we have attained." We'll get back to there in a moment. Verse 17, "Brothers, join in imitating me keep your eyes on those who walk according to the example you have in us." A quick challenge there. You need to train people and you need to be trained by people. You should write that down if that's not happening in your life.
[time=2507] You need to train people and you need to be trained by people. That's what Paul said in verse 17.
[time=2511] A little side note for us there. Verse 18, "For many of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears walk as enemies to the cross of Christ." We'll look at why they're enemies in just a moment.
[time=2523] Let's talk about this idea of the present. He said, "I press on towards the goal." I want to talk about goals for a minute. I'm a big believer in setting goals.
[time=2531] I think they help you in life, every area of life. But here's one thing I found about myself.
[time=2535] A lot of times I will set goals in almost every area of my life except in my faith, except in my spiritual life.
[time=2543] You know, we'll set a goal. I want to lose this weight or I want to get this promotion or I want to change my company to look like this or I want my kids to do this or to do that and I want this and I want that. And we set these goals and they're good goals. Nothing wrong with those kind of things. But a lot of times the last goals that we set, if you're anything like me, are the goals that have to do with my faith.
[time=2563] And so I want to challenge you with a question. What spiritual goal? This is in your notes for a reason here today. What spiritual goal do you need to set today?
[time=2571] For some of you, it's the goal of baptism. You just saw two people follow Jesus in baptism today. And what a privilege that was to be a part of their story.
[time=2579] Some of you, that's the next goal that you need to set. I need to accomplish that. And guess what?
[time=2583] We're in the business of helping you with that. And we would love to walk with you.
[time=2587] And guess, to spend some time in prayer.
[time=2591] You know, it's been a long time maybe since you've even prayed. Other than the going down the road, God helped my day not go so bad. I've been guilty of those too.
[time=2599] Some of you, it may be to read scripture, to dive into the Word of God more.
[time=2603] There are apps everywhere that help with that in this day and time. I love that.
[time=2607] I love that about technology that every day we have ways to keep the Word of God right in front of our face. The Bible apps, the most used one out there today, one of the melee crews sent me one recently that I loved.
[time=2619] It's called read scripture. Read scripture. So thank you for that.
[time=2623] Great suggestion. Read scripture. It has great reading plans for the year. You can still jump on board. So here's the thing. What's your goal?
[time=2631] What is the spiritual goal that you need to set? My challenge to you is don't set it on Monday.
[time=2635] Set it today. Set it right now. You can even check out a few things I'm fixing to say if you need to.
[time=2639] You'd probably be worth it. I do have some more to say so don't totally check out.
[time=2643] Set your goal about your present. Look at verse 16 again.
[time=2647] Another thought for you in this passage about your present.
[time=2651] A lot of times in the church, especially if you've grown up in church, we always want some new revelation. I hope that preacher says something I haven't heard before today. I hope he has something new to tell me today.
[time=2663] I've said that and you know we do want that and a lot of times I may be able to provide that. A lot of times I want and I love verse 16 because I think a lot of times our desire for something new often trumps our need to just get back into the things that we've known most of our life. And that's what Paul is saying in verse 16. Look there again with me. Verse 16 he says only let us hold true to what we have attained.
[time=2687] I want to give you a thought with that. Your growth in truth.
[time=2691] That's what we're here to do. We want to grow in the truth of Jesus. Your growth in truth is inseparable from you growing in the truth you already know.
[time=2699] Your growth in truth in your present is inseparable from you growing in the truth you already know. A lot of times the most profound things that God wants to do in your life and in my life is going to come from your digging back into something that you've known most of your life but just neglected to dig into.
[time=2719] Like example maybe I need to read the Bible.
[time=2723] I'm not Mr. Legalism where if you don't read it I don't have a number of minutes you're supposed to read every day. I just know if God writes me a letter and says I wrote you a letter Kevin I probably should read that letter if I want my life to have any kind of impact on eternity. If I want to be right with God I should probably hear from him and I'm so glad that he has written you a letter and he has written me a letter and so that's really what I'm talking about in this regard as well and so hold true to the things you already know. So think about some things that you've known most of your life but maybe you've been neglecting. Maybe that spiritual goal might come from that.
[time=2759] A lot of times in the church world I feel like we become professional information gatherers but we lack a lot of times in becoming professional information implementers. Because in this world today in Christianity especially in the United States we don't have an information problem. There's a Bible study on right now media you can buy it from this store or that store. You can stream live from any place technology has given us every bit of information about Jesus known to man today and there's new stuff coming out all the time. We don't have an information problem in the church today. A lot of times we just simply have an implementation problem with that information that God has given us.
[time=2799] I know most of the time in my life that's what comes back for me. I'm just not implementing something that I already knew. Paul's anthem in this regard is really Jesus I don't want to know about you I want to know you. I don't want to know about you. I want to know you. Look at the third thing here with me verses 19 through 21 we've looked at how living in a lot of eternity is going to transform my approach to my past. My approach to my present but also my approach to my future. That's the third thing versus 19 through 21. Let's look there together. This takes us through the end of chapter 3. Starting in verse 19 he had just said people walk as enemies of the cross of Christ. Verse 19 he says their end is destruction. Their God is their belly. They glory in their shame. What does all that mean? Why is he talking about belly?
[time=2851] Sustaining things that we need from day to day where he's coming from but it really gets wrapped up here and it's really about this one goal of eternity. He says with minds set on earthly things. So minds set on earthly things equals end being destruction. That's what Paul's telling you in this sentence here. But I love verse 20 and verse 21 he says but but our citizenship is in heaven.
[time=2875] I'm glad I'm a citizen of heaven. I'm going to talk about that in a minute.
[time=2879] Our citizenship is in heaven and from it we await a savior the Lord Jesus Christ who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself. Then we get to chapter chapter 4. This is some rich stuff. I'm going to talk about your future and I want to give you a statement that I hope can just drive you this week.
[time=2903] I want to challenge you this week to be confident in this life because of the next. Be confident in this life because of the next. When we know what our future holds as followers of Jesus it changes everything.
[time=2919] I want to show you something. I saw a long time ago.
[time=2923] Let's pretend that this rope represents the timeline of your life. It's long and it's got a lot of stuff that happens in this timeline.
[time=2935] But here we are. But I want to tell you this rope is not just going to represent your life here on earth. It's going to represent eternity. And so here you are. So there's your timeline and I don't even think that does it justice. This stretches the length of this stage.
[time=2951] Here you are. There's a lot of tangles in it. There's a lot of bumps in it.
[time=2955] Things don't go as expected. But this red symbolizes your life here on earth.
[time=2959] Just to put things in a little bit of perspective for you. If this rope, this white represents the timeline of eternity. Your eternity and it would just keep going.
[time=2967] This end would keep going. That end would keep going. But just so you can see this is where you are. Some of you are right here in the middle.
[time=2975] Some of you are right here in the beginning. Some of you are right here.
[time=2979] Some of you today could be the last day that you have in this red stretch of your eternity.
[time=2987] It's a sobering thought but it's a true thought for us. And when I realize how long, how wide, how vast eternity is, what my future looks like. That's why this one goal of church is to live in light of eternity. Because really when I see this, I see how short how life here is just a speck of sand compared to eternity.
[time=3007] It changes how I live in this stretch. I can never live the same in this stretch again when I realize the white just keeps on going.
[time=3015] That God's just getting started. If we really got the depth of eternity, how would it change? Our finite little minds, some smaller than others. But if we truly could grasp the depth of eternity, how big it is, how would it change how you look at that bump in the road and that knot in your life that just trips you up and tangles you up and consumes you in your life. How would it change how we live in the red if we lived in a lot of eternity? If we understood that it's a lot bigger than what's right in front of me. That's the goal of church.
[time=3055] It's to help people dig into what eternity does to this.
[time=3059] It's why the church exists and I want to give you to tie things together here.
[time=3063] Three reasons, you can be confident.
[time=3067] Three reasons, you can be confident about your future.
[time=3071] First one, we see it in verse 20, is that our citizenship is in heaven.
[time=3075] The reality of heaven, write that down if you're taking notes. The reality of heaven can give you confidence for your future. Our citizenship is in heaven and in this world, a lot of times we get consumed by our citizenship being here in the United States or we get consumed with our citizenship in this community or that community or that organization. And I want to tell you, even in the political world that we live in with all the uprising, all of the division that exists in this world today, I think the church should be the most unified place on the planet because if you know Jesus hear me, you are not a person of the elephant. You're not a person of the donkey.
[time=3107] You're a person of the lamb. His name is Jesus and he throws all of those divisions away. It doesn't matter what political background you come from. It doesn't matter what socioeconomic background you come from. It doesn't matter how you've approached the life that you call this faith of yours in everyday life today. It doesn't matter because Jesus threw it all away so that you could be united and won and the church could be all about eternity together.
[time=3135] That'll change the red stretch of your life. That'll change how you view what my future really looks like. And I want you to know, Jesus told us this was going to come. Times of division, times of turmoil, times of trouble. John 15, he reminds us and says, the world hated me.
[time=3151] It's going to hate you too. He reminds us in John 16, one of my favorite verses is verse 33. "These things Jesus said, I've spoken to you so that in me you can have peace in the world you're going to have trouble but take heart because I have overcome the world." He's already won the victory. He's already won the battle. He's already won the victory over those things that are tripping you up and consuming you in your life right now. Second thing is the return of Jesus.
[time=3179] Paul says, "We await a savior." And if you didn't know, Jesus is not present physically right now, but he's coming back.
[time=3187] He's coming back. We await a savior who's going to walk us into eternity together. The third thing that you can have confidence in, so you've got the reality of heaven, the return of Jesus, the resurrection of believers is the third thing. Think about those that have gone for you. If they knew Jesus, the dead and cry shall rise.
[time=3207] We get confused about that a lot of times, but I want you to know that means their body is coming back. And that body, he says here, Paul says it. He says, "The lowly bodies we've had here, even there they're going to be raised, I'm going to do away with that. I'm going to transform it into a heavenly, glorious body like my own, and we're going to be forever reigning beside Jesus as his children. If that doesn't change your outlook on the future, nothing will." We have the reality of heaven, we have the return of a savior, Jesus who loves us, and the resurrection of believers.
[time=3239] I want to be in that camp. That's the group I want to be associated with, and that group will have that one goal of eternity at the forefront of our minds every single day.
[time=3251] I want to ask you just to close your eyes with me for a moment, just think about what that means.
[time=3255] If you know Jesus, how is it that you can live in light of eternity today? What spiritual goal do you need to set?
[time=3263] How has God encouraged you in this moment today?
[time=3267] If you don't know Jesus, I want to talk to you for a moment and tell you that your eternity can change right now.
[time=3275] I want to challenge you. Don't be distracted. Don't let anybody pull you away.
[time=3279] Don't let your mind go anywhere other than what eternity is all about in this moment because God loves you. Yes, you're a sinner. Yes, your past has things that make you in that same camp that I am and that Paul is where we don't deserve a savior. You're right, but Jesus already won the battle over that in your life.
[time=3299] That's where salvation comes from. It's not something that we can attain. It's not something that we can achieve. It's already been won. It's already been achieved by Jesus. So how do I accept Christ?
[time=3311] Churches say those kind of things a lot, but what does that mean? How do I give my life to Jesus?
[time=3315] How do I become a Christian? How do I get saved?
[time=3319] The church often says, what does that look like? Well, luckily for you Jesus spelled it out so beautifully and it's very simple and it's something that we often make so complicated and it looks something like this where we simply say Jesus, I don't deserve salvation at all.
[time=3339] I fall so short, but I know you died for me.
[time=3343] I'm so short you stood up.
[time=3347] And you died for me and you're alive and because you're alive I can live.
[time=3351] Jesus, I just want to give you me, not pieces of me, not the convenient parts of me. I want to give you all of me. That's salvation. When that's your heart, I'm not going to lead you in a prayer because some of you are already praying it from your heart.
[time=3363] It's about the condition of your heart. When you say Jesus, my life is no longer minus yours. That's salvation. Ownership transfers from you to him.
[time=3371] That's when he becomes the Lord of your life. He becomes the boss and it changes everything about your eternity.
[time=3379] If that's you today, I want to give you a moment to just simply step into that world and trust Jesus as your Savior. When you do that, all heads bowed, all eyes closed.
[time=3387] When you just pray, cry out to him in this moment.
[time=3391] So church has one goal and it's eternity.
[time=3395] And you know really that's our goal here at Black Hawk Ministries is eternity. My eternity. The eternity of all the people in the world.
[time=3403] That's why Jesus came. That's what he was all about. That's why he said I'm going to build my church and even the gates of hell can't prevail against it. That's why we're here.
[time=3411] That's why we exist. And I hope that as you have looked at eternity, as you've thought about the rope of your life and just the short span that maybe now you live in, we don't know where we're at in that span for coming to the end. If today's the last day we have, if we have a lot of days left, but ultimately it all boils down to what we're going to decide about Jesus. That's what eternity really boils down to. What am I going to do with Jesus? And maybe that question is challenged you right now in a new and unique way. And God's really stirred something inside of you. My challenge to you is to not wait any longer to take the leap of faith that maybe you've been putting off. Maybe you've been hurt by the church and people have pushed you away from Jesus, you would say. Maybe mistakes that you have made. You know, things from your past, the failures of your past, or maybe it's even the victories of the past as we've looked at today that have kept you from jumping into your future. We've looked at your past. We've looked at your present.
[time=3463] We've looked at your future today and your eternity is all encased in those pieces and what you decide to do with Jesus right now. Don't hold back anymore.
[time=3471] Let Jesus have your life. Don't just hold bits and pieces back. Give him all of it. Say Jesus, all of me belongs to you. That's what salvation is all about. And if you've taken that step, let me talk a lot about this book and I believe in it because it just gives you something that's next. It gives you a next step. It's beginning steps. And we say beginning steps because it's really not about an end. A lot of people look at a salvation decision as being something that ends something in life, but it really just begins a new life, a new eternity for you. We want to get one of these books into your hands. And we'll be glad to mail it to you. We'll be glad to connect with you. However, you're going to have some information on your screen as to how you can reach out to us.
[time=3511] Let us know how we can get one of these in your hands. But more than that, let us know what God's done in your life. We want to hear your story because your story matters to us.
[time=3519] That's the point of all the eternities that we've seen God change here at Black Talk Ministries. We're just His tool. We're just someone that's here to be here for people like you as you walk on that journey. So allow us to walk with you as we move forward in the days ahead. And as you look at eternity, as you think about what you're going to do with Jesus, you live in the middle part of that message. We've just shared the present.
[time=3539] What are you going to do in the present that's going to impact your future and your eternity? And all of that in your past that maybe has held you back can be washed away today in this moment. Pray that's been an encouragement to you.
[time=3551] Pray, it's been a blessing to you. And I pray that God does something new in your life that He stirs something fresh, that you're recharged, that you're energized, you're inspired to go out and live inside out along with us here at Black Talk Ministries. See you soon.
