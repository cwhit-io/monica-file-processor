[time=240] Thank you so much for watching this today, I know that you're in for a challenge, you're in for a treat, you're in for a blessing, why?
[time=249] Because God is for you, because God wants to do something in your life today as we worship together and as we hear from God's Word.
[time=256] You're gonna get to hear from Rick Raber today, and I know the word that he has for you, from God, from his Word, is gonna challenge you like never before.
[time=264] I want to thank you for watching the Bible Hour, we exist to spread the Word of Jesus here locally and all around the world, so thank you for being a part of that today.
[time=273] There's lots of ways that you can connect with us and we want to share those with you so you can stay in touch.
[time=278] One of my favorite ways you can connect is through our church app.
[time=281] You can go to your app store and simply search for the Black Hawk Church app, and as you find that there are gonna be sermon notes, there are gonna be upcoming events, there's prayer requests, places where you can know you will be prayed for, if you've got something on your heart.
[time=293] Something that's happening in your life perhaps, that we can pray with you about.
[time=298] Lots of other things that you can do to stay connected with us here at Black Hawk Ministry, so I encourage you to find us there.
[time=303] You can also search for us on Facebook, you can look at the Bible Hour, search for the Bible Hour on Facebook, or for Black Hawk Ministries, and you can find us there.
[time=312] At Be Hawk Ministries, you can help you find us on Instagram and on Twitter, so find us through some of those venues and stay connected with us as we keep going through this together.
[time=321] I want to talk to you for a minute about this series, Inside Out.
[time=324] It's been such an amazing journey through the Book of Philippians.
[time=328] It's one of my favorite books in all the Bible, one of the best books about joy and all of scripture, because we haven't written to us from the Apostle Paul who's writing it from prison in one of the lowest points of his life.
[time=341] That may be where you're at today, you may be able to identify with Paul, but it's in those moments that we learn what the joy of Jesus can truly do, what it can truly look like.
[time=350] We're going to continue that journey as we look at Philippians chapter 4 today, but I particularly want to challenge you to be back with us next week as well, because I will be here wrapping up this series.
[time=360] We'll be at the end of chapter 4 of Philippians, and we're going to be talking about how church is a team sport.
[time=365] Now, each week we've helped you look at some different ways you can connect with the community of Fort Wayne and around the world through some of our partnerships.
[time=373] We've featured different ones every single week, and we're going to have every single ministry that we've talked about, plus a few others here with us next week, and you're going to hear of ways you, even our viewers, no matter how you're connecting with us through technology or at home, you can connect and be a part of all these efforts as well.
[time=390] So we're going to connect with a community. We're going to make a difference in the world around us. After all, that's what Inside Out is all about. It's about the church building up inwardly so that we turn outwardly.
[time=401] The natural tendency for a church and really for people is to turn inward, protect what I have, but Jesus said, "I want to build my church inwardly so that outwardly the world is changed forever."
[time=411] And so next week we're going to bring all of those things together and give you opportunities to plug into your community, just to make a difference, to help Jesus be made famous in Fort Wayne and around the world.
[time=421] So thank you so much for watching today. Pray your blessed today. Make sure you're back next week as we close this thing out. Talk to you soon.

[time=662] (gentle music)
[time=677] - This morning, we're continuing our Inside Out series by looking at another mission here in Fort Wayne doing great work, and it is the Mission Church.
[time=687] And joining me right now to talk about what's going on here at Fort Wayne, Tim Stauffer and Michael Brown, the co-pastors of the Mission Church.
[time=696] Tim, this is a church that's existed in Fort Wayne for a long time.
[time=701] Give us a little bit of the background, the history here that has brought the Mission Church to where it is.
[time=706] - Sure.
[time=707] So there was this couple back in 1948 named Amos and Elizabeth Zehr, and they have some connection with Blackhawk, and some of their families still involved in the school and in the church.
[time=722] But Amos and Elizabeth were working at the Rescue Mission and that just became something that grew more and more and more.
[time=731] It was something in their hearts to go help those that were at the Rescue Mission.
[time=735] It was mostly men at that time.
[time=738] In 1948, they asked permission.
[time=740] Since there isn't a church here, where do these guys go to church?
[time=743] And they said, "Well, if you want to do one, you go ahead and do it." And so they did.
[time=748] They started Mission Church in 1948.
[time=751] Inside the Rescue Mission, when it was down at the end of Superior Street, where the Three Rivers Apartments stand right now.
[time=759] And they continued in that until they turned 90 years old.
[time=765] And in 2001, they came and asked my wife and I if we would
[time=771] help them because at 90 years old, they didn't think they could do it anymore.
[time=775] And so we said, "Well, we'll come and visit." And we did.
[time=780] And Amos, we walked in that morning.
[time=782] I took my guitar, said we'd sing a couple songs, but when we walked in, he took his old King James Bible and thumped it on my chest and said, "You're preaching and he went and sat down." And we've been here since.
[time=794] You never know what God has in store for you.
[time=796] You never know.
[time=797] And then a few years later, Michael and Kim came and joined
[time=804] us and became co-pastors with us at Mission Church.
[time=809] And so that's where we are today.
[time=811] And you've changed locations a couple of times.
[time=813] You're now on Cass Street, but Michael, the mission, no pun intended, the heart of this place has continued throughout that whole journey.
[time=823] Tell us about the heart of this place right now.
[time=826] Really the way I like to give the elevator speeches that we're about with what God has given us, helping break the cycle of intergenerational poverty.
[time=837] And poverty is obviously spiritual, but it manifests itself in the inner city financially and emotionally in a lot of other ways.
[time=845] And so we are trying to engage people where they're at in very, very practical ways to teach them who Jesus is.
[time=853] One thing I think that sometimes we can get into a bubble being in Black Hawk, being in Northeast Fort Wayne, and we maybe don't fully realize or remember all the struggles going on in other parts of the city.
[time=867] What are some of the things that you guys see on a regular basis with the people that are coming to the Mission Church?
[time=875] Well, of course, poverty and whatever brand of poverty you want to talk about, but our focus is often and primarily on the children.
[time=887] Because we believe that if we can catch those kids when they're, before they get into the fifth grade, we can actually bend the trajectory of their life.
[time=898] But if they get a little bit older and they kind of get set in a pattern of intergenerational, multi-generational poverty, it's hard to get them out of that.
[time=909] So we try to really focus on the children in whatever way that may be in their nutrition, their hygiene, just brushing their teeth and some of those things.
[time=922] And Michael, I know that's got to be especially poignant for you.
[time=925] Your kids were a big part of the reason you ended up here at the Mission Church.
[time=929] They're Black Hawk kids in terms of school.
[time=932] They've grown up here at the Mission Church.
[time=935] That has to really speak to you on a heart level.
[time=938] Yeah, it was really our children that brought the connection.
[time=942] We were in a position of transitioning from a different church.
[time=946] And we thought we would kind of do some church shopping.
[time=949] You know, we usually hadn't done that before.
[time=951] And Tim, I had met through a mutual friend and invited me to come down and talk about some work I had been doing in South Africa.
[time=957] And we went into this place on Pearl Street.
[time=959] And, you know, the boys, as I spoke and afterwards the boys said, "Well, if we're looking for a church, what's wrong with this one?" I said, "Well, there's lead paint on the walls and it's peeling off and it smells like mold." And they're like, "Yeah, but Jesus is here." And we listened to our kids and went, "Oh, and we never left." That is great.
[time=977] The Mission Church is bringing Jesus to Fort Wayne.
[time=980] It's a message everybody needs to hear no matter where you are.
[time=984] And next week, we're going to talk more with Tim and Michael and find out about exactly what they're doing here in Fort Wayne to bring Jesus to people and exactly how we at Black Hawk can come alongside, partner with them, and spread the gospel.
[time=1000] Well, good morning.
[time=1002] My name is Rick Raber.
[time=1004] Welcome to Black Hawk.
[time=1006] I am one of our elders here.
[time=1007] And if you came this morning expecting to hear a message from our incredible new pastor, sorry, you get me, we thank you.
[time=1021] Thank you.
[time=1022] Thank you for that.
[time=1024] Kevin and Jessica and Caleb and Callie are actually getting an opportunity to spend some time with family down in between here in Georgia.
[time=1033] They're getting an opportunity to do that.
[time=1036] Today, we're nearing the end of a series that we've been in for the last several weeks called Inside Out.
[time=1042] Inside Out and the focus of us turning from this inside, focused on the church and putting that focus outside the walls of this building and looking at the body of Christ being the church in the community.
[time=1059] That's really what we've been focused on.
[time=1062] As part of that, we've talked about the church being unstoppable, that the church has a purpose and it's unstoppable, that it's not about religion, but it's about relationships.
[time=1074] It's about humility and considering others better than yourself.
[time=1079] Last week, we covered the church's one goal.
[time=1083] The one goal of the church is eternity.
[time=1091] And a view of heaven and an eternity impacts our present, our past, present and future.
[time=1099] That's the reality.
[time=1101] Today, we're in Philippians 4.
[time=1103] And I want you to ask you for just a moment to think with me how each you individually became to be aware of the person of Jesus.
[time=1115] I want you to picture that face.
[time=1118] If you want to close your eyes and picture that face, it might have been a mom.
[time=1123] It might have been a family member.
[time=1125] It might have been a cousin.
[time=1126] It might have been a co-worker.
[time=1130] Think about that person that was integral in you becoming aware of who the person of Jesus was, okay?
[time=1138] And today, we're going to do something instead of a hair-raising day, we're actually going to have a hand-raising day several times today, okay?
[time=1146] And I actually would like you to raise your hand, okay?
[time=1149] Right now, if that person that you just pictured was not a pastor,
[time=1157] okay?
[time=1158] If that person was not a pastor, they were a friend.
[time=1160] They were a co-worker.
[time=1161] They were a family member.
[time=1162] They were a cousin and an aunt or uncle.
[time=1164] I want you to raise your hand up high.
[time=1168] Look at that.
[time=1170] The number of people in the room.
[time=1172] And I just want to be really clear.
[time=1175] This isn't about an elder blast on the pastor.
[time=1178] All he's not here to defend himself.
[time=1180] This is about you understanding that each one of you in your pew has an opportunity, has an incredible opportunity to be
[time=1191] Jesus and represent Jesus to somebody.
[time=1195] The number one thing that I get when I ask people that question
[time=1201] isn't about how perfect that person was.
[time=1206] It's never about that.
[time=1208] It's not about how perfect or how great they were.
[time=1212] It's about how they love Jesus and they cared about whether I love Jesus or not.
[time=1218] That's what we're talking about today.
[time=1222] When we love Jesus and desire for those we encounter to have their eternity changed by a personal relationship with Jesus, we become conscious of what it means to be turned inside out.
[time=1239] We become very conscious of that.
[time=1242] Today's bottom line is we talk about the church multiplying through mature people.
[time=1249] The church multiplies through maturity.
[time=1252] Today's bottom line is a mature Christ follower is a Jesus compass.
[time=1258] I know you may not have heard it said quite that way before, but a mature Christ follower is a Jesus compass.
[time=1266] They're that thing, that point.
[time=1268] They're not the destination.
[time=1270] It's the tool that allows you to get to the destination and become aware of who the person of Jesus is.
[time=1278] And we can all be. We can absolutely be.
[time=1282] You can be a Jesus compass.
[time=1287] Just as it is completely normal for a magnet to be drawn to
[time=1293] steel or a moth to a flame, it's the same for a compass to be
[time=1300] pointed towards true north.
[time=1303] I won't ask you to raise your hands if you know or point to this direction is true north from the sanctuary today because I'm sure there's some directionally challenged in the room.
[time=1313] In the same way that those devices work, it is completely normal.
[time=1318] It's completely normal for people to be drawn to and attracted to Jesus Christ.
[time=1325] If they are given an accurate example of who he is, an accurate picture of him.
[time=1333] The incredibly cool implication of this is that if we strive to live for Jesus and accurately walk and talk about who he truly was, then we can expect in faith to watch people come to Jesus.
[time=1346] You can expect people to be drawn to him not be drawn to you, not to be drawn to you in spite of you.
[time=1354] They get to find out who Jesus is.
[time=1360] Like a compass points to true north.
[time=1363] We are living examples pointing to Jesus.
[time=1367] Open your Bibles and join me in Philippians 4.
[time=1370] If you don't have one, there are Bibles there in the pew in front of you, pew rack, please feel to take one.
[time=1376] Take one, please, the free, we want you to have it.
[time=1379] If you want to grab that, it's page 571 in your pew Bible.
[time=1386] Let's look at Philippians 4, 1 through 9 in some of these traits.
[time=1392] Therefore, my brothers, whom I love and I long for, my joy and my crown, stand firm with us in the Lord, my beloved.
[time=1402] I entreat you, Odea, and I entreat soon tikai.
[time=1407] To agree in the Lord, yes, I also ask you true companion.
[time=1412] Help these women who have labored side by side with me for the gospel, together with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are written in the book of life.
[time=1424] Rejoice in the Lord always.
[time=1426] I will say it again.
[time=1428] Rejoice.
[time=1429] Let your reasonableness be known to everyone.
[time=1436] The Lord is at hand, do not be anxious about anything but in
[time=1444] everything.
[time=1445] By prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your request be made known to God.
[time=1453] And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will
[time=1459] guard, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.
[time=1465] Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is non-operable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever
[time=1475] is commendable.
[time=1477] If there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.
[time=1487] Whatever you have learned and received and heard and seen in
[time=1493] me, practice these things.
[time=1499] And the God of peace will be with you.
[time=1501] Pray with me.
[time=1502] Heavenly Father, today, we beg you.
[time=1508] We beg you that your word would be powered by the Holy Spirit today.
[time=1512] Your word says that it won't return void.
[time=1516] God, there is an old song that we sang in my church as a kid.
[time=1522] Spirit of the living God, fall fresh on us today.
[time=1532] Melt me, mess me up.
[time=1535] Melt everybody today in your way.
[time=1541] Mold us back into what you want us to be.
[time=1544] Fill us with your spirit and then use us, God.
[time=1548] Please, God, use your word.
[time=1552] Get me out of the way.
[time=1555] And may people be lifted toward you, Jesus, today.
[time=1559] And your name be lifted high.
[time=1561] [AMEN] Well, let's look at some of the traits that are typical and fall into the category of this person that we would call a Jesus compass.
[time=1575] That has a great desire for redemptive relationships.
[time=1580] Verse chapter four, verse one.
[time=1582] Therefore, some of you have been around church long enough that whenever, therefore, as mentioned, you immediately have learned to go find what the therefore is, therefore.
[time=1594] Well, this is all about pointing back to what Kevin covered last week.
[time=1598] It's about covering and understanding that in view of eternity.
[time=1604] In view of the messed up world in which we live.
[time=1610] In view of the messed up world in which we live, we have to be reminded that our citizenship is where?
[time=1618] Yeah, in heaven.
[time=1621] We don't live here.
[time=1623] We are aliens and strangers here.
[time=1626] This is just remember the red spot on the rope?
[time=1629] This is just a slice.
[time=1634] That's the context.
[time=1638] Last week we read that in this world, the end of is destruction.
[time=1643] Their God is their belly.
[time=1646] They glory in their shame with minds set on earthly things.
[time=1652] The reminder that we live in a world whose God is their own gratification.
[time=1660] That's our world, right?
[time=1664] Gratification, now I want it and I want it now.
[time=1671] They find glory in shameful actions, but our citizenship is heaven.
[time=1677] Paul says in light of this truth, your citizenship should affect the way that you love, the people that you encounter.
[time=1686] He says, "My brothers whom I love and long for."
[time=1693] And again, he says right at the end of verse 1, "Beloved." You're catching this?
[time=1699] These people weren't casual acquaintances for Paul.
[time=1704] He loved them.
[time=1707] Who I love and long for.
[time=1709] That long for phrase is the phrase of the ache.
[time=1715] It's the phrase of the ache that happens when you're distant from somebody
[time=1721] that you long to be with.
[time=1724] Most of us have been there.
[time=1726] That's what he's talking about.
[time=1728] Those who I love and long for, they weren't casual.
[time=1734] Remember, Paul couldn't be with him.
[time=1736] He was in prison.
[time=1740] He was in prison, and that was a big deal.
[time=1747] Paul was a spiritual influence for them.
[time=1749] He was their spiritual coach, if you will.
[time=1752] He says, "In the middle of the world that is full of things contrary to Christ,
[time=1758] stand firm." That is a military term.
[time=1766] That is a present, active thing saying, "Do it now." And I can't give you a better illustration than the rotation that happened out in the lobby
[time=1777] of the officers that stood guard by that casket.
[time=1782] That was their task.
[time=1784] Stand firm.
[time=1786] Clear.
[time=1787] Do it now.
[time=1789] In light of everything else that's going on in your life, stand firm.
[time=1793] Do it now.
[time=1794] It's a command.
[time=1795] It's imperative.
[time=1796] Stand firm.
[time=1797] Hold your ground.
[time=1800] Because there will be things that toss you and shake up your world and take you to places that you didn't plan to go, as Darren already said so well, the interruptions of life.
[time=1813] The first trait of one who is a Jesus compass is your first bullet.
[time=1819] They have an eternal perspective that leads to stable living.
[time=1829] They are able to stay the course and live as Ephesians 4, 14, and 15 describes so that we are no longer children, tossed about to and fro by the waves,
[time=1840] and carried around by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning,
[time=1846] by craftiness in the enemy's deceitful schemes.
[time=1849] Rather speaking the truth of love, we are to grow up in every way into him.
[time=1855] Who is the head that's Jesus?
[time=1859] To live with an eternal heavenly perspective leads to a stable life.
[time=1863] They are solid examples, not perfect, solid examples that you can pattern your life
[time=1870] with and alongside.
[time=1875] The one goal of the church, like we said last week, is eternity, and it leads to stability in your daily lives.
[time=1882] The second trait of one who is a Jesus compass is from verses two and three.
[time=1890] I entreat you, Odea, and I entreat soon to K, to agree in the Lord.
[time=1897] Yes, I also ask you, true companion, help these women who have labored side by side
[time=1903] with me and the gospel together with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the book of life.
[time=1913] You heard that right? These two ladies, there were two women clearly not getting along.
[time=1921] Got that? And they were in the church.
[time=1926] They were in a church, and they were clearly getting along, not getting along enough.
[time=1932] They were clearly not getting along enough that Paul thought it was appropriate
[time=1938] to call them out by name in a letter that was going to be sent and distributed.
[time=1946] You understand it was a big deal.
[time=1951] It was a big deal. He doesn't say that they weren't Christ followers.
[time=1957] He said they were the partners in the gospel with him.
[time=1962] But he calls many would believe that this true companion is probably a proper name, but he's probably an elder in the church. And Paul says, "Hey, get these two on the same page.
[time=1976] It's causing problems in the body of Christ." Think about that. How much would you like your name read from the pulpit
[time=1989] as being in disagreement with a brother or sister?
[time=1994] Paul made unity in the body better that much.
[time=1999] He made unity in the body of Christ matter that much that he mentioned people by name.
[time=2008] It matters that much.
[time=2014] The second trait of a Jesus compass person is that bullet.
[time=2019] Maturity leads others towards being like-minded.
[time=2024] You know what? I know that you're going to be surprised, but not everybody in the church thinks the same way.
[time=2035] Really? Mark Ripley thinks different than I do.
[time=2040] Wow. Ty Edwards thinks different than I do.
[time=2045] That doesn't mean that it's not about conformity.
[time=2050] It's not about conformity. It's not about everybody looking the same.
[time=2056] It's a call to harmony.
[time=2059] And I know Darren and a lot of the musicians in the room have a whole lot more appreciation than many of us for what harmony really means.
[time=2068] Please allow me to give you just a simple definition for harmony.
[time=2073] It's another bullet for you there.
[time=2075] Harmony equals different parts.
[time=2078] Harmony is different parts producing pleasing results.
[time=2086] Different parts, not all the same.
[time=2091] Just the same way that we had these over here and these up here and the instruments up there.
[time=2098] They weren't playing their own- they weren't playing their own gig.
[time=2103] They had a common purpose.
[time=2106] It's not all the same, but producing a result that's pleasing to God.
[time=2111] These two ladies had an issue and they didn't agree and guess what?
[time=2116] Any guesses what they probably did?
[time=2121] Probably like many in the body and people do today.
[time=2128] Talk to somebody else about it rather than the person that they have the difficulty with.
[time=2136] And all of a sudden you had factions that were formed and people were taken up teams.
[time=2141] Could that be possible?
[time=2144] Would that happen with people?
[time=2147] You've heard Kevin say it from here.
[time=2149] Some of you have experienced the most painful things in your life have been associated with church.
[time=2156] That's why we want to turn the church inside out.
[time=2159] I took a class in seminary that was about the abuses in life and there was literally two weeks.
[time=2168] Two weeks that we spent on abuse in the church.
[time=2175] What's wrong with that?
[time=2182] It was such a big deal.
[time=2192] We don't all see church the same way.
[time=2195] It's okay.
[time=2196] Unity does not mean we're all the same.
[time=2200] It means we are unified around a kingdom purpose.
[time=2206] That's your next bullet.
[time=2208] We're unified around a kingdom purpose and the purpose is greatly represented in John 17
[time=2215] where Jesus called his high priestly prayer.
[time=2219] He says he's praying that they made perfectly one that we may be one like he is one with the father.
[time=2227] There's a phrase in there.
[time=2229] So that the world may know.
[time=2234] I will tell you this, there is nobody that said among the thousand plus people in this place yesterday
[time=2243] that can walk away with excuse for not knowing what the gospel of Jesus Christ was.
[time=2249] Our pastor proclaimed clearly to police officers, to firemen, to people from all over, all walks of life
[time=2257] and stood here, I can tell you that yesterday it was made clear that the world may know
[time=2268] that he was sent.
[time=2270] Jesus was sent so that you might be saved, so that you and I can live a life that's different.
[time=2281] Church is a team sport.
[time=2282] It's not about your agenda.
[time=2285] You understand that?
[time=2287] It's not about Rick's agenda, Kevin's agenda, Rich's agenda, the Elder's agenda, it's about Jesus' agenda.
[time=2295] It's about Jesus' agenda, it's not about what your ideas are.
[time=2302] It's a team sport.
[time=2306] I'm praying right now that nobody in the room has an active issue with a brother or sister.
[time=2319] Either here in our body or the greater body of Christ or in your family
[time=2325] that's led you to avoid them, that's led you to not look them in the eye and say I'm sorry,
[time=2338] that you're just not playing in harmony, producing, pleasing things for God in that relationship.
[time=2349] Romans 12, 18 says, "As long as it depends, as much as it depends on you, live at peace with all."
[time=2359] Matthew 5 goes a little bit higher, higher standard.
[time=2364] I just want to read it.
[time=2365] Matthew 5, 21 to 24.
[time=2368] I love how Jesus says in the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=2371] You have heard it said, but I say.
[time=2375] You've heard it said, but I say, listen what he says here.
[time=2378] You've heard it said from those of old, you should not murder and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.
[time=2386] But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment of all as well.
[time=2394] Whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council and whoever says you fool.
[time=2401] You fool, I'll tell you a word that comes out of my mouth too easy.
[time=2409] Wow, idiot.
[time=2413] I'm sorry.
[time=2416] I can say that.
[time=2419] And it's not always because somebody did something really bad.
[time=2422] It's just because it's too easy to say.
[time=2426] Whoever says you fool will be liable of hellfire.
[time=2431] So if you're offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you.
[time=2439] Notice the verbiage is that your brother has something against you, not that you have something against your brother.
[time=2447] Notice that they have something against you, you are supposed to leave your gift.
[time=2454] Stop.
[time=2455] Go take care of it, get the business taken care of, be reconciled, and then come back.
[time=2463] Unity matters that much.
[time=2471] And the body of Christ is more important than you being right or getting your own way.
[time=2479] Paul says it in 1 Corinthians 6.
[time=2482] Rather than end up before someone to settle your issue between you and your person, why not rather suffer wrong?
[time=2494] That's how he says it. Why not rather be defrauded?
[time=2503] Unity matters that much, even if it costs you, even if it costs you to say, this is fun.
[time=2511] Do you remember this?
[time=2513] Some of you are old enough to remember the fawns and he couldn't say the phrase, "I was wrong."
[time=2523] Right?
[time=2524] So you have some of you are old enough and gray here like me that you remember that.
[time=2528] I was wrong.
[time=2532] And even if it wasn't about being wrong, pursue unity so that you don't matter who's wrong,
[time=2540] that you're restored to a right relationship.
[time=2547] The body of Christ matters more than you.
[time=2552] Your individuality makes up this whole body.
[time=2555] And when you're at odds with somebody else, it affects more than the two of you.
[time=2561] That's a biblical principle.
[time=2563] And it matters.
[time=2564] We need to live in unity.
[time=2567] It matters more than just you.
[time=2570] People that are encompassed for Jesus point others to being like-minded and in harmony.
[time=2575] I find it really interesting that as soon as he gets done addressing difficulty between
[time=2583] people in the church, that his next verse is, "Rejoice.
[time=2590] Rejoice." Huh.
[time=2593] I will say it again, "Rejoice." Think about this.
[time=2600] How often is your lack of joy in life associated with people?
[time=2617] Their presence causing you problems.
[time=2623] Leaving voids.
[time=2625] Their treatment of you leaving you raw and hurting.
[time=2630] It's really often that we are.
[time=2635] They were called to rejoice in the midst of difficulty.
[time=2641] We've said it every week in this series, "To Rejoice." Let's try it again.
[time=2648] To rejoice is a choice.
[time=2653] And the ability, your next bullet, to rejoice is a choice.
[time=2657] And the ability for rejoicing always comes from the spirit.
[time=2662] Rejoicing is a spirit fruit.
[time=2666] It's fruit from being connected to the Jesus tree.
[time=2669] The next traits in our list are for a person who is mature and being a compass related to
[time=2677] anxiety and prayerful dependence.
[time=2685] Jesus being in your life bears fruit.
[time=2692] Fruit that's different than the flesh of Rick.
[time=2697] You don't get the kind of joy that the world thinks is joy from yourself.
[time=2703] It comes from the Holy Spirit.
[time=2706] The Lord is at hand, verse 6 says, "Do not be anxious about what?" Anything.
[time=2713] Just for the record, the Greek word means anything.
[time=2720] Anything.
[time=2722] There is nothing that qualifies for the column of anxiety.
[time=2728] Nothing.
[time=2730] Be anxious for nothing.
[time=2734] But right behind that he says, "In everything."
[time=2742] Anxiety, nothing fits in that category.
[time=2746] Prayer, dependence on God, a capable God who's able to provide all that you need.
[time=2753] What goes in that category?
[time=2756] Everything.
[time=2757] Say it again, everything, everything.
[time=2765] Your next bullet, and this is hard for some people.
[time=2769] Anxiety, fear, and trust in God can't coexist.
[time=2780] Anxiety and fear are issues for many.
[time=2783] They have deep roots in questions like, "What could happen?" Or, "What might happen?" Or, "The lovely, what if?" "What if?" Paul preffices that, "Don't be anxious with the Lord as at hand." It means the Lord is near.
[time=2800] He's not far away.
[time=2806] So the question is, "Do you have more faith in your ability to contemplate
[time=2812] all the things that could or might happen in life?"
[time=2820] Or, "In Jesus, who is near?" Then to chapter three, Jesus is detailed as having the power that enables him
[time=2830] to even subject all things to himself.
[time=2834] There's nothing that he does not have power over.
[time=2841] If you truly believe in an all-powerful, in-control God, Matthew 6, 8, he even says, "He knows what you need before you ask."
[time=2852] Trusting in God, that way, derails and displaces fear and anxiety.
[time=2859] Paul says nothing qualifies for the anxiety column, but everything goes into the go to God for column.
[time=2869] When I study in this passage, I came across some notes from a long time ago.
[time=2874] Some of you will remember one of our former pastors, Russell Moore.
[time=2878] Russell described these prayerful petitions where he says, "In everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your request be made known to God." Russell described those requests and specific things, as a humble cry of a dependent heart.
[time=2899] A humble cry of a dependent heart that recognized, "I can't take care of this. I need God.
[time=2906] I need you. I need you, Father."
[time=2912] It's not telling me what he's going to do for me.
[time=2915] It takes everything to an all-powerful, good God who cares for me and has a perfect plan.
[time=2922] That next bullet there is humble, grateful prayer, produces abundant peace and a protected inner man.
[time=2934] It says, "The peace of God guards your hearts and your mind in Christ Jesus."
[time=2945] Standing to keep watch over, same kind of word, military.
[time=2950] Keep watch over. It protects your heart and your mind.
[time=2957] After the charge to be one who takes everything to God in homeful, grateful prayer, Paul moves on and addresses the things that we are to think about.
[time=2970] When you're not taking everything to God in prayer, he wants to make sure that our minds aren't idle and thinking on the wrong things.
[time=2981] Finally, brothers, whatever is true, honorable, just, pure, lovely, commendable. If there's excellent, anything worthy of praise, think about these things. In 2 Corinthians 10, Paul talks about the war and that we don't wage war with the same weapons that the world does, and we're called to take thoughts, what, captive.
[time=3005] We're taking the enemy captive because it sets itself up against the knowledge of God
[time=3011] and it's saying this is not God in your life, and you have to take those thoughts captive.
[time=3016] And think differently. You think differently.
[time=3023] Your thought life is a battleground for the enemy.
[time=3027] We must fight that battle for the things that we think about.
[time=3031] I got a quote from Alistair Begg there for you, "A mind that is filled with what is true, noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable, excellent, and praise worthy will have little time for anxiety producing, peace disturbing, joy destroying thought."
[time=3054] Think about these things.
[time=3059] So having looked at the traits of maturity which lead to multiplication in the church, we get to verse 9. We get to verse 9.
[time=3070] And Paul says, "What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me
[time=3077] practice these things, the same man who is saying to do what you've seen in me in practice, in Romans 7, refers to himself as a wretched man, a messy guy that doesn't do the things that he wants to do and does the things he doesn't want to do.
[time=3101] All too often brothers and sisters in the body of Christ are too busy keeping as Kevin's describes their church smile, fine face on and portray that everything associated with being a Christ father is roses and chocolates, it's Valentine's Day.
[time=3120] Well the truth is it's not. 2 Corinthians 12, 9 and 10 says, "But he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness, therefore I'll boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses.
[time=3137] When shall last time be boasted about that?
[time=3144] For the sake of Christ, then I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions and calamities.
[time=3153] For when I am weak, then I am strong.
[time=3159] I don't need to live a perfect life or be perfect.
[time=3164] I just need a perfect Savior." Your next to last bullet there is mature believers are imperfect, imperfect but willing examples.
[time=3178] Can you be that?
[time=3181] Much like the compass that is not the destination but points to the destination, Paul was not the one to be focused on but he always pointed to Jesus.
[time=3195] Jesus isn't standard, not Paul, not Rick, not Kevin,
[time=3201] not Rich or any other staff member, standard to Jesus.
[time=3207] You're not called to be a perfect example even.
[time=3212] Paul says in 1 Corinthians 11, 1, follow me as I follow Jesus.
[time=3218] Follow me as I follow Jesus.
[time=3220] Here he says it a little bit different way.
[time=3222] What you've heard and seen and watched me do, practice that.
[time=3230] In a bid I'm going to ask you.
[time=3234] I'm going to ask everyone to bow their heads and their eyes and clothes.
[time=3239] And at that time I'm going to ask you to be in a posture that expects God
[time=3247] to prompt you to raise your hand.
[time=3253] Try to be focused on that and God working in your own life not wondering what the guy next to who's going to raise his hand for.
[time=3263] Listen, I believe the Spirit is going to ask many in the room today to acknowledge your need for Jesus in one of the areas we just talked about.
[time=3273] By raising your hand you're answering the Spirit's call for change in your life
[time=3280] in one of these areas and it's saying, Rick, pray for me.
[time=3286] One of the ways that people are pointed to Jesus and are drawn to him, we already said it is not by your perfection.
[time=3296] People need to know that everybody's sitting here in this sanctuary.
[time=3300] Some of you don't know Jesus today and you might be thinking that you're sitting here in a sanctuary with a whole bunch of people that got it all together.
[time=3310] And so when I ask you to raise your hand of a place you need Jesus to work in your life
[time=3317] so that we can acknowledge that, those that are unsafe today will get to hear that they're sitting in a sanctuary with imperfect people that need a perfect Savior.
[time=3330] Okay?
[time=3333] What a challenge we've been issued today from the end of Philippians chapter 4
[time=3341] as we've looked at what it means to rejoice in the Lord always.
[time=3345] That's kind of a tough challenge to do that always even in the ups, even in the downs and to have that peace of God that passes understanding.
[time=3352] One of my favorite verses in all scripture is a peace that we can't even understand, a peace that transcends every circumstance in our life.
[time=3361] That's the kind of peace that Paul was talking about in Philippians that living inside out really boils down to.
[time=3367] And as you've been challenged by Rick today, maybe you're one of those people that he talked about that you've got a relationship that's gone astray and there's a strain there and it's time to reel that back in.
[time=3377] It's time for the peace of God that we've talked about to tap into, to influence and to affect the relationships you have horizontally here on the earth.
[time=3386] Maybe that's your challenge today, but I want to talk to you for a moment about the greatest challenge, the greatest and most important relationship that any of us can ever have.
[time=3396] And that's our relationship with God that can only come through Jesus Christ.
[time=3400] That's really why we're here, that's why we exist.
[time=3403] And I believe somebody that's watching today, perhaps this you, has felt God stirring, doing something new inside of you, and today is the day of your salvation.
[time=3412] And if that's you, if you feel like God's doing something inside of you and saying today is that time to take that step, that perhaps you've been putting off for quite some time, maybe you've heard us talk about it week after week or maybe this is the first time you've heard it put that way, regardless of the case for you, I believe that God wants to do something inside of you.
[time=3428] If you don't know that your eternity is sealed, it's with Jesus, all because of that relationship, then today is that day for you.
[time=3437] It's really simple.
[time=3438] A lot of times as humans we make things so complex and we complicate what God intended to be so simple.
[time=3444] Here's what salvation really looks like if God's stirring that inside of you right now.
[time=3448] It really starts and ends with Jesus that I trust Jesus with my life.
[time=3452] This life that I've held on to so dearly, I now lay it down at his feet.
[time=3456] I trust him to save me.
[time=3458] I don't trust me to save me.
[time=3460] I don't know about you, but I've known for quite some time that I'm not good enough to save myself.
[time=3464] And today, maybe that is a new realization for you that it's time to trust in him.
[time=3469] Jesus came and he lived a sinless life that you or I could never live, only to dial on that cross to pay a penalty for that sin that you and I have that we could never pay.
[time=3479] He dialed on that cross for you and then he rose again and he is alive today and he wants to save you because of that living truth that's inside of you that only comes from him.
[time=3491] And being saved really is more than just believing that, it's trusting in that.
[time=3495] It's laying your life down and saying Jesus, I now give you all of me.
[time=3499] If that's you today, then I want to challenge you.
[time=3501] Paul, step away.
[time=3502] Do whatever you've got to do to take that step, call out to him.
[time=3505] It's not about a prayer, it's really just about your heart crying out to Jesus and he hears you whether you can do that aloud or silently.
[time=3512] He knows your heart and that's what salvation boils down to.
[time=3515] Thank you for taking that step.
[time=3517] Thank you for allowing him to work in your life and take that moment to do that.
[time=3520] If you have, we want to walk alongside of you.
[time=3522] This book is called Beginning Steps because salvation is not an end.
[time=3526] It's truly a beginning.
[time=3528] It starts something new.
[time=3529] It changes not just your eternal life, but it changes this life today.
[time=3533] And so we want to get one of these books in your hands.
[time=3535] It's just going to help you know what's to come.
[time=3537] Help you know what next steps to take in your life and in your journey.
[time=3541] And so we want to get one of these to you either by mail or you can come to Black Hawk Ministries to pick one up, but there's going to be some information on your screen that I will challenge you to use to reach out to us to connect with us so we can hear your story so we can know how we can best serve you and walk with you in the days ahead.
[time=3557] Thanks again for watching today.
[time=3559] I pray you've been challenged to live inside out.
[time=3562] And I want to challenge you to come back next week as we continue this series together.
[time=3571] [SILENCE]
