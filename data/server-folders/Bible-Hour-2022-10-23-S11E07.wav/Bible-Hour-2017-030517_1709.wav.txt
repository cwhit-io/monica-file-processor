[time=600] Thank you so much for watching The Bible Hour today. No matter how you're tuning in and finding us here, we're glad that you're here. We're glad that we can just have a little bit of time to connect with you and hopefully connect you with Jesus as we continue the series called Inside Out.
[time=620] We've been in the book of Philippians and the premise, the foundation of this whole series is that Jesus is building His church and it's a winning team. Jesus is building His church.
[time=629] And though our natural tendency is to turn inward, protect what we have, Jesus wants to build His church inwardly so that we can outwardly change the world. That's what Jesus came to do. He's successful in that and we at the church here at Black Hawk Ministries want to be a part of that winning team, living inside out.
[time=647] Along those lines, I'm really excited today to introduce somebody to you that I've thought a whole lot of for many, many years now. Christian Whitmer is here with me and Christian is coming on staff with us here at Black Hawk Ministries as our outreach pastor because we truly believe in what we talk about here.
[time=663] We don't just preach living inside out. We try every single day, every single way to live inside out and to maintain an outward focus. And so Christian is going to be helping us to communicate and really to connect all of our ministries with community in the world.
[time=677] So Christian, thank you so much, man, for being here and share a little bit with us about what makes you excited. Thank you, Kevin.
[time=683] I just want to say, first of all, I'm very grateful to be a part of the Black Hawk team. Black Hawk is a church that's already doing so much in the community. It's already doing so much around the world to connect people to Jesus.
[time=696] And more than anything, I'm just excited to be able to help build on the momentum that's already here, the excitement that's already taking place in all the ministries that are in this building, and to just do a better job of really connecting you.
[time=712] Connecting you to Black Hawk and to Jesus.
[time=716] Great. And I'm so excited to have you here and want to thank you for being willing to step out. Christian is moving from Georgia as did I. And so Christian, thanks for being here. I couldn't wait for you to meet him. You'll be hearing some more from him in the days ahead.
[time=728] And so today, as we look at this concept of living inside out, we're going to look at the fact that church is a team sport. And as we do that, it's all about connecting with ministries, connecting with venues that can impact the world.
[time=741] Impact the community and change us from the inside out so that we can be a part of changing the world. So I challenge you today just to continue to dig in with us into the book of Philippians.
[time=751] And I also want to mention to you about next week, I'm going to be beginning a brand new series called Bold Faith. Bold Faith in uncertain times.
[time=759] Do you ever feel like you're living in uncertain times? That's something that we all face. And so what we want to look at in this series is the life of Elisha.
[time=767] Elisha really lived out what it means to have Bold Faith, even when facing uncertainty.
[time=773] Even when question marks loomed on every corner. And so I want to challenge you to be back with us next week as we continue.
[time=779] And we dive into this new series called Bold Faith. Thank you for watching today. I pray that you'll be blessed as Jesus works in your life.
[time=797] You give us faith to move the mountains. Hope to dream again.
[time=803] We see the fires of revival. A darkness giving way to life.
[time=815] The glory of your grace advanced. Let it burn up a night. Let it burn up a night.
[time=823] Let the walls come down in Jesus' name. Let the longs be found in Jesus' name.
[time=833] Let the church arise to shine your light to the world. Shine your light.
[time=843] Let the walls come down in Jesus' name. Let the longs be found in Jesus' name.
[time=865] Let the walls be found in Jesus' name. Let the church arise to shine your light to the world.
[time=877] Shine your light. Open eyes to see in Jesus' name. Let the city sing in Jesus' name.
[time=889] Let the church arise to shine your light to the world. Shine your light.
[time=910] Salvation's tide is rising. As all your people seek your face, your life a river flowing.
[time=924] To wash our sin and shame away. Salvation's tide is rising.
[time=934] As all your people seek your face, your life a river flowing.
[time=944] To wash our sin and shame away. Salvation's tide is rising.
[time=954] As all your people seek your face, your life a river flowing.
[time=964] To wash our sin and shame away. Let the walls come down in Jesus' name.
[time=976] Let the walls be found in Jesus' name. Let the church arise to shine your light to the world.
[time=987] Shine your light. Open eyes to see in Jesus' name. Let the city sing in Jesus' name.
[time=1000] Let the church arise to shine your light to the world. Shine your light.
[time=1011] Salvation's tide is rising. As all your people seek your face, your life a river flowing.
[time=1025] To wash our sin and shame away. Washing away in Jesus' name.
[time=1055] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=1106] We're talking about the fact that church is a team sport.
[time=1110] We're very blessed with an amazing team. My leadership team here, staff leadership team and you are as well.
[time=1117] We're all in this together. Paul, interestingly enough, we've looked at a lot of things about Paul's journey.
[time=1122] He ties all of this book of Philippians, his letter to the Philippians together. He ties it together by talking about community.
[time=1129] Talking a lot about how church is a team sport. We're blessed with an amazing team of people in this place.
[time=1136] Even right now as you look around you today. Whether you're watching us online today, I want to welcome all of you.
[time=1141] You know, if you didn't know, our family is a lot bigger than what we see in this room.
[time=1145] If you're watching us at home, television online, you're part of that family.
[time=1148] It's one of the things I love about this place. We're connected all across our community and the world.
[time=1154] Thank you for joining us today. I'm glad Christian is here. Glad you're here.
[time=1157] I'm glad that Jesus, more importantly, is the center of everything that we do here at Black Hawk.
[time=1162] So let's look at Philippians. You've got your Bibles, get your apps out, whatever you've got there.
[time=1167] Philippians chapter 4. We'll be looking at verses 10 through 23. So Philippians 4, 10 through 23.
[time=1173] We're going to be looking at how Paul closes out this eight week series is what we've looked at it as.
[time=1178] But it's really his letter to the church at Philippi.
[time=1181] Now we've looked all at what that looked like, how it got started.
[time=1184] But today we're going to be looking at those verses. And really this idea that church is in fact a team thing.
[time=1190] It's a team sport that we all are invited to play a part in.
[time=1194] And so if you were here today, here's what I know.
[time=1197] Some of you came in here today because something has happened recently in your life that has led you to believe you need to find some more Jesus.
[time=1205] Or maybe you just don't know if you want to find more of Jesus, but you came here just to see what this whole Jesus church thing was really all about.
[time=1212] Maybe you gave up on church a long time ago. I have to. You say your pastor shouldn't say that.
[time=1220] Well I have, I quit ministry for a while. I'll tell you that story some other time.
[time=1224] I was tired of it. I was tired of the people. I've heard pastors and people say, you know ministry be real easy if it wasn't for the people.
[time=1233] You know what's true about that though? There would be no ministry if it wasn't for the mess that is this and that is all of us together.
[time=1239] We all bring a mess to the table. And a lot of times here's what I know about the church.
[time=1243] And one of the things we've been looking at in this series inside out, the point is that we typically build inwardly.
[time=1249] It's natural for us as people, as Christians, and certainly for the church to turn inward, to wall off the community to protect what we have because we like it that way.
[time=1259] We don't want to say, well we've never done it that way before. So we build walls and we turn inward.
[time=1264] It's natural for us, but Jesus said, I'm going to build my church and the gates of hell can't even prevail against it.
[time=1270] And I'm going to build it inwardly so that it outwardly can have an impact that changes the course of history, that changes the world.
[time=1278] That's what you're a part of when you jump into being the church.
[time=1282] And that's what Paul is helping us look at in the book of Philippians.
[time=1285] And I've been so excited just to see the wave responded.
[time=1288] We're going to talk more about these cards and what that looks like in a few moments.
[time=1291] But we've had dozens and dozens of you who have already connected with ministries and stretched yourselves to step out of your comfort zone.
[time=1298] For that I am very grateful.
[time=1300] But here's what I know.
[time=1302] Many of you still fit that mold that I've already described.
[time=1305] You're still skeptical of Jesus, of the church, and of diving in.
[time=1309] And I think a lot of times it's because we get to a place spiritually speaking in our faith where we get lonely.
[time=1314] You ever felt alone in your faith before?
[time=1318] Some of you would say, yeah, right now.
[time=1320] And here's something that is always a reality and a truth that we sit in every single week at church.
[time=1326] Even a church this size.
[time=1327] I know it is possible to sit in a sea of people.
[time=1330] Look around.
[time=1331] It's a big place.
[time=1333] There's a lot of people here.
[time=1334] It's possible to sit in a sea of people, yet be doing life completely by yourself.
[time=1340] I know that for a fact.
[time=1342] Some of you might be in that boat today.
[time=1344] And you know the thing about Paul is he knew what it was like to have friends.
[time=1348] He knew what it was like to be completely alone.
[time=1351] Paul, I'm sure can identify that you know this ministry journey, this faith journey often gets lonely.
[time=1357] And you feel like you're in it by yourself.
[time=1359] No one can identify.
[time=1360] And it just gets hard sometimes.
[time=1362] And Paul was in that boat.
[time=1363] So think about Paul.
[time=1364] He's coming to the end of his ministry.
[time=1366] He's writing the last words here in Philippians 4 to the church at Philippi, one of his favorite places.
[time=1372] And he made that very clear.
[time=1373] He had a deep love for these people.
[time=1375] He's been following Jesus in ministry for 30 years at this point of his life.
[time=1380] Around four of those years, when he's writing this letter, was in a Roman prison awaiting sentencing from Emperor Nero.
[time=1387] Think he felt alone at times?
[time=1389] You better know it.
[time=1391] And you know the thing about Paul is he knows what it's like to be lonely.
[time=1395] He even says that even Demas says forsaken me.
[time=1397] One of his closest friends, he's forsaken me and turned to worldly things and gone away.
[time=1403] A lot of you have judged the church as have I at times in my life, judged the church as a whole based on the actions of a few of its people.
[time=1413] And what that will get you is a place of loneliness.
[time=1416] A place of keep the church at arm's length.
[time=1419] A place of not engaging in all that God has to offer for your life as you be the church with other people.
[time=1426] Paul understood that because even though he was so alone, his closest friends even had deserted him at times in his life.
[time=1433] He was in this low point of his life, yet he writes rejoice in the Lord.
[time=1437] Always, again I will say, rejoice.
[time=1439] The peace of God last week, the peace of God that passes understanding will guard your hearts and your minds because of Christ Jesus.
[time=1447] What kind of guy in his right mind would be writing that at this point of his life?
[time=1451] One that met Jesus, one who understood the church to be what Jesus intended for it to be.
[time=1460] I want to give you three things that I believe Paul kind of gives us in these last verses.
[time=1465] This really you could call his prescription for strength on your faith journey.
[time=1469] If you feel a little weak, if you feel a little alone, I believe there are some things here that are going to encourage you as they did Paul.
[time=1476] Obviously in this dark moment of his life, encourage him to move forward and to keep his reality where it needed to be.
[time=1483] The first one is this, living in community.
[time=1485] We provide notes for you there in your bulletins.
[time=1487] You can take notes there or our church app.
[time=1489] If you haven't downloaded our church app, great way to stay connected.
[time=1492] Black Hawk Church, you can search for that and find it.
[time=1494] I'll be reading from the ESV, the English Standard Version, if you want to follow along in the same version in a moment.
[time=1499] But it's in verse 10 and then we're going to skip to verse 14 through 17 that we see Paul's encouragement.
[time=1505] Paul's challenged, Paul's prescription for strength on a faith journey as simply being living in community.
[time=1512] I know what a lot of you might think.
[time=1514] You know the church says that, seems like such a churchy word, living in community.
[time=1518] What does that mean?
[time=1519] I do live in a community, it's called Fort Wayne.
[time=1521] But what Paul is talking about is something that goes even deeper than that.
[time=1525] Let's look at verse 10, then we'll skip to verse 14 together.
[time=1527] Anybody ready for the word?
[time=1529] Verse 10, Paul says, "I rejoice," there he is again.
[time=1533] By the way, I have skipped something important, didn't I?
[time=1535] Let's pause there.
[time=1537] To rejoice is a...
[time=1539] You guys have been listening these last seven weeks, haven't you?
[time=1542] I am impressed.
[time=1543] To rejoice is a choice Paul chose to rejoice even in these moments of his life and he writes this to the church at Philippi here.
[time=1550] I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length you have received, you have revived rather, you're concerned for me.
[time=1559] You were indeed concerned for me, but you had no opportunity to go to verse 14.
[time=1563] It's talking about how they cared for him.
[time=1565] Yet it was kind of you to share my trouble.
[time=1570] You ever had anybody do that for you?
[time=1572] Just share your trouble, carry the load with you.
[time=1575] Verse 15, "And you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church entered into partnership with me, giving and receiving, except you only."
[time=1589] Verse 16, "Even in Thessalonica you sent me help for my knees once and again, not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that increases to your credit."
[time=1600] A lot of stuff happening there and this church bottom line has really supported Paul.
[time=1604] They've been there for Paul in his lowest moments in those times where everybody else was leaving him where he felt very lonely in his faith because they realized that church is a team sport and we don't quit on anybody.
[time=1616] Everybody makes the journey together beside of us.
[time=1620] So living in community, Paul is tying this together.
[time=1622] He could write a lot of different things to close this letter.
[time=1625] Yet he's writing these things.
[time=1626] He's writing about how they knew what it meant to live in community.
[time=1631] How many of you ever had a friend that was just always there?
[time=1634] The encouragement of friends.
[time=1635] You would say they're the ecclesiastes type friends in chapter 4 where it says two are better than one and chapter 4 verse 12.
[time=1642] A chord of three isn't easily broken.
[time=1644] You felt like they're those people, the other chords in your life that you have held onto that have stuck beside you no matter what and they were just that strong rope and foundation.
[time=1653] They stuck beside you maybe when nobody else would.
[time=1656] If you don't have a friend like that, and I know many of us do, but I realize some of you may say, I don't know that I've ever experienced that, to be honest with him.
[time=1665] Why want you to know something very important?
[time=1668] You have a friend in Jesus.
[time=1670] He's faithful when you're faithless.
[time=1673] He's the same yesterday, today, and forever, and he's not going anywhere.
[time=1680] You need to know that today. He is the only one who can truly fulfill that.
[time=1684] But Paul's talking about how people looked like Jesus in doing that in his life.
[time=1689] I'm grateful to have people like that in my own life.
[time=1691] You know, we often say, well, what does living in community mean?
[time=1694] It means that we go beyond sitting in rows.
[time=1698] We believe in this.
[time=1699] You're doing the right thing by being here.
[time=1701] I truly believe that this week because we're going to look at God's Word, not because I'm here, not because the music's that great, not because of any of us here, but because Jesus wants to work in your life.
[time=1709] And we're going to look at his Word and it's going to transform you.
[time=1712] It's important for us to do that every week.
[time=1714] But it's not enough to truly live the life that Paul is talking about just to sit in rows every week.
[time=1721] It's where we go from rows to circles.
[time=1724] And we look at each other in the face, and we hold each other accountable, where we walk with each other in the low moments of life, in the high moments of life, and everything in between where you know there were people who were following Jesus struggling at times.
[time=1738] To follow Jesus, just like you are, who you can look on your right and on your left and behind you and ahead of you and know you're not alone.
[time=1748] There's a statement I want to give you.
[time=1750] And it's hard to believe this statement sometimes because it's easier, it feels just to go it alone sometimes.
[time=1755] And the statement is, "The Christian life was never meant to be lived alone."
[time=1761] Some of you have worked really hard.
[time=1764] And in a church this size, here's what I'll tell you, I know, I know that if you want to, you can slip in our back door, sit on the back row, slip out, maybe a little before the service ends, get in your car and go home.
[time=1776] And I hope that if you've done that, that you've been very encouraged and you're always welcome here.
[time=1780] But I know that it's possible to do that.
[time=1783] And when we do those kinds of things, are we neglect building relationships?
[time=1788] We miss what Jesus came and not only did he say we should do what Jesus actually did.
[time=1795] In my own Christian journey, it's easy to talk a lot about what Jesus said without actually doing what Jesus did.
[time=1801] Jesus was all about community relationships.
[time=1805] That's why he got these knucklehead guys called the disciples.
[time=1808] You ever wonder why?
[time=1810] Jesus, he's the son of God, why did you pick that guy?
[time=1813] Peter, really?
[time=1815] I'm Peter.
[time=1818] I'm not even close to Peter, in fact.
[time=1821] And yet God has chosen to allow me to be a part of this thing we call the church.
[time=1825] Why? Because he loves, I don't know totally why.
[time=1830] When I look in the mirror, I don't get it.
[time=1832] What do you see, God and me?
[time=1835] You ever feel that way?
[time=1836] That'll make you feel lonely at times because then you wall things off.
[time=1839] You can't live inside out.
[time=1840] But Jesus said, I'm going to build my church.
[time=1842] He's building it, not you.
[time=1844] You get to be a part of building it.
[time=1845] He's going to build his church, whether you help or whether you don't.
[time=1848] But here we are with the opportunity to let him build us up so that we can be a part of him building his church.
[time=1854] That's the winning team and I want to be on that team.
[time=1857] Jesus value those relationships.
[time=1859] This is not in your notes, but I challenge you to write this down.
[time=1861] Just even this morning, early just praying and thinking through what it means to live in community.
[time=1865] This statement comes to mind that biblical community transcends any circumstance.
[time=1871] What does that mean?
[time=1876] It means it doesn't matter what you face.
[time=1879] If you're living in community with other believers that are based on a faith in our Lord, our Savior, Jesus and Jesus alone, that is not going to make the problems of life go away.
[time=1889] That is not going to make everything feel better, but that is going to give you a foundation to face whatever this world, this life and the enemy can throw your way.
[time=1899] Not because they're so great, but because God has put you in community in relationship with other people who need Jesus just like you do.
[time=1907] That changes everything.
[time=1910] And Paul understood that.
[time=1912] In my vision, our vision, God's vision is to be a part of a church that Blackhawk would not just be a church with small groups that meet.
[time=1922] That's great.
[time=1923] We have that.
[time=1924] We've been that for a long time.
[time=1925] I don't want to see Blackhawk.
[time=1926] God doesn't want to see his church, not just at Blackhawk, but globally, to be a church with small groups, but to be a church of small groups.
[time=1935] Think about the difference.
[time=1936] It's one thing to say, well, you know, I pop in one here and there, you know, our church has a few of those things.
[time=1940] But no, we want church to be carried out, the legs of the church, the army, the front lines of our church to be us in community, in small groups, where there's a group of people you're doing life with.
[time=1952] What does that mean?
[time=1953] You should say that, do life together.
[time=1955] That means live and hurt and cry and shout and scream and be angry and ask the questions that you have about what God's doing in your life, but to do it not by yourself but with other people.
[time=1970] That's what it looks like.
[time=1971] It's also to celebrate those moments of joy when a baby's born, when you get a new home, when you move to a new neighborhood, when you get a promotion at work.
[time=1982] When you get to share Jesus with that person who didn't know him, but you got to share it with him.
[time=1987] It's to share in the joys and the pains of life.
[time=1990] And Paul was grateful that the church at Philippi was that for him and his life.
[time=1995] He knew what it meant to live in community because he's even in prison talking about rejoicing, choosing to rejoice and thanking them for the community that they had provided.
[time=2004] So that started pretty high level.
[time=2006] Big picture church stuff.
[time=2008] Now Paul narrows it down to you, to me.
[time=2015] And it gets personal.
[time=2016] The second thing, not just living in community, but learning.
[time=2020] Learning, everybody say learning.
[time=2022] Learning contentment.
[time=2027] Has anybody else noticed that you don't just know how to be content like Paul's talking about?
[time=2032] You know, when our kids are growing up, did you ever have to teach your kids to tell a lie?
[time=2037] It's crazy how that happens, isn't it?
[time=2042] They're the perfect little angel and then one day that sweet little angel lies right to your face.
[time=2047] And you go, what's happened?
[time=2050] I never showed them how to do that.
[time=2052] First question I'd say is, you sure?
[time=2054] Maybe you did.
[time=2055] I don't know.
[time=2056] Maybe I did too.
[time=2057] Yeah.
[time=2058] But we don't have to teach that.
[time=2059] It's something that's natural to us.
[time=2061] It is not here me.
[time=2062] It is not natural to be content in all circumstances.
[time=2066] It hurts.
[time=2068] It's painful and it's almost impossible at times, but here's what I want you to know.
[time=2073] You may say, that described my life.
[time=2075] I thought church was irrelevant.
[time=2076] That's relevant to me because it is impossible, Pastor.
[time=2079] I want you to know with God everything is possible.
[time=2083] You hear people say that often on and it's hard to believe at times, but we're going to look at how it's possible to learn contentment.
[time=2090] People often say that it's not experienced, people will often say, experience is what makes you better in life.
[time=2097] No, it doesn't.
[time=2098] Experience alone is not going to really do that much in your life.
[time=2100] It's evaluated experience.
[time=2101] It's experience that you live through and look into and say, God, what are you teaching me there?
[time=2106] And then now, God, what can I do with what you taught me there?
[time=2110] Paul is doing that at this point of his life.
[time=2112] He's evaluating all of the experiences.
[time=2114] And look at verse 11 with me and we see how the second thing, his prescription for strength for us is learning contentment.
[time=2119] And I want you to underline two words when you see him.
[time=2123] If you're right in your Bible, some people don't do that.
[time=2125] I do, and I can't remember things well and I write everything I can.
[time=2128] Learn and know.
[time=2130] Both of them are in there twice.
[time=2132] Let's look at that together.
[time=2133] Verses 11 and 12.
[time=2135] Not that I'm speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content.
[time=2144] I know how to be brought low.
[time=2147] And I know how to abound in any and every circumstance.
[time=2151] I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need.
[time=2157] And then he says verse 13, I can do all things through Christ.
[time=2160] We're going to get back there in just a moment because that's going to be some of our closing encouragement.
[time=2165] Here's what I know about learning.
[time=2167] There is intentional learning and there's unintentional learning.
[time=2172] We learn things intentionally like how to read.
[time=2176] Caleb is six.
[time=2177] My son, and he's learning how to read.
[time=2179] And the only way he's learning to read is repetition.
[time=2182] Daddy, read it again.
[time=2188] And we do it over and over and we learn.
[time=2189] We're intentional.
[time=2190] We're memorizing scripture.
[time=2192] And, you know, thanks to Black Hawk Christian School, you know, we have those scriptures every week.
[time=2195] And I love that we're pouring that into our kids.
[time=2197] It's intentional.
[time=2198] We intentionally take those steps.
[time=2200] I was called to preach at the age of 17.
[time=2202] And my aptitude test that I took in high school, they give you the top ten things to do and the top ten things never to do.
[time=2208] What do you think number one was on my never to do list?
[time=2211] Any public speaking.
[time=2216] And so I knew I had to be pretty intentional.
[time=2218] If God was calling me, and I'm a believer, here's a statement for you.
[time=2221] If you don't think God can call you to maybe what he's stirring in your life, God never calls the equipped.
[time=2228] But God always equips the called.
[time=2232] I'm a walking testimony of that.
[time=2234] I was not equipped to be a pastor.
[time=2236] You've heard me say perhaps before the one thing I always said, God, I'll never be that.
[time=2240] Don't do that.
[time=2241] I'll never be that as a pastor like my dad.
[time=2244] I knew, even though God called me, I knew God was going to equip me.
[time=2247] And he did.
[time=2248] It felt like a slow go.
[time=2250] If you heard some of my early sermons, you say, "Hey, man." But I knew I had to be intentional about learning.
[time=2257] And so I've got in seminary and I read every book I could read.
[time=2260] I read every book I can read even now because I'm not that smart.
[time=2264] So I've been intentional about trying to grow and to learn.
[time=2267] I'm still not that smart, but I'm learning intentionally.
[time=2270] And one of the intentional learning things.
[time=2272] How many of you can drive a straight shift?
[time=2274] How many of you remember when somebody talked to you to drive a straight shift?
[time=2278] I remember that for me.
[time=2279] A little Chevy S10.
[time=2281] My dad's a little work truck.
[time=2282] My dad got in there with me.
[time=2284] We got in there.
[time=2287] I didn't know anything.
[time=2288] My dad's just patient and calm.
[time=2290] You may have been here when he shared some of his story months ago.
[time=2293] But we got in there.
[time=2295] And I still remember once we got in there and I finally got it moving trying to change gears.
[time=2302] And sometimes if you don't do it properly, it'll start.
[time=2306] And so I was frustrated.
[time=2308] I was mad.
[time=2309] I was upset.
[time=2310] I didn't know what to do.
[time=2311] We were just bouncing.
[time=2312] We were out in our pasture.
[time=2313] And we were bouncing through the pasture.
[time=2315] And my dad, what do you think he does?
[time=2317] Stop, son.
[time=2318] Don't do that.
[time=2319] No.
[time=2320] He goes, "Yee-haw!" I still remember that.
[time=2327] I was so mad at him.
[time=2329] I don't want you to eat.
[time=2330] I want you to tell me how to fix this so we can stop.
[time=2333] And I remember it just finally shut off and we slid to stop, you know, in the pasture.
[time=2337] And eventually, after time and time again, I learned how to drive a straight shift.
[time=2340] He taught me how.
[time=2341] I'll never get bouncing through my dad.
[time=2343] "Yee-haw!" Now I'm so mad at him.
[time=2346] But I always remember his patience there too.
[time=2349] That's one thing I've learned when you learn intentionally and unintentionally, it's always going to require grace and patience.
[time=2355] Not just for you, but from you to other people.
[time=2360] Just like my dad gave me that day.
[time=2362] I want to talk for a minute about unintentional learning though.
[time=2366] You've probably thought of some ways that you've learned intentionally, ways you're learning intentionally, but unintentional learning is something that we don't really ask for.
[time=2375] Think about Paul.
[time=2376] Do you think he intentionally wanted to learn contentment the way he was learning contentment?
[time=2383] No.
[time=2384] He was intentional about the gospel.
[time=2386] He was intentional about Jesus.
[time=2389] But he did not want to learn how to be content.
[time=2392] I've heard it said before, if you pray for patience, God will give you opportunities to be patient.
[time=2398] You're like, "Well, I'm not praying that prayer." You know, I think of Paul and where he was at in his life.
[time=2405] He had a lot of unintentional learning opportunities.
[time=2412] Nobody in their right mind wants to learn contentment the way that Paul is talking about.
[time=2418] I don't want to go through all that stuff.
[time=2420] It goes against our nature and who we are.
[time=2423] I'm just thinking about, I want to give you a statement as we look at this and think through this and the statement is this.
[time=2429] Even when we're unintentional, God is always intentional.
[time=2435] Even when you're unintentional.
[time=2437] Even when you're learning something that you didn't ask for.
[time=2440] Even when you go through the darkest, deepest valleys of your life and it was not an intentional
[time=2447] journey that you took, God is always intentional.
[time=2452] God is always working and it's always for good for those who love him and are called according
[time=2458] to his purpose.
[time=2459] What does that mean?
[time=2460] It means Jesus cares about you where you're at and it's even in the darkest moments, the unintentional journeys that we take that we didn't ask for.
[time=2467] It's even in those moments that he still loves, that he still cares, that he still consumes
[time=2473] us so much that we can find true contentment even when it doesn't make sense.
[time=2481] You know, I was thinking this week about how I've seen that in my own life and there's really no better example of that than Sergeant Joe Cox and Diana and their family and their back
[time=2493] with us here today and I was privileged to be able to walk with that family.
[time=2497] It's a big weekend for us here, just loving on that family because Joe had made such a splash and an impact in the community and I think about unintentional stuff.
[time=2506] Do you think that was something that anybody would have asked for?
[time=2511] No.
[time=2515] But when I think about how God's intentional, even when we're unintentional, how God is intentionally doing things that we could never reach to on our own, I think about this dear family, their
[time=2526] number one goal through the whole process was Joe's number one goal for his life and that was that people could know Jesus and I stood right here with officers, hundreds of people,
[time=2538] thousands of people watching online because Joe had written five steps of salvation in his Bible and Joe led people to Jesus in one of those dark moments that are unintentional, that don't make any sense that calls so many questions about God and what he's doing, but through that people have come to know Jesus and find faith in him.
[time=2556] That's what being a part of the church can look like and I'll never forget these moments,
[time=2564] the calls that have come in, kids in high school who are here that prayed to receive Jesus
[time=2570] in the middle of the night after the funeral, people that raise their hands in a funeral
[time=2577] service to give their life to Jesus and it reminded me that God is always intentional,
[time=2584] even in the unintentional moments, even in the unfathomable tragedies of our life,
[time=2591] God is still at work and we can find contentment and we can choose to rejoice because he is
[time=2598] always working and intentional.
[time=2601] I'm grateful for that.
[time=2603] You know another side effect of all of that is perhaps the fact that some of you are here, some of you don't know anything about what took place, many of you are here because of all of what took place just a weekend ago.
[time=2617] And I saw a community and a church come together like never before to live inside out
[time=2625] and he's only getting started.
[time=2628] That's a catalyst for community.
[time=2630] It's a catalyst for contentment.
[time=2633] That's what God wants you to find in your life as you learn, whether through the unintentional parts of your life or the intentional parts of your life, you've got to follow Jesus.
[time=2642] I'll tell you this, contentment always generates confidence.
[time=2646] Paul was a confident guy.
[time=2649] His confidence didn't come from him.
[time=2651] His confidence came from his contentment.
[time=2653] You want to be more confident in your life?
[time=2655] Learn, as Paul says, to be content in any circumstance that you're in.
[time=2661] It generates confidence.
[time=2662] I want to give you two questions, evaluation questions about your learning.
[time=2666] I want to jot these down, they're not in your notes, very simple.
[time=2669] Number one, what is God teaching me today?
[time=2671] I ask our staff and our leadership teams that every single week, they get sick of hearing it already because it's just something I know God is doing and it's going to stretch and it's going to help us every single day to ask God, what are you teaching me today?
[time=2684] So ask that number one, what is God teaching me today?
[time=2686] Number two, this is the tougher one.
[time=2688] Am I learning what he's teaching?
[time=2690] Paul says, "I have learned and I know." A lot of times we can learn, we can hear things without truly getting things.
[time=2697] You with me?
[time=2698] Have I ever took that test and you learned it?
[time=2700] I don't know, the teacher did it on the board, but the test comes and you go,
[time=2706] and it's just gone.
[time=2709] The same thing can happen in our life.
[time=2711] We've got to be intentional about letting God show us new things and as we do, we'll learn those things and we'll know those things and it will lead us to contentment.
[time=2720] So what's God teaching me and am I learning what he's teaching me?
[time=2722] Number three, we've looked at living in community.
[time=2725] We've looked at what it means to learn contentment.
[time=2728] Now leveraging, leveraging, making the most of God's capacity.
[time=2732] I love this word capacity.
[time=2734] We're going to look at it together here, leveraging God's capacity, and there are three God-given capacities that Paul closes this with.
[time=2741] Go back to verse 13 and I'll talk about the first one.
[time=2743] I want to give you three things, God-given capacities that he'll give you as you follow him on your faith journey.
[time=2749] Verse 13, he said, "I've learned how to do all these things to be content." Then he says, "I can do all things through him who strengthens me."
[time=2760] The first thing is God's strength.
[time=2763] Write that down.
[time=2764] God's strength.
[time=2765] Verse 13.
[time=2766] I think this verse has been one of my favorite verses all of my life, but I think we miss what it's really all about a lot of times.
[time=2774] I think we miss what it's all about sometimes because look at the context.
[time=2778] Context is everything people often say, but it truly is in this case because a lot of times we'll see athletes say, "I can do all things through Christ.
[time=2785] I can hit that ball over the fence because Jesus strengthens me." Is that bad?
[time=2789] No.
[time=2790] Jesus wants you to hit that ball over the fence who lets you hit it over that fence and the next 12 fences.
[time=2794] If he wants that to happen, it's going to happen.
[time=2798] But I think we miss the bigger meaning here.
[time=2801] What I'll tell you about this verse, "I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength," is that the context is contentment not achievement.
[time=2809] The context of "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me" is
[time=2815] contentment.
[time=2816] I've learned to be content learned, to be content struggled, to be content in all
[time=2822] things because I can do all things through Christ.
[time=2825] Context here is contentment.
[time=2827] It's not just achievement.
[time=2829] It's not necessarily getting that promotion.
[time=2831] It's not necessarily your life looking like A, B or C or D in your life.
[time=2836] If that's God's will, he'll help you get there.
[time=2838] No doubt about it.
[time=2839] It's not bad to put on your eye black, Philippians 4, 13.
[time=2842] I love that.
[time=2843] It shows the world that everything's possible through Jesus, but we need to know we miss the bigger picture.
[time=2848] It's a lot bigger than we make that verse at times.
[time=2851] What Paul is saying is, "I can be content no matter what life throws my way because Jesus is my life." That's what Paul is saying.
[time=2861] It doesn't matter what I face.
[time=2862] It doesn't matter what's in my past.
[time=2864] It doesn't matter what I experienced in the church.
[time=2866] It doesn't matter how deeply I was hurt or I was wounded.
[time=2869] I can be content no matter what because Jesus defines my life and consumes my life, not my situation or my circumstance.
[time=2878] That's how Paul leads us to this thought that we can rejoice as a choice in our life.
[time=2885] The second thing is God's provision verses 18 through 20.
[time=2889] Not just God's strength, but God's provision.
[time=2891] Look at verse 18 with me.
[time=2893] Paul says, "I've received full payment and more.
[time=2896] I'm well supplied." I wouldn't feel very well supplied if I was sitting in prison.
[time=2902] I know they've provided for his needs and they've given him money and they've probably given him food and all those kind of things, but, wow, this guy, Jesus really got a hold of this guy for him to say these things.
[time=2913] "Having received," he says, "from a paphrodite is the gift you had sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God." Verse 19, this is God's provision.
[time=2924] It's the second thing, not just God's strength, but God's provision.
[time=2927] Verse 19 particularly, "And my God, not my ability,
[time=2934] not my family, not my strength, but my God will supply every
[time=2942] need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
[time=2948] To our God and Father, be glory forever and ever, amen." My challenge to you with this is put your confidence in the capacity of Christ.
[time=2959] Put your confidence in the capacity of Jesus, not in your capacity, not in the church's capacity, not in anybody's capacity except for Jesus.
[time=2968] He says, "My God will supply every need that you have according to his riches, not my own." God's provision.
[time=2977] The third thing is God's family, God's family.
[time=2981] I love how he closes this out.
[time=2983] Verse 21 through 23, he says, "Greet every saint," this is his final words.
[time=2986] "Greet every saint in Christ Jesus, the brothers who are with me greet you,
[time=2993] all of the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar's household, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit." All those words there represent a family of God, this diverse, and I'll direct you back to how the church at Philippi started.
[time=3008] We looked at it in week one.
[time=3009] If you didn't see that message, I'll challenge you.
[time=3011] Go back and find that because we looked at how the church at Philippi started with three people of different race, three people of different religious backgrounds, three people with different financial backgrounds, three very different divided people came together.
[time=3025] Lydia, Philippian jailer, and a slave girl.
[time=3029] And it was on the foundation of those three people's story, that this church that Paul has given us a mature glimpse into what the church can and should look like in so many ways.
[time=3038] That's how it all began.
[time=3041] You're part of a family, and that's why it doesn't matter what name is on our signs. It doesn't matter what denomination is represented.
[time=3049] It doesn't matter what skin color you come from.
[time=3052] It doesn't matter what your financial or your religious background is.
[time=3056] Jesus comes into that picture and he tears down all of the walls.
[time=3060] We've been seeing it. Let the walls come down in Jesus' name.
[time=3063] He comes into that picture and he unifies that which has been divided.
[time=3067] He unifies the things that we could never see come together for a purpose that were baptized into the family of God because of Jesus, and that tears down the walls of denominations, that tears down the walls of skin colors, that tears down every wall you could ever draw up.
[time=3083] And it's only possible because Jesus is building his church and we get to be a part of that picture, of God's family.
[time=3091] I'm going to give you a statement, and then I want to challenge us as we wrap things up today.
[time=3096] The statement is this, "Inside out churches judge success based on sending capacity, not seating capacity."
[time=3111] Success as a church is not about how many people we can fill seats with.
[time=3116] It's about how many people we can equip to be the church in our community
[time=3122] and in the world around us.
[time=3124] That's why I love the sending mentality that Black Hawk has.
[time=3127] So many staff members, so many key people here have been sent out across these
[time=3133] to other nations, across town, across wherever.
[time=3136] It doesn't matter because we are the church and church is a team sport.
[time=3142] It's been refreshing here in Fort Wayne to see churches working together.
[time=3146] A lot of times churches work against each other, like we're competition.
[time=3149] I've got news for you. We're on the same team.
[time=3152] Paul's talked about it in Philippians. If we know Jesus, if He's preached, then God be the glory. That's what we get to be a part of when God unifies His family.
[time=3167] What a book. The book of Philippians is a life-changing, amazing story about what it means to have joy, even when it doesn't make sense to be able to have that kind of a joy.
[time=3177] And so maybe today you're that person. And as you've heard me talk about the gospel and how it can truly change your life, maybe today is that day for you.
[time=3186] And you've been putting that off, but you've found that today God's doing something new, something different inside of you. I want to challenge you to take that leap of faith, to not make complicated what God has made so simple, to not put off what needs to happen today.
[time=3200] I challenge you just to trust Jesus.
[time=3203] There's nobody in your life. There's no one that has ever been.
[time=3207] There's no one that will ever be that's more trustworthy than Jesus Himself.
[time=3211] And so I challenge you to trust in Him for your salvation, not trusting yourself anymore, not trusting me to save me, trusting Him to save me.
[time=3220] That's what salvation is all about as we've looked at today.
[time=3223] And if that's you, I challenge you to take that step, not to hold back any longer.
[time=3227] And if you have taken that step, if you still need to, pause, step away.
[time=3230] Do whatever you've got to do to make sure you reach out to Jesus from your heart to His as we've discussed today.
[time=3235] But if you have, I want to get one of these books in your hand.
[time=3238] This is a book that we use every week here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=3241] It's simply called Beginning Steps. It's a growth guide for you believers.
[time=3244] It really just shows you what's next, because accepting Jesus, trusting in Him for salvation is the beginning of a new life, not the end of something.
[time=3252] So let's begin this new journey together.
[time=3254] And we want to get these in your hands either by mailing one to you.
[time=3257] We'll be glad to do that. You can come to Black Hawk Ministries at any point during the week on one of our Sunday services at 10.30 a.m. and we'd love to get one of these in your hands that way.
[time=3266] There's some information on your screen that will direct you as to how you can reach out to us.
[time=3271] Maybe you need to reach out to us because God's done something in you and you just need to share that story.
[time=3276] We love getting stories from how the Bible are, how we at Black Hawk Ministries are being used by God to change lives for eternity.
[time=3283] That's why we exist.
[time=3284] And so if you need to share that with us, I challenge you to use that information and do just that.
[time=3289] One last thing that I'll share with you today is that I've challenged you pretty heavily to get engaged in ministry, to connect with different ministries that we've even featured in this series.
[time=3298] And in this series, we've closed out by giving you those opportunities to connect with those ministries.
[time=3303] You have that same opportunity.
[time=3305] Maybe you're one of those that maybe even stood just like we did here in the service today.
[time=3310] Maybe you stood up and said today is that day where I just know I've got to step out on faith and find a way to share Jesus with other people.
[time=3318] If that's you, we've got so many venues here at Black Hawk Ministries that can help you do just that.
[time=3323] Thank you so much for watching.
[time=3324] Thank you for allowing us the privilege to have a few minutes of your busy life.
[time=3328] I know your schedule is crazy just like all of us, but thank you for tuning in.
[time=3332] Thank you for allowing Jesus to work, and we're going to continue to live inside out together on this journey.
[time=3338] You're the god of this city.
[time=3341] You're the king of these people.
[time=3344] You're the lord of this nation.

[time=3535] Greater things are still to be done in this city.
