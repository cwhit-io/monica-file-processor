[time=428] One of my favorite times of year where God does those types of things is Easter.
[time=432] Easter's coming up on April the 16th this year and I want to personally invite you to come and join us here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=439] On Easter Sunday April the 16th we're going to have two services, identical services, that you can choose between

[time=454] The hope that that can bring about.
[time=456] The Friday before Easter on Good Friday we're also going to host a service in partnership with some local churches here at 6 p.m.
[time=463] at Black Hawk Ministries so we would love to have you there as well.
[time=467] And so today here's what we're fixing to do.
[time=469] We're fixing to go into a new series, a new message called Bold Faith.
[time=473] And it's about bold faith though in uncertain times.
[time=477] There's definitely some uncertain things happening in your life, in my life and in the world around us.
[time=482] So how is it that people in the Bible could live out a bold faith in the midst of what seems like such uncertain times?
[time=489] That's what we're going to look at.
[time=491] We're going to look at how we can position ourselves for God to do miracles through our bold faith even when uncertain times loom all around us.
[time=499] I pray that you're blessed by the message and I'll be back to share some more with you in just a few minutes.
[time=529] I pray that you're blessed by the message and I pray that you're blessed by the message and I pray that you're blessed by the message and I pray that you're blessed by the message and I pray that you're blessed by the message and I pray that you're blessed by the message and I pray that you're blessed by the message.
[time=559] I pray that you're blessed by the message and I pray that you're blessed by the message and I pray that you're blessed by the message and I pray that you're blessed by the message and I pray that you're blessed by the message and I pray that you're blessed by the message and I pray that you're blessed by the message and I pray that you're blessed by the message and I pray that you're blessed by the message and I pray that you're blessed by the message and I pray that you're blessed by the message and I pray that you're blessed by the message and I pray that you're blessed by the message and I pray that you're blessed by the message.

[time=775] [AMEN]
[time=790] [MUSIC - 65 seconds]
[time=875] If you got your Bibles, I want to ask you to turn with me to the book of 1 Kings, 1 Kings, chapter 19.
[time=883] 1 Kings, chapter 19 in your Old Testament, and so we're kicking off a new series today and I want to welcome you to that series simply called Bold Fate in Uncertain Times.
[time=893] Anybody noticed that there is a little bit at times of uncertainty that swirls around your life these days?
[time=900] If you didn't find any in your life, then when you leave today, I'm guessing some will meet you.
[time=905] There is a lot of uncertainty, a lot of question marks, a lot of struggles, a lot of trials, and you brought those in here with you, I'm guessing.
[time=914] But today, those times of uncertainty, those struggles, those trials, those bumps in the road are going to be met, going to be intersected by faith and what God can do through faith today.
[time=926] He's got something for you today. No matter whether you're watching us online, on television, I love that our family here at Blackhawk is a lot bigger than what we squeeze into this room every single week.
[time=936] It stands far out into our community and around the world, so no matter where you're at today, thank you for being a part of what God is doing.
[time=943] So I'm pumped about this series. Can I tell you why? You guys got to talk back to me because this is going to be some good stuff.
[time=949] I'm really pumped about this series because I truly believe in the depths of my heart that these six weeks, we're going to look at the life of Elisha.
[time=959] We're going to talk about Elisha, not Elijah, but Elisha in just a moment, but I truly believe that these six weeks are going to serve as a defining moment in your faith journey.
[time=971] In hundreds of people, I believe it'll serve as a defining moment that you go back to when God started something new, when God stirred you in a new direction, where you got unstuck, perhaps, in your faith and move forward to what God has for you.
[time=986] You ever wonder at times as we watch that video and think about the uncertain times we live in, do you ever wonder like I do how guys in the Bible, ladies in the Bible, they're stories, they displayed such bold faith in some of them.
[time=1000] In some of the most inopportune times, the most uncertain times any of us could draw up, they displayed the greatest faith that maybe the world has yet to ever see.
[time=1010] How do they do that? How can we do that? That's what we're going to be digging into, and I love the verse that it closed out with, and if you're wondering if that's possible for you, the answer is yes, because Jesus put it this way, John 16 and verse 33, he said, let me tell you some things.
[time=1026] I tell you these things, because in me you can have some peace, in the world you're going to have trouble, it's going to happen, it's not out, you might run into some obstacles.
[time=1036] No, in this world you will have tribulation trials and troubles, but he ends by simply saying, but take heart because I have overcome the world.
[time=1047] That should give you a little hope no matter how uncertain life may feel, that's the source of bold faith that we go into today as we look at 1 Kings, and today we're going to look at this idea, this concept, each week we'll look at something that's bold, today's bold viewpoint is bold commitment, bold commitment.
[time=1064] So, how can we find bold commitment like we see in the life of Elishon? So, set this series up on, I'll give you a couple of thoughts, they're in your notes there, if you're taking notes, I'll be reading from the English standard version, if you've got your app, you want to find that with me, ESV version there will be there in just a moment, but you also have notes in your bulletin, if you like following on there, another great way to follow along is by the Black Hawk Church app, even if you're not here with us watching from a distance, the notes are every week in the Black Hawk Church app, so I would encourage you to find that.
[time=1093] Let me give you the driving thought of this series. This is what's going to drive us every single week, and it's really the concept through which we're going to look at the life, the character, and the bold faith of a man we know as Elisha, and it is, we often ask God to do bold miracles through our faith, yet refuse to put ourselves in a position to need them.
[time=1116] So many times, you say, "Well, what does that mean?" It means we say, "God, I really want you to do this in my life, I really want you to do a miracle in this area of my life." And God says, "Okay, well, then take this step," and it's like, "Well, I want you to do it, but I can't take that kind of step," because that might eliminate my plan B.
[time=1133] I wouldn't feel very secure, God, taking that kind of step, but I still want you to do miracles, and so we'll say, "God, do the extraordinary, do things that are exceedingly abundantly above in my life, but don't make me get uncomfortable to get there."
[time=1145] But faith stretches us beyond what we're capable of. Without it doing that, what would we need faith for anyway? If we could do it all anyway, what would we need God for if we have all that we need to get wherever we're trying to go?
[time=1160] That's why we need faith sometimes. Some of you are in a season where you didn't ask for an opportunity to exercise your faith.
[time=1167] You weren't looking for a stretching faith, but faith has got you in a place now where maybe it's a diagnosis. Maybe it's a struggle in your relationship.
[time=1176] Maybe you've lost a job. Maybe things that were once stable have gotten very unstable, and you've been forced into this place where you're now having to stretch in your faith and to rely on your faith more than ever before.
[time=1190] You know, people will often say, "Well, God won't put more on you than you can handle. That's in the Bible." No, it's not.
[time=1197] Some of you came in thinking that was in the Bible. No, it's not the verse that it's talking about.
[time=1201] It says, "You won't be tempted beyond what you're able to bear." If you know Jesus, that means you have inside of you the power to overcome any temptation in your life.
[time=1209] I'm going to tell you, I've been in a lot of situations in my life where I had way more on me than I could bear.
[time=1215] It was so uncertain. I couldn't bear it, and I was having to look up at God down below.
[time=1221] And the only place I could look is up, and I couldn't bear it, but what I found in those times is that He could bear it.
[time=1228] He could carry not just my situation, but carry me.
[time=1232] So the challenge of this series is that we put ourselves in those positions at times, and it becomes a defining moment.
[time=1237] And so the driving question that comes from that is simply this, how can we position ourselves, how can we position ourselves for miracles through bold faith?
[time=1247] How can we position ourselves for miracles through our bold faith?
[time=1252] Write this down if you're taking notes. The bottom line, really, of 1 Kings 19, we're going to be looking at verses 19 through 21, just a few verses that carry a lot of weight with us today.
[time=1261] Is this, bold faith begins, we're calling and commitment combined. Bold faith begins, we're calling and commitment combined.
[time=1274] Here's what I know about you and me, is we all have calling in our life, we all have passions, we all have God stirring us toward things.
[time=1283] That's our calling in our life, and a lot of times we spend a lot of our life trying to find that.
[time=1287] We have a calling, and we all have commitment. Some of you say, well, I'm not a very committed person, I struggle with commitment or whatever it might be, but you're committed to something.
[time=1295] You're committed to give some of your time to hear from God today at the least.
[time=1299] If you're not committed to anything else, you're committed to hearing from Him, at least in a small sense today.
[time=1303] So we all have calling, we all have commitment. A lot of times they just go in different directions.
[time=1309] Our calling's over here, and our commitment's over here, but bold faith begins when those two things come together.
[time=1315] Well, you say, well, how can I make those two things in my life come together? I'm really glad you asked.
[time=1321] That's what we're going to look at, and it starts with this idea of concept of calling with Elisha.
[time=1327] Now, so let me set up the story of Elisha. There isn't Elijah, and everybody say Elijah.
[time=1333] I'm probably going to mix them up about 17 times, but you'll know the difference. Just give me some grace, and I'll give you some as well.
[time=1343] But we're going to look at Elisha, and as we do, Elijah comes into play.
[time=1349] And so that's where we're at the setup, the context for this miraculous calling that we'll get to in verse 19 of 1 Kings 19.
[time=1356] The backdrop is not quite what you might think it is. The backdrop, the context of Elisha's calling was pretty dark, and dreary, and uncertain, because Elijah,
[time=1366] Elijah is the one who's going to come alongside of and call. What he's going to do is he's going to throw his cloak, it says, around Elisha.
[time=1374] And that cloak represents his authority, his calling, the anointing of God. He was a prophet of God, and his call to Elisha was to come along with me.
[time=1385] Let work with me, serve with me, and you are going to take my place. It was a succession plan.
[time=1391] And you say, well, that sounds great for Elisha. In some ways, but at the surface, Elisha was being asked to leave a life of luxury and go be a little unpaid intern,
[time=1405] kind of a CEO of his father's business to an unpaid intern serving this guy that he'd never met would not even a word to a life of danger, a life of poverty at times.
[time=1416] He was being asked to leave everything that he knew. But the backdrop of this, you need to know about Elijah.
[time=1422] So earlier in this passage, if you read ahead, and I challenge you, go back and look at some of that this week. If you go back and do some of that, what you're going to find is that Elijah was going through one of the darkest seasons of his life.
[time=1433] He was being fed by birds because he was running for his life from Queen Jezebel.
[time=1438] And if you ever thought about naming your child Jezebel, you might re-think it.
[time=1442] At least give hope to the name again or something. I hope I hadn't offended any Jezebels in the building or elsewhere.
[time=1450] But Jezebel was coming after Elijah to kill him. He was running for his life. He was depressed.
[time=1456] So the backdrop, think about this, the backdrop of this whole story of Elijah started with this idea, this context of depression, of loneliness, of poverty, and of great, great need and uncertainty.
[time=1471] Kind of sounds like today, for many of you as we look around, and even the setting of the story was the 9th century BC.
[time=1480] And so what you need to know about that is Israel was very divided. A lot of people were worshiping false God, primarily Baal.
[time=1488] And it's much like the scattered uncertainty we feel today. People going in millions of different directions and it's hard to find where to go.
[time=1496] So Elijah, a few things you need to know about him as we get to this idea of his calling is he came from a rich family. How do you know this?
[time=1504] It says that he was plowing with 12 yoke of oxen. Now 12 yoke of oxen means there was 24 oxen.
[time=1512] Now in this day and time, one oxen was like one car for us today. You getting the picture yet? 24 cars. This is a 24 car family.
[time=1525] That's what he's coming from. So he's out plowing, bleeding away with some of that. You need to know that he was an ordinary guy living at home with his parents.
[time=1534] Managing his parents estate, his parents business, and was called to be a prophet of God. And here's some interesting thoughts.
[time=1541] Elijah is recorded in scripture as performing more miracles than anybody else in all of the Bible except for Jesus.
[time=1553] Pretty interesting, but he hasn't gotten there yet. And ironically you'll find that later in 2 Kings chapter 2, we won't look there.
[time=1561] We'll get there later on in this series, but he was asked, well what do you want? Anything you want will be granted to you is at the time of Elijah's passing.
[time=1569] I've heard him for a number of years and he said, well what do you want? He said, I want a double portion of Elijah's spirit.
[time=1577] And God granted it to him. And so Elijah is recorded in the Bible as performing 28 miracles. How many do you think Elijah is recorded as performing?
[time=1589] How about 14? Pretty amazing, isn't it? God is so intentional. I just love the Bible.
[time=1595] I just love that God has given his Word to us with things like that in it. If you don't believe in those things, then I challenge you.
[time=1604] Read some of these stories. Ask God to show himself to you. If you're skeptical and I know he'll do just that.
[time=1611] He's done that in me. I love the Word of God because it's real and it's alive and it's active and it's sharper than any two-edged sword.
[time=1619] Why does it say that? Because it pierces our heart and cuts through all of our unbelief.
[time=1625] Look there with me. I want to give you today two bold statements about commitment. Two bold statements about commitment.
[time=1632] The first one comes from verses 19 and 20 of 1 Kings chapter 19. And it's, I don't have to understand it all to obey the call.
[time=1642] I don't have to understand it all to obey the call. Let's look at verse 19 of 1 Kings 19. Who's ready for the Word this morning?
[time=1653] It says, and so this again is after God revealed, and by the way, I love chapter 19 with Elijah. He's in a low point of his life.
[time=1662] He's depressed. He's lonely and he's seeking God and God reveals himself. It's where it says, "Well, God wasn't in the wind.
[time=1668] God wasn't in the earthquake. Some of you are familiar with that passage. This has just happened." And so he's saying, "I'm so frustrated because nobody's turning to you and I've given my life to this and I'm such a low point of my life and my faith."
[time=1681] And some of you say, "I'm in Elijah's boat." Well, that's what was happening and God eventually says, "Here's what I want you to do."
[time=1687] He revealed himself to him first. He met him where he was first. Don't you love that about God?
[time=1692] In our lowest moments, he just meets us where we are. He did that with Elijah. And then he says, "Now I want you to go call this guy Elisha."
[time=1699] It seems pretty clear that they had met. They had known each other. So here's what happens in verse 19.
[time=1704] It says, "So he departed from there and found Elisha, the son of Shafat, who was plowing with 12 yoke of oxen in front of him.
[time=1712] And he was with the 12th." So he was bringing up the rear, probably managing that whole concept, that whole field there.
[time=1719] He was running the show there. And then Elijah passed by him and cast his cloak upon him.
[time=1725] Again, that represented his calling, his authority, his anointing of God to be a prophet of God.
[time=1730] And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said, "That'd be kind of weird, wouldn't it?
[time=1735] You're doing your job and this guy comes and takes his coat off and just goes, "Hey, come back. You're just giving me a coat or what's all this about?"
[time=1743] But he knew. He knew there was something significant to this, but there were immediately questions swirled in Elisha's head.
[time=1751] I promise you. Because he had a lot of uncertainty, a lot of questions. What is coming with that?
[time=1756] So he left his oxen, ran after Elijah, and said, "Let me kiss my father and my mother, then I will follow you."
[time=1762] And he said, "Go back again for what have I done to you?" Now, let's look at this.
[time=1767] I don't have to understand at all to obey the call, and I've learned in life that God's oftentimes kind of intentionally vague with his directions to me.
[time=1778] Anybody else noticed that? If you think that's unspiritual, it's okay. This is a safe place, safe zone to bring your unspiritualness.
[time=1785] Is that a word? Into the room. It is now. You can bring it there. A lot of times, I think God purposefully doesn't tell me much.
[time=1792] And it drives me crazy. I like details. I like knowing what's around the corner. I don't like stepping into the unknown.
[time=1801] But a lot of times, God says, "Go." Well, go where? How am I going to get there? Who's going to pay for it? Who's going to drive?
[time=1811] You know, you start asking these questions. I love you looking scripture when he called his disciples. He says, "Come follow me."
[time=1818] One word a lot of times, "Follow." I love Jesus walking on the water, and Peter's in the boat, and he's walking on the water, and it's a stormy night, and it's scary.
[time=1827] And he just looks at Jesus, and they have this conversation, and Jesus just says, "Come."
[time=1833] "Come, step on the water." You do know, you're pretty special, Jesus, but I'm not. I'm going to sink like a rock.
[time=1842] But what about Jesus just says, "Come." Moses, he says, "Go." Abraham, he says, "Go."
[time=1849] To the land that I'll show you. Go where? To the land that I'll show you. Just go. Set on a journey.
[time=1856] And here's what I want you to know today. A lot of times, God's going to ask you to do things. He's going to ask you to take a step of faith, and he's going to be intentionally vague.
[time=1863] And I believe, I've come to this belief that I think God doesn't often give us all those details because we can't handle all the details that he already knows about.
[time=1871] And if we knew about all those details, then we would never take that first step.
[time=1875] So he just calls and beckons us, "Go. Come. Stay. Walk. What is it that God's saying to you?"
[time=1884] And so the challenge I would give to you today is, "What's the one word that God has for you in this season of your life?"
[time=1891] Just like it was with him, and I think of Elisha, he didn't even get a word. Elijah comes riding by, and he throws his cloak on him.
[time=1899] Not even a word. Scripture records. But he knew it meant something great.
[time=1907] It funneled into a lot of questions. Some of you, you're in a marriage that you're ready to quit on right now.
[time=1914] And perhaps God's one word for you is, "Stay." Some of you just got some bad news. Maybe it's about your health or your job or whatever it might be, and God's one word for you is, "Trust."
[time=1928] Maybe it's God's stirred a new ministry idea or something new on your heart, and you're trying to figure out all the details before you take a step, and maybe God's word for you today is, "Start."
[time=1939] Start. Maybe for some of you, you've been planning your family, and you've maybe been trying to have kids, or maybe you've had kids, but God's calling you, and his one word is, "Adopt."
[time=1950] Or foster. And you're just like, "Well, what a domestic or international who's going to pay for it, who's going to do all the fun, right?"
[time=1958] Just start. Maybe it's time for a process that you've been putting off to start today.
[time=1965] Even through the uncertainty. That's the essence of faith.
[time=1969] You don't have to understand everything to take the next step.
[time=1973] And for some in this room, it's time to take a step towards God. And what I love about God is this.
[time=1979] He says, "Draw near to me, and I'll draw near to you." Draw near to me, and I'll draw near to you. He's never going anywhere. He's not trying to get away from you.
[time=1989] He's been here the whole time. A lot of times we just run these little loops and these rabbit trails.
[time=1995] And we get off course, and God's the whole time, just steady coming towards us.
[time=1999] Take a step towards Him. Whatever that means for you today, and I guarantee you, it'll be a good, positive step.
[time=2005] One of the phrases that God used, even for my family coming to Indiana.
[time=2009] It was a big step for us to leave everything we knew.
[time=2012] And I've been thinking about this this week as we've looked at Elisha and prepared for what the series is going to be.
[time=2017] The phrase, and it's in your notes there, is, "The answer is yes, Lord. Now what's the question?"
[time=2023] Here's what you and I like to do.
[time=2025] God, give me the question, and I'll get back to you in two weeks with my answer.
[time=2030] After I've researched, and God, I've got to pray about it.
[time=2034] We sound so spiritual and holy, but a lot of times we even use prayer as a crutch.
[time=2041] Here's what I'll tell you. God has called you to live a life of faith.
[time=2046] And if He's already made some things clear, you don't have to pray about the details.
[time=2050] Did a pastor just say that at Black Hawk? Yes, he did.
[time=2054] Because it's biblical, and we see it in Elisha's life. He took off, and he ran after what God was doing.
[time=2059] You don't have to pray about and arrange every detail in an area where God has already said, "Go."
[time=2066] Even if it's vague, even if it's uncertain in your life.
[time=2070] Now I was thinking about oxen. I've grown up on a farm and done a lot of farming and seen a lot of plowing.
[time=2077] It would be kind of, yeah. I wasn't going to show you that yet, but there you go.
[time=2084] That's your review every day. That would get old.
[time=2088] And I know some of you would say, "That is my view every day. You don't know where I work."
[time=2094] Don't tell them that the pastor told you that.
[time=2098] But I want to use this to think about something for a moment.
[time=2101] A lot of you feel like my life's like Elisha's. Maybe he was rich, but maybe he was restless.
[time=2106] Maybe God was doing something new in his life long before Elijah came by.
[time=2110] We don't know that. It's not really recorded in Scripture. Some of you are in that place now, but you've been holding back because you feel like you've got to understand it all before your call can become a part of your life.
[time=2123] But your word, your statement for the day is, "I don't have to understand it all to obey the call."
[time=2129] So some of you are saying, "I'm tired of looking at oxen rears every single day."
[time=2136] And your life has gotten monotonous. It's gotten overwhelming.
[time=2140] But some people, your word is, "stick it out." Don't quit, persevere, endure, bloom where you're planted.
[time=2148] And along those lines, I want to lead us to the second thought, the second bold statement, is that I can be used by God the most when I hold on to the least.
[time=2158] We like holding on to stuff in our life.
[time=2161] We like holding on cleaning to security.
[time=2164] We like holding on clean to our plans and our goals and our agendas, but I believe that I can be used by God the most when I hold on to the least. We get verse 21.
[time=2176] He said, "Go and talk to your family," all of that, like we saw here, but verse 21.
[time=2180] And he returned, this is my favorite part of his calling, right here, verse 21, 1 Kings 19. "And he returned from following him and took the yoke of oxen and sacrificed them and boiled their flesh with the yokes
[time=2195] of the oxen and gave it to the people and they ate." Then he arose, went after Elijah
[time=2205] and assisted him.
[time=2209] What just happened in that verse? He killed the cows and burned the plows.
[time=2213] Literally, he killed the cows and he burned the plows.
[time=2221] Elijah's killing of the oxen, now what you should know is one of those oxen would have fed a family of five for almost a year the way they ate and prepared. And that's crazy in it. So this is significant. So they've got 24 of them, but here he is. He kills them and he cooks them and he feeds the community. Because if everybody took an eight, that doesn't mean it didn't say they put it in freezers. He fed the community. He did meant, this is crazy, who would do, this is bold.
[time=2249] He took the means by which he made a living, his security and his agenda, his plan B, who he was and he sacrificed it to God and did ministry, ministered to the community around him in the midst of one of the most uncertain times in his life. He did ministry, what a concept, sounds like Jesus. He did ministry in the worst, most dark, horrible moments of his life. Because even though there would be excitement in Elisha's life, he's leaving everything he knew. Don't under appreciate what he's going through. He's leaving everything. And so everybody do this with me, put your hands in your lap.
[time=2293] I've done this before. I think this is a good exercise. A lot of us live like this. We squeeze everything we can. As tight as we can, we close our fists. Like this.
[time=2305] Some of you came in today, and here's, I'm serious and I know, some of you came in today like this. Not only are you clinging to your security, not only are you clinging to the only things that seem stable in your life, but you're also in so doing, making fists at God. Some of you came in shaking your fist at God today because he's done things in your life. He's allowed things in your life. He didn't stop things in your life that you think he should have done differently. I'm well aware. And I've walked those shoes, and a lot of times I've shaken my fist at God.
[time=2337] I've clung to stuff that I needed to just release. God can use me the most when I hold on to the least. I often try to pray with my hands open.
[time=2349] Because a lot of times when we pray, God's hearing us, but it doesn't quite look like his answer isn't quite going to fit into the box that we try to create for God. But an open-handed mindset means I'm going to let go of whatever I've got to let go of to follow Jesus. And God, whatever you have for me, I'm open to it.
[time=2369] And so I challenge you with your hands like that this week as you pray to just remember to be open-handed. So a couple of things about how we can do that. You can close your hands now. You don't have to keep it that way.
[time=2381] To step towards God's future for me, I'm going to have to step away from two things.
[time=2385] Oftentimes in my life to step towards my future that God has in mind for me, I'll have to step away from number one my security. He killed the cows, killed the cows, and burned the plows.
[time=2397] Now that was his plan B. Now it's one thing to follow after God's calling. But if I was a luscious dad, I think about if my son Caleb came to me and said, "Hey, I've got to go follow this guy." You kind of know of him maybe, but he's a prophet of God and he's asked me to follow him and God's going to do these great things. I think what I would probably do just realistically and honestly is I would say that is great.
[time=2421] I want to support you with that. And then he says to me, so what I'm fixing to do is I'm fixing to go sacrifice about two oxen. They're really kind of your two oxen too. I hope you're okay with that. I'm going to sacrifice them and I'm going to feed the community and I'm going to burn because what you need to know is he used the plowing equipment, the yolks, the plowing equipment that made all this possible. He burned those things to cook me. So dad, to start this journey, I'm going to do that.
[time=2445] Okay, son.
[time=2449] Let me just challenge you with something.
[time=2453] Let's follow God, what he's doing here. But let's keep a decent little plan B in place.
[time=2461] Let's keep your, you're going to like this, let's keep your oxen's open.
[time=2465] See what I did there? Bad joke. Moving on.
[time=2469] I would say, hey, let's keep, you're not going to hear anything else I have to say after that, are you?
[time=2475] I told you, you've got to have a place full of grace for each other in this place, right?
[time=2479] Son, you know, keep your options open.
[time=2483] Keep a plan B in place. What if this guy just abandons you one day? What if, what if, what if, what if, what if, what if, what if, what if, but
[time=2489] a lysus, he decided to burn his plan B and use it to do ministry to people in an uncertain season of his life to step towards what God has for my future. A lot of times I'm going to have to step away from my security. I'm going to ask you a question.
[time=2509] What plow do you need to burn today?
[time=2513] What plow do you need to burn today? What security agenda is God asking you to step away from today? I think of the story of my dad. Some of you've heard some of his story and he shared it here at Black Hawk and how he owned a very successful business. But God called him in the ministry and it was clear that calling and he, and at the same time myself, my sister, and my mother were going through very challenging health season, health struggle, and what that was we had, what was known as chronic fatigue syndrome. We had to go to Atlanta every other week, about an hour, hour and a half drive from where we lived to get a shot every other week just to have any energy, just to have any immune system to overcome any sickness. We couldn't be around a lot of different stuff. I tried to play baseball and I'd stay sick all the time because my immune system just couldn't keep up. All three of us were going through that struggle and the bad thing is the insurance didn't pay for hardly any of it. Came out of my dad's pocket. He was paying for it gladly and God was providing but in the middle of that nothing was changing with our health. God said I want you to go into ministry and a big part of that for him. He knew was to step away from this business, to step out of business and go into the church world and what that ended up looking like was him leaving this business that was successful to basically become a secretary at the church part time. Who's going to pay for all of our medical bills? How would you?
[time=2605] And he took the step and I'm so grateful for a father who would do something like that because I saw and especially now that I'm older looking back at it, I've said to him were you crazy?
[time=2617] What are you thinking? And he said several times I don't know sometimes son other than I had to have faith and do what God asked me to do. And the beauty is after that it was only after it wasn't before. He had left the business sold out of the business it was after that that in the coming months we'd go back to the doctor and he would say you know they're not as bad as they were last time about myself and my sister you know they seem to have more energy they haven't been sick you're saying instead of two weeks coming four weeks go back four weeks later yeah they're doing even better let's try six weeks and that kept happening until eventually God healed us completely and since that time and that day I have never had an issue with my health outside of just normal sickness now you tell me that a doctor caused that now you tell me that I had anything to do with that God does whatever he chooses hear me in your life apply this to your life God does whatever he chooses however and whenever he chooses to do it to take care of you and to send you into and to equip you for what he has called you to do that means every sickness like mine gets healed no that sickness could be a part of what God's going to continually use in your life to grow your faith and to touch other people what about when tragedy strikes or what about when this happens and you've got all these what ifs and what abouts I don't know what God's going to do in those things but I know that he is faithful and we're faithless and that we can trust him because even when we don't get it even when things are so crazy and uncertain and up and down and our feelings and our emotions are ripped to shreds and thrown on the ground that God is still the same yesterday today and forever and he will never leave your forsake you so what does that mean for you what's that one word that God has for your life and I'll tell you sometimes not only will it require us to step towards what God has for us that we have to step away from our security also our agenda that's the second thing to step away from our agenda a lot of times your plans and your goals and your agenda is not the same thing as God's plans God's goals and God's agenda even if they're good plans you ever had that happen before you set a goal that was really a godly goal I've done it in ministry where I felt like God was leading us to approach ministry in this way but God says no I've got something different in mind a lot of times our agenda isn't what God has in mind so here's what I'll tell you some of you God's calling you and I love that Black Hawk here we have sent people across the globe to follow callings just like this some of you are here we've had some visiting from Africa the last couple of weeks some of our missionaries I love that I love interacting with people who have said you know what I don't have to understand that all to obey the call they didn't understand everything I guarantee you when they left and they had no idea what they were getting themselves into and got called onto a different land some of you that have adopted an adoption ministry called Grafted here we talked about safe families and all these different ways you can reach out those of you who have done that and our families in that process even right now and it doesn't go like you think it's gonna go I've heard the stories we wonder what are we getting ourselves into at times and for some of you God's calling you to take a big step and to leave everything to quit your job and to go to Africa if he's doing that then go but here's what I'm going to tell you this is the part where it brings it down a little bit for some of you God's not asking you to do anything like that at all for some of you you've been wanting to quit that job for some of you you've been wanting to run away from that marriage or that relationship sometimes the bold faith move isn't to up and leave everything and go across the globe is to stay put right where you are and stick it out through the times that most people would run away from so that God can work in your context and you can bloom where God's planted you for some of you that's the challenge of the day it's to not quit but to persevere to bloom where God has planted you in the season in the context what's the backdrop of this story it was depression it was uncertainty it was pain it was poverty and Elijah didn't run from it he ran towards God in the midst of it all that's what set up this call that Elisha is now walking into in your life the bold commitment is going to start with being faithful where God's placed you and it's often going to take a few things it's going to take surrender it's going to take sacrifice it's going to take service surrender sacrifice and service those are three key things I see in this story from Elisha surrender he surrendered his plan B in his old way of life he left everything he knew he surrendered it and laid it down at the foot of the cross laid it down at God's feet follow after what God had asked him to do he sacrificed his financial and overall security to do it literally killed the cows and burned the plows what plowed you need to sacrifice and burn and then he served he served Elijah and what we often don't notice in this story is he went from kind of a CEO type role running this family business if you will he's high up on the chain there to kind of a coffee runner an unpaid intern because he just served Elijah and 2 Kings chapter 2 that's when Elijah passes away we'll get there later and I'll reference that a couple more times but what you should know is that that was 18 years from the calling of Elisha to Elijah passing that was 18 years of this man's life that he served that he stuck it out do you think he probably wanted to quit serving Elijah at times I can just about guarantee it because when you follow Jesus when you follow God you hit some bumps in the road and it gets monotonous it gets like that picture where you feel like all I do is look at oxen rear all day you know he felt that way even after he started following Elijah but he served he stuck it out and he didn't quit I'm gonna ask you just to close your eyes with me for a moment and just reflect on what one word God may have for you what's that one word that God has for you in your life if you know Jesus today maybe that one word is one of those we've mentioned maybe it's a brand new one maybe it's something that he's now laid on your heart that you've got to start maybe it's something that you've got to finish but I challenge you to come up with one word that God's placed on your heart I want to speak to those of you though now as everyone around us does just that no heads up nobody looking around just you and Jesus for a moment if you don't know Jesus today and you would say to me I don't know that if I were to die today if today was my last day I don't know that I'd spend eternity in heaven with God because of my relationship with Jesus I'd like to know but I just don't know a sermon like this has been about faith well I'll tell you what your one word is your one word and you could say it a lot of different ways but I'll just use this one word surrender surrender that's what salvation is all about it's about surrender it's about us saying I lay my life down at your feet Jesus I've tried to save myself I've tried to run my own life it's been my life so far but from this day forward Jesus I surrender it to you I believe you died for me after living that sinless life I could never live on my own you did that but then you died for me you paid that price for me that I could never pay and after three days Jesus I believe you rose from the dead I believe you are alive scripture promises and God looks at you into your heart right now and promises you that anyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved but your one word is to surrender your life simply saying Jesus I give you me I'm yours in a room this size I believe there are many that need to take that step I'm not going to lead you in a prayer because I believe your hearts already screaming at some of you have perhaps already prayed it salvation is a hard issue it's not a words issue your words can't save you it's your heart being surrendered to Jesus that saves you so if that's you would you take a moment right where you sit no matter what's going on in your head or in your life and here's the thing some of you may be saying but I got to get this squared away don't don't do that don't let the enemy whisper those things in your ears if you wait there'll be something else that'll hold you back the next time today is the day of salvation for you because Jesus has already paid the price and won the victory over sin death and the grave with you in mind will you call out to him and give your life to him in this very moment today is perhaps that day that we've discussed that new day of salvation
[time=3157] where God has spoken new life eternal life over you in a different kind of way maybe you're ready to take that leap of faith that I've been talking to you about and today's that time I want to challenge you I want to encourage you even though there may be voices in your ear even though your mind and your heart and your emotions may be taking you on a journey all over the place I want to encourage you just to take that leap of faith that we've talked about salvation really is as simple as scripture tells us that it is Jesus made it that way for us he paid that price with you in mind and so I want to challenge you just to take that step today and if you have taken that step we've got a booklet we want to get into your hands the book is simply called beginning steps of God for new believers and we would love to mail one of these to you we would love to meet you in person put one in your hands here in person at Black Hawk Ministries but we want to hear from you there's going to be some information on your screen where you can reach out to us you can call us by phone you can email us but I want to challenge you to reach out let us know what God has done in your life today and if you've taken that step of salvation or maybe it's time for you to take the step of baptism because God has saved you and you've given your life to Jesus we want to help you in that we want to connect you to one of our life groups life groups are just a small group of people that get together and try to live life together not just sit and rose on Sundays or watch online or television but to truly do life alongside of each other to lean on each other when times are difficult to celebrate together when times are great to cry together laugh together whatever life looks like we would love to get you connected with what we just simply call community biblical community where we lean on each other as that's what we call life groups we'd love to connect you to one of those help you in your next step of faith get one of these booklets in your hands or if you just got a story of how guys use this ministry perhaps to give you some bold faith to give you that bold obedience that bold calling that we've talked about today we'd love to hear that story so let us know what God's doing in your life and we'll walk alongside you in every single way that we can I want to challenge you to come back next week next week we're going to continue this series called bold faith and uncertain times we're going to be looking at bold trust the question is going to be centered around this thought that you know it's hard to trust when the unexpected happens it's hard to trust when things don't make sense so how do we trust God when things don't make sense that's what we'll look at next week I want to invite you to come back and join us find us at blackcockministries.org or come see us at blackcockministries here at 1030 on next Sunday see them Lord I come I confess
