[time=159] [MUSIC]
[time=164] I need you to soften my heart and

[time=352] [MUSIC]
[time=355] Thanks so much for watching today.
[time=357] I pray that you've already been blessed, but you're in for even more blessings.
[time=361] I am really excited about bold faith and uncertain times.
[time=364] I'm really excited about what this series is going to do in your life, what it's already done in mine, and he's just getting started.
[time=370] Thank you for watching the Bible Hour.
[time=372] I'm really honored that you would just give us a little bit of time in your week to let us pour into your life.
[time=377] Let us point to Jesus in your life.
[time=379] So thank you for watching.
[time=380] Share with your friends.
[time=381] Let them know what God's doing in your life here.
[time=383] A few ways you can connect with us at Black Hawk Ministries, a part of the Bible Hour.
[time=387] You can always go to our website, BlackhawkMinistries.org, or you can go to all of our social media platforms.
[time=392] You can look for @BeHawkMinistries on Twitter and on Instagram to find us there.
[time=397] You can search for the Bible Hour and for Black Hawk Ministries on Facebook.
[time=401] And then my favorite tool that I use every week is our app.
[time=404] It really connects you to all of those pieces that I've mentioned.
[time=407] It has all of our messages, has notes in there, has upcoming events, has a way you can put prayer quests into our team and be prayed over and so you can download Black Hawk Church app from your app stores and connect with us that way.
[time=420] I want to talk to you about Easter.
[time=421] I love Easter.
[time=422] It's my favorite time of year, especially when it comes to my faith, because here's the deal.
[time=427] If it wasn't for Easter, if it wasn't for the fact that Jesus is alive, that he's not in a tomb, then what would we have to celebrate?
[time=435] What would be the point of church?
[time=438] We wouldn't need a Bible Hour ministry like you're plugging into today, but I am so glad and so proud to be able to say that Jesus is alive and we're going to celebrate the hope that comes from that very fact.
[time=450] The faith in the resurrection, the hope that comes from the fact that Jesus is not in a tomb and he is alive today.
[time=457] I want to celebrate that alongside you.
[time=459] So I want to personally invite you to come and join us for Easter weekend.
[time=463] We have a Good Friday service on the 14th of April at 6 p.m.
[time=467] here at Black Hawk Ministries, and then on Sunday, Easter Sunday, the 16th of April, we have two services at 9 a.m. and 1030 a.m.
[time=475] We want to invite you to come and bring friends.
[time=477] Let's pack this place out as we celebrate the hope that comes from the resurrection of Jesus.
[time=482] He is alive.
[time=483] I want to point you to our website, blackcockministries.org/easter.
[time=486] If you go there, you're going to find everything from ways you can volunteer.
[time=490] You can sign up to volunteer and help us on this special day.
[time=493] You can sign up to be baptized.
[time=495] Maybe you've prayed to receive Jesus recently through watching one of our broadcasts and it's time for you to take that step of obedience and follow Him in baptism.
[time=503] Be baptized as you've seen us do with so many people.
[time=505] You can sign up for that there.
[time=507] You can get social media profile pictures.
[time=510] You can get pictures to help spread the word, spread the news about Black Hawk Easter services.
[time=515] So I challenge you to go to blackcockministries.org/easter and join the fun that we're doing there.
[time=520] Last but not least, I want to set up our message today.
[time=523] I truly believe that you're going to find some faith.
[time=526] You're going to find a new perspective on faith today that is really going to transcend even the uncertainties of your life.
[time=533] I truly believe that today's message is we look at bold provision as we look at how God's going to provide, how God can take what little we have and do a lot.
[time=542] I believe that He's going to start something new in your life today.
[time=545] So I challenge you just to sit back, to rest in the fact that Jesus cares about you where you are.
[time=550] And as we continue to worship as we dive into the Word today, let God work in a new way in your life.
[time=555] We'll talk to you soon.
[time=556] Well, this morning, we want to talk with Ken and Nora Stewart again.
[time=562] We talked with them last week.
[time=564] They're from here care of audiology here in Fort Wayne.
[time=567] And guys, for those that missed the first part of your story, we kind of left off, you had been running an audiology clinic here in Fort Wayne for a number of years.
[time=577] And back in 2008, you went on a mission trip to Mexico.
[time=580] Came back, kind of broken by God and decided, we're going to take our entire marketing and advertising budget, 10% of our entire business, and turn it into not-for-profit mission work around our area.
[time=593] And Nora, you guys were advised to be honest, this is a terrible idea.
[time=599] Yeah, at the time, we had a business advisor that was actually on the cover of Forbes.
[time=604] And I told him my grand idea, and I had sent him all sorts of reasons why we needed to do it.
[time=609] And he point blank, said, "You'll go out of business." But luckily, at the same time, within a very short period of time, as I was, we were questioning the move, I ran into a woman of faith.
[time=621] And I was telling her my concerns, and she said, "Honey, if it's God's will, it's God's bill."
[time=628] And I thought, "Yes, that's what I needed." So you pull out ahead, you listened to God, you didn't listen to this nationally respected financial advisor.
[time=637] Ken, it still was not smooth sailing, though.
[time=640] When you guys first got into this, it was a bumpy road, for sure.
[time=645] Yeah, it was rough for starters.
[time=647] I mean, I remember at that time confiding in you and another buddy going, "We're failing." I mean, not only is our not-for-profit going to fail, our for-profit's going to fail.
[time=655] And if you know my wife well enough, you know, her reaction is, "Oh, that's fine.
[time=659] We're just going to sell our house.
[time=660] We'll move up on top of the business," which we were doing our not-for-profit work.
[time=664] And, you know, as a provider, a protector, I'm like, so, you know, at that point, we knew we needed some help.
[time=670] And we had our first fundraiser, we rented out Cinema Grill, and we had a comedian and food.
[time=676] And last night, we were reflecting.
[time=678] And I was like, "Nora, how many people did show up for that?
[time=681] Like 20?" And she's like, "Try 12." I mean, so it was pretty much a disaster, but out of that, God worked.
[time=688] What did he do?
[time=689] Well, at the end of it, a woman came up to us and said, "I get your vision, and I'm actually pretty good at putting these things together.
[time=695] I want to help you." And so from that first volunteer, that led to quickly to about eight power volunteers.
[time=701] We call them Vicki volunteers.
[time=702] And now there's hundreds of volunteers all over the U.S.
[time=705] And so Ken and Nora got rolling with Hear Care and Hear Care Connection, and you came to me a couple of years ago with this idea that I literally laughed at at first.
[time=713] You said, "We're doing this mission work, we want to take it all over the world." And we want to first go where Jesus walked and talked and lived.
[time=721] Let's go to the Holy Land.
[time=723] Partner with us at 21 Alive and do the trips on TV.
[time=726] When I was done laughing, I said, "I'll get you a meeting and they can tell you no." But as you can see, and as many of you remember, I ended up -- that's me standing in front of the tomb of Jesus.
[time=737] I was just standing where he preached the Bread of Life sermon in John 6.
[time=742] These trips came together, Nora, and they were more than we even imagined they would be.
[time=747] Oh, yeah.
[time=748] And that's where I think -- well, where I know God's in it, because I couldn't have even fathomed.
[time=753] How big this would be or how he would allow -- you know, allow to use us.
[time=758] So we're about to go on our 20th mission trip.
[time=761] We've been back to the Middle East numerous times.
[time=764] And really quick, I know we ended the last story with this little broken pot of clay
[time=770] that I wrote, "God, let me hear your call. I'm available." I had forgotten about that.
[time=775] That was a year and a half that we wrote on that broken clay before our first trip with you.
[time=780] And we were -- it was in my purse.
[time=782] We were on our way down to Bethlehem, and I was getting a tissue because my nose was running, and I felt that little piece of broken clay, and I thought, I remember writing this.
[time=792] It's a year and a half, a year and a half of struggle.
[time=794] And I pulled out the clay because I didn't remember what I wrote on it.
[time=797] And it said, "Let me hear your call." And we were on our first hearing the call trip.
[time=801] And someone else at the station said, "We should call these trips Hearing the Call." Yeah.
[time=806] And Nora looked at her clay, like, "Oh, my gosh." I let out a scream in the bus, and everybody said, "I don't know what's wrong." Amazing.
[time=812] And Ken, by the end of this year, you guys will be on more than 25 trips.
[time=816] You've helped literally thousands of kids.
[time=819] Because in other parts of the country, you're helping little girls like this.
[time=824] It's a genetic problem.
[time=826] And you've started this national co-op called Entheos.
[time=829] And Ken, the picture of that.
[time=831] I love the picture of that.
[time=832] Here we are in Little Ol Fort Wayne, and you have gathered people from every corner of the country,
[time=838] and you're helping people all over the world.
[time=840] Well, when you say "we," I mean, it's total God, because our bandwidth, our capacity, we couldn't have created what's going on now.
[time=846] It's just, you look back at it, and you go, "Oh, my gosh." She sent that angel, that cinema grill, and then that connection.
[time=854] So, like Kevin was talking about last week, sometimes bold faith is just when God's nudging, you may be to make that call, or to walk across the room and have that conversation.
[time=862] And that's how it's worked.
[time=863] And sometimes, even when very smart people say, "This is not a good idea." Someone on the cover of Forbes told them, "Don't do this.
[time=870] You will go bankrupt." And now they go on trips.
[time=873] They lead trips with people from Washington, California, Pennsylvania, Florida,
[time=879] many other spots all over the world.
[time=881] Thousands of kids helped because of your bold faith.
[time=884] So, thank you so much.
[time=885] Will you guys thank Ken and Nora for joining us these last two weeks,
[time=891] but for the way they have lived out their bold faith.
[time=896] They live a life of worship, and so we thank you so much.
[time=900] And we're going to continue to worship this morning.
[time=931] And I know it's been a while, but Lord, please hear my prayer.
[time=939] I need you like I never have before.
[time=947] Sometimes it takes a mountain.
[time=957] Sometimes it troublesy.
[time=965] Sometimes it takes a desert to get ahold of me.
[time=981] Your love is so much stronger than what ever troubles me.
[time=997] Sometimes it takes a mountain to trust you and be.
[time=1014] Forgive me Jesus.
[time=1019] I thought I could control.
[time=1024] Whatever life would throw my way.
[time=1031] But this, I will admit, has brought me to my knees.
[time=1039] And I need you Lord, and I'm not ashamed to say oh.
[time=1049] Sometimes it takes a mountain.
[time=1057] Sometimes the trouble will seem.
[time=1065] Sometimes it takes a desert to get ahold of me.
[time=1079] Your love is so much stronger than what ever troubles me.
[time=1096] Sometimes it takes a mountain to trust you and be.
[time=1131] Sometimes it takes a mountain.
[time=1140] Sometimes the trouble will seem.
[time=1149] Sometimes it takes a desert to get ahold to get ahold of me.
[time=1160] Because what I know?
[time=1165] Your love is so much stronger than what ever troubles me.
[time=1183] Sometimes it takes a mountain to trust you and be.
[time=1255] Sometimes it takes a river.
[time=1922] Sometimes it takes us burying things and working through things that are very painful for us to truly get to a place of bold commitment, of bold trust and trust.
[time=1931] What can I do when I'm running on empty?
[time=1936] Let's read verses 3 through 7 the rest of the story.
[time=1940] So she had come to him and said what do you have in your house?
[time=1944] We're going to come back to that phrase in a few minutes.
[time=1946] Your servant has nothing at all in the house except a jar of oil.
[time=1950] Verse 3, then he said go outside, borrow vessels or jars, borrow vessels from all of your neighbors.
[time=1957] Empty vessels, somebody say empty vessels.
[time=1961] Empty vessels and not too few.
[time=1964] And not too few sounds like dig some ditches even though it does not make sense.
[time=1969] Kind of a theme in the life of life isn't it?
[time=1973] Empty vessels and not too few.
[time=1975] Verse 4, then go in and shut the door behind yourself and your sons and pour into all these vessels.
[time=1982] I'll be going.
[time=1985] I think you misunderstood me.
[time=1987] I have a little oil, like in the little teensy we see jar?
[time=1991] No, just go and do it anyway, dig some ditches.
[time=1994] And then when one is full, he said, set it aside.
[time=1998] Pour it into the vessels when one is full, set it aside.
[time=2001] So she went from him and shut the door behind herself and her sons.
[time=2006] I love that there's implied faith there.
[time=2008] It doesn't say, so she went and contemplated for 16 days and on the 17th day she went and gathered three more jars.
[time=2014] No, she just went and did what he said and she had some faith.
[time=2018] I love the implied faith.
[time=2020] I want the story of my life to be one of implied faith.
[time=2024] When you're writing the next sentence about Kevin Rivers in his life, it's what you know he did what God wanted him to do.
[time=2030] So after he did, this is what happened.
[time=2032] That's the kind of faith I want to have and I love.
[time=2034] You think she had faith that she didn't feel empty?
[time=2036] Of course not.
[time=2037] Of course she had those love moments, but she went out and she did it anyway.
[time=2041] Continuing in verse five and as she poured them, they brought the vessels to her.
[time=2046] When the vessels were full, she said to her son, bring me another vessel.
[time=2051] And they said to her, there is not another.
[time=2053] Then, underlying that, then, then the oil stopped flowing.
[time=2059] She came and told the man of God and he said, go, sell the oil and pay your debts and you and your sons can live on the rest.
[time=2069] Beautiful story of bold provision that God brought about.
[time=2072] And there's two key lessons, two key, I would say answers to that question.
[time=2076] What can I do when I'm running on empty?
[time=2078] Number one, start with what you have and trust him for what you need.
[time=2089] Think about this.
[time=2090] God used, I love the question.
[time=2091] He said, what do you have in your house?
[time=2094] Nothing.
[time=2095] You ever been there?
[time=2097] Nothing.
[time=2098] Poor little me, nothing.
[time=2100] And she could really say that and be pretty justified in that.
[time=2104] Well, you know, I do have that little bit of oil.
[time=2107] I do have that little bit of oil.
[time=2109] And so God wanted her just to start with what she had and trust him for everything she needed.
[time=2114] God used what she had, not what she didn't have to do the things that she needed and then some.
[time=2121] And then some.
[time=2123] And I want to give you a word this morning for you, for some of you that are struggling with this kind of thought of what I have.
[time=2129] A lot of times we get so crippled by what we don't have in life.
[time=2133] And by crippled, I mean just paralyzed in our faith.
[time=2136] We won't move because what God's supposed to do this thing next.
[time=2138] So I'm just going to sit here and wait until he does it.
[time=2140] Maybe today, hear me.
[time=2141] Maybe today, God's word for you is stop waiting for what you want and start working with what you have.
[time=2152] Because you might just find, you have more at your fingertips than you think you do.
[time=2157] This widow did not think she had anything to work with.
[time=2160] Yet God took a little and did a whole lot of things that she would have never dreamed possible.
[time=2165] God never said, oh I should never said to her, what do you want?
[time=2169] Widow, what do you need?
[time=2172] He said, what do you have?
[time=2175] What do you have?
[time=2177] I came here today to tell somebody that all you have is all God needs.
[time=2185] All you have is all God needs.
[time=2188] He doesn't need anything else.
[time=2190] You may think you do, and if you do, he'll equip you with whatever you need to do what he wants you to do.
[time=2195] But all he needs is all you already have.
[time=2198] Not all that you might have, that you will have.
[time=2200] When your bank account looks better, when your relationship's more short up, no.
[time=2204] He will only need what you already have in your life.
[time=2209] Right now, even when you feel empty.
[time=2212] Now when you think about what she had, let's talk about that.
[time=2214] Olive oil is likely what they were looking at here.
[time=2217] And so several things olive oil would have been used for in the time.
[time=2220] She only had a little teeny-weeny jar full of that, but it was used for cooking, to light lamps.
[time=2225] It was used for moisturizer.
[time=2226] They didn't have bath and body works that they'd run by and get the good smell and lotion.
[time=2230] They'd rub that on, that's the moisturizer in the day.
[time=2233] Get rid of the sand and the dryness.
[time=2234] They would put it on leather to condition the leather so it would be pliable.
[time=2238] They would use it on iron to keep the iron from rusting.
[time=2241] They would use it for anointing, for prayer and worship of God and offerings to God.
[time=2247] So it had a lot of uses, but God took just that tiny little bit of something that had a lot of different uses and did things that she never even dreamed possible.
[time=2255] God has given you, everybody look at me for a minute.
[time=2258] Some of you came today to hear this word from God.
[time=2261] God has given you everything you need.
[time=2264] Everything you need to be the person that he has in mind for you to be.
[time=2271] Everything you need.
[time=2272] If you don't believe me, just because I said it, 2 Peter 1-3 is a great verse, drop that down.
[time=2276] 2 Peter 1-3, one of my favorite verses says, "His divine power doesn't say Kevin's own ability."
[time=2284] No, His divine power has granted to you all things.
[time=2290] Somebody say all things, doesn't say some things, all things, all things for life and godliness.
[time=2298] His divine power has granted to you everything that you need.
[time=2304] Everything.
[time=2305] Elisha, let's talk about the jars for a minute.
[time=2308] I love this when it comes to that, that we have all we need, and a lot of us feel like my jar doesn't look good enough.
[time=2314] The shape and the size of the jar, look, I look in the mirror every day and say that.
[time=2322] The shape and size of the jar of my life, God doesn't really offer you very much.
[time=2327] But there's something about this passage, go back and look, what did Elisha tell her to do?
[time=2331] He had one stipulation about the vessels or the jars, one.
[time=2335] It wasn't, make sure they had, they're bedazzled.
[time=2339] Make sure they don't have any cracks.
[time=2342] Make sure they're big and bold and tall.
[time=2346] What is the one thing that he required them to be?
[time=2349] Say it loud.
[time=2351] Empty.
[time=2352] The one stipulation is that it's an empty jar that she would find jars that are empty and in need of being filled.
[time=2361] Didn't say that the jar would be pretty, didn't say it would be this shape or this size or anything about it other than it's got to be empty.
[time=2367] Second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 7 says we have this treasure and jars of clay.
[time=2373] Now in that verse and in this passage I want to apply to you and me today that the jar represents our bodies.
[time=2380] It represents our life.
[time=2382] The jar represents you and me.
[time=2385] What was the stipulation again?
[time=2386] That we looked the part and acted the part and could speak well and do to know that it's empty.
[time=2391] That it's empty.
[time=2392] When we're empty then there's a comparison in Scripture with oil.
[time=2398] Usually when oil is mentioned in Scripture it has some kind of connotation for the Holy Spirit, the presence of God in our life.
[time=2405] I love that.
[time=2406] What we see here, 2 Corinthians 4 and 7, what we see here in this widow's story is that the only stipulation is that the jar is empty.
[time=2414] It doesn't have to be any certain shape, any certain size.
[time=2417] So we just simply to be filled with the oil, the Holy Spirit, the presence of God, to see our emptiness go away.
[time=2424] What do we have to be and do?
[time=2427] Be empty.
[time=2431] Your emptiness is the evidence of God's readiness to provide and do something bold in your life.
[time=2436] I love that about what Elisha asked.
[time=2438] I've been thinking about other stories in Scripture even this week.
[time=2442] Elisha said what do you have in your house?
[time=2444] I love when Moses was doing some miracles before Pharaoh to lead his people out of Egypt.
[time=2449] He said what is that in your hand Moses?
[time=2451] I think God didn't know Moses had a staff in his hand, it was just a stick.
[time=2455] Why did he ask him that?
[time=2457] Just like Elisha says what do you have in your house?
[time=2461] God looks at Moses and says Moses what's that in your hand?
[time=2465] In a lot of times I truly believe God just wants to look at you and me and ask us what do you have in your house?
[time=2472] What do you have in your hand?
[time=2474] Not what do you covet about what's in the houses and the hands of others?
[time=2479] What do you have in your house and in your hand?
[time=2484] And all you have is all I need.
[time=2488] That's the God that we serve.
[time=2490] Somebody should feel encouraged by that today because you didn't think what you had was worth anything but it is.
[time=2496] Just like this widow's oil was worth everything.
[time=2499] Some of you today may even be saying you know if I just had a bigger platform.
[time=2503] You know I just have this tiny little job or I just have this role at work or I'm just a stay at home mom
[time=2509] and I heard something I want to speak to you.
[time=2511] Anybody that's a stay at home mom if you raise your kids and pour into your kids let me speak some truth into your life.
[time=2516] I want you to know today that your greatest contribution to the world and to the kingdom of God might not be something that you do or you accomplish.
[time=2524] It might be somebody you raise and if those of you who are saying I don't have the right kind of platform in other areas with my job whatever it looks like I don't have enough to bring to the table today.
[time=2535] Today I want you to know your greatest contribution to the world and to the kingdom of God might be somebody you influence with all you have.
[time=2543] You don't have much but all you have you lay it on the line for your kids and your grandkids and those people that drive you crazy at work and those people that sit across from you at church.
[time=2553] Can I get an amen that drive you crazy and you just give them everything that you've got even when you've got nothing left to give and say God everything I have is yours and God looks at you and says that's all I need.
[time=2567] That's all I need.
[time=2569] He's just getting started with this story.
[time=2572] There's another we could go home right.
[time=2574] We're not going to.
[time=2575] Number two.
[time=2578] Not just trust God for what you need while you just simply offer what you have.
[time=2582] But number two.
[time=2583] Believe Jesus is all you need.
[time=2585] Believe Jesus is all you need even when you don't have what you want.
[time=2589] Hmm.
[time=2591] It's starting to get real personal now isn't it.
[time=2593] Let's think about that for a minute.
[time=2595] I've found in my life that when I don't have the things I really want.
[time=2599] See if you identify with me.
[time=2601] It may just be me.
[time=2602] But I've found a lot of times when I don't have what I want.
[time=2606] What I really want.
[time=2608] It's in those seasons that God teaches me and reminds me that he's all I really need.
[time=2614] When I don't have what I really want.
[time=2616] I start to learn that Jesus is all I really need.
[time=2620] Maybe you can identify a lashes response.
[time=2623] He cares about her.
[time=2624] He says how can I help you.
[time=2626] He respects her too.
[time=2627] I think in the question of well tell me what you have.
[time=2629] Not just poof.
[time=2631] There's your.
[time=2633] There's your provision.
[time=2635] He says well tell me what you have there.
[time=2637] A lot of times I believe this about me and about us is that we will get consumed by what
[time=2643] we don't have.
[time=2644] I truly believe that one of the enemy's greatest tools.
[time=2647] If you didn't know this to the enemy.
[time=2649] Satan.
[time=2650] His armies that come against the children of God and try to blind us to the truth.
[time=2655] The only tool he has to work in your life is lies and deception.
[time=2660] That's it.
[time=2662] He has no power over you except to maybe convince you to believe something that pulls you away from the truth of the gospel.
[time=2668] The truth of Jesus.
[time=2669] And I think one of his biggest tools in our life is getting us to a place that we convince
[time=2675] ourselves to be consumed by what we don't have.
[time=2678] The widow.
[time=2679] How did she answer that question to begin with?
[time=2681] She said I have nothing.
[time=2682] I have nothing.
[time=2684] Except.
[time=2687] A jar of oil.
[time=2689] A little bit of oil.
[time=2691] And don't you think about what God did it in the story?
[time=2693] He said you know what with that exception.
[time=2695] She said I have nothing.
[time=2697] Except.
[time=2698] A little bit of oil.
[time=2699] God took her exception and did an exceptional miracle.
[time=2703] And he wants to take your exception when you stop and take a second and just step back long enough and say God I don't think I have anything to bring but whatever I have is yours.
[time=2712] I do have this little bit.
[time=2713] I do have a passion for you.
[time=2716] I have no idea how to minister to him.
[time=2718] I don't have any.
[time=2719] I don't have a beautiful place.
[time=2720] A lot of times we get consumed though with what we don't have so much that we miss the big things God wants
[time=2726] to do.
[time=2727] I would say it this way.
[time=2729] Sometimes we get consumed by the lack in our life.
[time=2733] So much that we miss the lot that God is doing around us.
[time=2737] I have seen this a lot in ministry.
[time=2739] You know someone may say some of you may have said this to me.
[time=2742] So I may offend you a little and I sort of apologize.
[time=2746] My house isn't really nice enough to host a life group.
[time=2749] Because we all know the Holy Spirit only moves across granite countertops, right?
[time=2757] Maybe God says you could probably fit three in there and those three might just be that neighbor across the street.
[time=2763] Here's my favorite one.
[time=2765] I've never done this but I know people here have.
[time=2768] You stand at your closet and what do you say?
[time=2771] I have nothing to wear.
[time=2776] When God knows you could close a whole African village with what you got in there.
[time=2783] All right, after probably move on.
[time=2785] Next point, right?
[time=2788] Let me tell you something about the God that you and I serve.
[time=2791] He specializes.
[time=2793] You should write this down.
[time=2794] This is going to change your life this week.
[time=2795] I believe it.
[time=2796] He specializes in doing a lot with a little.
[time=2805] I was thinking this week, what stories really show us that and remind us how God does a lot
[time=2811] with a little.
[time=2812] If you came to mind the five loaves and two fish.
[time=2814] Little boy.
[time=2815] They had five loaves and two fish.
[time=2817] What did Jesus do?
[time=2818] He fed how many?
[time=2819] Do you know?
[time=2821] A hundred?
[time=2822] Five thousand plus the women, the children.
[time=2825] So it was more than that.
[time=2827] But just a little.
[time=2829] They had baskets.
[time=2830] Twelve.
[time=2831] A dozen baskets left over at the end.
[time=2834] Another of my favorites when I think about these stories is David and Goliath.
[time=2838] I love David.
[time=2840] I identify with David a lot.
[time=2842] God called me in the ministry at a young age and I felt too young and certainly felt inadequate.
[time=2846] So I identify with David so much in my life and the struggles that he went through.
[time=2852] But he killed this giant.
[time=2854] What was his name?
[time=2855] Goliath.
[time=2856] Yeah, that guy.
[time=2857] Over nine feet tall.
[time=2859] Armies were afraid of this guy.
[time=2861] And he made fun of David's God.
[time=2864] And so David had just five smooth storms.
[time=2869] It's a little.
[time=2871] And by the way it only took one.
[time=2874] God did a whole lot with a little and instead of like this guy's too big to beat.
[time=2879] Which is what everybody had been saying.
[time=2881] This guy's too big to beat.
[time=2882] My God looked at that giant and said no he's too big to miss.
[time=2888] He's not too big to beat.
[time=2890] He's too big to miss.
[time=2893] Look at Mark chapter four with me.
[time=2894] Foot there.
[time=2895] New Testament.
[time=2896] Mark chapter four.
[time=2897] This is my favorite one.
[time=2898] I want to kind of land here for a few minutes as we wrap things up in just a little bit.
[time=2902] Mark chapter four.
[time=2903] Jesus is going to talk about what's the kingdom of God like to his disciples.
[time=2908] Mark chapter four verses 30 through 32 is what I want to read.
[time=2915] And he's just simply talking about what the kingdom of God is like.
[time=2919] How can I compare it?
[time=2920] How can I help people see it?
[time=2922] It's a pretty big task that Jesus had to try to explain it.
[time=2926] So what does he do?
[time=2927] He goes to a visual.
[time=2928] I love this.
[time=2931] Mark four verse 30.
[time=2933] And he said with what can we compare the kingdom of God?
[time=2936] Or what parable should we use for him?
[time=2939] He said it's like the grain of a mustard seed.
[time=2942] Which when sown on the ground is the smallest of all seeds on earth.
[time=2948] Yet when it is sown and it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants and puts
[time=2956] out large branches so that the birds of the air can make their nest in its shade.
[time=2962] I love that passage.
[time=2963] I love the mustard seed thought.
[time=2965] I want to, have you ever seen a mustard seed?
[time=2968] Some of you I gave you a couple when you came in.
[time=2971] Have you ever seen one?
[time=2972] You want to see a picture of a mustard seed?
[time=2974] I want to show you a picture of a mustard seed.
[time=2977] This is the mustard seed.
[time=2980] What?
[time=2981] It doesn't look like a seed?
[time=2984] I don't look at that and I see a seed.
[time=2987] I see a mustard seed there.
[time=2989] God looks at that and says that's a mustard seed.
[time=2992] It just got sown.
[time=2994] It was little but it turned into something that's a lot.
[time=2999] You want to, I've got some things in my pocket.
[time=3001] What do you think I got in my pocket?
[time=3003] No, I don't.
[time=3006] I don't have seeds in my pocket.
[time=3008] You thought I had seeds in my pocket, didn't you?
[time=3010] You know what I got in my pocket?
[time=3012] I got trees in my pocket.
[time=3017] You don't believe me, do you?
[time=3018] This is a tree.
[time=3019] I've got lots of trees in my pocket.
[time=3023] Have you ever caught a tree?
[time=3026] You want to catch a tree?
[time=3027] You ready?
[time=3031] He didn't play ball.
[time=3033] You want to catch a tree?
[time=3034] You can catch the tree.
[time=3035] There you go.
[time=3036] He got it.
[time=3037] Well, nobody will know.
[time=3038] Just act like you got it.
[time=3039] Be confident.
[time=3043] How many times do we miss the light that God wants to do because we think it's just too small?
[time=3054] I'm going to challenge you.
[time=3056] They don't judge the tree by the seed.
[time=3061] How many times do we judge the tree by the seed?
[time=3063] How many times do we say it's just too small?
[time=3067] God couldn't do something big or something that small.
[time=3071] How many times do we do that?
[time=3072] How many times do I do that in my life?
[time=3075] Do you see the tree in the seed?
[time=3080] Do you see the hope of the world in a barren womb because God did when no one else did?
[time=3088] Do you see leadership potential in that rebellious child?
[time=3093] Now he's preaching.
[time=3098] Do you see a blessing in what all we can tell is just a tragedy?
[time=3105] God does.
[time=3107] And he wants to do a lot with a little.
[time=3111] Some of you came today because you feel like you just are a mustard seed.
[time=3114] And I still remember this guy, I barely remember his name.
[time=3117] I thought this week and remembered his name.
[time=3119] His name was Sean.
[time=3120] I met him in Georgia while we were doing ministry out there a long time ago.
[time=3123] And Sean, I just know him as the mustard seed guy.
[time=3126] As we talked about this passage and how mustard, it only takes the faith of a mustard seed to be saved.
[time=3132] And he came up and with tears in his eyes said, are you telling me that with faith so small that I can't even show you it
[time=3143] because it's so tiny in my hand.
[time=3145] He brought this.
[time=3146] The next week brought a jar, brought a little bag of mustard seeds.
[time=3149] Faith like this that I can be saved.
[time=3151] Is that what you're telling me?
[time=3154] My answer and our answer was no, that's what Jesus is telling you.
[time=3158] When he prayed to receive Jesus, he got baptized and he's led.
[time=3161] I don't know how many people to Jesus since then.
[time=3164] And he carries around mustard seeds.
[time=3166] So I just know him as the mustard seed guy.
[time=3168] You know what I think?
[time=3170] I think somebody else here is another mustard seed guy.
[time=3174] Another mustard seed gal that today you're going to discover what faith the size of a mustard seed can look like.
[time=3181] What it can do in your life.
[time=3183] My favorite part of this story is how there's salvation in the story.
[time=3188] How Jesus is in the story.
[time=3189] This is an Old Testament.
[time=3190] Jesus hadn't come on the scene yet.
[time=3192] But don't you think about a few things with me?
[time=3195] This widow had a huge debt that she could not pay.
[time=3200] She was about to lose everything.
[time=3202] She did.
[time=3203] It's a huge debt.
[time=3204] She could never begin to pay back this debt.
[time=3207] You have a huge debt that you can't pay.
[time=3212] Why?
[time=3213] Because I sinned against God.
[time=3215] Let's just clear this up.
[time=3216] Anybody ever sinned before?
[time=3218] Okay.
[time=3219] Good.
[time=3220] That means this is applicable to everyone in the room.
[time=3222] That's good.
[time=3223] If you know Jesus today, what's the light that God wants to do with the little?
[time=3227] If you don't know Jesus today and you say, what do you mean no Jesus?
[time=3231] Do you have salvation?
[time=3232] Do you know that you'll spend eternity with God in heaven when you die?
[time=3235] Do you know that?
[time=3236] And if you go, yes, I want you to go, yes, today.
[time=3243] I know what your small step is.
[time=3245] It's the picture of salvation in this story that God wants to do a lot with a little.
[time=3251] That you just like the widow have a debt you can never pay.
[time=3255] A debt you can never pay.
[time=3257] You can never pay the price that Jesus already paid.
[time=3260] But that's the beauty.
[time=3261] Just like God's bold provision was seen in this lady's life, your life and my life met bold provision when Jesus came from heaven, left his comfort, left being seated at the right hand of God to come as a humble baby.
[time=3274] Where God again did a lot with a little.
[time=3276] And why did he do that?
[time=3277] For you and for me.
[time=3278] Why, so that he could go to that cross and pay your debt that you could never pay.
[time=3283] He died on that cross for you, paying the price for all the sins of the world.
[time=3288] Your sins, my sins, the price we could never pay because he lived that sinless life we could never live.
[time=3295] And after he did that, he died.
[time=3298] He was buried.
[time=3299] And God showed up again.
[time=3302] And he did a lot with a little.
[time=3305] It was a dire situation, the Savior of the world was in a tomb.
[time=3310] But he said, rise.
[time=3313] And today he's alive and he's well.
[time=3315] And when he came out of that grave, he came out with the victory over death and over sin and over your past and all the skeletons and your closet that Satan uses in your life to tell you not to trust Jesus to save you.
[time=3327] He paid that price.
[time=3328] You're not fighting for victory.
[time=3330] You're fighting from victory when you know Jesus.
[time=3333] And I believe that today is the day of salvation for somebody here.
[time=3337] It's time for you to take that leap of faith and stop playing games with eternity.
[time=3341] And if that's you today, when I ask you just back here as everybody across the building, will you just close your eyes?
[time=3347] And just reflect on what it is God's teaching you today.
[time=3350] If you know Jesus, what's the light that he wants to do with a little?
[time=3357] If you don't know Jesus and I was speaking to you just now, I want you to know that we are all sinners.
[time=3364] Jesus paid that debt for you.
[time=3366] One of my favorite verses is 2 Corinthians 5, 21 where it simply says that he who knew no sin became sin on our behalf so that we could become the righteousness of God.
[time=3378] Salvation begins where I end.
[time=3380] I want to say that again.
[time=3382] Salvation begins where I end.
[time=3384] Today is the day that it's time for you to end.
[time=3386] It's time for you to lay your life down for him.
[time=3389] And it's very simple, I'm not going to lead you in a prayer because I believe your heart is screaming it right now.
[time=3393] It's about your heart.
[time=3394] No prayer can save you, no words can save you today.
[time=3397] It's all about the condition of your heart where you just cry out to Jesus and say, "I do need you Jesus and I lay my life down at your feet.
[time=3406] I can't save me Jesus, so will you save me?" Some of you need to do that right now.
[time=3412] Would you do that?
[time=3413] Just take a moment.
[time=3414] Take a moment and cry out to Jesus where you sit.
[time=3421] Bold faith, bold provision.
[time=3423] What does that mean to you today?
[time=3425] I've got in my hand one of those mustard seeds.
[time=3427] You can't see it because it's so small.
[time=3429] But as I look at these mustard seeds, I just think about the stories that I've told and how, you know, just a small, tiny faith that seems so tiny, seems so small,
[time=3440] seems like it couldn't really do anything, can change not just one's life but one's eternity.
[time=3446] Maybe that's you today.
[time=3447] The story that I've shared with you and the provision that God can bring about, how God can take just a little and do a lot.
[time=3454] Maybe that's the description of your faith.
[time=3457] Maybe today you've reached that point where you have just this faith of a mustard seed and today's that day you're trusting Jesus.
[time=3463] If you've taken that step today, I'm so proud of you.
[time=3466] I'm so proud for you and we cannot wait to walk alongside of you to help you, to give you some next steps.
[time=3473] And part of the way that we want to do that is we'd like to get a booklet in your hand.
[time=3476] This booklet is called Beginning Steps, a Growth Guide for New Believers.
[time=3479] And in its pages, you're just going to simply find some next steps, seven next steps that'll help you plug into the faith that you've now discovered.
[time=3487] Maybe you discovered it a while back, but it's time to re-engage, re-ignite the passion and the fire and the faith that you once had.
[time=3495] Whatever the case may be, no matter what God's doing in your life, we'd love to mail you a booklet.
[time=3499] We'd love to see you in person here at Black Hawk Ministries, hand one off directly in person to you.
[time=3504] No matter what it looks like for you, there's going to be some information on your screen, an email, phone number, that you can reach out to us and we would love to walk with you.
[time=3512] We'd love to hear your story.
[time=3514] We'd love for you just to type out or call in and tell us what God's done, what He's taught you through the Bible Ira, through all of our ministries here at Black Hawk.
[time=3521] And we want to walk with you.
[time=3522] We want to help you discover what the faith, the size of a mustard seed can look like in real life.
[time=3527] I truly believe it's going to be a bold provision.
[time=3529] And that bold provision begins where my self-sufficiency ends.
[time=3534] And with that in mind, I challenge you, go out this week and live out your faith.
[time=3537] Tell other people about your faith.
[time=3539] Tell other people about the decisions that God has led you to make.
[time=3542] And I want to invite you in closing just to come and join us on Easter.
[time=3546] Again, that is really why we do what we do, the fact that Jesus is alive.
[time=3550] Easter is on April the 16th.
[time=3552] And you can go to blackhawkministries.org/easter and get all of the information.
[time=3556] Thank you for letting God work today.
[time=3558] Thank you for allowing us into your life.
[time=3560] And we look forward to next time and invite you to join us again next week.
[time=3563] God bless you.
[time=3564] See you soon.
