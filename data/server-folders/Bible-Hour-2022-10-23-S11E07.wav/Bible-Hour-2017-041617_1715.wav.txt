[time=209] We care about you and we believe that God's got a special word that's going to speak right into your heart today.
[time=215] We're going to be looking at bold faith and the whole premise of this series has been that bold faith really stands out and works the most during uncertain times.
[time=224] I'm guessing that you probably have some uncertainty swirling around in your life personally today.
[time=229] If not, then in the world today, there's certainly a lot of uncertainty that swirls around us and I pray that in your heart, in your life, God really does something new.
[time=238] That he speaks to you in a new way today as we look at this idea of bold vision, how we can see that God is already at work inside of your situation, inside of the uncertainty, and he's going to begin something to you in you today.

[time=609] [MUSIC - 232 seconds]
[time=846] [AMEN] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 168 seconds]
[time=1028] Good morning to my Black Hawk family.
[time=1030] Anybody excited to serve Jesus today? Man, he's been good.
[time=1034] Absolutely. I just love kids. Don't you just love kids?
[time=1038] I just couldn't help but just say something about how we just love your kids.
[time=1042] We love kids here at this church and I can see every time with the little poem branches and every time our kids go to worship. Why Jesus said, "Hey, you can't really enter the kingdom of God unless you become like one of these little children."
[time=1053] I see that every time and I just love it. But I'm so glad that you're here if you're a guest with us.
[time=1058] My name is Kevin, pastor here and it's an honor to just have you here with us today.
[time=1063] I've met a lot of people that are here for the first time already, so thank you for giving of your week being here.
[time=1068] I want to say welcome to our extended Black Hawk family. Whether you're watching us online, whether you're watching us on television, at home,
[time=1075] whatever that looks like, we've got a big family here and it is a privilege just to serve Jesus together as a family.
[time=1081] And so we're closing out today a series that we've been in. This is the sixth week of a series called Bold Faith.
[time=1088] Somebody say Bold Faith. We need some bold faith in this world today because we live in uncertain times.
[time=1095] Have you noticed? So we've been looking at bold faith in uncertain times and today we're going to look at the sixth and final part of that.
[time=1102] And don't worry, if you have missed the messages you can go back on our website, find all of those.
[time=1107] But even if you haven't heard any of them, I believe, I know, that God's got a word for you today.
[time=1112] He's got something for you because we're going to look straight at his word. We're not hearing from me.
[time=1116] We're not hearing from anybody but him today. That's always my prayer.
[time=1120] When I get to preach the word of God is that he speaks not me, and as he does, he's going to change something in your life today.
[time=1126] You ready for it?
[time=1127] You got your Bibles. Look at 2 Kings, 2 Kings, chapter 6. Today I want to share a message with you entitled Bold Vision.
[time=1135] Bold Vision. How many of you would say that at times in your life is hard to see God's presence at work in your life?
[time=1143] How many of you would be honest?
[time=1145] You may know here that it's supposed to be and you believe in your heart that it's there, but there's sometimes in your life where it's hard to see how God's working in the situation that you find yourself planted in.
[time=1156] Can I get amen?
[time=1158] We all have those seasons of our life. Some of you are in that season today and I've got a word that I believe is going to transform how you see, how you see the situation that you're in and how God's going to work through that situation.
[time=1171] Bold Vision. Elisha. That's what we've been doing in this series. Looking at the life of Elisha. Elisha is a prophet of God.
[time=1179] He was the main prophet in the nation of Israel at this time of his life and he had really seen a lot of uncertain times in his life and in his leadership.
[time=1188] And it identifies with me and it identifies with you because he led through those uncertain times and God did things through his bold faith.
[time=1197] And we've been looking at a bold component of Elisha's life each and every single week with this idea that a lot of times we ask God,
[time=1205] we ask God to do bold miracles through our faith that then refuse at times to put ourselves in a position to need the very miracles that we pray for.
[time=1215] God, do big things through me, but don't stretch me. Don't make me uncomfortable. Don't ask me to talk to that person.
[time=1223] You know what I'm talking about?
[time=1226] God does that kind of stuff, doesn't he? A lot of times we end up refusing to put ourselves in those positions because what I would say and call spiritual blindness gets in the way of God's blessings.
[time=1238] So many times I get so spiritually blind that I miss the blessings of God that are ever present in my life.
[time=1245] What God wants us to do like Elisha did with his life is say, God, how can I position myself?
[time=1252] How can I position myself for bold miracles through my bold faith?
[time=1257] How can I position myself to be open to all that you have for my life?
[time=1262] And when I think about Elisha, this is our last week at least for now talking about this prophet, this man of God called Elisha.
[time=1269] What I love about Elisha the most, I wanted to say this on the last week and I want to share it with you now is that Elisha is known as the greater prophet.
[time=1278] If you read about him, you're going to see that phrase come up a lot.
[time=1281] A lot of that's because he performed, think about this, he performed more miracles.
[time=1285] God used him, his leadership, his ministry to perform more miracles than any other prophet in all of the Bible.
[time=1292] In fact, more than anybody else in all of the Bible except for Gessu, Jesus himself, there's a reason for that.
[time=1299] Elisha is called the greater prophet because there was a greater prophet that was yet to come.
[time=1304] There's a greater man in his name is Jesus on a Palm Sunday.
[time=1308] We celebrate the fact that he entered Jerusalem.
[time=1311] He entered Jerusalem to die for you and for me because he had come on to the scene.
[time=1316] Elisha's whole life pointed to this one man named Jesus.
[time=1321] He wasn't even alive at the season of Elisha's life but I love that in the Bible, every single book of the Bible, even the Old Testament books like Second Kings where Jesus was not yet on the scene, they all point to Jesus Christ.
[time=1336] He's in every book of the Bible and I'd love for somebody to prove me wrong with that because I know you can't do it because he is in every book of the Bible.
[time=1343] He's the author and the finisher of our faith and he's got something for you today.
[time=1349] Elisha's whole journey pointed to this greater man who would come named Jesus, even the name Elisha, the Hebrew name, the Hebrew word Elisha's, two Hebrew words, Eli, meaning God, Shah, meaning saves.
[time=1365] His very name says God saves.
[time=1369] He is the God of salvation, he's the God over your life and today's story really is all about his blessings that come from the times that we see him overcome
[time=1378] our spiritual blindness.
[time=1381] So let's look at Second Kings chapter 6.
[time=1383] The first seven verses go, it takes us back to last week, verses one through seven is all about the floating axe head.
[time=1389] If you missed that, go back on our website, find that message about the axe head and how God wants to bring about a bold comeback in your life.
[time=1396] But today we're looking at this bold vision, the very next verse, verse number eight is where we pick up in Second Kings chapter six.
[time=1403] We'll be reading from the ESV, English Standard Version, it's the same version as the Bibles and the seats around you.
[time=1409] Would challenge you to pick one of those up or find it in your app or whatever you're using, join in with us today.
[time=1414] Verse number eight of Second Kings six, who's ready for the word?
[time=1419] I'm going to read just the first few verses here, we'll read verses eight through fourteen to set up our story.
[time=1425] It says, "Once when the king of Syria was warring against Israel, he took counsel with his servant, saying, at such and such place, we shall be my camp."
[time=1436] But the man of God, Elisha, here's where he enters the scene again, sent word to the king of Israel, saying,
[time=1442] "Beware that you do not pass this place, for the Syrians are going down there, and the king of Israel sent to the place about which the man of God told him."
[time=1452] Thus he used to warn him so that it saved himself there more than once or twice.
[time=1458] So what does that mean? Elisha is saying, "Hey, you've got enemies, king of Israel, don't go to this place or that place because that's where they're going to be."
[time=1466] God had given him that insight, so he saved his nation, he saved a lot of wars, he saved a lot of losses over and over.
[time=1472] I love that it says this happened more than once or twice.
[time=1475] Almost like a hint of sarcasm, like God was just all over it did whatever he wanted him used Elisha to do that. It happened a pretty good bit.
[time=1482] And so as you might imagine, this did not set well with the kings that were trying to come against Israel, verse 11.
[time=1488] And the mind of the king of Syria was greatly troubled because of this thing.
[time=1493] I bet it was, and he called his servants and said to them, "Will you not show me who of us is for the king of Israel?"
[time=1500] In other words, there's a mole somewhere, somebody's giving us up, somebody's giving up my plans, who is it?
[time=1506] And so here's what they had to say to him, the servant said, verse 12, "None my lord, O king but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom."
[time=1519] Big brother at its finest, always watching.
[time=1524] Verse 13, I love that verse, verse 13, and he said, "Go and see where he is." Pretty good plan he comes up with here.
[time=1531] "Go and see where he is that I may send and seize him." It was told him, "Behold, he is in Dothan," verse 14.
[time=1539] So he sent there, horses underlined this, horses and chariots going to come back in a few minutes.
[time=1545] He sent there, horses and chariots, and a great army, and they came by night and surrounded the city.
[time=1552] Elisha's living in Dothan, he's been giving up this location, he's been helping the king of Israel, and now they have surrounded the city that he sits in.
[time=1561] You ever felt surrounded?
[time=1563] You ever felt like Elisha would have felt during that time once he knew what was going on?
[time=1567] You ever felt like you just woke up and your day was ruined before it ever got started?
[time=1572] You were already surrounded by the enemy?
[time=1574] Well, that's the story, that's the setup of this story right now, and you may have even noticed that as I studied this week, we had mapped out this series, and we will be talking about this week many, many weeks ago.
[time=1585] But it's the king of Syria, and the word Syria, that location may ring a bell to you, if you've watched the news lately.
[time=1593] It's had quite an impact lately, and it's a heartbreaking one.
[time=1599] And as a pastor, I often get asked, "Pastor, what do you think about all this stuff?"
[time=1605] Oftentimes, maybe you wanted to get baited into a political discussion and whatnot, and so I want to share with you what I think about it, before we dig into this.
[time=1615] Last night, even this morning, our brothers and sisters in Christ, some of you may have not even seen this yet, I was made aware that even this morning, we're bomb.
[time=1623] Palm Sunday, one of the most important weeks, entering Passion Week, where Jesus was making his way to the cross.
[time=1629] But a group of people in Egypt were bomb today, our brothers and sisters in Christ.
[time=1633] Palm Sunday means something different to them than it does to us, and I'm grateful that we feel safe, that we feel secure, but what I think about this situation has nothing to do with politics, and I want to share it with you from my heart to yours today.
[time=1646] What I feel about the state and the situation that we find our world in today, it mirrors the uncertain times that we've been looking at every single week.
[time=1655] Here's what I think, here's what I believe and what I know God wants from his church in times like this.
[time=1661] We're supposed to pray for those who are hurting.
[time=1664] We're supposed to mourn with those who mourn.
[time=1667] We're supposed to bear each other's burdens.
[time=1670] Your heart should be heavy for those who are hurting, those who have lost loved ones. We're also supposed to pray for our leadership and the leadership around the world who are making all these decisions that I'm glad I don't have to make.
[time=1682] We've got to pray for them, but more than any of that, that's the starting place.
[time=1685] Here's what I challenge you to do today, do it with me, take a breath.
[time=1693] Rest in the fact that Jesus is still on the throne.
[time=1696] He's not going to be removed. No one can remove Jesus from the throne.
[time=1701] And what can you do?
[time=1702] How should we respond?
[time=1703] We should do those things I've talked about, but you should simply and fully be the church.
[time=1709] Love those who are different.
[time=1712] Love those who have different perspectives.
[time=1714] Walk with other people who are hurting and be the church of Jesus.
[time=1718] And in so doing, people will see Jesus even through the uncertain times.
[time=1722] Dare I say bold faith in uncertain times.
[time=1725] Like we saw in Elisha's life.
[time=1727] Now that we got that out of the way, let's see how Elisha did that.
[time=1731] What a beautiful picture.
[time=1732] What timing.
[time=1733] It's almost like God knows what he's doing, doesn't he?
[time=1735] He's ahead of us or something.
[time=1736] Imagine that, as I believe he fully is.
[time=1738] Let me give you the bottom line today, and I think it ties us to Palm Sunday.
[time=1742] It ties us to the state of our world.
[time=1744] It ties us to what's going on all around us.
[time=1746] The bottom line today is simply this, that God's strength is best showcased on the stage of my struggles.
[time=1754] You didn't want to hear that, did you this morning.
[time=1757] God's strength is often showcased best on the stage of my struggles.
[time=1763] On the stage of uncertainty.
[time=1766] On the stage of uncertain times in our nation, in our world, and in my life, God's strength is often best highlighted.
[time=1773] Elisha, I already mentioned he did more miracles than any other prophet in the Bible.
[time=1777] And the ones we've been looking at, think about this with me.
[time=1779] The ones that we have looked at, we've looked at six, counting the one we'll look at today.
[time=1784] They all came through the lens of and on the stage of either Elisha's own struggles or the struggles of other people.
[time=1792] They all came on the stage of struggles.
[time=1795] Because I truly believe in the depth of my heart that God's strength is best showcased on the stage of my struggles.
[time=1801] Why? Because if it was my strength and if it was in a time of certainty and strength of my own, I might think I did that.
[time=1809] But God wants to showcase his strength even in the midst of your struggle.
[time=1813] And that's where we find ourselves again. Elisha is surrounded.
[time=1817] You may feel surrounded.
[time=1819] And a lot of times, you know, you say, well, what's so special about Elisha?
[time=1823] I think the main, I've asked myself that through this whole series.
[time=1826] What's so different about Elisha?
[time=1828] I think the bottom line, the common denominator that differentiates Elisha is that he saw through situations.
[time=1835] He saw things. His vision changed how he had a perspective in a situation that made no sense logically.
[time=1843] But spiritually, God used it and did amazing things that only God could do because his strength was best showcased through the lens of all of those struggles.
[time=1853] The story really shows two types of spiritually blind people, those who are believers.
[time=1858] Did you know you can be a believer in Jesus, a follower of Jesus and still be spiritually blind?
[time=1863] You can. We'll show spiritually blind that are believers, but then spiritually blind that are unbelievers.
[time=1869] They didn't know Jesus. They didn't know who God was.
[time=1872] They had yet to see him work in the ways that others had done.
[time=1875] And we're going to see those in this story.
[time=1877] The force of struggles, I think, in my own life as I reflect really usually goes back to a lack of sight, a lack of vision.
[time=1883] I don't see as God sees and therefore my lack of vision leads me to fear, fear.
[time=1892] We don't like using that word. We sung about it today, but fear often grips us because we refuse to put ourselves in a position to see often times as God sees.
[time=1902] I want to ask you a question. How many of you have ever been afraid of the dark before?
[time=1906] Yeah, I was afraid of the dark as a kid. Why are we afraid of the dark?
[time=1911] We can't see. We don't know what's around that corner or in that closet or up under that bed.
[time=1916] We can't see. You ever feel that way in your life? You can't see. You're blind.
[time=1921] And what you don't see, what you don't know is coming, what is uncertain, leads to fear in your life.
[time=1927] So I want to ask you a personal question. Just between you and Jesus, what are you afraid of today?
[time=1935] What in your life is gripped in the clutches of fear?
[time=1940] It holds you back. You wake up thinking about it. You go to bed thinking about it.
[time=1945] You don't know what's coming and it drives you crazy. It consumes you. It caves in on you.
[time=1953] I truly believe that today some of you are going to be liberated from fear.
[time=1957] Not because I can do anything for it, but because Jesus already did everything to defeat it and to destroy it.
[time=1963] And I believe it's going to happen in your life. I want to give you two remedies.
[time=1966] Faith, vision remedies we'll call them. Faith, vision remedies for fear that we see in this story.
[time=1971] But I want to warn you, you ready?
[time=1974] I want to warn you that both of these steps involve action. Somebody say action.
[time=1979] We got to move. We can't sit still if we want bold faith.
[time=1983] Let's look at verses 15 through 23. And as we do, I want to challenge you to notice the vision changes.
[time=1988] This is the rest of the story and then I'm going to give you those two points, those two steps, two remedies to fear. But as we read this, look for how vision, how perspectives shift in this story.
[time=2000] Look for how bold vision leads to bold faith in God working even on the stage of struggles to showcase his strength as we read on verse 15.
[time=2009] When the servant of the man of God, this is after the city was surrounded by night.
[time=2013] The servant of the man of God rose early in the morning and went out behold an army with horses and chariots was all around the city.
[time=2021] And the servant said, alas my master, what shall we do?
[time=2026] You ever woke up that way? I already asked you that.
[time=2029] We wake up and we say, alas, you may not say that and you may say something else.
[time=2034] God help you. I don't know. I've said a lot of stuff at different times of my life too.
[time=2038] Lord, help me. What am I going to do? You woke up and you feel surrounded before you could even put your feet on the floor.
[time=2045] You're surrounded and defeated before the day begins. Well, this is where Elisha was. But I love, love, love verses 16 and 17.
[time=2053] Look at what Elisha has to say. He said, verse 16, do not be afraid.
[time=2061] It's one of the most common commands in all of scripture. We're going to come back to that in a minute, underline that, circle that.
[time=2066] Do not be afraid. Love this. For those who are with us are more than those who are with them.
[time=2072] It's a lot of truth that we need to grab hold of there. Verse 17, then Elisha prayed.
[time=2079] Three of the most powerful words in this whole passage. You should circle them. You should underline them.
[time=2084] You should go back to that. Then Elisha prayed and said, oh Lord, please open his eyes that he may see.
[time=2091] So the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire.
[time=2098] All around Elisha. And when the Syrians came down against him, Elisha prayed to the Lord and said, please strike this people with blindness.
[time=2107] So he struck them with blindness in accordance with the prayer of Elisha.
[time=2111] Now, a lot of scholars would believe they weren't totally blinded. Well, they couldn't see, but they were disillusioned, disoriented.
[time=2117] I don't know exactly what it looked like. I can only imagine. But if they were totally blind, they probably wouldn't do what came next.
[time=2123] But they were definitely disillusioned. God had blinded them to seeing everything that was right in front of them in one way or another.
[time=2130] And then this is what happened in verse 19. And Elisha said to them, this is not the way and this is not the city.
[time=2137] Follow me. I will bring you to the man whom you seek and he led them to Samaria.
[time=2142] Now, Samaria was a capital city. This is where the king of Israel was. This is where all of his armies would have been.
[time=2148] They walked right into the trap because they were blind in verse 20. As soon as they entered Samaria, Elisha said, oh Lord, open the eyes of these men that they may see.
[time=2157] So the Lord opened their eyes and they saw, and behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.
[time=2162] And as soon as the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elijah, my father, shall I strike them down?
[time=2169] Shall I strike them down? It's in their twice. I can picture it like an eager little kid like, ooh, can I get them?
[time=2176] Can I get them? Can I get them like a kid with the candy? Can I eat it? Can I eat it? Can I have it? Can I have it, Mom?
[time=2181] I love that. And he answered another twist in the story, verse 22. You shall not strike them down.
[time=2188] Would you strike down those that you've taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them.
[time=2194] What? Right. Set bread and water before them that they may eat and drink and go to their master.
[time=2200] Another picture of what I think Jesus did and looked like and how he led in life sounds kind of like, love your enemies.
[time=2207] Do good to those who persecute you. Jesus hadn't even said that yet, but yet Elisha was leading that kind of away, verse 23.
[time=2214] So he prepared them a great feast, and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away.
[time=2220] And they went to their master, and I love how this story ends, and the Syrians did not come again on raids into the land of Israel.
[time=2229] I love this story so much to unpack there, but I want to narrow it into two faith vision remedies for fear.
[time=2236] Two things that will help you overcome fear in your life. The first one is this.
[time=2240] Number one, stare through the surface of your situation. There's something more there.
[time=2246] We've looked at this concept a few times throughout this series, but it's seen so clearly in this passage.
[time=2252] You stare through the surface of your situation. A lot of times we get consumed by the surface, by the outlook, by what surrounds us due to our circumstance.
[time=2262] We get consumed by our circumstance. Have you ever been consumed by your circumstance before?
[time=2266] Probably that situation that you thought of when I asked you what you're afraid of came to mind.
[time=2271] A lot of times our fears, they get rooted in what I might not have enough of or I might not be enough of to make it through whatever situation I'm in.
[time=2280] But I believe this that it's not your situation that determines your courage or your faith.
[time=2285] I believe it's how you see your situation that determines your courage and what your faith looks like no matter what situation or circumstance you find yourself in.
[time=2294] You may wake up surrounded like Elisha. You may have woken up surrounded this morning by enemies, by fears, by doubts, by hurts, by pain, by need, by broken relationships.
[time=2308] The list can go on and on and on, but we can stare through that situation to see God at work, to see God's strength even in the situation that's so overwhelming to us.
[time=2319] Because his strength is showcased best on the stage even of our struggles. Elisha is surrounded by enemies, but he saw things other people didn't see.
[time=2327] That was common in his life. Think about it. Think about his stories. A lot of times he would see greatness where other people just saw mediocrity.
[time=2333] A lot of times he would see potential when other people only saw problems.
[time=2337] Like problems, problems Elisha. Step up, problems, problems, but no, I see potential for God to do something big.
[time=2343] Let's think about the six stories that we've looked at in this series.
[time=2347] When everyone else saw Elisha's future in the field, that was his future.
[time=2352] That's all he was going to do. Elisha saw a calling in his faith.
[time=2355] When everyone else saw dusty dryness and thirst where an army was thirsting to death, Elisha saw potential for a river in the desert and it was filled and they drank.
[time=2366] When everybody saw a debt that couldn't be paid with the widow's oil, Elisha saw empty jars that God was ready to fill.
[time=2373] When everybody else saw an incurable disease with name and Elisha saw this potential, this opportunity for skin to be made better than you, for God to heal.
[time=2383] Last week, when everybody else just saw a sunken piece of metal, an axe head that sunk to the bottom of the Jordan River, Elisha saw floating metal.
[time=2392] Elisha saw God bringing back to life that which was lost.
[time=2397] And in this story, while everybody else could only see the surrounding of the enemy in this big city, Elisha saw God's army in the mountains.
[time=2407] And let me tell you that I believe that a lot of times for us to see changes in our life, for us to see God bring about the stuff that he wants to do, we'll have to stare through the surface.
[time=2418] We have to stare through what stares at us to look for his presence in the middle of it. Elisha became good at having that kind of bold vision with his life.
[time=2427] Verse 16, he said, "Don't be afraid. Fear not." One of the most important, one of the most frequent, one of the most common commands in all the Bible. Who said that a lot?
[time=2438] Jesus, over and over. Don't be afraid. Fear not. Don't be afraid. Why did he do that? It's like he knew we were going to be fearful people.
[time=2446] I think he was right. I think he was around fearful people and he knew fearful people would come after him.
[time=2451] And so he said, "Fear not." Just like Elisha did, but then in verse 17, rather, I want to give you a statement that I think will challenge you and help you this week to be more like Elisha with bold faith.
[time=2462] Elisha closed his eyes in order to see. Elisha closed his eyes in order to see. Verse 17, those three words that had you circle, then Elisha prayed.
[time=2475] How many times do we get in the deep depths of the situation of a struggle? And then we realized three months later that we haven't even talked to God about that struggle.
[time=2486] Elisha was the first one to say, "God, this is yours." And he was already working. He was already so in tune with God that he asked them to bring blindness.
[time=2496] And he asked them to open the eyes of his servants so that they could see. And he did just that. But he prayed. He closed his eyes in order to see. Everybody close your eyes for a minute.
[time=2506] Sometimes, for you to see how God is at work in your situation, you just need to close your eyes, tune out the situation itself and look for the strength of our Almighty Savior named Jesus Christ.
[time=2517] I want you to do that in this place today because he wants to speak to you where you're at with your eyes closed. And some of you today, you just closed your eyes and because you have closed your eyes, you're going to see.
[time=2527] You're going to see because God's got a vision for you to see. You can open your eyes, no sleeping. That was not your opportunity to take a nap.
[time=2537] It's possible for us to have eyes wide open, but have eyes that are shut at the same time. Your eyes physically can be wide open, but your spiritual eyes can be wired shut.
[time=2548] How many of you know that you need to wake up two times every morning? Just what you wanted to hear, right? One's plenty hard enough. Can I get amen?
[time=2555] One's plenty hard enough, but you need to wake up two times every morning. You need to wake up physically, but you need to wake up spiritually every single day because you're entering a war zone for your soul, for your family, for your life, and for your faith.
[time=2569] And you have a capable enemy that wants to do nothing more than to seek you out to kill and destroy all the great things that God wants to do in your life.
[time=2577] So you need to wake up physically, yes, but you need to wake up spiritually to see the bold visions, the things that God's doing, even in the ways that He wants to showcase His strength on the stage of your struggles.
[time=2588] Even in that, yes, in that situation. Yes, in that situation. Yes, in that situation. Even that situation. Even the one that you think He can't work through, He is at work.
[time=2599] I truly believe that if you can see through it, you can see it through. If you can see it through it, stare through the surface of your situation.
[time=2608] If you can see through it, then you can see it through. You can see it through because He has already seen it through. He already knows the end of this story.
[time=2616] Stare through the surface of your situation. Number two, seek God's presence within your problem.
[time=2624] A lot of times we run away from the problems that get presented in our life, but seek God's presence inside of within, wrapped up in, right in the heart of the problem that scares you to death every single day.
[time=2635] Look for how God is present there because I truly believe He is. Let me go back to that earlier question.
[time=2641] What are you afraid of? What was your answer when I asked you that earlier? Don't say it out loud, just you.
[time=2648] I'm going to give you a verse about that very thing. Psalm 112 verses 6 and 7 says, "Surely the righteous will never be shaken.
[time=2657] They will be remembered forever. They will have no fear of bad news." I love that.
[time=2665] Their hearts are steadfast, trusting in the Lord. Whatever grips you through fear today, God has already overcome it.
[time=2675] Jesus said, "John 1633, I've told you these things so that in me you can have peace in the world. You will have trouble.
[time=2681] You will have tribulation, but take heart because I have overcome the world. That's why the righteous don't have to be shaken.
[time=2687] That's why we can be a picture of steadiness in a world of instability.
[time=2691] That's why we can look to Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith in such a way that when everything around us crumbles and people see a world that's dissipating a world that's going up and down and it's lacking stability and it's lacking steadiness.
[time=2704] They can look to you and to me and see a church, see the church. You're the church, by the way, if you didn't know who's the church, if you know Jesus, you're the church.
[time=2711] They can see a church that is stable, that is not shaken, that doesn't fear bad news because we know the good news of Jesus Christ.
[time=2721] That'll change how you see. That'll help you see God's presence inside of your problem.
[time=2727] Verse 17 gives us a good picture of what we should do, perhaps, when God doesn't show up the way I thought He would.
[time=2734] Ever been there? I prayed and I prayed like Elisha did, but God didn't show up the way that I thought He would.
[time=2742] You know, when I read this passage, I was looking for things that I have missed in the past, and one really hit me within this story.
[time=2749] When I read this story, I see maybe a prayer of what I would take as, you know, God coming and getting and surrounding me.
[time=2756] Like, it's a picture of, like, God's here. I asked for God's presence, so He surrounds me. He circles me.
[time=2763] And then the enemy's out there. That's what we want, isn't it?
[time=2767] When we pray, we say, "God, protect me from my enemies, insulate me from all the problems," and then, you know, that would be good.
[time=2775] You know, God's here, enemy's there, but you know the problem with that is a lot of times we would think that we had something to do with that.
[time=2781] If we're just insulated and we're in the middle of all of that strength, and a lot of times we ask God to provide His presence to fix our problems,
[time=2789] or to insulate us from our problems, but a lot of times I truly believe, as we see in this passage, God desires to provide His presence to fix our perspective with the problem surrounding us.
[time=2801] That hurts a lot worse than God just circling us, but you notice in this story that God, where was God's army? Where were the chariots and horses of fire?
[time=2811] They were in the mountains, but the Syrian army were surrounding the city.
[time=2817] So what was happening is God's army was outside of the circle that was surrounding Elisha.
[time=2823] The enemy of Elisha was surrounded by God. I want to tell you something that's going to help you this week.
[time=2828] A lot of times we think God insulate me, hide me from my problems, but God wants to use the stage of your struggles and your problems to showcase His strength.
[time=2836] And I want to tell you right now, you need to know that whatever is surrounding you is surrounded by God.
[time=2843] Whatever is surrounding you, yes, it may be surrounding you.
[time=2847] Yes, you may have an enemy bearing down on you, but your enemy is surrounded by a God who can take out that enemy in a second.
[time=2854] In fact, He already has. He's on the throne.
[time=2859] God is surrounding whatever it is that surrounds you.
[time=2864] Now, what does that mean? That means you're still surrounded.
[time=2868] That means you still have that problem staring back at you, just like Elisha did.
[time=2872] God was on the outside of that, more than capable of handling it.
[time=2875] But a lot of times for God to showcase His strength in your situation, He's got to do it through your struggles.
[time=2881] So let me ask you a few questions today as you think about that very thought that God's surrounding.
[time=2886] I love Psalm 120. We'll write that down, by the way. Psalm 121 verse 1. Psalm 121 verse 1.
[time=2891] It popped in my head as I realized. I had this picture of how I thought maybe God was surrounding Elisha, and then the enemies were outside of that circle.
[time=2898] But no, God was surrounding what surrounded Elisha. He was still in the middle of it.
[time=2902] Psalm 121 verse 1 says, "I lift my eyes to the hills.
[time=2906] Where does my help come from? My help comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth."
[time=2914] God is surrounding whatever it is that surrounds you.
[time=2917] What if God wants to show you His strength through your struggle?
[time=2921] What if God wants to show you His purpose through your problem?
[time=2925] What if God wants to show you His help through your hardship?
[time=2930] I believe He does.
[time=2932] A lot of times, I think God often asks us to be afflicted with the very disease that He's called us to cure.
[time=2938] Think about that for a minute.
[time=2940] Many times, God wants us to be afflicted with the very disease that He's calling us to cure.
[time=2945] I could be talking about health issues, but it could not be health issues.
[time=2949] It could be relationship struggles. It could be financial troubles.
[time=2952] And God needs you to be afflicted with the very thing that He's going to use you to reach your hands into as the hands and feet of Jesus and touch other people with.
[time=2960] It's pretty hard to help other people when you haven't been through the hardship that they're facing.
[time=2964] Have you ever noticed that?
[time=2966] God wants to take your hardship and use it to help other people be pointed to Jesus because He wants to stick His hands in that situation.
[time=2973] He wants people to see His presence inside of that problem.
[time=2978] And that's exactly what was happening in Elisha's life.
[time=2982] His presence was all over that problem.
[time=2985] So here's what I want you to do this week. Everybody ready for this? Stretch your neck a little bit.
[time=2990] Got an exercise for you.
[time=2992] This week, when you feel surrounded, I want you to do one thing.
[time=2995] It's what I think Elisha really did here. I want you to blink.
[time=2998] Blink. Go ahead. I know you want to try it now, so go ahead.
[time=3001] Just blink.
[time=3002] The rub your eyes a little if necessary. If the blinking's not working, rub both of your eyes if necessary.
[time=3007] But look for God's presence. Seek out God's presence inside of your problem.
[time=3011] Share through your situation to see the strength of the Lord at work even in the midst of your struggles.
[time=3018] Blink this week. And I think you'll find Him. Blink this week.
[time=3022] And I think you'll see that Jesus is doing something to change how you can see your problems.
[time=3028] Let me share this with you. Sometimes when we're praying for God to show up.
[time=3032] You ever done that?
[time=3034] Sometimes when we're praying for God to show up, He wants simply to open our eyes to see that He's all ready there.
[time=3040] Do you think God just all of a sudden showed up in the mountains and the hills of this story?
[time=3046] He was already there.
[time=3048] Do you think it surprised God that this enemy surrounded Elisha? He was already there.
[time=3053] They may have set up camp overnight, but God set up camp before they were born.
[time=3057] He's already there.
[time=3059] So sometimes when you're praying for God to show up, He just wants to open your eyes in this moment.
[time=3064] To open your eyes for you to see He's all ready there.
[time=3068] And you know what's even better about that? Not only is He already there, He's never going away.
[time=3074] He's not leaving you. He will never leave you. He will never forsake you.
[time=3077] And He's just getting started and showing you what that can look like in your life.
[time=3081] Sometimes He wants us to look past our hardship to see the help that we had in place the whole time.
[time=3089] We're never limited, I don't believe, by God's capability. Can I get a name in?
[time=3093] We serve a capable God. But we're never limited by His capability, but we can be limited by our own capacity to see what He is capable of doing.
[time=3103] That's what limits us. The capability of God, His capacity is not what limits you in your life.
[time=3110] But we can be limited by our own capability, our own capacity to see what He's capable of doing.
[time=3117] And He wants to do something new in you in this moment today.
[time=3120] The question is, do I see it? Not is He there, no? Can I see it?
[time=3124] Can I see the horses and chariots of fire in the mountains where my help comes from the Lord?
[time=3130] He's there. He's not leaving you. He's not forsaking you.
[time=3134] And God's strength is showcased best on the stage of our struggles at times.
[time=3139] And I want you to think about the cross. This Palm Sunday as we look towards Easter, before Easter came, before Sunday came, Friday had to happen.
[time=3148] On Friday, Jesus died the most brutal death that any of us could ever imagine.
[time=3153] It's the perfect picture of God showcasing His strength on the stage of struggles, on the stage of weakness.
[time=3161] Have you ever thought about the fact that our very emblem of faith, the cross?
[time=3166] You see the cross everywhere. We're around our necks. We hang it everywhere.
[time=3169] We put it up. It's on the front of our building because it represents our faith.
[time=3172] It represents how we have hope.
[time=3174] But have you ever thought about the fact that the very emblem of our faith is actually in all reality, an emblem, a picture, a tangible place of death
[time=3185] and of destruction and of struggle?
[time=3189] God took that which meant nothing but death, nothing but hell, nothing but hurt.
[time=3195] And He turned it into the emblem of hope that you and I cling to on a daily basis.
[time=3201] God's strength is best showcased on the stage of my struggles, of your struggles and of my struggles.
[time=3207] And I want you to know today that you can stare through the surface of that situation and you can see God's presence in your problem and Jesus will make Himself known in ways that will change your life, in ways that will change your eternity, in ways that will change your faith into a faith that is a bold faith that stands out even in the darkest of circumstances, even in the most uncertain of times.
[time=3230] I want to ask you just to close your eyes and reflect for a moment on what that may mean for you.
[time=3234] What does it mean that you serve a God whose presence is inside of your problem?
[time=3240] A God who even in the midst of your struggle wants to showcase His strength.
[time=3247] If you've known Jesus for quite some time, then today God wants to show you something new.
[time=3254] God wants to stretch you in your faith to go places you've never been before.
[time=3260] What does that look like for you?
[time=3261] Some of you are here and you would say right now in this moment that God has revealed to you that you just don't have that personal relationship.
[time=3267] And as we've talked about the fact that God turned this emblem of death, the cross that Jesus died on, turned it into a symbol of hope.
[time=3278] You're grasping that for the first time and you would say, "I just don't know that if I were to die today, pastor, that I would spend eternity in heaven with this Jesus who came to save me." I want to know that. I want to believe that, but I don't know.
[time=3290] But I want to know and I want you to know in this moment right here in this place today that the same God who was the God of Elisha, the same God who stepped into Jerusalem
[time=3303] with those palm branches riding a donkey, that different kind of king
[time=3309] that ended up on that cross for you.
[time=3311] That same Jesus is looking at you and loving you right now.
[time=3317] Yes in the midst of your struggles.
[time=3319] Yes in the midst of your sin.
[time=3321] It's nothing compared to him.
[time=3323] And some of you need to embrace that today.
[time=3325] Salvation comes from us laying me down at the foot of the cross.
[time=3328] What does that mean?
[time=3329] It means I surrender.
[time=3330] It means I trust him to save me and stop trusting me to save me.
[time=3335] It means I believe he died for me.
[time=3337] It means I believe he's alive.
[time=3339] And it means I say, "Jesus, I give you me." Yes, it's that simple.
[time=3344] Don't believe the lies of the enemy who tells you it can't be that simple.
[time=3347] Jesus made it that simple for you and for me.
[time=3351] Turn away from you.
[time=3353] Turn away from this life that you've held on to and turn it over to him and trust him.
[time=3357] I'm not going to lead you in a prayer because I think your heart's screaming it in your own words.
[time=3361] No prayer saves you.
[time=3362] It's the condition of your heart.
[time=3363] It's you crying out to God.
[time=3364] You can do that in the silence.
[time=3366] We're out loud in this moment.
[time=3368] Will you do that?
[time=3369] Will you take a moment if you've never done that and just say, "Jesus, I'm yours.
[time=3372] Please save me." If that's you, you'll never regret it.
[time=3376] Do it right now.
[time=3381] I pray you've been blessed.
[time=3382] I pray that God has shown you something new.
[time=3385] Maybe you didn't see something that has been there the whole time.
[time=3389] Maybe it's time for you to stare through the situation that's been troubling you.
[time=3394] But then the problem that you're facing God's presence has been revealed to you within that problem.
[time=3399] And you've seen that he's been there and he's been at work.
[time=3402] Maybe something new has happened inside of you in your faith.
[time=3404] Maybe you are one of those people today that would say, "Today's the day of my salvation." As you've talked about, the gospel, I haven't really understood it.
[time=3413] I haven't known how simple Jesus really did make it.
[time=3416] That it really is all about the fact that Jesus paid the price I could never pay.
[time=3420] Because he died, the death that I could never die, because he lived the sinless life that I could never live.
[time=3425] He paid that price for me.
[time=3427] And while he was on that cross, I was on his mind.
[time=3429] And Jesus today, I give you me.
[time=3431] Maybe that's been the cry of your heart as we've looked at.
[time=3434] It really is that simple.
[time=3436] You do have an enemy who wants to whisper in your ear and tell you it can't be that simple.
[time=3440] It really couldn't apply to somebody like me.
[time=3443] But I want you to know that when Jesus died on that cross, when he rose from the grave, he thought about you.
[time=3449] And today is the day of your salvation.
[time=3452] If that's you, let us know.
[time=3453] Take a minute.
[time=3454] Whatever you've got to do, step aside, push pause, make sure that you lay your life down at the foot of the cross, saying, "Jesus, I'm yours."
[time=3462] And if you do that, the Bible promises and God looks you right in the eye, right into the depths of your soul and your heart today and says, "You shall be saved."
[time=3471] I pray that that happens in your life.
[time=3473] And if it has, maybe God's doing something new inside of you.
[time=3476] Maybe he taught you something about a situation or a problem that you're facing right now.
[time=3480] If you have taken a step of faith, maybe you need to be baptized.
[time=3483] Maybe you need to connect to a life group.
[time=3485] We call those life groups here because they're just small communities of people that we want to get you connected with.
[time=3490] That helps a big church feel small, helps you do life alongside of other people.
[time=3495] They have the same problems, the same situations, the same struggles so that you don't do life alone because we believe life is better together.
[time=3503] Whatever it may mean for you, let us know.
[time=3505] There's going to be some information on your screen, phone number, email address.
[time=3508] Reach out to us.
[time=3509] Tell us the story that is yours.
[time=3511] Tell us about what God has taught you.
[time=3513] Tell us about the decision that God's leading you to make.
[time=3516] We even have a booklet we'd like to get in your hands.
[time=3518] It's simply called beginning steps, a growth guide for new believers.
[time=3521] And this booklet's just going to give you some steps that will help you take forward steps, forward progress in your faith.
[time=3528] We're so excited, so excited about what God's doing in your life.
[time=3532] We cannot wait to see you soon, to walk with you, to support you, and to be a team with you.
[time=3538] We believe church is a team sport, and we're in this thing together.
[time=3541] Thank you for watching.
[time=3542] Thank you more importantly for just allowing Jesus to speak into your heart, speak in your life today.
[time=3546] I can't wait to see you next week.
[time=3548] We'll be kicking off a new series.
[time=3549] I invite you to join us.
[time=3550] You won't want to miss it.
[time=3551] We're going to be talking about relationships.
[time=3553] I'm guessing that you've got one.
[time=3555] And I'm guessing that those could probably go a little bit better.
[time=3558] And God's got a word for you. Join me next week as we continue just to grow together in our faith as Jesus works in our lives.
[time=3564] God bless.
