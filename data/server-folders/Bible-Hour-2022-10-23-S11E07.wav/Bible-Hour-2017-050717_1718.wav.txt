[time=346] Thank you so much for watching today, and my prayer for you today is that God will just really work in your life as we continue just looking at relationships.
[time=354] You've got them, I've got them, but a lot of times they need work, and I'm glad as we look at what it means to be the better half today, that Jesus was that and is that in our relationships.
[time=364] He meets us right where we are.
[time=367] That's what we hope that today's program can do for you as we look at God's word, as we celebrate, as we just look at what He has for us, that Jesus will meet you where you are, and you'll be open to receive that as will we all.
[time=378] So I want to invite you as we continue to worship today and build towards today's message just to connect with us.
[time=384] There are so many things going on here at Black Hawk Ministries, and we want to invite you to just plug into those areas.
[time=391] So there's a lot of ways you can stay connected with us and know what's happening.
[time=395] One of my favorite is our church app. We have an app, you can just search in your app store, just Black Hawk Church app, and you'll find us there.
[time=401] You can stay connected with us with all of our events, submit prayer requests, lots of different venues for you to connect with us all in that one place.
[time=409] The same thing for you is the website, BlackhawkMinistries.org.
[time=413] On the homepage there you can sign up for our newsletter.
[time=416] It's one of our main ways we communicate and just make sure you're up to date on all of the stuff that's going on.
[time=421] We have stuff going on for every age group. We have small group opportunities.
[time=425] We call them life groups because we believe in doing life together, and they meet seven days a week.
[time=431] So no matter what your schedule is, we have a group that I believe can meet your schedule.
[time=435] And our commitment is if one doesn't, we'll start one that can meet your schedule and you might even be a part of that.
[time=441] And so you've got a lot of ways to stay connected with us, including social media.
[time=444] You can look for @BhawkMinistries on Twitter or Instagram, or just search for BlackhawkMinistries on Facebook.
[time=451] And we'd love to see you there. Sit back, relax, take a breath, we'll continue to worship.
[time=456] And I'll be back with you to share momentarily.
[time=459] In every relationship there are two halves.
[time=462] In an ideal relationship, there is give and take.
[time=466] Both sides strive toward harmony.
[time=469] But not every relationship is ideal.
[time=472] Sometimes relationships experience conflict.
[time=476] Conflict leads to distance.
[time=479] It leads to isolation.
[time=482] When you see the relationship drift to isolation, be the better half.
[time=488] Well, good morning, my Blackhawk family.
[time=502] First things first, if you're new with us, you wonder what is the deal with the cookies and the Oreos.
[time=508] And so I'm about to tell you just that we're doing a series called The Better Half.
[time=513] And we're looking at how there really are two halves to every relationship.
[time=517] This is the statement that guides our entire series.
[time=520] There are two halves to every relationship.
[time=523] So make yours the better half.
[time=526] And so you know like the Oreos, when you twist one off, depending on whether you're the chocolate guy or the cream guy or girl, there's a better half.
[time=534] So I think that we're called as Christians.
[time=537] We are called as followers of Jesus to be the better half as we serve him today.
[time=543] So that's what it's all about if you're new with us.
[time=545] If you are not new with us and you were here last week, I want you to know I know what's on the forefront of your mind.
[time=551] And that question is, are you going to give out more Oreos?
[time=555] As I gave out some last week, there he is.
[time=557] He's in the same spot back there.
[time=559] I gave out a big package last week and so I've got good news for you.
[time=562] I'm giving out twice as many Oreos today.
[time=565] And the criteria was twofold and it's the same this way that you've got to be enthusiastic.
[time=571] If you're going to come get Oreos like this, then you get no Oreos.
[time=577] You've got to be enthusiastic about Oreos, but you've got to be enthusiastic about being the better half.
[time=581] Who's with me?
[time=583] All right.
[time=585] I see some enthusiasm.
[time=587] Raise your hand if you want one.
[time=588] All right.
[time=589] There's an enthusiastic lady.
[time=590] Come on up.
[time=591] And then let's go somewhere over.
[time=593] I'm not going to forget about you balcony.
[time=595] Your time's coming.
[time=596] All right.
[time=597] And you back there.
[time=598] Come on up.
[time=599] Come get your Oreos.
[time=600] Got double stuff today.
[time=601] How many of you like the cream part?
[time=604] You were hoping for the big package, weren't you?
[time=609] But she was still enthusiastic anyway.
[time=611] And they're double stuff.
[time=612] So you can't go wrong with that.
[time=614] Go be the better half, ladies.
[time=616] Thanks for being here.
[time=617] Thank you for being the better half.
[time=622] We're in the second week of this series.
[time=624] And I want to tell you, it's such a joy to see people digging into relationships.
[time=628] And if you're watching us maybe not from this room or you're part of our extended family at Black Hawk, we have a big extended family through streaming online and television.
[time=637] If that's you, then welcome.
[time=639] Thank you for joining us today.
[time=640] I'm sorry.
[time=641] I can't hand you some Oreos.
[time=642] That's why you should come and join us.
[time=644] Can I get a name in?
[time=645] We have a good time at Black Hawk.
[time=647] Thanks for being here.
[time=648] Today is the second week of this series.
[time=650] Better half.
[time=651] And I want to talk about words that burn.
[time=654] Words that burn.
[time=656] And you're going to see why as we go through this passage in James chapter 3.
[time=660] So if you've got your Bibles, then grab one.
[time=663] Look along with me.
[time=664] James chapter 3, the first 10 verses.
[time=666] Look along in your apps.
[time=667] I'll be reading from the ESV, English Standard Version today.
[time=670] If you want to share the same version, we do have Bibles in the seats around you as well.
[time=675] But join in with us today.
[time=676] Let me ask you a question.
[time=678] Do you ever have moments where words are leaving your mouth and then your brain catches up?
[time=688] I'm glad to know it's not just me.
[time=690] Your brain catches up and you try to do this number, but they're already going.
[time=695] The words have left the building and it is too late to do anything about them.
[time=700] And you know the thing about words is they have the potential, I truly believe this.
[time=705] Words may be the biggest relationship burner known to man.
[time=711] A lot of times we say it's actions.
[time=713] It's actions speak louder than words.
[time=715] And while I think there's a lot of truth to that statement and it's hard to classify each of those things, a lot of things can burn down a relationship.
[time=722] But usually any situation where a relationship is burning, words were right at the heart of the situation.
[time=731] And you know that because you have spoken those words before.
[time=734] Can I get a name in?
[time=736] And you know that because you've had those words spoken to you before.
[time=739] Can I get a name in?
[time=741] We've all been in those shoes and words truly matter because words truly burn and have a lot to do with our lives.
[time=748] And so my question for you today is this are words currently in this season of relationships in your life.
[time=754] Are words a building tool or a breaking or maybe a burning tool in your relationships?
[time=761] And the new living translation Proverbs 10, 19 says this.
[time=765] I love the new living translation version of it because it just gets straight to the heart of the issue.
[time=769] It says too much talk leads to sin, be sensible and keep your mouth shut.
[time=774] New living translation.
[time=777] And there's a lot of truth to that.
[time=779] Sometimes if I could just do this, my life would be a lot better off sometimes.
[time=785] My relationships would look a lot different.
[time=787] Let's look at James chapter three.
[time=789] I want to talk about those words that burn.
[time=791] We're going to mainly answer two questions that I'll get to in just a moment.
[time=794] You do have notes and you can get those out that came with your bulletin or take notes however you please today.
[time=799] So James chapter three, who's ready for the word?
[time=802] Verses one and two is what I'll start by reading. The first has to do with teaching.
[time=807] And some of you are teachers, maybe in a school, maybe in a church setting with Sunday school or groups, life groups we call them here.
[time=815] Or maybe you teach in different ways like with your kids at home, but I would argue all of us are teachers in one way or another.
[time=821] But I will say something about our teaching here at Blackhawk through this verse.
[time=824] And then there's what I would say maybe, if you're ready for this, maybe verse two may be the most unifying verse in all of the Bible.
[time=832] Alright, let's read it together.
[time=834] James chapter three verse one, "Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness."
[time=842] I'll pause there and I want you to know that verse, we believe that verse because we believe the Bible here at Blackhawk.
[time=849] And we take teaching very seriously when I'm speaking whoever's on this platform, every word that is spoken in leadership and teaching capacities at Blackhawk.
[time=858] We always want the word to have the last word.
[time=862] We don't want anybody up here that's just going to tell you opinion.
[time=866] And today I'm going to tell you, I'll tell you a little bit about my opinion, but I'll always try to tell you that, hey, this is my opinion, take it for what it's worth.
[time=872] Every single day, every single message, every single time we preach, we want God's word to have the last word, just so you know.
[time=880] Verse two, now it starts to get really practical and narrowed down.
[time=884] Again, the most unifying verse in all of the Bible may be, verse two, "For we all stumble in many ways, can I get a witness?
[time=893] For we all stumble in many ways, and if anyone does not stumble in what he says, he's a perfect man."
[time=902] A little sarcasm there maybe, I think so.
[time=905] Also able to bridle his whole body.
[time=909] Great passage here, more to come, but I want us to look at this concept of communication, and how many of you have noticed that in relationships, communication tends to get more and more broken as the relationship grows,
[time=922] and as the relationship continues.
[time=925] So if you don't believe me, I've got what I'll call the five stages of the buried cold, and so if you get a cold, you catch a cold while you're married, this may be what it would look like in the first year, and then we'll go to the second and third.
[time=936] I read this somewhere I don't know where, but I think it could maybe hit home with some of us, not me of course, but maybe you.
[time=943] Baby darling, first year, I'm so worried about that sniffle, so I've called the paramedics to rush you to the hospital, and I know you hate hospital food, so I'm having some meals catered in just in case you have to stay.
[time=954] Second year, sweetheart, I really don't like the sound of that cough, so I've arranged for the doctor to make a house call, let me tuck you in.
[time=963] Aw, third year, hey, you look like you've got a fever.
[time=969] Why don't you drive yourself over to the CVS and get you some medicine, and I'll watch the kids for you.
[time=976] Fourth year, look, be sensible, after you fed and bade the kids and washed all the dishes, you really should go to bed.
[time=985] Fifth year, I'm going to get worse, right? Fifth year, for Pete's sake, do you have to cough so loud? I can't hear the TV.
[time=995] Would you mind going in the other room while my show is on? You sound like a barking dog.
[time=1001] One guy said, "You know, in the first year of my marriage, my wife used to bring me my slippers, and the dog would come barking.
[time=1008] Now my dog brings me the slippers." The rest of you will get that later, and if you didn't get it, you should probably drop it.
[time=1020] It has nothing to do with where we're trying to go in the sermon, right? Can I get a name in? There we go.
[time=1024] The bottom line today is simply this. We are called to do this with our words, with our communication, reverse the ratio.
[time=1034] Reverse the ratio of my words. Write that down if you're taking notes. Let me make some sense of what I mean by reversing the ratio.
[time=1041] There's an institution that's done some research on marriage and family and relationships and words, and it's called the Gottman Institute.
[time=1048] And so they've done a lot of studies and so a lot of percentages, a lot of comparisons as to how we speak and what it does to our relationships.
[time=1056] Here's what they found that in everyday conversation, the average person would average six criticisms to every one encouragement.
[time=1069] Six criticisms to every one encouragement. That means for every time you say, "You really look nice today."
[time=1077] You say, "I thought you were going to go to the gym. I thought you were going to clean up the living room.
[time=1083] I thought this, or maybe you should this." We give out six criticisms on average in comparison to every one encouragement.
[time=1092] You get the reverse the ratio bottom line now. And then the research has been done, the suggested impact on relationships, what the ratio should look like.
[time=1101] It's basically a reverse of that. It should be at least a five to one encouragement to criticism ratio.
[time=1106] No, it's not from a verse in the Bible, but I just think it's pretty true. I think Dan Cathy even said it well, true at Cathy rather, true at Cathy said this about encouragement.
[time=1115] I think he pegged it really well. He said that the universal international sign you can use to determine if someone needs encouragement is if they're breathing.
[time=1126] I think that's pretty well said. You need encouragement. The other half of your relationship, they need encouragement.
[time=1136] Well, I encourage them enough, but do you? Does God want to reverse the ratios a bit in that relationship to help you be the better half in that relationship?
[time=1144] I've tried this before. I tried one time. I know going an entire day without giving any criticisms out. You know what I noticed? I didn't talk much that day.
[time=1157] Maybe you should take me up on that challenge as well and try to go a whole day without handing out a criticism.
[time=1163] You'll recognize and realize how true those ratios can be in your life. But today, here's what I want to do.
[time=1170] I want to help you with that journey because it's one thing to say we need to reverse the ratios and then we can say amen and now go do it.
[time=1176] But we all know that's a lot harder to do than to hear said to you. Can I give the name in?
[time=1184] Two questions. Two big questions about your words. I want to first look at the question of what do my words do?
[time=1190] What do my words do? And then I want to look at the question that we all are going to be asking as we go through this passage.
[time=1196] What do I do with my words? Let's look at what my words do and then let's look at what I can do with my words.
[time=1202] Let's start with question number one, verses two through eight. We'll see here in this passage. We'll go back to verse two where we just looked at the most unifying verse that maybe you'll read in all of Scripture.
[time=1212] And that is we all stumble in many ways, especially with our words at times. So what do my words do? Words do a couple of things.
[time=1219] The first one, if you want to fill it in in your notes, words control. Words control. They control so much of our lives. Look at verses two through five with me.
[time=1230] Right after he says, we all stumble in many ways and if you don't stumble, he says, well, you're a perfect man with maybe a hint of sarcasm there.
[time=1238] And then if you are a perfect man, he says at the end of verse two, you're also able to bridle his whole body.
[time=1244] Verse three, let's look there together. If we put bits into the mouths of horses so that they obey us, we guide their whole bodies as well.
[time=1254] Verse four, look at, he gives a couple of illustrations, the horses now to the ships. In verse four, look at the ships also.
[time=1260] Though they are so large and driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs.
[time=1270] So also, the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great things.
[time=1276] I love those two illustrations because we have horses, Jessica and I have horses and we love horses for quite some time.
[time=1283] And they can be scary animals. They're big. Talk to some of you and I know you're fearful of horses, not naming any names.
[time=1290] But it's a scary thing to look at horses and they can do a lot with you. If they decide they want you off their back, you're not going to stay on their back.
[time=1298] I don't care how good of a rodeo person you may be. But when they're well trained, a bit in their mouth can guide their whole body.
[time=1305] And some of you may not know what a bit looks like so I brought one. This is small, teeny, tiny little bits.
[time=1312] So this goes in their mouth. The rains will attach. I'm not putting it in my mouth because I don't know where this thing has been.
[time=1317] But it goes in their mouth and you can guide their whole body with this one little tiny bit.
[time=1324] And then I like the illustration of the ships there as well. I like that scripture reminds us even though those ships are driven around by strong winds.
[time=1333] I love the application to life there. That even when we are in the midst of situations that feel heavy, that feel burdensome, and that feel like they're going to overtake and overwhelm us.
[time=1344] Even though the winds of life blow us to and fro, we've got just like a rudder steers of ship. We've got this little thing called the tongue that impacts so much of our lives.
[time=1355] Scripture reminds us that the power of life and death is in the tongue.
[time=1359] It's a lot of truth to this passage here. And James is reminding us what our words could do. They control us.
[time=1365] Your words weigh a thousand pounds. You ever noticed that? Words have made you see yourself in certain ways today. I can just about promise you that.
[time=1375] The words that have been spoken over your life have helped you define who you are as a person.
[time=1380] Some of you've been told you'll never amount to anything. Some of you've been told that you're only going to end up in prison one day.
[time=1387] Some of you've been told that you'll never be successful. Some of you've been told that you're this name or that name.
[time=1393] And it shapes and affects you, doesn't it? It's real.
[time=1397] I'm glad I serve a God who's bigger than the winds of the sea, this bigger than the words from the mouths of those who want to tear us down.
[time=1406] Because when God looks at you today, you should know, you should know that if you know Jesus as your Savior today,
[time=1412] God does not look at the words that have been spoken over your life because He is the word who came into your life and defines everything and removes all of the things that have torn you down.
[time=1422] That have torn you down for all of these years. You do not have to be torn down. Celebrate it.
[time=1428] You don't have to be torn down by the words that have been spoken over your life any longer.
[time=1435] Some of you came today because you needed to hear that. However, I do know that those words still have an impact in your life.
[time=1441] They stick. Words stick so much in our lives. Your mouth controls a lot of your direction. It weighs a thousand pounds.
[time=1449] Sometimes we try to pick our words back up after they've been said. It's kind of like this.
[time=1453] If I were to back over you with my car and get out, you know, we'll say, "Well, I know I said that, but I didn't mean it."
[time=1460] You ever said that? I didn't mean it. So we can move on.
[time=1465] Well, it was kind of like those words. Then your brain caught up. They still came out. The words have left the building.
[time=1470] It's kind of like me saying something just like I would back over you with my car and get out and say, "Oh man, I really didn't mean to back over you with my car and then get mad at you because your leg's broken and you can't walk.
[time=1480] Get up. What's your problem? Get up and move." So be careful with your words.
[time=1485] They weigh a thousand pounds as we well know in our lives.
[time=1488] And the second thing that words do is they consume. They don't just control. They also consume.
[time=1493] They consume like a fire. That's what we'll see here beginning in verse five. Look there with me.
[time=1499] The end of verse five there. He says, "So also the tongue is a small member, but it boasts of great things."
[time=1506] And then the end of verse five, it says, "How great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire."
[time=1513] The tongue is a fire. Look at somebody say, "You're on fire. You're on fire."
[time=1522] That tongue of yours is a fire. Love this passage. The tongue, verse six, is a fire. A world of unrighteousness.
[time=1529] The tongue is set among our members, staining the whole body. It affects everything, continues.
[time=1535] Setting on fire, you ever met anybody like this?
[time=1540] Setting on fire, the entire course of life. And this is my favorite part maybe, maybe for impure reasons.
[time=1549] I'm not yet sure, but it's here and so we can have a little fun with it. And set on fire by hell.
[time=1556] Some of you are like, "I'm going to use that verse this week." You already circled it in underlined it, didn't you? That is not what being the better half is all about.
[time=1565] You can't go tell your spouse or that person that they're tongue is set on fire by hell.
[time=1570] It's not going to help the relationship. You won't be the better half.
[time=1574] But now that I did my duty and said that, I do love that that's in there because I've met a few of those people.
[time=1579] And I've been that person.
[time=1582] I've had those moments where my tongue was the one that was set on fire by the unrighteousness and by the motives of our enemy from the depths of hell.
[time=1592] I've watched how words can tear down and ruin lives, verse seven.
[time=1597] It's hard to tame it, isn't it? That's James's point here in verse seven, "For every kind of beast and bird of reptile and sea creature can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind." Verse eight, "But no human being can tame the tongue.
[time=1611] It is a restless, evil, full of deadly poison."
[time=1617] Mm.
[time=1619] I just wanted to pick the most encouraging passage in the Bible for you today.
[time=1624] You feel encouraged yet? We're going to reverse the ratio just a minute, I promise.
[time=1629] As we've looked at and talked about today, your words consume.
[time=1632] And I got to admit, you ready for some confession? Confession is good for the soul.
[time=1637] I'm not sure if Christian Whitmer, our outreach pastor is in here.
[time=1640] You saw him on stage a few minutes ago, but we did some ministry together in Georgia.
[time=1643] I was a campus pastor.
[time=1645] And as a campus pastor in Georgia, I was also over a big college ministry that we had there.
[time=1650] And so we had a huge group of college kids right down the road from University of West Georgia is where we were.
[time=1656] And so they all came, some big college there.
[time=1658] They came to our campus.
[time=1659] We were about a mile and a half down the road from when they came, and they wanted to do this big, huge bonfire.
[time=1665] And if I ever cringe, if you say, "I'd like to do a bonfire at Black Hawk and I cringe, you're about to know why."
[time=1671] Because we did this big bonfire. We set it up great.
[time=1674] We blocked it all off. It was done so well.
[time=1677] Everything about the event was an absolute home run.
[time=1681] It was great.
[time=1683] And then at the end, I was really tired.
[time=1686] And Christian was there with me, and we decided, you know, there's some pretty responsible college kids.
[time=1692] You already see where this story starts to turn, don't you?
[time=1698] And they said, "We'll stay with the fire. We just don't want to stop roasting the s'mores." And it's like, "Well, you better make sure that you put this fire out before you go home." It's a simple task. Can you do that?
[time=1708] Yes, I've got it.
[time=1710] So I went home next morning.
[time=1714] Got a text from one of the pastors at the church.
[time=1718] And the grass, this was probably, I don't know, 100 yards behind the church building.
[time=1724] The grass from the bonfire, all the way, I can't even get it out of my mouth.
[time=1730] These words, yeah, all the way to the church building had burned.
[time=1736] It was black.
[time=1738] I almost burned the church down.
[time=1742] It didn't praise God. I don't know how it went out, but it went out. I'm so glad.
[time=1747] Or you may not even see me today because I probably would have never worked in the church again.
[time=1751] The guy who burned his churches down.
[time=1754] Christian was a part of it, too, given him a hard time when he sinned.
[time=1759] He called our executive pastor, a great friend of mine. He said it's going to be with the Lord.
[time=1763] I'll never forget going.
[time=1767] Picking up the phone and saying, "Before I finish this..." This is probably not the best way to start, but this is how I started.
[time=1774] "Before I finish this sentence, know that everything's okay." And he said, "Get to the point. What's wrong?" I said, "I almost burned down our west campus, but it didn't burn down, but the grass is really black."
[time=1788] And he just said, "You know, that's okay. I'm glad everything's okay." And he showed lots of grace with his words, but I didn't know what kind of words I get back.
[time=1796] But that's the same thing that can happen in your life and in mine, is it not?
[time=1800] One little spark. It only took one poor decision. You would say, "Well, that's not a little poor decision, Kevin.
[time=1805] There's no way I would have made that decision. You're probably right." But it only took one little spark from that fire to set ablaze the entire campus that I was overseeing.
[time=1815] And I'll never forget that fire that was sparked, and your words do the same thing in your relationships.
[time=1820] Some of you have burned down some relationships with your words, and it didn't stop at the building.
[time=1825] It caught fire at the building. The inside, the outside, they have burned down because words consume.
[time=1831] A lot of times we'll say more after we said too much. Are you with me?
[time=1836] We'll say more after we said too much.
[time=1838] Well, I didn't mean it. Well, let me explain a little further.
[time=1840] And I always liken it to digging yourself the whole. You just kind of keep digging, don't you?
[time=1845] You've already dug in a hole. You're already fixing to get shoved into the hole, but you just keep digging the hole.
[time=1849] And you make it deeper, and you make it deeper. A lot of times we'll continue with our words after we've already dug ourselves a hole
[time=1855] so much that it's like we're throwing matches on the fire, trying to put the fire out.
[time=1860] And with that, I hope you feel encouraged.
[time=1864] Let me give you before I do give you some encouragement.
[time=1868] Sometimes I think one of the biggest barriers, I want to give you a few barriers to godly communication.
[time=1873] One of the biggest barriers is, I would say, a misconception of what honesty is.
[time=1879] You ever met that person who's just too honest too often?
[time=1883] There's a statement in your notes there that I'd like to share with you that I've wrestled with, thought about what honesty is and what it isn't.
[time=1889] I think that being honest is not about saying every true thing.
[time=1893] Being honest, rather, is about choosing to say only true things.
[time=1898] Being honest is not about saying every true thing.
[time=1902] Am I right? Some true things just need to be kept to yourself.
[time=1906] Do I need to give illustrations? Because I probably got some.
[time=1909] By the way, one of my, I'll give you one since you look like you need to know a good illustration.
[time=1914] I will never, and I rarely say never anymore, but God willing, I'll never look at any of you ladies.
[time=1920] And say, "When's the baby do?" I don't care if it is utterly obvious that you are nine months pregnant until you tell me that you're pregnant. I'm not going to ask.
[time=1932] Why do you ask?
[time=1935] Do I need to finish the story really? I really don't, do I?
[time=1938] Because that can get you in a mess. It is probably true.
[time=1941] In fact, I might know it's true, but sometimes you might just need to keep it to yourself for that season.
[time=1947] Can I get an amen? Let me give you some barriers to Godly communication.
[time=1952] The first one is complaining, complaining.
[time=1955] I believe in a church setting. All of my years I've grown up in the church.
[time=1959] I've led in the church. In a church setting, I think gossip, right?
[time=1963] Gossip there beside complaining too, because that's what it turns into most of the time.
[time=1966] I'll say something else about complaining, but gossip, I think is one of the biggest church relationship burners I have ever witnessed.
[time=1974] It tears down relationships in the church. It tears down the unity that God is building in the church.
[time=1979] And so I want to tell you today that if you have a problem with somebody in this place and you come and share it with me, I want you to know what I'm going to do.
[time=1987] I'm going to say, well, when have you talked to that person?
[time=1989] Because Matthew 18, jot that down, Matthew 18 gives you an excellent outline for how to manage conflict
[time=1995] without it turning into complaining and gossiping, but our natural tendency is to go, hey, did you hear about this? My favorite, the church one, if you're a church person, you've been here with us for a while, if not, then this probably doesn't apply to you, but I think I've fit it. We'll say, hey, you really need to pray for Bob.
[time=2014] Why? Well, in case you haven't heard, and you started a fire,
[time=2021] you set a flame. And so I want to challenge you carry around, I think we all carry a box of matches
[time=2027] and a bucket of water. I want to challenge you to carry around a bucket of water with your words.
[time=2032] If somebody wants to start a fire dump water all over their head, physically speaking, maybe, probably not, but maybe, but no, spiritually speaking, practically speaking,
[time=2043] use that bucket of water. What does that look like? If somebody wants to complain about somebody else in the church or in your family, then say, you know what, I can see where you'd be pretty frustrated.
[time=2051] I just challenge you to go sit down with them.
[time=2054] You know, we're doing a series at the church right now called Better Half, and we're learning how to be the better half.
[time=2059] There are two halves to every relationship, and our challenge has been make yours the better half.
[time=2063] That's what I would like to challenge you to do. Just try to make yours the better half.
[time=2066] Go the extra mile and just sit down with them and be honest in a loving and godly way.
[time=2071] Talk about water.
[time=2074] Would that not change the complaining that takes place in your family and relationships and life and church?
[time=2080] Carry around a bucket of water and out a box of matches, and Mark Twain said this about complaining in case you still don't believe me about how it's a barrier here.
[time=2088] He said, don't complain and talk about all your problems.
[time=2091] 80% of people don't care, and the other 20 think you deserve them.
[time=2097] He said it, not me.
[time=2100] But don't be a complainer. I think complaining is a contaminant in the church.
[time=2105] Complaining is a contaminator in your relationships.
[time=2109] Don't be a complainer. Be that positive person. Be that better half.
[time=2113] Criticism. We've already talked about that when the call here is to reverse the ratio.
[time=2117] One of those barriers to communication. Yes, complaining, but also criticism.
[time=2121] Reverse that ratio, and then the third is cycles of communication.
[time=2125] Cycles of communication. You ever been handed down some cycles in your communication?
[time=2130] The way that mom and dad always communicated or grandma or grandpa or this mentor or that mentor or this influence or that influence? How they communicate?
[time=2138] You find yourself communicating in that way?
[time=2141] You would say, well, it's just not fair the cycles that I had handed down to me.
[time=2144] And you know what? If you told me what that looked like, I would probably agree with you 100%.
[time=2149] It's not right. It's not fair. Like James said, if everyone handed down the right kind of cycles, then there would be perfect men and women in this world, but there aren't.
[time=2159] So my challenge to you, and I want to give you some practical tools, hopefully today that will help you break some of those cycles.
[time=2164] I'm blessed to have some parents that broke cycles in their own life, in their own journey, the heritage of our family,
[time=2171] of what's said and what's not said. Some of you have rarely have ever been told I love you.
[time=2177] I was blessed that my parents chose to make sure I heard that very frequently.
[time=2182] Some of you didn't have that blessing, but you can be that blessing in somebody else's life, and it all starts with me telling you right now from Jesus to you.
[time=2190] Sorry, I don't have a better looking, better voice to do it with, but I can tell you right now that Jesus looks at you and he says, "I love you. I love you."
[time=2201] And so you've been told, and now you can go break that cycle and be that in the lives of other people.
[time=2205] So that's what words do. Now let's look at what do I do with my words.
[time=2210] James is going to help us a little bit, but then we're going to have to dig a little deeper.
[time=2213] Let's look at verses 9 and 10. He reiterates his point here in verse 9 by saying, "With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people." Have you ever met one of those? Sounds like one of those church hypocrites, right?
[time=2229] I see you sitting in church on Sunday, but then I saw what you did on Monday.
[time=2234] I saw what you did last weekend. I know I've been that person.
[time=2238] I've seen that person, and it's so true. It's just such a real picture of what words do.
[time=2242] And how much they matter.
[time=2245] He says, "Who were made in the likeness of God?" Verse 10, "For the same mouth, from the same mouth, come blessing and cursing.
[time=2252] My brothers, these things ought not be so."
[time=2259] And then I'd like to say he gives a seven-step outline for how to change it.
[time=2263] But if you keep reading, he's got a couple more thoughts there, and he just changes the subject.
[time=2267] He really focuses a lot on what our words do.
[time=2270] And so I've had to think a lot this week about what it is that I can share that'll help you do something with your words, and I've come up with a solution.
[time=2279] Do you want to see it? Do you want to see it? All right.
[time=2283] You need to get you one of these.
[time=2289] My wife made this for me a long time ago.
[time=2294] You need to get you one of these. This is the best solution that I have come up with.
[time=2298] Beware of mouth.
[time=2300] How many of you need this sign?
[time=2303] We're not giving them out after the service.
[time=2305] That's not the point of the better half.
[time=2307] But it might help you in your relationships.
[time=2309] Let's talk for a minute about what do I do with my words.
[time=2313] It's one thing to know what words do.
[time=2315] They control and they consume, yet we still need a sign like this so many times, don't we?
[time=2321] Beware my mouth.
[time=2323] And today I want us to give you -- I want to give you four things that'll help you, that will help you do something better with your words, four practical things.
[time=2332] Most of these, I would say, are very biblical in principle, but a lot of them, I'm just going to give you some good practical advice and opinions today about what you could do to help fulfill what I believe God wants to do in your relationships through your words.
[time=2343] I'm going to take this off because you won't listen.
[time=2346] That'd be a -- that's a bad metaphor there, isn't it?
[time=2349] If you're preaching and saying, don't listen to anything I'm saying, right?
[time=2353] Number one, break the unhealthy cycles I've created.
[time=2361] Jop this down if you're taking notes.
[time=2362] Love and Respect is the name of a book.
[time=2364] Love and Respect by Dr. Emerson Eggerichs.
[time=2367] And so you can just Google Love and Respect book and you'll find that it's red and white.
[time=2371] It has Love and Respect there on the cover.
[time=2373] It's a great book, one of my favorite tools in marriage.
[time=2376] But in it, the whole book is based off of three cycles.
[time=2379] And I want to show you those cycles.
[time=2381] The first one you'll, I think, relate to and it's called the crazy cycle.
[time=2385] Look at somebody say, you crazy.
[time=2388] We all are.
[time=2389] Here's the crazy cycle.
[time=2391] The crazy cycle is where somebody, he or she, this is in the context of marriage, but you can apply it wherever.
[time=2397] Somebody reacts without Respect, which causes another reaction without Love.
[time=2401] And so a lack of Respect motivates a lack of Love, motivates a lack of Respect, you get the picture, and it just spirals out of control.
[time=2409] Words do that, don't they?
[time=2410] In the book he outlines how to take steps away from the crazy cycle into what he calls
[time=2416] the energizing cycle.
[time=2417] And here's that.
[time=2418] Look at the energizing cycle with me.
[time=2420] The energizing cycle is where somebody breaks the cycle.
[time=2424] Look at me for a minute.
[time=2425] Some of you today are called to break the cycle today.
[time=2429] Today.
[time=2431] There's a cycle that's going on in your household or over the phone in the next conversation.
[time=2435] That cycle is going to continue.
[time=2438] And your call is today to break that cycle.
[time=2441] That means that even when someone reacts to you without Respect or without Love,
[time=2447] his premise that it is that in marriage, the primary need for a lady is they need that Love, the security that comes from Love, and men need that Respect.
[time=2455] And so the crazy cycle goes the opposite way.
[time=2457] But somebody breaks the cycle and shows Love and/or Respect, even though the other
[time=2463] person may or may not deserve it.
[time=2465] And it's energizing.
[time=2466] It starts to reverse the cycle.
[time=2468] And then you get to what he calls the rewarded cycle, the rewarding cycle.
[time=2472] And that is where it becomes pretty unconditional, kind of like the Love of Jesus, where my Love and Respect happens regardless of her Love and/or Respect.
[time=2481] And it doesn't matter what they do.
[time=2483] It's not conditional.
[time=2484] Love is not a conditional.
[time=2485] Hear me.
[time=2486] Some of you need to know this in your relationship.
[time=2488] Love is not a feeling.
[time=2490] Sometimes we base our Love on the conditional version of how it feels that day and how you treated me that day.
[time=2497] Love, and I'm glad God looked at Love this way when it comes to my life.
[time=2501] Love is not a feeling, it's a choice.
[time=2504] Love is a choice that you choose to do unconditionally regardless of what the other half of your relationship chooses to do.
[time=2514] For some of you, it's time to break some cycles.
[time=2517] It's time to energize the cycles that have gotten a little bit crazy in your life.
[time=2522] Second thing is to own the fires I've started.
[time=2526] Own the fires that I've started.
[time=2529] What does that mean?
[time=2530] That may mean that you need to go to somebody and say, "You know what?
[time=2534] I realize my words started a fire.
[time=2536] Blame it on your pastor." I'll be a scapegoat for you.
[time=2540] Say, "Pastor taught to us today about words, and I just got to tell you, he challenged us to own the fires, because he told me to do it.
[time=2547] I've got to come tell you this." But then from your heart to theirs, own the fires that you started, even if they started a bigger fire, own your little fire.
[time=2555] And say, "You know what?
[time=2556] I realize my words started a fire in our relationship." And I'm really sorry about that.
[time=2563] I want to ask you if you'll forgive me.
[time=2566] Some of you said, "I don't know.
[time=2569] I'm not sure I can do that." But I would challenge you to take that step.
[time=2571] And a lot of times we like to throw matches on the fire to put the fire out.
[time=2574] You say, "I want to ask you to forgive me.
[time=2576] Let me give you a great piece of advice that you're going to thank me for later." If you take me up on this challenge, if you do that, say what you came to say on the fire, ask them to forgive you.
[time=2586] Even if you feel like you've got to say, "I hope one day you can forgive me." And leave it at that, and then do this.
[time=2598] And leave it there.
[time=2600] That's my challenge to you.
[time=2601] Maybe very hard for some of you.
[time=2603] In fact, I did that this week, this week, from something years ago that God just put in my mind.
[time=2608] And I just said, "Well, you know what?
[time=2609] If I'm going to preach it, I need to call, and I need to say I'm really sorry." I realized that when I said that, that probably hurt, didn't it?
[time=2615] And the answer was yes.
[time=2617] I said, "Well, I'm really sorry.
[time=2618] I want to ask you if you'll forgive me." And guess what they said?
[time=2621] I sure will.
[time=2623] Thank you for that.
[time=2625] Novel concept, right?
[time=2627] We miss it so many times, and I'm right there in that same boat with you.
[time=2631] On the fires you start at number three, repair the damage.
[time=2634] Repair the damage my fires left behind.
[time=2637] Romans 12, 18 says, "So much as it depends on you, live peaceably with all men."
[time=2644] You can't repair the damage as that church had burned down.
[time=2647] I could repair it in a day.
[time=2649] I may never repair it back to what it used to be, because words do weigh a thousand pounds.
[time=2654] They are heavy, and they last, and they're not forgotten, but you can rebuild your relationships.
[time=2661] You can.
[time=2662] It may not look exactly like it used to look, and that's okay.
[time=2664] You can still take steps to repair the damage that your fires have started in your life.
[time=2670] And some of you, I like to call them EGRs.
[time=2672] EGR.
[time=2673] Some might say EGR.
[time=2674] Write that down, because I'm about to help you.
[time=2677] Those are the people in your life that are the extra grace required.
[time=2683] Honestly, I'm not the EGR in your life.
[time=2685] The extra grace, there he comes, extra grace required, extra grace required.
[time=2690] But you have them in your life.
[time=2692] And it's time for you to take some ownership and taking forward steps in that process.
[time=2697] I would challenge you with that today.
[time=2699] Repair the damage as much as it depends on you.
[time=2701] Here's what I'll challenge you.
[time=2702] I'm not going to preach this sermon to the fourth week, okay?
[time=2704] Come back.
[time=2705] You don't want to miss two weeks from today, because I'm going to talk about how you can do your part.
[time=2708] But a lot of times we get so consumed with the other person, the other half in our relationship doing their part, that we neglect to do ours, and then we might even leave God out of the equation, thinking he may or may not even be doing his part.
[time=2720] God's part, my part, their part.
[time=2722] God will always do his part.
[time=2724] He is always faithful.
[time=2725] Regardless of whether or not the other half in your relationship does their part, do your part, and that's all God asks of you.
[time=2733] I just set somebody free in this place today.
[time=2736] Because you've been so consumed with their part that you just didn't think your part was enough.
[time=2741] Your part is enough.
[time=2742] Go do your part.
[time=2744] Own the fires you started and repair the damage as best you can as much as it depends on you.
[time=2749] And then last but not least, surrender my mouth to Jesus daily.
[time=2755] Surrender my mouth to Jesus daily.
[time=2759] Proverbs 21, 23 says, "Whoever keeps his mouth and his tongue keeps himself out of trouble."
[time=2766] Psalm 141 and verse 3.
[time=2770] Set a guard, oh Lord, over my mouth.
[time=2773] Keep watch over the door of my lips.
[time=2776] For some of us, it's time to shut the door.
[time=2780] For some of us, it may be time to listen.
[time=2785] To be the godly better half in your relationship.
[time=2789] There are two questions there that I'll leave with you.
[time=2792] Two questions that maybe you should ask yourself before speaking.
[time=2796] Number one is winning the moment worth burning down the relationship.
[time=2802] But I've got a zinger.
[time=2804] If I share that, then I'll shut them down.
[time=2806] Well, do you really want to shut them down?
[time=2808] Is that price?
[time=2809] Is that cost worth winning the moment?
[time=2813] Are you going to start a fire that's going to burn something down just to win the moment?
[time=2818] Good question to ask.
[time=2819] The second one is, do I need to love my relationship more than I love being right?
[time=2831] Does that mean we don't stand up for truth?
[time=2833] Of course not.
[time=2834] But sometimes we value too much.
[time=2836] I know I value too much being right so much that maybe I devalue the relationship.
[time=2842] And I don't think that puts us in a position where we can be the better half or we can be Jesus.
[time=2848] Some people say, you know, this is just in a marriage context.
[time=2850] No, you've got relationships everywhere.
[time=2852] I don't care what circle, what season of life you're in.
[time=2855] You have relationships where Jesus has called you to be Jesus.
[time=2859] Think about this phrase.
[time=2861] You may be the only Jesus some will ever see.
[time=2865] You may be the only Bible that some will ever read.
[time=2871] Let's be the better half.
[time=2873] Let's be Jesus in our lives, in their lives.
[time=2877] Let's be Jesus with the words that we pour out of this temple scripture calls it.
[time=2884] This temple where we house the spirit of the living God.
[time=2888] Let's be the better half to get.
[time=2890] I want to ask you just to bow your heads, close your eyes for a moment.
[time=2893] Nobody looking around, just you and Jesus for a moment.
[time=2896] If you know Jesus today, then I want to challenge you to take the steps of being the better half.
[time=2902] To take one of those steps that we've looked at and just allow God to start teaching you something new.
[time=2908] Maybe there's a phone call you've got to make.
[time=2910] I'm not sure what it looks like for you in this place today.
[time=2912] But I challenge you to not hold back and to ask God to show you what it means for you to be the better half.
[time=2919] But as we were coming out of Easter, I thought about what we talked about on Good Friday or service here.
[time=2924] Because I want to speak to those of you who would say, you know, I don't have the capacity to be the better half, I think.
[time=2929] Because I'm not sure if I were to die today, that I would spend eternity in heaven with Jesus.
[time=2935] I'd like to be sure of that, but I'm not sure that if I died today, if this was my last day, that I'd spend forever in heaven.
[time=2943] Because I know Jesus personally and I've laid my life down at his feet.
[time=2947] I'd like to know, but I don't know. I want to talk to you.
[time=2950] I was thinking about the road to Emmaus, and so right after Jesus Easter was a couple of weeks ago, right after Jesus rose from the dead, two people were walking away from Jerusalem.
[time=2960] They're walking away from the scene where they had been told with words.
[time=2964] They had been told with the words of eyewitnesses that Jesus is no longer there, that he's alive, he has risen.
[time=2971] But they couldn't quite get to this place of belief, and so they walked away from the scene.
[time=2976] And I've been thinking about so many that may sit in this place every single week, and you hear us talk about with our words and hopefully with actions that Jesus is alive and that he cares about you,
[time=2986] but there have been so many days, so many weeks, so many months.
[time=2989] Maybe it's been years that you've walked away from the scene of where God was working in your life.
[time=2994] And I want to challenge you. My heart breaks for you today because there is no relationship that's more important than your relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=3003] And maybe today it's time to not walk away from the scene.
[time=3006] You've heard us say just as those two walking away from Jerusalem, the road to Emmaus,
[time=3012] they had heard that Jesus was alive, but they were struggling with having their faith tied up in that fact.
[time=3020] You know what Jesus did? He met them on that road.
[time=3025] Right in their disbelief, right in the midst of their confusion, right in the midst of all the chaos.
[time=3031] He stopped them in their tracks and said, I love you.
[time=3036] I haven't given up on you and I really am alive in this place today.
[time=3043] Somebody is here and God's telling you that he is alive and that he is well.
[time=3048] And he's saying, don't walk away today.
[time=3050] Don't walk away from the scene of my resurrection.
[time=3053] Don't walk away from the scene of your eternal life.
[time=3057] You can know, I don't care what you've been through.
[time=3059] I don't care what skeletons are in your closet.
[time=3061] Jesus looks at you and says, I'm bigger than your skeletons.
[time=3064] I'm bigger than your past and I will meet you where you are.
[time=3068] Don't wait on everything to line up and be in order to follow me.
[time=3071] Follow me today.
[time=3073] Scripture says salvation is as simple as just believing Jesus died on the cross for your sins, believing that he is resurrected, that he is alive.
[time=3082] And trusting him to save you, not trusting yourself to save you anymore because Romans 3
[time=3088] tells us that we all sin and fall short of the glory of God.
[time=3092] We're unified in that, but Jesus meets us in that very spot.
[time=3096] I'm not going to lead you in a prayer because I believe your heart is screaming those things to Jesus.
[time=3101] Salvation is not a prayer thing.
[time=3103] It's a heart thing.
[time=3105] We just use prayer as a means by which to talk to God.
[time=3108] So I want to give you a moment right now.
[time=3110] Will you talk to God right where you sit no matter where you are, no matter what's going on around you're in your mind, will you talk to God, lay your life down at his feet and ask him to save you and I promised you based on the promises and the word of Jesus himself that he will save you.
[time=3126] Will you do that now?
[time=3132] Maybe that's you.
[time=3133] Maybe the person I've been describing where God's been drawing, where God's been teaching you new things, not just about words, but about who you are and about how God sees you.
[time=3142] Maybe that's you today.
[time=3143] Maybe God's teaching you something new about you and that new thing may just be that it's time to take the leap.
[time=3149] It's time to trust Jesus to save you.
[time=3152] That's exactly why we exist.
[time=3154] That's what we desire to see.
[time=3155] That's what we drive towards here at Black Hawk Ministries every week.
[time=3159] So if that's you, take that leap.
[time=3161] Just trust Jesus today and you will not regret it.
[time=3164] I truly believe that and we want to walk with you.
[time=3166] If you have taken that step, if you haven't, maybe it's time to step away and just hit pause or whatever you've got to do to go make that right with Jesus right now.
[time=3173] But if you have, we want to walk with you.
[time=3175] We've got great resources that we want to get into your hands today that will just help you take your next steps.
[time=3181] We always say there's a book called Beginning Steps and we always say that getting saved, trusting Jesus to save you is not the end of something, but it's the beginning of something new.
[time=3191] So this is the booklet I'm talking about, Beginning Steps, a growth guide for new believers and it's just going to walk you through seven steps that will help you take forward steps in your faith, not just stay stagnant, not just let today be an end of something, but the beginning of something brand new.
[time=3205] So I would challenge you to allow us to put one of these in your hands, several ways we can do that.
[time=3210] We'd love to see you in person at Black Hawk Ministries during the week or on a Sunday morning.
[time=3215] Our services are at 1030 each week here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=3218] So we would love to put one in your hands in person or we will mail you one of these books.
[time=3223] If you'll just give us your information, there's going to be some information on your screen that includes the phone number, email address that you can use to reach out to us and say, "Hey, I need a book.
[time=3231] I need to walk with somebody.
[time=3233] I need to know what's next for me and we would love just to walk with you." And we'd also love to hear your story.
[time=3239] Some of you, maybe you've been listening, you've been watching for quite some time and God's been teaching you some new things.
[time=3244] And today you'd just really love to share what God's shown you.
[time=3248] And if that's you, we'd love to hear from you.
[time=3250] We'd love to walk with you.
[time=3251] And I truly believe that everything from your words, to your walk, to who you are in your everyday life, to what your work life looks like, to what your family life looks like, to your everyday steps that you take, that every bit of it can be wrapped up in who Jesus is and all that he has for your life.
[time=3268] Tap into that and I'm excited to continue this series with you better half.
[time=3272] Next week you don't want to miss it.
[time=3274] We're going to talk about how a lot of times we compare to the glory that we seem to see in other people's lives, but that God's glory trumps all of that and it's going to help you tap into who God wants you to be and all that he has for your life.
[time=3287] See you next week.
[time=3309] And to all of the people with burdens and pains keeping you back from your love.
[time=3320] You believe that there's nothing and there is no one who can make it right.
[time=3330] There is hope for the helpers, rest for the weary, love for the broken home.
[time=3340] There is grace and forgiveness, mercy and healing.
[time=3345] They'll meet you wherever you are, cry out to Jesus, cry out to Jesus.
[time=3360] For the marriage that's struggling just to hang on, they've lost all of their faith and love.
[time=3372] And they've done all that they can take it right against you.
[time=3377] It's not enough.
[time=3382] For the ones who can break the addictions and chains.
[time=3387] You try to give up, but you come back again.
[time=3392] Just remember that you're not alone in your shape and your suffering.
[time=3401] There is hope for the helpers, rest for the weary, love for the broken home.
[time=3411] There is grace and forgiveness, mercy and healing.
[time=3416] They'll meet you wherever you are, cry out to Jesus.
[time=3427] When you're lonely and it feels like the whole world is falling upon you.
[time=3437] You just reach out, you just cry out to Jesus.
[time=3445] Cry to Jesus.
[time=3453] To the widow who suffers from being alone, wiping the tears from her eyes.
[time=3463] For the children around the world without a home, say a prayer tonight.
[time=3472] There is hope for the helpers, rest for the weary, love for the broken home.
[time=3482] There is grace and forgiveness, mercy and healing.
[time=3488] They'll meet you wherever you are.
[time=3492] There is hope for the helpers, rest for the weary, love for the broken home.
[time=3502] There is grace and forgiveness, mercy and healing.
[time=3508] They'll meet you wherever you are, cry out to Jesus.
[time=3526] Cry out to Jesus.
