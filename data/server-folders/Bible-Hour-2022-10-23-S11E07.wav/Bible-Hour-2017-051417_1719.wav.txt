[time=210] Your love is devoted, like a ring of solid gold, like a vow that is tested, like a covenant alone.
[time=226] Your love is enduring, through the winter rain, and beyond the horizon, with mercy for today.
[time=240] Faithful you have been, and faithful you will be.
[time=247] You pledge yourself to me, and it's why I say your praise will never be on my lips, ever be on my lips.
[time=258] Your praise will never be on my lips, ever be on my lips.
[time=282] [MUSIC]
[time=294] You father the orphan, your kindness makes us whole, and your shoulder weakness, and your strength becomes our own.
[time=307] Now you're making me like you, clothing me and wine, bringing beauty from ashes.
[time=318] For you will have your bride, free of all her guilt, and rid of all her shame, and know about her true name.
[time=331] And it's why I say your praise will never be on my lips, ever be on my lips.
[time=353] Your praise will never be on my lips, ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips.
[time=361] And you will be praised, and you will be praised, with angels and saints we sing worthy, Lord, and you will be praised.
[time=405] You will be praised, with angels and saints we sing worthy, Lord, and you will be praised, with angels and saints we sing worthy, Lord, and you will be praised, with angels and saints we sing worthy, Lord, and you will be praised.
[time=416] It's why I say your praise will never be on my lips, ever be on my lips.
[time=442] Never be on my lips.
[time=461] [APPLAUSE]
[time=465] I want to thank you so much for watching today here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=469] We just love that we get the privilege of sharing a little bit of your time during the week, and so we'd love to hear from you.
[time=475] One of my favorite things about this ministry, about the fact that we get to share some time just studying the Word and letting God work in our lives is hearing stories about how God is at work.
[time=485] And so we'd love to hear from you, we'd love to connect with you, we'd love to help you see what all Black Hawk Ministries may be able to provide in your life in terms of just helping you connect with Jesus and walk with Him.
[time=496] And so we'd love to invite you to visit our website, blackhawkministries.org.
[time=500] You can look at our live every single week at 1030 on social media.
[time=504] You can just look for @bhawkMinistries on either Twitter or Instagram.
[time=508] And so we'd love to have you connect with us there or on Facebook.
[time=511] You can look for Black Hawk Ministries or the Bible Hour on Facebook.
[time=515] We stream live there as well as our website every single week.
[time=518] I also invite you to download our church app, Black Hawk Church App, and it has all kinds of great tools, just ways you can be prayed for.
[time=525] Maybe you've got something in your life and you feel like nobody's praying for you.
[time=529] Maybe it's time to just reach out and say, "I just need somebody to pray for me." We promise you that if you reach out to us through our app or through one of these venues that we will pray for you diligently.
[time=539] And we will lift you up before God.
[time=541] And so today, I just want to tell you thank you, we do not take it lightly.
[time=545] We do not take it lightly, that you just allow us into your home, into your life, into your spiritual walk with God.
[time=550] And so today we're going to be looking at being the better half. We're going to be looking at what it means to build our relationships in a way that honors God, that pleases God, and that helps us relate better to other people.
[time=562] I hope that you find it practical, but more than that, I hope that you find it spiritually powerful in your life.
[time=568] And today we're going to be looking at this idea that we tend to compare ourselves to the glory of other people.
[time=573] We tend to look outside of ourselves at other relationships, at other people's kids, at other people's possessions, whatever it may be.
[time=581] And we ask ourselves, "Am I doing okay? Am I making it?" Today, I challenge you to ask the question, "What is it? What does it mean to make it?
[time=589] What does it really mean to matter in life?" And so we're going to be answering some of those questions, and I truly believe you'll leave today as we look at God's Word.
[time=598] Second Corinthians chapter 3, I believe you'll leave today, maybe comparing yourself in a little bit of a different light, hopefully in the way that God looks at you.
[time=606] Thanks for watching.
[time=628] Singing is one, hallelujah, holy holy, God Almighty, great I am, always worthy, now you'll be standing, God Almighty, great I am.
[time=658] Wanna be near, near to your heart, loving the world, gaining the dark.
[time=672] Wanna see dry bones, living again, singing as one, hallelujah, holy holy, God Almighty, great I am, always worthy.
[time=687] God Almighty, great I am, who is worthy, now you'll be standing, God Almighty, great I am.
[time=713] Here's the great I am, great I am.
[time=727] Almighty, shake me for you, the demons running free, at the mention of your name, King of Majesty.
[time=739] There is no crown in care, for anyone can stand, and for the power and the presence of the great I am, great I am, great I am.
[time=756] Yeah, great I am, great I am, great I am, great I am.
[time=772] Hallelujah, holy holy, God Almighty, great I am, who is worthy, now you'll be standing, God Almighty, great I am.
[time=798] Great I am, great I am, great I am.
[time=817] You're not to shake me for you, the demons running free, at the mention of your name, King of Majesty.
[time=829] There is no power and prayer, for anyone can stand, and for the power and the presence of the great I am, great I am, great I am, great I am.
[time=846] Great I am, great I am, great I am, great I am.
[time=863] Hallelujah, holy holy, God Almighty, great I am, who is worthy, now you'll be standing, God Almighty, great I am.
[time=889] Great I am, great I am, great I am, great I am.
[time=908] This is made by today.
[time=914] In every relationship there are two halves, in an ideal relationship there is give and take, both sides strive toward harmony, but not every relationship is ideal.
[time=927] Sometimes relationships experience conflict, conflict leads to distance, distance leads to isolation.
[time=937] When you see the relationship drift to isolation, be the better half.
[time=953] So do you want the good news or the bad news first?
[time=965] But your time is coming, I'm not going to tell you how, I'm not going to tell you when, I'm not going to tell you where, but if you'll hang in there with us you might get some more Oreos.
[time=972] If you have no idea what I'm talking about, that means you may be a first time guest with us and I want to say thank you for being here, we have been giving out Oreos in church.
[time=981] You know, whatever it takes to get us to come back to church, right?
[time=984] Well you're talking about being the better half as you just saw and Oreos has been our theme because no matter what, how many of you have the chocolate people again just want to know who I'm talking to?
[time=993] You know when you twist it you want the chocolate side, how many of you want the cream side?
[time=997] All right, cream side?
[time=999] Chocolate side?
[time=1001] I don't know what's wrong with the chocolate people, we'll convince them one day.
[time=1005] But our point in this series has been every single week, we're in our third week of this simply that you know what, there are two halves to every relationship.
[time=1013] So make yours the better half, make yours the better half.
[time=1019] And that applies to whether you're married, whether you're single, whether you have kids, whether you're a parent or not, no matter whether you are any of those things, a mixture of those things, you have relationships.
[time=1029] And if your relationships are like mine they get kind of messy, can I get a name in?
[time=1035] It just happens and so we're looking at how we can make our half the better half and looking at really some root issues in relationships.
[time=1042] Not really dealing with specific relationships but going back to the roots that I believe scripture gives us or at least a few of those roots that will help us relate better with the people in our lives, help us be the better half in our lives as well.
[time=1056] So today we're going to look at what I'll call the comparison culture that we live in today.
[time=1061] And so this is the third week of our series, we'll be in second Corinthians, second Corinthians chapter number three.
[time=1067] In your New Testament if you want to find your place there, I'll be reading from the English standard version, if you want to get the same one on your app or look in any version, there's a Bible in your seat there, if you're looking for one, you're welcome to use those as well.
[time=1080] I want to take this opportunity to just to welcome all of our extended family as we get ready to dive in this series.
[time=1086] We've got a big family here at Black Hawk, not just that meets in this room, but those that join us online or through television at home and your PJs, whatever that looks like.
[time=1094] Thank you for joining us and we welcome you to our family as well.
[time=1098] A blessing is not to be a part of the family of God.
[time=1104] Somebody's leaving here today, just so you know, I just know this in my heart.
[time=1109] Somebody's leaving here today with something way better.
[time=1113] That's the good news, by the way, you thought I just stopped with the bad news, didn't you?
[time=1116] I remember the good news is that somebody is leaving this place today with something way better than Oreos.
[time=1123] You said, does that exist?
[time=1124] It absolutely exists.
[time=1126] Jesus has something for you today.
[time=1128] Everybody look at me for a minute because some of you don't believe me.
[time=1131] Jesus has something for you today in this moment.
[time=1136] Will you listen?
[time=1137] Will you let him speak to you?
[time=1139] I know he's got something that's going to bless your life and change your relationships and it's going to start because it's going to change you.
[time=1144] It's going to change who you are and how you even see him.
[time=1148] In Oreos, there's a lot of comparisons of Oreos.
[time=1151] Did you know how many Oreos there are?
[time=1153] If you didn't, I'm going to tell you.
[time=1155] And when I would buy some, I would probably do some comparisons now.
[time=1158] I'm going to give you a few that I found this week.
[time=1160] I know some of you don't believe me, but there are banana split Oreos, birthday cake Oreos, candy cane Oreos, caramel apple Oreos, cookie dough Oreos, cool mint Oreos, fruit punch Oreos.
[time=1171] You want me to keep going?
[time=1173] Some of these sound gross, don't they?
[time=1175] Some of them sound pretty good, though.
[time=1176] They're gingerbread Oreos, lemon twist ones, limeade Oreos, peanut butter Oreos, pumpkin spice Oreos, and it just keeps going and going and going.
[time=1185] You know, now when you go buy Oreos, you're going to compare them all, aren't you?
[time=1189] I may just buy six of them instead of that one package, but just like we might compare Oreos, here's where it's going to get real for us today.
[time=1196] We live in a culture of comparison, a culture of constant comparison.
[time=1201] Just like we would compare Oreos, we compare relationships, we compare what we have versus what they have, we compare children, we compare and we compare and we compare and we ask the question, how do I know I'm doing?
[time=1214] How do I know I'm doing okay?
[time=1216] Some of you came to church today because you're wondering, am I okay?
[time=1219] Got him, am I okay with you?
[time=1221] Am I in a good place in my life?
[time=1223] And we ask these questions, and a lot of times we end up going to comparison to get our answers, and so I want us to look at how we know it.
[time=1231] We know it, it's unhealthy, and we feel it, but we do it anyway.
[time=1234] Don't we?
[time=1235] We compare to other people, and it's a real problem in relationships, and I can't talk about comparison culture without talking about the church smile.
[time=1243] If there's ever been a church smile, sermon, this is it.
[time=1246] Some of you know where I'm fixing to go, but those of you who don't know what the church smile is, I'm going to show you mine.
[time=1251] Are you ready?
[time=1252] This is the smile that you put on.
[time=1257] It doesn't matter how horrible your week's been.
[time=1259] It doesn't matter how big of a knock-down, drag-out fight you may have had with the kids or whoever you rode with the church.
[time=1265] It doesn't matter how terrible this week, this weekend, this morning has been.
[time=1269] When you hit your foot on that pavement in a parking lot of a church, you put on the church smile, you go.
[time=1274] Hey brother, hey sister, and you just act like you've got it all together no matter whether you do have anything together for that week.
[time=1283] Is that not true?
[time=1284] I desire, because I believe it's Jesus' desire that the church be a place where we can be who we are with all of our mess, with all of our broken Oreos, with all of the messes that we've made, the problems we've created in our relationships.
[time=1298] And that doesn't mean you have to be negative, it doesn't mean you have to always be Johnny Raincloud, always say, but it means that you can be who you are and know that you're going to be embraced and that you're going to be loved because Jesus cares about you in the middle of your mess, because guess what?
[time=1313] He knows about the mess.
[time=1315] The people sitting next to you may have no idea, but he knows.
[time=1319] He knows where you sit in this place today.
[time=1321] So my challenge is, let's take off the church smiles and really dig into the depths, the messiness, the things that we hide in the background, the things that we compare ourselves to.
[time=1332] Let's play them before Jesus today as we do that.
[time=1335] Who's with me?
[time=1336] You're about going to join me with that.
[time=1337] Let's do that today.
[time=1338] I want to give you the bottom line.
[time=1339] If you're taking notes, we gave you a note sheet as you came in.
[time=1341] If you like the outlines, you can take notes on our church at Black Hawk Church.
[time=1345] You can search for that in the App Store.
[time=1347] And you can find it there, we have notes there, or just get out the notebooks or just like you're listening.
[time=1352] No one will know the difference.
[time=1353] But I want to give you the bottom line.
[time=1355] I always try to give you what the whole point of the passage is, second Corinthians 3.
[time=1359] The point really today is this, that my identity hinges on him, not them.
[time=1369] My identity, who I am when I try to compare and see if I'm okay.
[time=1375] Who I am, hinges on him.
[time=1377] Who's him?
[time=1378] See all Jesus, hinges on him, not on them.
[time=1383] So my question to you today is, what's the them in your life?
[time=1387] What have you been comparing yourself to?
[time=1389] To see, as your benchmark, your checkpoint to say, am I okay?
[time=1393] Am I doing all right in this life?
[time=1395] What have you been comparing to?
[time=1396] What's the them in your life that maybe your identity has been tied to?
[time=1400] You know it shouldn't be.
[time=1401] Maybe it's a past mistake.
[time=1402] Maybe it's a broken relationship.
[time=1404] Maybe it's the job that you want to get that you just can't seem to get a hold of.
[time=1408] I don't know what it might be, but there's always, I believe, something in our life that's competing to control the identity that we hold true to ourselves.
[time=1418] The identity that makes us who we are.
[time=1421] We know perhaps that it should be Jesus, but there are these things in our lives that always compete to take over his seat, his throne in our life.
[time=1429] And a lot of times we'd just say, Jesus, can you scooch over on that throne of my life a little bit because this is going to sit here for a while and we focus on it.
[time=1436] We don't mean to, but we do it.
[time=1439] I do it.
[time=1440] Just so you know, you have a pastor who struggles with this.
[time=1443] I've always heard that if you preach from preaching, school, seminary, whatever, if you preach out of your weakness and you're vulnerable and you're honest about it, guess what?
[time=1451] You'll never run out of material or illustrations.
[time=1455] And so today I give you that.
[time=1457] I struggle with this.
[time=1458] In the church world, comparison is big.
[time=1460] We say, how many are you running?
[time=1463] How many do you guys have now?
[time=1465] What does this ministry look like at your church?
[time=1467] Well, yeah, you know, that's pretty good, but let me tell you about ours.
[time=1470] And we compare.
[time=1471] And you know what I believe about the church is that it's a team sport.
[time=1475] It's a team sport.
[time=1476] We are all on the same team.
[time=1478] And when we learn who our identity is tied up in and live in the light of that fact, the comparisons of our life becomes a sharing effect.
[time=1486] So we go from comparing to sharing when Jesus gets involved.
[time=1490] That's what I believe he wants to do in your life and in your relationships today.
[time=1494] So we live in the same culture where maybe more than any other generation where we do compare.
[time=1499] And so let me give you a few benchmarks.
[time=1501] You might, you might like me be in a middle of the comparison culture.
[time=1507] You might even be called up too much in the comparison culture if some of these things might apply to you.
[time=1512] Maybe you allow what others have to keep you from enjoying what you have.
[time=1523] Maybe your spouse feels like they can't measure up because they feel like you compare them to someone else.
[time=1531] Maybe you are that spouse.
[time=1532] And I'll pause.
[time=1533] I'm going to give a little plug for a minute.
[time=1535] We're very blessed at Black Hawk Ministries that we have a marriage ministry.
[time=1539] We're in the middle of a marriage struggle and we've got a marriage ministry called marriage matters.
[time=1543] I think you're going to put some information on the screen.
[time=1545] And maybe you just need to reach out and say, you know what?
[time=1547] I could use some help.
[time=1548] I could use some community surrounding marriage because it's tough for me right now.
[time=1551] I just want to speak to your heart and say, we've got a place for you.
[time=1554] And it's not a place where you come and get judged.
[time=1556] It's a place where you come and get loved on by people who are struggling with the same things.
[time=1560] Maybe comparison just like you are.
[time=1562] And so that information is on your screen.
[time=1564] Marriage matters here at our church.
[time=1569] Another way you might know that you are struggling with this culture of comparison is maybe even the kids.
[time=1574] You ever notice that?
[time=1575] We like to compare our kids sometimes.
[time=1577] Maybe you struggle to enjoy your kids' season that they're in because you compare them to the seasons of other kids.
[time=1584] I see this, you know, with education, having young kids, it's like, man, well, so-and-so's kid, they already got those letters and those words figured out.
[time=1591] I'm struggling with that, so I feel behind.
[time=1594] And we compare and we think that that comparison defines maybe who they are.
[time=1598] We don't mean to.
[time=1599] Or maybe who we are as parents.
[time=1600] That's what we usually would do.
[time=1601] It's like, well, dang, I'm really messing this up.
[time=1604] I'm behind.
[time=1605] It's my fault.
[time=1606] I'm a terrible parent.
[time=1607] I'm a terrible mom or a dad.
[time=1608] Or maybe the worst one ever.
[time=1610] If you struggle with the comparison culture we live in is you secretly enjoy the failures
[time=1616] of other people in your life.
[time=1620] And it's like, well, you can't say that.
[time=1622] That's that secret thing that nobody ever talks about.
[time=1624] I want to talk about it.
[time=1625] We do, don't we?
[time=1626] We know we shouldn't like it when somebody else fails.
[time=1630] But we look at their life and it's like, well, I'm glad in our mind we go, but I do.
[time=1634] You don't, I'm sure.
[time=1635] But, you know, I'm unspiritual and you're probably way more spiritual than me.
[time=1637] But I might go, you know what?
[time=1639] I'm so glad that that perfect guy that always look up to that they're struggling too.
[time=1644] Good.
[time=1645] I mean, no, that's not, I shouldn't say that.
[time=1647] And then we go through this tug of war, but we secretly enjoy the failure of others because it lets us know, you know what?
[time=1652] Maybe I'm okay.
[time=1653] And I want to submit to you today that there's a better way to know whether or not you're okay than that.
[time=1661] Because if you start down that path, there's always something else to compare to.
[time=1665] Somebody always has a bigger er.
[time=1668] They're smart er.
[time=1670] They're pretty er.
[time=1672] They're rich er.
[time=1673] There's always going to be a bigger er in your life.
[time=1677] And so it says lose, lose.
[time=1678] There's no win when you get into this comparison culture.
[time=1681] Let's talk about how we can learn how to know where the world is.
[time=1685] Second Corinthians chapter 3.
[time=1686] Paul talks about a passage that a lot of times we breeze through can feel like a confusing passage at times in our life.
[time=1692] But as we're reading this, I want to ask you to answer the question, what or who is it that you're using as your reference point to tell you if you're okay in life?
[time=1702] Be honest with yourself.
[time=1704] Don't just go Jesus.
[time=1706] You can never go wrong in church when somebody asks a question and you just go Jesus.
[time=1711] But don't do the Sunday school answer today.
[time=1714] Be honest with yourself and with him today.
[time=1716] What is your mirror, the reflection that you use to tell whether or not you are okay.
[time=1721] God wants him to be that reference point, not them.
[time=1725] That's where your identity hinges.
[time=1726] This passage is about Paul.
[time=1728] Let's read verse 12 and I want to give you a little background and then we'll break it apart into two sections and I want to give you some answers to some questions.
[time=1734] Maybe you're swirling around in your mind just like they are in your mind.
[time=1737] But in this passage verse 12, Paul writes this.
[time=1739] "Since we have such a hope, we are very bold."
[time=1745] We are very bold.
[time=1748] I want to pause there and I'll tell you what he's going to write about his Moses.
[time=1751] Paul is writing to the church at Corinth, a pretty messed up church.
[time=1755] They had a lot of problems.
[time=1757] They had a lot of messy relationships.
[time=1759] We'll just leave it there for now.
[time=1761] He was writing to help address some problems in the church and he's writing to the New Testament church way before or way after Moses.
[time=1768] Moses has already come and gone but he's going to reference the law.
[time=1771] He's going to reference Moses and what you should know about this passage is Moses would go meet with God.
[time=1775] This was in the time where the law was predominant.
[time=1778] The law was dispersed amongst the people.
[time=1781] The law was where it began and where it ends.
[time=1783] And so really we learn now, we're looking back, we see that we can never measure up to the law.
[time=1789] But this was the time where the law was it.
[time=1791] That's where Moses lived.
[time=1792] He would meet with God.
[time=1793] He would go on a mountain top and meet with God and he would come back down from the mountain top.
[time=1797] And his face would literally be shining because of his presence in the presence of God.
[time=1803] And so he would wear a veil to cover that presence.
[time=1805] Now some would say people say different things of reasons why that would be.
[time=1809] But most likely you probably just couldn't look at the presence of God very well.
[time=1813] We need to just put our face on the ground.
[time=1815] But he would come and he would veil his face.
[time=1817] And I've read scholars that would even say that he would do that too because maybe he didn't want people to see.
[time=1822] This was interesting.
[time=1823] I don't know if it's true.
[time=1824] But maybe he didn't want people to see when the presence of God faded from his face.
[time=1828] Maybe there are more personal reasons.
[time=1830] I don't know.
[time=1831] But I know that was the predominant reason he would wear this veil.
[time=1834] But the veil came, here's what you should know.
[time=1837] You can go back and study all that.
[time=1838] There's a lot of fascinating stuff.
[time=1839] You can read it.
[time=1840] It's good.
[time=1841] But let's make it real for us today.
[time=1843] Paul's talking about then how the veil had come to represent something more than a covering for someone's face.
[time=1851] The veil had come to represent a division, a divider, a barrier between the heart of man and the heart of God.
[time=1861] And during that season of veil, a curtain was even put up in the temple to divide the holy of holies.
[time=1867] The holy of holies was where the ark of the covenant resided.
[time=1870] And in the ark of the covenant was the Ten Commandments.
[time=1872] And it represented during that time the very presence of God.
[time=1876] And there was a veil put up there.
[time=1878] And so that's what this veil I think that Paul's going to talk about really came to represent.
[time=1882] Not just in the lives of the church at Corinth, not just in the lives of those who were living in Moses' time, but also in our own time.
[time=1889] It represents how we cover, how we hide behind these barriers that I believe Jesus came to do away with to begin with.
[time=1897] And so with that, I want to answer the question today.
[time=1900] I want us to look at the question of how I can overcome and break the chains of comparison.
[time=1906] Before I do that though, I can't help but have a little fun.
[time=1909] You guys want to have a little fun with me?
[time=1911] How many of you know about Pinterest?
[time=1913] Pinterest.
[time=1914] If you use Pinterest, raise your hand.
[time=1916] Dude, guys, how many guys?
[time=1918] Put your hands down, ladies.
[time=1919] How many guys?
[time=1920] You are very bold.
[time=1922] I'm just kidding.
[time=1924] I've looked at Pinterest some.
[time=1926] Yeah, so a lot of us.
[time=1927] And before I'd say any of this, I'm okay with Pinterest.
[time=1930] I'm not up here preaching against it.
[time=1932] I don't like Pinterest very much because it's created a ton of work for me in my house.
[time=1936] But on Pinterest, you get this picture of perfection.
[time=1942] And here's what I want to submit to you today.
[time=1944] And I truly believe that in the church world and in culture in general, we are dying from the pressure of our own presentation of pseudo-perfection.
[time=1955] Pseudo means false in case you didn't know.
[time=1957] It means it's not real.
[time=1959] It's fake.
[time=1960] We become posers.
[time=1961] And I believe we're killing ourselves.
[time=1963] Trying to measure up and present perfection that really doesn't exist anyway.
[time=1967] We put a veil on what's really there.
[time=1969] That's where we're going to see the time in this passage.
[time=1971] But let's talk about Pinterest first.
[time=1973] I went on Pinterest and looked at some stuff.
[time=1975] But Pinterest is great.
[time=1976] And if you don't know what Pinterest is, I found Wikipedia gave you a great definition.
[time=1980] For those of you who don't know, like me, you may not know as much.
[time=1982] It's a visual discovery tool that people use to collect their ideas for their different projects and interests.
[time=1988] Pinterest, I think, is where it came from.
[time=1989] I don't know.
[time=1990] It's pretty creative.
[time=1991] People create and share collections called boards of visual bookmarks called pens that they use to do things like plan trips or projects and organize events and save articles and
[time=2002] recipes.
[time=2003] Pinterest users, is that okay?
[time=2004] True?
[time=2005] True.
[time=2006] There's a better website.
[time=2007] You want to know what it is?
[time=2009] It's called Pinterest fail.com.
[time=2014] You can spend hours on Pinterest fail.com and I highly recommend it.
[time=2021] Can I give you a few examples?
[time=2023] You want to see something?
[time=2024] Okay.
[time=2025] Let's look at -- because there's food and then there's people.
[time=2026] So I'm going to give you two kind of food items.
[time=2029] Then we're going to go to some people.
[time=2030] I like babies, too.
[time=2031] Those are the best.
[time=2032] First of all, here's an elmo cake.
[time=2035] That's impressive.
[time=2037] How many of you think you can make that?
[time=2038] If you do, then you're doing my kids' birthdays for sure.
[time=2042] But on Pinterest fail.com, this is what it was supposed to look like and this is what happened.
[time=2053] That would be the cake I would come up with.
[time=2055] I can just about promise you.
[time=2062] How many of yous that represent your life?
[time=2064] Hey, if we look behind the veil, that elmo cake describes it all, doesn't it?
[time=2070] Let's look at another one.
[time=2071] Check this one out.
[time=2072] Easter just came and gone.
[time=2073] Here's these little deviled eggs.
[time=2075] Nice little project.
[time=2080] What do you think it turned out like?
[time=2083] Check this one out.
[time=2085] I love it.
[time=2094] You're like, "Hey, there's you, honey.
[time=2097] That's you." Be the better half.
[time=2101] Be the better half.
[time=2103] Let's look at some people.
[time=2104] How many of you like babies?
[time=2105] Christmas baby picture.
[time=2106] Look at this one.
[time=2107] Wouldn't it be great if you could get your babies to do this?
[time=2111] Let's do it again and say, "Ahh." Everybody sits in, though, and you try to take babies' pictures.
[time=2117] We've tried it a bunch of times, and it usually looks something more like this.
[time=2122] Yep, they just eat it.
[time=2128] They would have eaten either elmo cake, too, just so you know they wouldn't have cared.
[time=2131] Let's do one more.
[time=2133] You want to do one more?
[time=2134] One more.
[time=2135] I could do 12 to 15, but then we'd probably do that more than look at the Bible, and that probably bad, right?
[time=2140] So let's do one more.
[time=2141] How about this one when we're kissing the baby?
[time=2143] Aww.
[time=2147] And then this is what it usually turns out like.
[time=2157] Can we all just say amen on three, and we know one, two, three, amen?
[time=2164] That's my life.
[time=2165] Is that your life too?
[time=2166] That is my life, for sure.
[time=2169] Think about the selfies you put up.
[time=2170] You put up the good ones, right?
[time=2172] You took 18 selfies, and you put up the only one where you didn't have something in your teeth, or you didn't blink, or somebody didn't photobomb you.
[time=2180] But people think that you never got photobombed, that you never blink, that your clothes always look that nice.
[time=2186] Am I right?
[time=2187] But if they only knew what happened behind the scenes, that's my life.
[time=2193] I think it's yours, too.
[time=2194] I think it's more all of our lives than any of us truly grab hold of in life sometimes.
[time=2199] Now let's talk about how, then, can we break the chains of comparison?
[time=2202] Let's go to 2 Corinthians 3, you want to read the rest of those verses, I want to give you two ways.
[time=2206] I believe from this passage, you can break the chains of comparison.
[time=2210] Let's look at number one, it comes from verses 12 through 15.
[time=2214] Number one is refuse.
[time=2216] Somebody say refuse, refuse to hide behind a barrier that Jesus already broke.
[time=2225] And we compare a lot of times we hide behind barriers that Jesus already tore down.
[time=2230] Let's look at it.
[time=2231] I already told you to give you a little bit of background on Moses, that's 3 verses 12 through 15, again starting with 12.
[time=2236] Since we have such hope, we are what?
[time=2239] Very bold.
[time=2240] Not like Moses who put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not gaze at the outcome of what was being brought to an end, verse 14.
[time=2250] But their minds were hardened for to this day.
[time=2253] So here's what he's saying, "Even back to the time of Moses, all the way to this time in which I write to you now, and it's another caveat for us, is that it goes all the way to the time of all the readers." Paul had no idea perhaps, maybe he did, I don't know what Paul thought as he wrote, but man God has transcended what any man could do with his writings and it transcends even to this day, your day, in my day I believe.
[time=2277] When they read the old covenant he said, "The same veil remains unlifted because only through,"
[time=2284] you should underline this part, "only through Christ is it taken away."
[time=2292] Verse 15, "Yes, to this day, whenever Moses is read," again he's just reiterating it, "a veil lies over their hearts." Some of us like those people, not just have a veil over our face, to maybe hide what's
[time=2306] there and we'll talk some more about that, why we wear veils and what gets us to those places.
[time=2311] But some of us don't just have a veil over our face with our selfies and our Pinterest pens and our Instagram pictures.
[time=2317] We have a veil over our heart and we've been hiding and putting a barrier between us and
[time=2323] God that Jesus already tore apart.
[time=2328] For some of you today is going to be that day, I believe it.
[time=2331] Not because I'm preaching, but because Jesus is real, he's alive and he knows every skeleton in your closet, yet he still loves you.
[time=2340] Somebody's going to find that today.
[time=2341] I believe it's going to change your eternity today and you're not going to be like those with a veil over your heart today.
[time=2347] So let's talk about this idea of refusing to hide behind a barrier that Jesus already broke and I truly believe that when you realize Jesus broke the barrier that comes from my weakness, my weakness, my sin.
[time=2358] When Jesus breaks that barrier, he not only breaks apart my weakness, but he breaks apart.
[time=2364] Hear me.
[time=2365] He breaks apart my need to hide that weakness.
[time=2368] He breaks apart my need to act like I've got to have a veil and I've got to always look like I've got it all together.
[time=2373] Does that mean you go around completely negative and always tearing people apart?
[time=2377] No, you get the opposite effect when you know what Jesus has broken, the barrier that sin created between us and God, Jesus tore it apart when we get that.
[time=2386] Not only does Jesus overcome our weakness, Jesus overcomes our need to try to hide the weakness because it's in our weakness that he has made strong.
[time=2397] When we're at our lowest point, Jesus says it's strong as he has ever been.
[time=2402] When you see your sin overtaking you, Jesus already broke that barrier.
[time=2408] That's why I believe in preaching from my own weaknesses.
[time=2412] A lot of times people, you know, the compliments I give as a pastor, they usually don't come from man.
[time=2417] The way you exegeted that passage, brother.
[time=2421] You know what they usually come from?
[time=2423] Thanks for being real.
[time=2425] It's nice to know that even the pastor struggles and I want you to know, I struggle.
[time=2431] You would tell me your struggles in your life.
[time=2432] I'd probably just go, you know me too.
[time=2434] A lot of times in the church we go, well, you should.
[time=2438] I struggle.
[time=2439] Well, you should.
[time=2441] Just look at somebody in your life and just say, you know what, me too.
[time=2445] I get it.
[time=2446] I hurt too, I struggle too and then when we come together, even in the midst of all of
[time=2453] our mess and our weaknesses and our terrible relationships, Jesus comes through on the platform
[time=2460] of people who are unified around the only thing, the only Savior who truly ever was the
[time=2466] better half.
[time=2468] We should strive to be the better half, but Jesus was already the better half.
[time=2471] Spoiler alert.
[time=2472] I wasn't supposed to say that until the last week of the series, right, but that's the key.
[time=2477] Isn't it?
[time=2478] To realize that Jesus was the better half, so now we can be as well.
[time=2480] And so that's why my goal is that we never have a plastic pulpit at Black Hawk.
[time=2487] I've seen a lot of plastic pulpits where all we do is just talk from our strengths and not like everything in our church is perfect.
[time=2493] This place is messy just like your life is messy.
[time=2496] We all hurt just like you hurt in your relationships.
[time=2499] I refuse to let this pulpit be a plastic pulpit.
[time=2503] It's going to be one that even in the middle of all the pain and the problems and my past and my imperfections that the power of God can work through and in the midst of any of it.
[time=2513] That's the kind of church that Jesus is building, and he said, "I'll build my church," and even the gates of hell can't prevail against it.
[time=2522] That's what you're a part of when you're digging into the church.
[time=2524] So verse 15, he says, "There's a veil over their hearts." Jesus already broke that veil, and so I think a lot of times for them, they were living in the past.
[time=2533] I think this group of people lived in the glory days of Moses.
[time=2537] Back in Moses' time, and you hear that in church, "Well, back when so and so was pastor, or back in this season of our church, or back in this season of my relationship," and that's great.
[time=2546] I'm all for celebrating history.
[time=2547] I'm glad that we celebrate Moses, but Jesus didn't die on the cross so that we live in the past.
[time=2552] Jesus died in the cross because there's power that comes from that in the present that changes everything about my future.
[time=2558] And so in this passage as he's talking about this, let me speak to parents for a minute.
[time=2562] As they were living in the past, I'm going to give you a statement, "Don't miss the moment." This is beyond parenting, but maybe it'll help some parents here today, too.
[time=2569] Don't miss the moment because you're stuck in what once was or what might be.
[time=2580] Fear of what's to come, or fear of how what's in my past may come back up and haunt me in my present.
[time=2586] Don't miss the moment.
[time=2587] But parents, it's so easy to hate that your kids are growing up so much that you say, "Well, I wish they were little again," but live in the moment where they are now.
[time=2596] They got to the moment where they are now because you were at least somewhat faithful in the time when they were little.
[time=2602] And this is going to happen as they progress, just like our faith.
[time=2605] We're called to step forward.
[time=2606] So live in those moments as Jesus pours into you in the middle of your mess.
[time=2611] Live in the moment he's placed you in.
[time=2613] Thrive where you've been planted right now.
[time=2615] You want a different job.
[time=2617] The best way to get to the unknown will of God, by the way, is to live in the known will of God where he's planted you right now.
[time=2623] Live in the known will of God.
[time=2625] Be faithful with where he's planted you, and then he will walk you towards the unknown parts of his will that you're striving forward to receive and to achieve.
[time=2634] He's already there.
[time=2636] Don't miss the moment because you're stuck.
[time=2638] And so that means for us, sometimes we would rather pin or post on social media the projects
[time=2644] we want to do.
[time=2646] Maybe you want you pin about a coloring project or a painting project.
[time=2650] Well I would challenge you, don't pin about the future project.
[time=2653] Get out the paint brushes and the crayons that are in your drawer and do the best you can do with what you've got right now in the season.
[time=2659] Now is that about a coloring sheet?
[time=2661] No.
[time=2662] Maybe it is.
[time=2663] Maybe you should go home and color.
[time=2664] Coloring is fun.
[time=2665] But there's so much more to that thought.
[time=2666] Use what God has planted inside of you right now to thrive in the moment he's placed you in.
[time=2672] Don't get so caught up in where you're trying to get to in your life that you missed where God has you.
[time=2676] Number two, not just this refuse to hide behind a barrier Jesus tore down, but remember, that's
[time=2683] what we're going to do in taking communion in just a few minutes, we're going to remember.
[time=2687] I'm just going to reflect and remember, but remember the freedom Jesus already bought.
[time=2693] He already broke all of those barriers.
[time=2695] Why?
[time=2696] Because he purchased you.
[time=2699] Because he already bought the freedom that you could not afford, that I could not afford.
[time=2704] He already bought it.
[time=2705] And so remember the price that was paid and I've learned in my life that remembering the right stuff will help me refuse the wrong stuff.
[time=2714] If you remember the right stuff in your life, you zoom in and focus on those things, it'll help you refuse the wrong things in your life and I want to read to you.
[time=2722] You don't have to turn there, but I just want to read it to you and Luke in just a second.
[time=2726] Let's read our passage first, second Corinthians three, sets it up so well.
[time=2730] Let's start in verse 16.
[time=2731] You see this in verses 16 through 18, I love verse 16.
[time=2737] But when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.
[time=2744] But when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed, it's finished, it's done.
[time=2751] Now the Lord, verse 17 is the spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is, not was, not will
[time=2759] be, where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
[time=2766] I love verse 18.
[time=2767] And we all with unveiled face and we all with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord
[time=2776] are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another, for this comes from how good I can be.
[time=2784] When I strive to be the better half, this comes from the Lord who is spirit and where
[time=2792] the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
[time=2795] I want to read Luke at the end of Jesus' life.
[time=2798] Luke 23, you don't have to flip there, but Luke 23, 44, 3, 46 is where Jesus is hanging on the cross, paying that price we've been talking about, it says it was about the sixth hour and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
[time=2810] And when the sun's light failed, the curtain of the temple was torn in two.
[time=2817] That's that veil I was telling you about that signified the barrier between us and God and the presence of God and the heart of man and then it was Jesus calling out with a loud voice, verse 46, "Father into your hands I commit my spirit." In Matthew 27, verse 51, it's that same account of Jesus' death, it says that that veil was ripped, but it also says that it was ripped from top to bottom.
[time=2838] I love that it was ripped from top to bottom because it signifies that we could never rip it from the bottom up.
[time=2844] We could never get rid of that veil, but only Jesus could tear it down and when He died on that cross, paid that brutal death for you and for me.
[time=2852] It was at that moment God came down to man and ripped the veil that represented the barrier between us and Him from top to bottom because only He could do it, but He did it and He did it for you and He did it for me.
[time=2867] That is where it's celebrating.
[time=2869] That'll help you be the better half when you realize that God's stooped down to you, met you where you are.
[time=2876] Some of you need Him to do that today and I think today He's going to do just that.
[time=2881] He's going to change your life.
[time=2882] He's going to change your heart where the Spirit of the Lord is.
[time=2886] There is freedom.
[time=2887] How many of you have ever seen extreme home makeover?
[time=2889] It's an older show kind of back in the day, right?
[time=2892] But I always love that show and when they show the house of things, they do this house and the family that they're blessing doesn't get to see it until the end, it's the moral of the story.
[time=2901] It's usually somebody that's in great need and very much worthy of a big blessing and it's a wonderful thing to see.
[time=2905] I love it because at the end they have the little things in front of the house and you don't get to see the house.
[time=2909] When they unveil, when they show the finished product, what is the camera focus on?
[time=2915] Think about it.
[time=2920] It's the face of the people.
[time=2922] You don't get your first take on what the house, the project actually looks like.
[time=2927] The end result actually looks like until you first see the face, the expression of the people who are receiving it in the same way.
[time=2935] This is where it gets right down to our hearts and the same way there are some people in your life that are going to get their first impression, their first take of what the end result of eternity truly is when we know Jesus Christ by the looks on your face, by how
[time=2948] real maybe you can be and you say, "Well, that means that's more of a reason to look perfect." No, it's the opposite.
[time=2953] People look at who you really are and if they can see Jesus working in the middle of your mess and my mess, then they're going to say, "Wow, maybe he could actually work in mine too." And by the look on your face, by you showing them your Elmo cake, they may see the glory
[time=2969] of God in a way that they would never see it.
[time=2972] You may be the only Jesus some will ever see.
[time=2975] The only Bible some will ever read.
[time=2977] I'm going to share this with you and this is your challenge for the week.
[time=2980] I love verse 18 because it just says with unveiled faces is to unveil.
[time=2986] Take the veil off.
[time=2987] The thing about veils, look at this for a minute, think about if I had a big cloth here and I'm covered up.
[time=2991] The point would be that you couldn't see what's behind the veil, right?
[time=2995] Sometimes I really need veils and see me in the morning sometimes, right?
[time=3001] But the point is that you don't get to see what's behind the veil, but if I wore a veil, I also don't get to see outside of the veil.
[time=3008] And so when I'm trying to hide what's behind the veil, the veil is covering up my ability to see God for who he truly is.
[time=3016] So a veil, yes, it covers up what's behind it, but it also distorts your vision and your ability to be able to see God for who he is in your life and meet you where you are.
[time=3025] So let's take the veils off.
[time=3026] And here's what I'll tell you.
[time=3027] Instead of this week.
[time=3028] So what do I do, Pastor?
[time=3029] That's great.
[time=3030] You gave me some great points, you know, refused to hide behind a barrier, Jesus already broke and remember the price he's already paid, the freedom he's already bought.
[time=3038] That's great.
[time=3039] But how do I do that?
[time=3040] I want to just give you one thought this week.
[time=3042] Sometimes those preachers were bad about just giving you 18 steps and you're like, man, I can't even get through one, one-eighth of the step, the first step, right?
[time=3050] So I want to give you one step, one challenge, one thought that might encourage you.
[time=3053] This week, instead of comparing yourself to the glory of others, when you feel a tendency to do that, here's what I challenge you, instead of comparing yourself to the glory of others, try contemplating the glory of God.
[time=3066] I truly believe that the more we focus on the glory of God, what does contemplate?
[time=3072] What does that mean?
[time=3073] It means to dwell on, means to think about, means to consider.
[time=3077] I truly believe the more we dwell on, think about and consider the standard of glory which
[time=3083] is God himself.
[time=3084] We will realize we will never, ever, ever, ever, ever meet that standard and we'd stop trying to compare ourselves to the glory of other people and using that as a standard.
[time=3093] We get the right standard in place.
[time=3095] We contemplate who God is and remember the price he's already paid for the freedom that we have, the need to compare ourselves to the glory of others starts to kind of fade away.
[time=3106] You may even find yourself posting on Pinterestfail.com this week.
[time=3110] But what a glorious step that could be for some of us, to have the security because that's what it boils down to, everybody hear me for a minute, it really boils down to how you see yourself.
[time=3120] It really does.
[time=3121] It has nothing to do with those other people like you think it does, it really has everything to do with your identity.
[time=3126] That's why the bottom line is my identity hinges on him, not on them.
[time=3131] What was that question again?
[time=3132] Who's the them in your life?
[time=3134] Bring them up in your mind again, maybe it's a what, it may not be a person, maybe a thing
[time=3140] in your life.
[time=3141] It could be a lot of different things, but what is the them in your life?
[time=3144] Your identity hinges on him, not on them.
[time=3148] I love Galatians chapter 4 and to tie this together.
[time=3151] I just want to challenge you to think of yourself as God sees you, Galatians 4, beginning in verse 6, you can jot it down.
[time=3155] We're not going to turn there, but God just simply calls us sons and daughters of God.
[time=3162] I love that passage because I'm adopted.
[time=3165] That's why I love the tangible picture of adoption.
[time=3169] There's nothing more of a tangible picture perhaps of our faith in Jesus than physically
[time=3175] adopting a child or someone into our life because that's us.
[time=3179] We were unlovable and unadoptable, but Jesus meant us where we are and adopted us, made us sons.
[time=3186] This week when you don't see yourself like God sees you, I want to challenge you to take your cue about you from the one who made you, the one who defined you.
[time=3194] You know what God says to you?
[time=3197] All I is here for men, I want to tell you something that's going to help you this week.
[time=3200] Truly believe it.
[time=3201] When God looks at you, back to that question, who or what is it that I use as my reference point to let me know I'm okay in life?
[time=3208] You know what God says if you know Jesus today?
[time=3211] You're just fine because you're mine.
[time=3217] I've already bought you, I've already broken down all those barriers.
[time=3223] You're just fine because you're mine.
[time=3224] You bow your heads, think about what that means to you for a moment.
[time=3228] You're just fine because you're mine.
[time=3231] My identity hinges on him, not on them.
[time=3233] What does that mean for you?
[time=3235] If you know Jesus today, I believe that maybe it's time for you to take some steps of allowing
[time=3241] your identity to hinge in the right places.
[time=3245] Maybe you've been comparing and it's time to start contemplating.
[time=3248] Compare less, contemplate more.
[time=3251] Maybe that's your takeaway this week, but let me talk to those of you who would say, you know what, I've compared myself to the glory of God and I'm way short.
[time=3257] I come up way short.
[time=3258] If I were to die today, I just don't know that I would spend eternity in heaven with God because I have a personal relationship with Jesus.
[time=3265] Some of you would say, that's me.
[time=3266] I would like to say that I know 100% that I'd spend eternity there, but I just don't
[time=3272] totally know.
[time=3273] I want you to know that based on the authority of God's Word and of who Jesus is, nothing
[time=3279] to do with anybody in this room, that price has already been paid.
[time=3283] The victory has already been won today.
[time=3285] You can know beyond a shadow of a doubt that you're saved.
[time=3289] You say, well, I've heard these churchy terms saved and salvation and pray in the prayer,
[time=3295] and what does all that mean?
[time=3296] Here's what it means.
[time=3297] It means that you say to Jesus from your heart to his, I'm not even going to lead you in a prayer because I believe your heart is screaming it to God now.
[time=3303] It's as simple as your heart screaming to Jesus, the acknowledgement that you fall so short of his glory, that you can't save yourself anymore, you've been trying, but you can't
[time=3315] get there on your own, but that you believe Jesus died, he paid that price, freedom has already been bought, and that he's alive because he rose again, and you just tell Jesus you
[time=3325] want to trust him to save you instead of trusting yourself.
[time=3329] Scripture promises Jesus looks into the mess that is your heart and relationships in life at times and says, I promise I'll save you where you sit.
[time=3337] You take a moment to fash you and just cry out to Jesus.
[time=3340] It really is that simple, and no, you won't get all those things squared away in your life first.
[time=3346] It'll never happen.
[time=3347] You need Jesus to walk with you.
[time=3349] He doesn't make everything perfect, but he gives you a foundation of power that you've never had before, and it starts with that eternal life that comes from Jesus and Jesus alone.
[time=3357] Will you cry out to him in your heart right now and ask him to save you fash you?
[time=3364] Will I pray that comparison may mean something a little bit different to you now?
[time=3368] Maybe today you have, for the first time, seen how it is that God sees you, that he really
[time=3374] does look at you and say, you know what, you are just fine because you're mine, and maybe it's time for you to take that step where you can be a part of the family of God, and maybe that step has seemed like something that's just out of reach for you, it's not something that's possible for you to attain, but today God has reminded you, God has shown you that it's possible because of Jesus Christ, and that's why we exist, that's why we do what we do every single week is to help people find Jesus and help people walk with Jesus,
[time=3402] and so today if you have not taken that step, maybe you said it's time for me to jump out of this comfort zone of mine, it's time to step over the ledge and truly trust Jesus
[time=3413] to save me.
[time=3414] If that's you, then I challenge you to take that step, I challenge you to step aside, I challenge you to push pause, whatever you've got to do to make that right with God today, and if you have done that, if you're doing that right now, we want to know, we want to hear your story, we want to walk alongside of you, and today you can truly say, when I compare myself to the glory of God, I fall so short, I fall so short, but Jesus meets
[time=3437] me right there, and he cares about me in that spot where I fall so short, and we want to walk beside you as you enter into that new world of salvation, that new eternal life that the Bible talks about, that God looks at you and says you're just fine, because your mind, take your cue about you from the one who made you today, that's my challenge to you, I pray it means something new to you, and if you have taken that step, we want to get a resource into your hand, we don't just like pointing you to Jesus, we want to help you find Jesus and then walk with him, and so we've got a booklet called Beginning Steps, A Growth Guide for New Believers, now that book is going to walk you through some steps that will help you not just sit stagnant in your faith, but actually take steps in your faith, move forward in your faith, it'll help you see what baptism is all about, and we'd love to baptize you here at Black Hawk Ministries, or just help equip you to know what it means so you can do that at your local church, or wherever God plugs you in, we want you to find a place to just be in community with him, and so we want to get one of these in your hands, there's going to be information on your screen that you can email us or call us, and we would love to mail one to you, we'd love to give one to you in person, and I just want to challenge you to take those steps forward in your faith today, knowing that God looks at you and he cares about you right where you are, it's a joy, it's a privilege, it's an honor, just to get to share with you the love of Jesus, the gospel, the gospel's good news, and good news it is indeed, it's how it happened, it's news, it's finished,
[time=3521] it's done, but it continues through you and through me, and we're honored to partner with you surrounding that very fact here at Black Hawk Ministries, thanks for watching today, and I want to invite you back next week, we're going to close out our Better Half series, we're going to be looking at how we can be the better half by just simply doing our part,
[time=3538] so many times we get consumed in our relationships by them, who's them, just like our identity hinges on him and not them, we get consumed in them doing their part so much maybe that
[time=3549] we miss the fact that God's already doing his, and he just wants us to do ours, I want us to discover next week how we can do our part and do it to the best of our ability, close them to the Lord next week, invite you back, see you then.
