[time=585] Thank you so much for tuning in today. It's just a joy and a privilege to be able to share some time with you, some time in your busy schedule just to focus on Jesus, focus on what he has for you, and I want you to know he does have something for you today.
[time=593] Focus on Jesus, focus on what he has for you, and I want you to know he does have something for you today. I'm really excited about today's message because we're going to be looking at how we can do our part in relationships.
[time=605] And as we continue to worship, as we continue just to ready ourselves for God to do something new in our lives, I just challenge you to sit back and relax and know that God has already done his part in your life.
[time=617] And that's what we're going to look at. We're going to dig into how the part that Jesus has already done impacts the part in your relationships that he is calling you to do. And I pray it's a big blessing to you today.

[time=695] [MUSIC - 152 seconds]
[time=860] Well, we're in a series of messages called "Better Half" and I like cookies. Do you like cookies?
[time=867] I made a promise a couple of weeks ago if you're new with us, I'm just going to tell you, if you'll hang in there with me, you may or may not just get a treat as you leave today.
[time=875] I'm just leaving that there for you.
[time=877] We're talking about relationships and how important those relationships are to us and I can't think of a more important relationship than my mama.
[time=886] I'm a mama's boy. Any other mama's boys in the building?
[time=889] Are mama's girls? Yeah.
[time=891] Shout out to all the moms today.
[time=893] Can we just thank them one more time for all they do?
[time=895] Absolutely.
[time=901] I want to say Happy Mother's Day to my mom and then to my lovely bride.
[time=905] And for those of you guys who may feel like you could just use a new layer of appreciation for the ladies in your life, I'm going to give you a hint as to how you can get to that level of appreciation.
[time=915] Send her away for a weekend.
[time=917] My wife, Jessica, has gone to visit her moms coming back in town today
[time=923] and I want you to know that our kids are here.
[time=926] Their socks match and their hair is combed.
[time=929] And I have a new found appreciation for the lady in my life as well.
[time=937] So ladies, we love you and we are excited about today.
[time=940] What a great day for us with baby dedication.
[time=942] Our stage filled with little ones that we're dedicating to the Lord.
[time=946] And then today now we're wrapping up actually this four weeks of focus emphasis on being the better half.
[time=952] And you know this statement by now.
[time=954] I hope if you're new with us, you can join in with us.
[time=956] Pretty simple and easy to explain and apply maybe a little bit more difficult.
[time=961] But let's say what our series statement is that there are two halves to every relationship.
[time=966] So make yours thee.
[time=968] Say that again.
[time=970] Make yours thee.
[time=971] Better half.
[time=973] I've had a lot of better halves in my life in relationships.
[time=977] Only one as a wife, but a lot of better halves.
[time=980] A lot of people who went the extra mile to meet me where I was.
[time=984] And I believe that's what our calling is.
[time=986] Is it not to try and be that better half to meet people where they are as Jesus met us in this whole thing.
[time=993] Here's what I know.
[time=994] Some of you are here for baby dedication.
[time=996] Some of you may not do this whole church thing.
[time=998] I want to welcome our extended family watching us online today.
[time=1001] Or watching us on television or at home.
[time=1004] You may not do church and that may be why you're at home.
[time=1006] But something prompted you just to come today to sit in this building or to log in to look at what God may have for you.
[time=1013] I want to tell you I'm well aware when you hear a pastor a lot of times say we're in a series on relationships.
[time=1018] It's like well how many weeks is that relationship?
[time=1020] Well this one's four.
[time=1021] Well I'll see you in five.
[time=1023] It's like well I'm not listening to you talk about relationships.
[time=1026] Yours probably aren't much better than mine.
[time=1028] You know what I would tell you?
[time=1029] You're probably exactly right.
[time=1031] And that's exactly why we need to dig in and learn what it means to be the better half.
[time=1036] And so look at Colossians three with me.
[time=1038] That's what we're going to do.
[time=1039] Looking at the last week of this series.
[time=1042] And I want to just talk about doing my part.
[time=1045] That's what we've been saying.
[time=1046] We're saying there are two halves to every relationship.
[time=1048] So let me make mine the better half.
[time=1051] That's let me do my part.
[time=1053] And then the other part.
[time=1054] The other people in the equation.
[time=1056] If you want to add some notes to the notes that you're already taking over here.
[time=1059] I believe there are three parts to every relationship.
[time=1062] There's God's part.
[time=1063] There's my part.
[time=1065] And there's their part.
[time=1068] And we're going to look at how all those things apply.
[time=1070] And I hope I can come back to those three parts.
[time=1072] God's part.
[time=1073] My part.
[time=1074] Their part.
[time=1075] Toward the end of this message.
[time=1076] And maybe they mean something new to you.
[time=1078] Maybe your part looks and feels and maybe gets approached a little bit differently.
[time=1082] Let's look at Colossians chapter number three.
[time=1085] Colossians three.
[time=1087] Beginning there in verse one.
[time=1089] I want to read the first few verses and our main text will be a little bit later.
[time=1092] But this sets us up really well.
[time=1094] Who's ready for the word this morning?
[time=1096] If you're new with us at Blackhawk we believe that God's word has the last word.
[time=1101] He wrote it.
[time=1102] He wrote it to you.
[time=1104] And we believe the Bible and we believe it's going to do something inside of your heart today.
[time=1109] Somebody's leaving here looking at your part a little bit differently because you're going to see who God is and how he's done his part.
[time=1115] Somebody's leaving here knowing what it means to be the better half.
[time=1119] Because you're going to run into Jesus as we look at his words today.
[time=1122] Who's ready for that?
[time=1124] In chapter three verses one through four.
[time=1127] The apostle Paul writes this and he says, "If then you have been raised with Christ, seek
[time=1133] the things that are above." Be the better half you could fill in there.
[time=1136] Seek those things where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
[time=1142] Set your minds on the things that are above, not on the things that are of the earth.
[time=1147] For you have died.
[time=1148] Love that verse.
[time=1150] Take a somebody and say, "You're dead." For you have died.
[time=1156] Just what you wanted to come to church and hear today, right?
[time=1158] You need another reminder of how dead you are.
[time=1161] You said, "I felt plenty dead without your help.
[time=1163] Thank you very much." But it says, "For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
[time=1170] When Christ, I love this part.
[time=1172] When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you will also appear with Him in glory."
[time=1181] Love those verses.
[time=1182] We're going to look at some practical things that will help you do your part to do what Paul is talking about.
[time=1187] Setting your minds on things above and being the better half today is what we're going to dig into.
[time=1192] I'm going to give you the bottom line.
[time=1193] Every week I try to give you a bottom line.
[time=1195] This is really what we're going to look at.
[time=1196] This is what the Scripture tells us and this week the bottom line is simply this.
[time=1200] "I can do my part because Jesus already did His."
[time=1214] Anybody glad of that today?
[time=1216] There have been so many times in my life and my relationships where I failed to do my part.
[time=1222] This week the house might be a little bit of a mess, but the kids have socks that match.
[time=1229] Sometimes it's way worse than the house being a mess because moms out of town sometimes we don't meet people where they are.
[time=1235] We're not humble.
[time=1236] We're not patient.
[time=1237] We're not going to put on the things that Paul's going to challenge us to put on, but what I want you to look at this text there, because usually this is one of those texts in Scripture where we look at it and say, "Wow, that's overwhelming.
[time=1246] I could never, ever even do that." We would never tell anybody that, but we leave here going, "No way can I do the things that that guy wrote about, no way." I would tell you, you're probably right.
[time=1256] You're definitely right.
[time=1258] But today I want to give you a different perspective on how the fact, because it is a fact, and we put our fate in the facts of God's word, that Jesus already did his part, how the fact that Jesus did his part affects my part.
[time=1271] That's what I want us to dig into.
[time=1272] Paul's going to give us some great verses.
[time=1273] I want to give you a couple of verses you could write down along these lines.
[time=1277] I love 1 John 4, 19.
[time=1278] We love because he first loved us.
[time=1282] You think you can't love, "Well, maybe you haven't run into the love of God because we don't have that much capacity to love well outside of the fact that God already showed us what love is." And when that love permeates our hearts, then we have a little bit of something different that we can give out.
[time=1298] We love because he first loved us.
[time=1301] John chapter 13, Jesus said it this way, verses 34 and 35.
[time=1305] He says, "A new command I give to you." And everyone listening would think, "Well, what's new?
[time=1309] What's new?" And you're going to be thinking when I'm finished reading this verse, "What's new about that?" That's not new.
[time=1314] It's very new to the people that Jesus was speaking to and to the people that Paul was writing to.
[time=1319] We'll get there in a minute.
[time=1320] But Jesus said, "A new command I give to you that you love one another." That's the new command.
[time=1325] That you love one another.
[time=1327] Just as I have loved you, starting to shift there, just as I have loved you, you also were to love one another.
[time=1333] By this, all people will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another.
[time=1341] Now Jesus was talking to a group of people, Paul and Colossians 3 that we're reading today was writing to a group of people who wouldn't look at humility, gentleness, kindness,
[time=1353] long suffering or patience.
[time=1354] I call that the P word.
[time=1356] That's the hardest one for me just so you know.
[time=1358] They wouldn't look at those things as norms.
[time=1360] We hear those and we're like, "Yeah, we're supposed to do those things.
[time=1362] We know that.
[time=1363] It doesn't feel new to us." But the people that Paul was writing to, they were in the Roman Greco world where there was no way that would be the norm.
[time=1371] It was a macho, manly, getting my point across, do whatever it takes care of me in mind, kind
[time=1377] of mentality, sounds familiar in some ways, shapes and forms even today, doesn't it?
[time=1382] But it would be a new command.
[time=1384] It would be a new thing for them to embrace that kind of a mindset.
[time=1387] And maybe for you, it's also a new mindset.
[time=1390] Maybe in the world and context we live in, it is a new mindset and maybe it feels just as overwhelming to you as it does to me.
[time=1397] Can I get a name in?
[time=1399] Those things are not easy to employ in our relationships.
[time=1401] Being the better half is no joke.
[time=1404] It's not for wimps to be the better half.
[time=1407] And so today I want us to look at this and so here's the thing.
[time=1409] What is the biggest part about doing my part?
[time=1412] What's the biggest thing I can do to do my part?
[time=1415] You ready for it?
[time=1416] It's all about what you wear.
[time=1420] It's true.
[time=1421] Paul's going to tell us in just a minute.
[time=1423] It's all about what you wear.
[time=1425] Paul's going to talk about what we need to put on, what we need to clothe ourselves with.
[time=1430] You ever had times in your life where it was all about what you wear?
[time=1433] We had babies up here, they were dressed up, didn't they look beautiful by the way?
[time=1437] It was all about the dress but then again it really wasn't, was it?
[time=1440] They dressed up because of the occasion and a lot of times we learn a lot about people by what they wear, do we not?
[time=1447] We can learn a lot about people by what they wear.
[time=1450] Let's talk about that fact for a minute.
[time=1452] Let's look at this guy.
[time=1453] Can you tell who this person's for by what they're wearing?
[time=1459] Any packer fans in the building?
[time=1462] All right, all right, it gets really divisive when you're a preacher and you start talking about sports teams because everybody's here, so you know what he's for because of what he wears, right?
[time=1471] What about this guy?
[time=1472] You know who he's for?
[time=1475] Because of what he's got on, Chicago Bears, any Bears fans?
[time=1479] Okay, I think maybe this would actually be a better Bears fan picture to be honest with me, I had to do it, I'm sorry, please, please don't check out, God's word transcends all
[time=1495] of our sports teams, Jesus is bigger than sports, but you can tell a lot about these people because of what they wear, what about in church, what should a Jesus follower wear?
[time=1506] Has anybody ever told you before?
[time=1507] I've been told before, I know when I first went into minister, I was told on my job description what you need to wear on Sunday mornings, it's what Jesus followers should wear, right?
[time=1518] Most of the time it looks something like this, doesn't it?
[time=1520] It's what we go to, suits and ties, why don't you look around for a minute?
[time=1526] You see suits and ties, I'm not picking on you, you look great, your wife did an outstanding
[time=1532] job picking that out for you.
[time=1535] But you look around, what do you see?
[time=1536] You see suits and ties.
[time=1538] I look around and I see shorts and flip flops, t-shirts, I try to wear jeans every week
[time=1544] because I think it just puts people at ease to help you know you're part of a place where it doesn't matter what you wear to come in, little side note, I'm saying it doesn't matter what we wear, but then I'm saying it doesn't, but I'm going to tie those together in a minute.
[time=1555] In this sense, what we wear to the church building, we don't care.
[time=1560] You can wear whatever you want to wear and you are going to be loved right where you are, you don't have to have the best of the best to come into this place because we just bring all of our mess, we just bring all that we are to this place, we lay it down at the foot of the cross and Jesus meets us right there, so if you ever, ever hear anybody say you've got to wear something special or you need to come to this place, you tell them that's just not the case that we accept people exactly as they are.
[time=1585] That's the environment Jesus built, that's the environment we're building here, just so you know.
[time=1590] Now back to why it should matter what you wear.
[time=1591] A lot of times we think Jesus followers, well you've got to dress up, you've got to look at the part, you know, and a lot of people when you may go from suits and ties to something more like this.
[time=1601] You ever met that guy before, you're definitely buying what he's selling, right?
[time=1609] John 3 16 is where it's at.
[time=1611] Now let's talk about Colossians 3, it matters what you wear.
[time=1614] Paul's going to talk about how we can know what Jesus followers should wear.
[time=1620] We can know what Jesus followers should wear.
[time=1623] And this was even before buttons and zippers were even invented.
[time=1627] But he meets us right there.
[time=1628] Let's talk about this question, how can I do my part to be the better half?
[time=1632] How can I do my part, that's the theme of the day, to be the better half.
[time=1636] And we know I can do my part because Jesus already did his, but now how practically can we employ that mindset, knowing that Jesus did his part, he met us there, he was the better half.
[time=1646] Now how can I in turn be the better half in my relationships?
[time=1650] Romans 12 verse 18, you should jot that down, great verse, Romans 12, 18 says if possible so far as it depends on you in parentheses, so much as it depends on you doing your part.
[time=1662] So much as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.
[time=1666] Let's talk about a couple of ways that we can do just that.
[time=1669] Number one, Colossians 3, it comes from verses 9 and 10, we'll look there, break through your old self, break through your old self, who's here and needs a breakthrough today?
[time=1682] Anybody say, I just need a breakthrough.
[time=1685] Sometimes we just need a breakthrough moment, maybe you're here and maybe that's what you're going to find today.
[time=1690] Let's look at Colossians 3 verses 9 and 10, let's read that together and some of those do's and do not's in here that feel so overwhelming but it's going to come together I think in maybe a new way that might just walk with you different this week.
[time=1702] Verse 9, Colossians 3, Paul says, do not lie to one another, that's good in being the better half, seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices and have put
[time=1713] on the new self which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator.
[time=1721] I love that last part, we skip it, we just say okay I got it, get rid of the old self and get the new self.
[time=1726] No, the new self comes from the fact that Jesus already did his part, it's saying it's being renewed in the knowledge and the image of the one that created the new self, meaning you can't create the new self, it's already been done.
[time=1738] Jesus already did his part so that you could have the new self so that your old self could pass away and he could make all things new.
[time=1748] So today we're going to talk about the first part of this is how can I break through my old self?
[time=1752] Have you ever fought with you before?
[time=1760] I beat myself up all the time, I criticize myself, I challenge myself to do things, let
[time=1766] myself down or is that just me or do you do that too?
[time=1769] You tell yourself how I'm going to do this tomorrow no matter what and then tomorrow comes and then the next day comes and then three weeks comes and you never got there and you have trouble just breaking through these barriers that seem so overwhelming and
[time=1783] today I want us to look at how we can break through your old self to all the moms in the room today and on Mother's Day I want you to know I realize that you may have not had
[time=1795] the best influences on your life, I'm fully aware of that, I think about that a lot how
[time=1802] I was blessed with an amazing mom who was a huge influence on my life, I've seen family
[time=1808] members that didn't have that blessing, didn't have that privilege, maybe as has already been mentioned, maybe your mom is no longer with us or maybe life looks a little different for you than the cookie cutter picture here but I want to give you a statement that I truly believe is going to help you and it's going to help whoever you are, I don't care what walk of life, what those challenges, what those barriers you need to break through, look like, the statement is simply this that no matter what influence I've had on my life I can still be a godly influence in the lives of others.
[time=1837] Some of you don't believe me but I believe as we look at how Jesus already did his part you'll see that your part can truly lead you to having a godly influence in the lives of other people no matter what influence you've had on your life.
[time=1851] We haven't all had the blessings of the same good influences in our life, you've probably had one or two and you should celebrate them by the way, great side note, you want to be the better half today, make sure your mom or the lady in your life or whoever's invested in you and filled some of those voids in your life, whatever that has needed to look like, let them know that they're loved and valued today and that doesn't mean the wilting flowers that were left over in the car, no go tell her, go give them a hug, go let them know that
[time=1877] they're valued and that they're loved but here's the thing, some of you have been being held back by influences, by cycles that have yet to be broken in your family, relationships
[time=1889] are messy, can I get a witness, you got any of those?
[time=1895] Those are messy, relationships become huge messes that feel like huge barriers that
[time=1901] we could never break through sometimes but no matter what influences and barriers have been poured onto your life, Jesus can do a work inside of you that will allow you to be a godly influence in the lives of all he puts into your path and it all comes and it will flow through the part that Jesus already did.
[time=1921] You can, everybody look at me for a minute, I want to tell you something that maybe you've never been told, you can break that cycle, you can break that cycle.
[time=1935] What cycle, that one, the one that came into your mind, the one that you can't seem to break through, yes you can, why?
[time=1943] Because even though your part feels so difficult, Jesus already did his and when Jesus already did his, inside of you lives the power and all that you need, first Peter, all that you need that pertains to life and godliness and if I may add being the better half, you
[time=1960] have everything you need right at your fingertips, why?
[time=1963] Because you can do your part because Jesus already did his, no matter what influence you've had on your life, you can be that influence, the better half in the lives of others.
[time=1973] Maybe it's time to break some cycles for you today, maybe it's time to take some of those steps that you never thought you could take, but here's where it gets hard, before I give you the second one, I want to give you another component of breaking through your old self and it's this, that a lot of times to get to a breakthrough, the best way you can get there is for God to break you.
[time=1997] Brokenness is often the bridge to breakthroughs, brokenness is often the bridge to breakthroughs.
[time=2007] Before I got there, you said I really do want to be the better half, but if I've got to get broken to be the better half, I don't know, it's a lot more challenging, but some of you came in and you brought your brokenness with you, you've got a backpack full of brokenness.
[time=2021] In your hands are the shattered pieces of the things that you thought would be whole at this point of your life, you brought your brokenness with you, I don't know what that
[time=2031] looks like for you, I don't pretend to know, I'm not the guy who says I know how you feel, I know it, whoever told you that they don't know how you feel, except for Jesus because you know what, Jesus knows about all your brokenness, he saw you bring it in today and
[time=2047] it's in those broken pieces, those broken moments that God can often bring about the greatest
[time=2053] breakthroughs in your life, don't discount the brokenness, don't just look at it as a
[time=2060] passing season that you'll just do whatever it takes to get through it, no, be in the moment of your brokenness, allow God to break you, what if I were to tell you today that in order for you to be the better half, that God must break you in order to get you to a breakthrough, would you still be all in?
[time=2078] Some of you said I didn't say I was all in, but I am all in, not by my choice, even in those moments God will use your brokenness and lead to breakthroughs and what does that look like?
[time=2089] I can think of one of my favorite practical examples was a guy that was addicted to pornography, and he had been working with me, we had set him up on all kinds of accountability, softwares and all kinds of stuff and paired him up with a lot of different people and he was struggling with this so bad and it just was something he felt like he could never break through of his life, he contemplated suicide over it, he gave up and came back and said I do
[time=2114] want to break through over and over, but finally you know what happened, I'm not saying he doesn't still struggle with it, I'm sure that he does because our struggles seem to follow us around.
[time=2124] Have you ever noticed that we live in a broken world, so your brokenness just keeps coming back and breaking you again?
[time=2129] I'm sure that was the case for him, but he got so broken that his main struggle with
[time=2135] smartphones and he got so broken that he traded in his smartphone for a flip phone.
[time=2144] I'm not kidding, to this day if you see this guy, he'll have a flip phone because he was so broken, so desperate for a breakthrough that he would do whatever it took to allow God to work in him and through him and if it meant throwing aside the things that were normal, the things that might even bring about some criticism and some questions, he was okay with it because his brokenness had led him to a place where God was ready to break through.
[time=2170] Some of you are ready for a breakthrough today and it's the brokenness that you brought to the table that God's going to use to do just that.
[time=2177] Let me give you number two, not just break through your old self, let's get real practical.
[time=2181] Verses 12 through 17, number two is believe, and some might say believe, believe in the
[time=2187] sufficiency of God's grace.
[time=2190] We say I believe in that, do you?
[time=2193] Do I truly believe in it?
[time=2196] Sometimes to believe in the sufficiency of God's grace is going to mean to bring all of my brokenness and be so broken and so dependent on him that there's nowhere else
[time=2205] to turn when it comes to self-effort versus grace-driven effort that's what we're going to look at, that our brokenness has got us to this place where all we can do is look to him.
[time=2214] Maybe that's not such a bad place.
[time=2215] Let's look at verses 12 through 17 and if you don't think you need God's grace, wait
[time=2221] until after I read these verses.
[time=2224] If you're good at doing all of these verses without God's grace, then I want you to write the book and I am your first customer.
[time=2230] Let's read it together.
[time=2231] 12, Paul says put on them, there's a close, it's all about what you wear, you never heard that in church before but you did today, it's all about what you wear as a Jesus follower, he's saying this is what you wear, put on them as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved,
[time=2246] compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, bearing with one another and
[time=2253] if one has a complaint against another, do you have any of those?
[time=2257] Don't answer that.
[time=2258] If one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other as the Lord has forgiven you so
[time=2265] also you must forgive, there it is again because he loved, we can love too.
[time=2269] We love because he first loved us so we should forgive the way he has forgiven us as the Lord has forgiven you so also you must forgive, verse 14.
[time=2277] And above all these, put on what?
[time=2281] Say that again, put on love which binds everything together in perfect harmony and let the peace
[time=2288] of Christ underline rule, whatever that word is in your translation, we're going to look at it in a minute.
[time=2293] Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts to which indeed you are called in one body and be thankful, be thankful, cultivate that heart, that mindset of just bringing gratitude
[time=2306] to whatever situation life throws your way.
[time=2309] Could you bind that with love, we're doing okay, verse 16, let the word of Christ well in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing songs and hymns and spiritual songs with thanksfulness in your hearts to God, verse 17, and whatever
[time=2325] you do, this is your part.
[time=2327] How do I do my part?
[time=2328] How do I put on the right things?
[time=2329] How do I be the better half?
[time=2331] Whatever you do in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God our Father through Him.
[time=2341] Let's unpack that.
[time=2342] Talk about how we need to believe.
[time=2344] Do you believe you need the sufficiency of God's grace now that we read that?
[time=2348] Can I get a name in?
[time=2349] I don't do real well in that stuff alone.
[time=2351] Let's go through.
[time=2352] There were seven things.
[time=2353] I want to do a few things with this.
[time=2354] I want to give you the seven items.
[time=2355] I want to talk through those briefly that we see here and they're straight from the verse and then I want to talk about why, if you ever ask this question, why can't I bust through that barrier of my sin?
[time=2365] Why can't I beat that sin?
[time=2368] Why can't I get past this season of my life?
[time=2370] I want to give you a few thoughts that may just meet you where you are.
[time=2373] And then last, I want to talk about how it applies to your relationships and then we're out of here.
[time=2377] Does that sound good?
[time=2378] Let's do those things.
[time=2379] Seven things here.
[time=2380] Compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, patience, forgiveness and love.
[time=2384] Seven things.
[time=2385] Compassion, the term there, we always say, "I love you, Mom, with all my heart."
[time=2391] Well, this term, literally, it's not going to be quite as, no.
[time=2397] It literally means to love with all of your intestines or spleen.
[time=2403] So now, today, when you see Mom say, "Mom, I love you with all my guts." They say, "In the Bible," just don't do that.
[time=2412] Say, "Go with the heart." It still means the same thing for us, right?
[time=2414] But it means to love with everything that you've got to offer that compassionate love to each other.
[time=2420] Kindness is to loan you everything I have, where you're weak and maybe I'm strong, I'll loan it to you.
[time=2425] I'll give it to you.
[time=2426] I'll put it before you, humility, seeing myself the way God sees me, seeing myself accurately.
[time=2434] You ever had a blown-up version of yourself in your mind before?
[time=2438] Maybe pride started into the equation?
[time=2440] I mean, you wouldn't, but I have, you know, the other half of your relationships probably done that if you have it, right?
[time=2446] But we do that, and humility is something that seems so far-fetched, and to those that Paul was writing, it would have felt the same way.
[time=2453] So we can identify with them.
[time=2455] And so really what we're saying here is that humility allows me to approach you as a peer.
[time=2460] Think about this.
[time=2461] I can approach you as a peer no matter what you do or don't do when it comes to your part.
[time=2468] I can do my part no matter what you do in your part because I see myself accurately.
[time=2473] You're a peer to me.
[time=2474] Think about it this way.
[time=2475] We are all broken people under the umbrella of God's love and grace, all of us.
[time=2481] It doesn't matter what your skin color is.
[time=2483] It doesn't matter what clothes you're wearing.
[time=2485] It doesn't matter what background you come from, doesn't matter what relationships have looked like to you.
[time=2489] We are all broken people, peers, under the umbrella of the grace of God.
[time=2495] We need His love.
[time=2497] That's the kind of atmosphere that the church should build.
[time=2501] That's the kind of culture that we should be propelling in the world around us to let people know that there is a place for them, not just in this building, but in the family of God.
[time=2511] What brokenness you bring.
[time=2513] We see a lot of divisive issues in this world today, and I want you to know the only thing that compares through the divisiveness of all of the different sins, all of the different political arenas, all the different difference in the world today is Jesus and Jesus alone.
[time=2527] His blood is His righteousness.
[time=2529] It's His grace.
[time=2530] That's why Jesus brought that to a world full of brokenness and He laid it before people and when He did that, it pierced through the differences, but that takes humility.
[time=2542] That takes saying, "I'm going to see you as God sees you not through the lens of what you've done to me." Gentleness.
[time=2549] I like this word, it can be even translated as meek, and I'll give you a phrase about meekness.
[time=2555] Meek is not weak.
[time=2556] A lot of times people think that meekness is weakness.
[time=2560] Meek is one of the strongest character traits that Jesus brought to the table.
[time=2564] He brought them all to the table, but Jesus brought meekness to the table.
[time=2568] He was gentle.
[time=2569] That means that my relationship with you is more important than you being impressed by me.
[time=2573] That means I'm going to put you first and I'm going to choose to love you in a lot of your
[time=2579] strengths and weaknesses, not mine.
[time=2580] A lot of times we want to leverage my strengths and I'm going to love you through the lens of that no matter how well it meets you where you are or not, because that way you'll be impressed with me and I can look like I've got it together and I'm confident I can put my church smile on and you can be impressed by me, but a lot of times that doesn't help the other half of your relationship does it.
[time=2597] A lot of times it may be through your weakness that God wants to use his strength to meet
[time=2604] people in their brokenness and their weakness.
[time=2607] That's meekness.
[time=2608] That's why meek is not weak.
[time=2610] That's why Jesus propelled that, lived that, and then patience, what was that one again?
[time=2614] The pea word, patience.
[time=2617] I am an impatient guy, do not like having to be patient.
[time=2621] Anybody else with me make me feel a little better about myself, okay, just checking.
[time=2625] It's deciding in relationships to move at your speed, not mine.
[time=2630] When you're ready to do your part, you do your part, but until then I'm going to do my part and then forgiveness is the sixth one and it's to forgive as Jesus forgave you.
[time=2641] Do I need to unpack that one?
[time=2643] Jesus offered ultimate forgiveness when you didn't deserve it, when I didn't deserve it.
[time=2647] That's what we're supposed to give out.
[time=2648] And then love is the umbrella that brings it all together.
[time=2652] There's those seven things.
[time=2653] Anybody feel overwhelmed yet?
[time=2655] I know I do sometimes.
[time=2656] That's why it's because of the part that Jesus already did that we can do our part.
[time=2660] Let's talk about why you can't break through the barrier of your sin sometimes.
[time=2666] There's not a blanket statement that's going to fix your sin for you.
[time=2668] I don't have that prescription.
[time=2670] I'm not about to write it or am I?
[time=2672] I think that there is something that just gets to the heart of all of our issues.
[time=2676] And I think a key reason we can't seem to win victories over sin is that we end up fighting
[time=2682] from self-driven effort instead of grace-driven effort.
[time=2687] I want to unpack that with you for a minute.
[time=2690] We say things like, "Just try harder.
[time=2693] Just try a little harder.
[time=2694] Back to John." Well, just stop.
[time=2699] Is it always that simple?
[time=2702] You tell me, is it?
[time=2705] No.
[time=2706] Just quit it.
[time=2707] Have you ever said that?
[time=2708] I've said that to the kids.
[time=2709] Not this weekend because it was a perfect weekend even with my wife gone.
[time=2713] Stop it.
[time=2714] Just quit it.
[time=2715] Just stop.
[time=2717] Sometimes it's not that simple, is it?
[time=2719] Sometimes we can't just try a little harder and get where we need to go.
[time=2725] Sometimes we need to move from self-driven effort.
[time=2727] You ever gotten there, by the way, where you just realize my self-driven effort is never going to be enough sometimes.
[time=2732] Some of you are there right now.
[time=2733] I think we all are, for honest, in one way or another.
[time=2735] But sometimes we need to shift from self-driven effort to grace-driven effort.
[time=2739] What is grace-driven effort?
[time=2740] Let's talk about, for a moment, the differences in those things.
[time=2744] Here's what I'll say about sin, your self-driven effort.
[time=2747] You are competing against your sin.
[time=2750] Is that fair?
[time=2751] If it's self-driven effort, I am fighting against my sin.
[time=2755] Me?
[time=2756] Sin.
[time=2757] You know the problem without equation?
[time=2760] Both things are sinful.
[time=2763] Sin is sin, and you are sinful.
[time=2765] And so no matter who wins, guess what wins?
[time=2769] Sin.
[time=2770] I just summed up a big portion of your life, didn't I?
[time=2775] Mine too, because we all have those battles.
[time=2778] But grace-driven effort is totally different than two sinful pieces of an equation, colliding and battling.
[time=2784] Grace-driven effort comes from, I think, let's look at Colossians 3.15 again.
[time=2787] It says, "Let the peace of Christ rule." Some might say rule, that word, that Greek word, came from the Olympic Games in that era
[time=2796] and culture.
[time=2797] They would battle and compete, and it would get ugly, and it would get deadly, and people would cheat to win, and then people would fight, and then people would kill each other.
[time=2807] And so they implemented umpires, is what we would call them, but they're just decision-makers, referees, whatever you want to call them, in those games.
[time=2814] And the final word went to them.
[time=2816] They made the decision.
[time=2817] They ruled, that's the word, they ruled those games.
[time=2822] They were to the decision-maker.
[time=2824] They decided what goes, and most of the time they would even be backed up by guards to enforce it and make it happen.
[time=2829] So let the peace of Christ be your decision-maker.
[time=2833] Let it govern the fight.
[time=2835] Let it get in the middle.
[time=2837] Let it drive where you go.
[time=2838] Let it rule in your life, and that starts to take us to this mindset of what does grace-driven effort start to look like, it changes from sin and sin, battling to God being in the middle and ruling sin.
[time=2850] So grace-driven effort.
[time=2851] A lot of times we'll try to train.
[time=2853] Think about this.
[time=2854] A lot of times we'll try to train the monster of our sin.
[time=2859] You've got one, a monster, don't you?
[time=2862] We all do.
[time=2864] A lot of times we look up and say, "There he is, he's looking back at me from the mirror." The monster is staring me down.
[time=2870] A lot of times we try to train the monster of our sin.
[time=2874] That's what we can do.
[time=2876] What grace-driven effort, what Jesus doing his part looks like for you is that you move from training the monster of your sin to a violent triumph over the monster of your sin.
[time=2886] You move from training it to triumphing over it.
[time=2888] Does that mean it's just going to go away the next day?
[time=2890] No.
[time=2891] But it means the victory has already been won over it, and here's where the difference comes in.
[time=2895] Write this down if you're taking notes.
[time=2896] It's in your notes.
[time=2897] That's what grace-driven effort does not fight for victory.
[time=2900] Grace-driven effort fights from victory.
[time=2904] Grace that you fought for victory, self-driven effort, it fights for the victory, and you're trying to win, but sin keeps winning.
[time=2911] Grace-driven effort fights from a victory that's already been won.
[time=2915] What did we say earlier?
[time=2916] I can do my part because Jesus already did his.
[time=2920] He already won.
[time=2921] We're fighting through a grace-driven effort that's already won the victory over that sin.
[time=2927] How would it change our approach if we got to that place where we fought from that victory instead of trying to fight for a victory that's already been won?
[time=2935] It would change things about where we're going.
[time=2937] I love the verse Romans 8-37.
[time=2940] Romans 8, one of my favorite chapters in the Bible.
[time=2942] I'm not going to preach it.
[time=2943] I promise because you've got Mother's Day lunches to get to you.
[time=2945] But Romans 8-37 says that we are more than conquerors through Christ, the same Christ
[time=2953] who loves us.
[time=2954] We're more than conquerors.
[time=2957] When you are the conqueror, think about this comparison, self-driven effort, grace-driven effort.
[time=2962] When you are a conqueror, you win because of what you can do.
[time=2965] You've won some victories and battles in your life that you won, good for you.
[time=2970] But when you're a conqueror, you win because of what you can do.
[time=2973] When you're more than a conqueror, you win because of what has already been done.
[time=2978] I want to be the kind of Christian who wears and puts on these things as a Jesus follower
[time=2985] because I'm fighting from the victory that's already been won.
[time=2987] I'm fighting from what has already been accomplished, not what I'm trying to beat and trying to
[time=2993] accomplish.
[time=2994] Does that mean you're going to get all your wishes and get the promotion that you want every time?
[time=2998] Nope.
[time=2999] What was the best way to get a breakthrough again?
[time=3002] Brokenness.
[time=3003] Sometimes you're going to need to be broken and those can be the best ways to break through the barriers.
[time=3007] Brokenness can get you to that kind of a place.
[time=3009] Let's look at Colossians the last part here.
[time=3011] Let's apply it to our relationships and I'll leave you with this challenge today.
[time=3015] Let's look at verse 23.
[time=3017] Colossians chapter 3 verse 23, it echoes what we already read in verse 17.
[time=3023] He says again in verse 23, "Whatever you do, work heartily as for the Lord."
[time=3029] Underline that.
[time=3030] "As for the Lord, not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance
[time=3037] as your reward.
[time=3038] You are serving the Lord Christ." Stop there.
[time=3042] "You are serving the Lord Christ." Let's go through a progression here about doing my part.
[time=3049] Keys to doing my part is knowing Jesus already did his, we said, but Jesus said in Matthew 7, 12, he said, "Do unto others the golden rule," right?
[time=3057] If you know it, say it with me.
[time=3058] "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." Jesus said that.
[time=3063] That is in the Bible.
[time=3064] Just so you know.
[time=3065] People think maybe it's not, it is, Jesus said that, but then it gets built upon.
[time=3068] Colossians 3, 13 is saying, "Forgive as God's forgiven you.
[time=3073] Do unto others.
[time=3074] Forgive as Jesus forgave you." And then in this verse 23, it says, "Do unto others as though you are doing unto Jesus."
[time=3081] So we get from do unto others as you would have them do to you, to now do unto others
[time=3087] as though you're doing unto Jesus.
[time=3091] That would help you be the better half.
[time=3092] Can I give you a name in?
[time=3095] What's part, my part, their part in your relationships?
[time=3097] I'm going to give you a statement that I believe is going to help you this week and you can circle it, underline it, contemplate it, dig into it.
[time=3105] I can't get so consumed with their part.
[time=3109] Have you ever been there?
[time=3110] Gosh, I wish they'd just listen.
[time=3113] A little knucklehead, they'd just do what I said.
[time=3119] I can't get so consumed with their part that I neglect my part or doubt God's part.
[time=3125] I can't, in my relationships, get so consumed with them doing their part that I neglect
[time=3131] to just do mine, do whatever I do, as unto the Lord, or that I doubt God's part.
[time=3137] I've been in seasons of my life where I was so consumed by the other person in the equation
[time=3143] doing their part that I just neglected to even do mine.
[time=3147] And then it calls me to doubt is God even working in this relationship?
[time=3152] But God looks at you.
[time=3153] Hear me.
[time=3154] Jesus says, just do your part, holding you accountable to your part.
[time=3158] Do that.
[time=3159] I'll do my part.
[time=3161] God's always faithful even when we're faithless.
[time=3163] And that is true regardless of whether or not they do their part.
[time=3168] Last thing I want to tell you today is that it's in your nose.
[time=3170] I can be the better half because Jesus was already better than the better half on my behalf.
[time=3177] Say that five times fast.
[time=3180] But I believe it, I can be the better half because Jesus was already better than that better half on my behalf.
[time=3186] I can do my part because Jesus already did his.
[time=3194] We bow your heads with me.
[time=3195] Just process that for a minute.
[time=3197] Reflect on that.
[time=3198] Lay that at the foot of the cross.
[time=3200] If you know Jesus today, then let him know that you're thankful that he was the better half, that he's done his part, ask him to equip you in doing your part, to be the better
[time=3211] half.
[time=3212] And with nobody moving around, nobody thinking about anything else for just a minute, I just want to talk to those of you who've come today, maybe this is, this church thing is new to you and you didn't really expect God to be stirring like he is.
[time=3226] But in your heart right now, you feel him working, you feel him tugging.
[time=3232] Something's different.
[time=3233] You feel like he's asking you to do something.
[time=3235] Maybe you would answer this question with a no, if I were to ask you and say, if you're to die today, God forbid, but if you were to die today, if this was your time, would you know for certain that you would spend eternity in heaven with God because you have
[time=3250] a personal relationship with Jesus?
[time=3253] I believe somebody's here today and you would say to me right now, you would say, I'd like to know that, but I just don't.
[time=3261] I'm not sure, the gospel is here for you today.
[time=3267] What is the gospel?
[time=3268] The gospel means good news, it's good news because it already happened.
[time=3272] News is already done.
[time=3273] Just like that victory is already won, this good news is already done, it's already accomplished.
[time=3278] Jesus already won the battle over your sin.
[time=3282] Salvation, the gospel message is all about me saying to God, God, I know I'm separated
[time=3288] from you because I'm so sinful, so I need you to save me.
[time=3292] I believe Jesus died for me, I believe that he's alive today.
[time=3297] I asked for the victory that he's already won to be my victory.
[time=3301] Please save me.
[time=3302] You know what, some of you are saying, I can't say it like you just did, good, God doesn't want you to because a prayer never saved anybody.
[time=3309] I'm not even going to lead you in a prayer because your heart is screaming and in your words to God, would you just lay your life down before him saying, Jesus, I do need you and ask him to save you in your words from your heart to his.
[time=3320] Salvation is a heart issue.
[time=3322] Salvation begins where you end, where you say, I'm going to stop trying to save me.
[time=3326] I need you to do it, Jesus.
[time=3327] If that's you today, would you just take a moment, cry out to him between your heart and his?
[time=3333] Would you do that right now?
[time=3339] Doing my part, maybe your part right now looks a little bit different to you than it did before you listen today's message from the Apostle Paul and Colossians 3 and the fact that Jesus already did his part means you can do your part.
[time=3353] But I want to talk to you if you're one of those people that I was just addressing, that Jesus doing his part means something new to you today.
[time=3360] Maybe God has drawn you to that part that Jesus already played, the fact that he did die on the cross for your sins, for my sins, the fact that he did rise from the dead.
[time=3371] He came out of that grave and when he came out of that grave, he came out with a victory over all of your sin, over death, over all of your problems, over all of the ways that
[time=3381] you and I don't do our part well.
[time=3383] And maybe today it's time for you to enter into that relationship.
[time=3387] I challenge you, don't hold back.
[time=3388] It really is that simple.
[time=3390] It's as simple as the gospel truly is for us.
[time=3393] Jesus made it that simple, it's really as simple as laying my life down at the foot of the cross and saying, Jesus, I do need you to save me.
[time=3401] I can't save myself.
[time=3403] Thank you for doing your part.
[time=3405] I now do my part in just giving you me.
[time=3408] That's salvation.
[time=3409] If you believe in your heart that Jesus is alive, that he died for you and lay your life down
[time=3415] before him, you will be saved.
[time=3417] I challenge you to take that step if you haven't already.
[time=3419] Step away, push pause, whatever you've got to do, there's nothing more important in your life than that very step.
[time=3425] And if you've taken that step, we want to know about it.
[time=3427] We want to celebrate with you, it's the biggest step that you could ever take in your life because it transcends this life and goes into the next.
[time=3435] It's an eternity defining step that you've taken today.
[time=3438] And so we've got some resources.
[time=3440] We would just like to get into your hands.
[time=3442] Book called Beginning Steps, a growth guide for new believers.
[time=3445] We would love to either mail one of these to you.
[time=3447] You can come by the church here and we would love to put one in your hands in person.
[time=3452] But this book will just help you know what's next, help you know how you can move forward in your faith because this is not just a fire insurance, this is not just something that you do that is an end in your life, this is the beginning of a brand new life that Jesus is beginning inside of you right now.
[time=3467] We want to walk alongside of you in that new life, in that new journey and we're excited to build community with you.
[time=3473] A lot of times we say things like that in the church, but what is that community?
[time=3477] What does it look like?
[time=3478] What does it mean?
[time=3479] It means that we want to put you around other people who are struggling just like you.
[time=3483] We're people who need to grow just like you, just like me and we've got a lot of people here that would love to hear from you, to walk with you, to befriend you and to do life alongside of you.
[time=3494] And so we would love to drive you to our website, to our life groups, to all of the different ways that we can connect with you.
[time=3500] So let us know what God's doing in your life.
[time=3502] There's going to be some information on your screen that will have an email address, will have a phone number that you can use to reach out to us, tell us your story and tell us how we can best serve you, pray for you and help you in your spiritual journey.
[time=3514] That's why we're here, after all, and invite you to take forward steps in your faith.
[time=3520] Don't hold back, don't listen to the enemy when he says it wasn't real today, it didn't matter today, it couldn't be true for you because of all these things in your past.
[time=3529] Jesus already did his part, it's done, it's finished.
[time=3532] You get to fight from that victory in your relationships and more importantly in your relationship with him today.
[time=3538] Thank you so much for listening, for watching, for allowing God to work, and I want to invite you back next week.
[time=3544] I'm going to be talking about this term "vision" and how vision, not just for God's church,
[time=3550] but for our own individual lives, how the vision that God has for the church he built and is building impacts my life and your life and it will not only touch your relationships,
[time=3561] it will touch every area of your life.
[time=3562] So come back next week as we dig into that together, God bless.
[time=3568] God bless you.
