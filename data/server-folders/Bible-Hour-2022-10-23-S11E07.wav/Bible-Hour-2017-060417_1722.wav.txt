[time=667] Now my heart has found a home.
[time=673] Now your grace is always with me and I'll never be alone.
[time=697] [MUSIC - 50 seconds]
[time=761] God has a vision for you. Did you know it?
[time=764] I'm excited that God has a vision for his church.
[time=767] When Jesus said he was going to build it he said I will build my church and even the gates of hell can't even prevail against it.
[time=774] I love being a part of a winning team and I've read the end of the book.
[time=778] We win because he wins and I'm so glad that you're here to just be a part of how God is building his church.
[time=784] But today I want us to zoom in a little bit deeper.
[time=787] Last week I talked about God's vision for this place and we spent a good bit of time looking at a lot of different elements of where we're going as a church.
[time=794] If you missed that you can go to our website, blackhawkministries.org/messages.
[time=799] We'll end up on all those pieces. But today I want to zoom in a little bit further in talking about vision focus.
[time=806] Is there a vision focus that I should have that we should have as a church?
[time=811] I want to ask you to join me in looking at Luke 15.
[time=814] Luke chapter 15, great, great story in scripture that gives us a great glimpse at really what Jesus and his focus was all about.
[time=823] I think it may have something to do with you and me.
[time=826] So if you're a guest with us, thanks for being here. You're amongst friends.
[time=829] You're a part of that vision.
[time=831] Us coming together and being the church is what it is all about and it is an exciting day to be a part of all God's doing here at blackhawk ministries.
[time=839] And so I celebrate what he's up to and today I want us to zoom in.
[time=843] I want to welcome our extended family as well.
[time=845] Beyond this room we have a big family of people that log in online whether through television, live streaming, Facebook, live, all the different venues we have.
[time=853] If you're watching us at home or wherever you may be in your pajamas, whatever that looks like for you, thanks for joining us.
[time=858] Maybe you're traveling, but I'm glad that God's given us such a wonderful family here at this church.
[time=863] Luke chapter 15, let's look there together.
[time=865] Luke chapter 15, I want to read the first two verses to you today as we talk about how we can have a focus within my vision.
[time=873] A vision for my focus where we zoom in as a church and it'll impact us all as believers, as followers of Jesus.
[time=880] Even those of you who may be here and say I'm not yet that.
[time=884] I'm still trying to figure this whole fake thing out today.
[time=887] I think this is a great passage to help you know how Jesus looks at you, how Jesus looks at this church, and how we can all plug in and be a part of it.
[time=895] Who's ready for the word?
[time=897] Luke 15, beginning there in verse 1, says now the tax collectors and sinners.
[time=902] Paul's there.
[time=903] Have you ever noticed that it doesn't just say sinners?
[time=905] It says the tax collectors and sinners. Now the tax collectors were so bad.
[time=910] They were such sinners that they had a category of their own.
[time=914] Have you ever been in that category perhaps?
[time=917] Well I'm not just a sinner, I'm Kevin.
[time=919] I'm not just a sinner, I'm this or that.
[time=921] Well they did.
[time=922] They were the thugs of the day.
[time=924] They stole people's money and they were horrible, horrible people so they had literally a category of their own.
[time=929] Now back to the verse.
[time=930] Now the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to him.
[time=936] Him is Jesus, verse 2.
[time=938] And the Pharisees and scribes grumbled.
[time=940] Give me your best grumble.
[time=943] The Pharisees and the scribes grumbled saying this man receives or welcomes or embraces.
[time=950] This man receives sinners and eats with them.
[time=954] Then the beginning of verse 3 is Jesus' response to that says so he told them this parable.
[time=960] And that is what I want us to look at today.
[time=962] This parable, this stories that Jesus tells in response to this fact that sinners and tax collectors, even people who were worse than sinners like the tax collectors, were drawn to Jesus and he was always found with them.
[time=973] I've always thought that it's interesting that Jesus always seemed drawn to sinners.
[time=978] Yes.
[time=979] But it's way more interesting to me that not only was Jesus drawn to sinners, sinners were always drawn to Jesus.
[time=986] People who were not like Jesus liked Jesus.
[time=991] It's always been interesting.
[time=992] It's always been intriguing to me.
[time=994] Jesus was always known as a religious leader, yet you don't find him particularly drawn to being around the religious people.
[time=1002] Why?
[time=1003] It baffles us sometimes when we look at what church people maybe have looked like in our stereotypical view point of what church should look like.
[time=1012] And then we contrast that with Jesus.
[time=1014] And Jesus responds to those questions that swirl around in our head in Luke 15 by telling this parable.
[time=1020] It's the longest parable that Jesus told.
[time=1022] We're going to dig in.
[time=1023] It's one parable.
[time=1024] It looks like three, but it's actually one.
[time=1026] You'll see one in a few minutes and I think it'll help us even get a different understanding of maybe a parable, a story that we've heard many, many times before.
[time=1034] And so Jesus, I was always around those people and I'm a true believer in this.
[time=1039] The bottom line is this.
[time=1040] I'm going to give it to you.
[time=1041] This is what this story tells us today.
[time=1043] It's what we're going to build upon.
[time=1044] I truly believe that what is true of Jesus personally should be true of us collectively.
[time=1053] What's true of Jesus personally should be true of us collectively.
[time=1058] We could never fully emulate Jesus on our own.
[time=1061] Can I get a name in?
[time=1063] I could never quite get to the Jesus level.
[time=1066] You know, maybe at times I'll bump on up here and then I'll fall right back down and I'll bump on back here and I can't get to the level of Jesus.
[time=1073] But the reason Jesus built his church, hear me.
[time=1075] This is the vision part.
[time=1076] Vision for our focus as a church that's going to zoom in to vision for you as a follower of Jesus today.
[time=1082] That's why we need the church.
[time=1083] We can't emulate Jesus personally, individually.
[time=1087] But what is true of Jesus personally, the example that he set for us is something that we should emulate.
[time=1092] Something that we should build towards collectively.
[time=1095] We should look like Jesus looked as a body.
[time=1098] That's why the church is described throughout scripture as the body of Christ.
[time=1102] You're just one part of it.
[time=1104] You're not Jesus.
[time=1106] I'm not Jesus.
[time=1108] I'm a part of the body of Christ.
[time=1110] And when we come together, I may be just a fingernail at times.
[time=1114] Sometimes I feel like the toenail fungus of the church.
[time=1117] You ever met that person?
[time=1119] I'm a part of the body.
[time=1121] But how beautiful is it when the body of Christ comes together?
[time=1125] And we collectively look like Jesus looked personally.
[time=1129] I think that's the vision that we have got to pursue.
[time=1132] And it starts with an individual pursuit of us just being a good part of that team.
[time=1137] Church is a team sport, I often say.
[time=1140] Years ago I heard a statement that rocked my world.
[time=1143] And I'll share a little bit more of that story later in the message.
[time=1145] But the statement was simply this, that historically the church has divorced the message of Jesus
[time=1153] from the methods of Jesus.
[time=1156] Now what does that mean, you would say?
[time=1158] The Kevin version of that is we often love to talk about what Jesus said without actually doing what Jesus did.
[time=1165] It's easy to talk about what Jesus said.
[time=1168] Every week I talk about what Jesus said, but it's a lot harder when we leave this place and we go out there.
[time=1173] And that person meets us in the restaurant or in Walmart or in the line or at your workplace or maybe at your house.
[time=1180] Life gets hard, it's a lot harder to actually do what Jesus did than just to talk about what Jesus said.
[time=1187] In order for us to have a focused vision in our life, we've actually got to go from just talking about the things Jesus said
[time=1193] to living them out, to walking the walk and not just talking the talk and you say we all know this, we're supposed to do that.
[time=1200] It's easy sermon to preach to say well don't just talk about it, go do it, but how?
[time=1204] What does that look like?
[time=1205] And I think Jesus gives us a great glimpse, a great foundation as to how we can build that focus for our vision
[time=1212] that will truly be a foundation for how we live and walk the walk that God has called us to walk.
[time=1218] In this passage, Luke 15, I'm not going to read the whole chapter to you, I trust that you will do that this week, an amazing passage
[time=1225] that Jesus responds to this, why are you always around sinners?
[time=1229] Why are you around the worst of the worst?
[time=1231] Why do they always get drawn to you and you're always drawn to them?
[time=1233] What's your deal?
[time=1234] You're supposed to be a religious leader, you should look distinguished.
[time=1238] You should look separate, yet you're in their houses, yet they always come to you.
[time=1242] What is your problem, Jesus?
[time=1244] That's what Jesus was up against in this season of his life.
[time=1247] And his ministry.
[time=1248] And I think there's so much to learn.
[time=1250] So in response, he tells a parable.
[time=1252] Look at verse three, he says it, he told this parable, singular.
[time=1255] We'll come back to why it's singular, but within that parable, there are three stories.
[time=1259] I want to walk you through some of them.
[time=1260] There in the first several verses, three through seven there, you see the first story.
[time=1264] It's about a shepherd.
[time=1266] Now the shepherd had a hundred sheep, and he says, and this would have been their language in that day.
[time=1270] I know to us it seems foreign, but to them that's their language.
[time=1273] They know all about shepherds.
[time=1274] Which of you who have a hundred sheep and one of them got lost?
[time=1278] Would you not go after, leave that ninety-nine to go after the one?
[time=1281] Now that would be fairly common in a shepherd today, but even then, but especially now.
[time=1286] We go, ah, if I have a hundred, one hundred, one dollar bills, and I lose one, I'm just holding on to those ninety-nine.
[time=1294] That one can just float away.
[time=1296] I'm holding on to that ninety-nine.
[time=1297] Besides, the sheep are stupid.
[time=1299] If he wandered off, he deserves to get lost, right?
[time=1302] That's how we feel.
[time=1303] But this shepherd goes after the one leaving the ninety-nine behind.
[time=1309] Sillogical.
[time=1310] It's an illogical picture of where Jesus is taking the people that were listening and where he wants to take you and me today.
[time=1316] And so then in verse seven it says, "Does heaven not rejoice that much more?"
[time=1322] When one lost person comes to Jesus, then when a bunch of people who already have repentance are already there.
[time=1329] And we'll look at those words and we'll dig into that a little bit more.
[time=1331] Then he tells the second story.
[time=1333] He narrows it down a little bit, and he's narrowing down to you, by the way.
[time=1336] I think you'll see that in a few minutes.
[time=1338] It's going to narrow right down to where you and I sit.
[time=1340] The second story there starting in verse eight is about the lost coin.
[time=1344] So then we go from this man, the shepherd, now to a lady who in her house had ten coins.
[time=1349] Ten silver coins, scholars debate on whether this is the dowry and all these pieces.
[time=1353] But the point of this is she loses one of her ten coins.
[time=1356] She has ten, she loses one silver coin, and she cares the house apart.
[time=1359] Cushions are flying everywhere.
[time=1361] And you've ever been there, right?
[time=1363] Usually your phone or your keys.
[time=1365] You tore the house apart, so she tears the house apart for the sake of that one coin.
[time=1369] And then she calls her friends and neighbors and says, "Celebrate with me the coin that I lost.
[time=1373] I found it.
[time=1374] It's now back in my possession." Now to the third part of the story.
[time=1380] We narrow it down a little bit further now to the prodigal son story.
[time=1383] Maybe you've heard this story before.
[time=1385] The prodigal son is this guy who really looks at his dad and says, "Are you ever going to die?"
[time=1393] I sure would like my inheritance.
[time=1395] And I tried to just wait it out, but it looks like you're going to hang in there for a while.
[time=1399] So I want my inheritance now.
[time=1402] Terrible, isn't it?
[time=1403] Awful guy.
[time=1404] Terrible guy.
[time=1406] But you know I see myself and him and the other people in this story quite a bit.
[time=1410] So he says, "I'd like to get my inheritance now." So he takes his inheritance, goes off to a far away country and squanders it all.
[time=1417] We learn later in the passage that it even involved prostitutes and the worst of the worst things that he could have done with that money he did with that money.
[time=1424] But the problem with that approach to life is you do what with that money?
[time=1429] You run out.
[time=1430] Some of you say, "Hey, I do identify with him.
[time=1433] I'm broke too." And so he was so broke, so destitute that he hired himself out, scripture says, to work at a pig farmer's place
[time=1441] feeding the pigs, and he got so hungry that he desired to eat the pig's food.
[time=1447] You ever been at that kind of point in your life where you're at that low point and you feel like all I have is pig's food in front of me.
[time=1454] That's all I can hold in my fingertips.
[time=1456] Well, that's where he was.
[time=1457] And then he thought, "You know, my dad's servants, his employees, they eat better than this.
[time=1462] They at least have some bread to eat.
[time=1464] They don't go hungry.
[time=1465] I'm not worthy to be my dad's son anymore for sure, but maybe he'll hire me.
[time=1469] Maybe he'll feed me and I could just go back and talk to him and say, "Dad, I'm not worthy to be your son, but will you hire me?" That's where we'll stop for now, and I'll finish the rest of that story in a minute.
[time=1479] But those are the stories that Jesus tells, and how many of you know the end of that story?
[time=1483] Does the dad say, "Yeah, you can just be hired.
[time=1485] I'll give you pigs' food to eat." Is that what he does?
[time=1489] He runs to him.
[time=1490] He embraces him.
[time=1491] He kisses him.
[time=1492] He kills the fatted calf.
[time=1493] He puts a robe around him.
[time=1495] He gives him his ring.
[time=1496] He celebrates and he throws a party.
[time=1499] They dance and they sing because this knucklehead of a son decided he wanted to come home.
[time=1505] Now, if you're like me, I would probably look at that knucklehead of a son and say, "You know what?
[time=1510] We're going to have a party, but you will sit.
[time=1513] You will watch.
[time=1514] We will dance." But instead, he says, "Dance with me, son.
[time=1519] I want to celebrate." And he throws a huge party.
[time=1522] Why?
[time=1523] It doesn't make sense.
[time=1524] It doesn't make sense to leave 99 sheep to go after the one.
[time=1526] It doesn't make sense to find that one coin and to throw a big party with the neighborhood because you find a silver coin.
[time=1532] It doesn't make sense to celebrate a son who was stupid, who was lost, who made the dumbest decisions anybody could ever make and throw a party when he decides to come to his senses.
[time=1542] It's illogical.
[time=1544] And I would submit to you that grace is pretty illogical to the grace of God that saved your
[time=1550] soul and mind.
[time=1552] If we submit our lives to Jesus, it's just as illogical.
[time=1554] And I think that's the journey that Jesus wants to take us on.
[time=1557] So let's talk about how can we keep our vision focused?
[time=1561] How can we keep our vision focused?
[time=1562] I want to give you two simple things and we'll finish this story and maybe tie some pieces of that story together that maybe you've never thought about, maybe you have, but maybe we need to revisit today.
[time=1572] How can we keep our vision focused?
[time=1573] Number one, believe God's embrace of grace.
[time=1577] I love that phrase because that's what this story is all about, it's an embrace of grace.
[time=1582] Believe God's grace, embrace of grace is your worth.
[time=1588] Let me ask you a question.
[time=1589] What are you worth?
[time=1594] Maybe a better question.
[time=1596] Where do you find your worth?
[time=1599] If you answered that honestly, don't say it out loud because you'd never give the honest answer out loud, am I right?
[time=1605] You'd like to say, well, what you just said, God's embrace of grace, I'll go with that.
[time=1610] It sounds good, but it's a lot harder to employ in our life.
[time=1613] A lot of times we find worth in everything but the places that we should be finding it.
[time=1618] We live in a culture where we're taught, you've got to earn your worth.
[time=1622] You want to eat?
[time=1623] You've got to work for it.
[time=1624] Is that good?
[time=1625] Is that true?
[time=1626] Sure it is.
[time=1627] But grace is pretty illogical, spiritually speaking.
[time=1630] We live in this practical world and we think that everything in the practical world applies exactly the same, spiritually speaking.
[time=1636] But God is everything.
[time=1637] I've always believed and said that God is everything impossible and everything illogical.
[time=1643] God is not bound by the rationale that we often live by and I sure am glad.
[time=1651] Jesus wants you to understand where your worth truly comes from today.
[time=1654] Some of you maybe have been misunderstanding, misinterpreting where that worth truly gets drawn from in your life today.
[time=1661] And so let's look at Luke 15, go to verse 21.
[time=1665] Because the prodigal son, as we know him, the younger brother in this story, we're going to be introduced to an older brother in this story in just a few minutes.
[time=1672] But let's focus on the younger brother.
[time=1673] Verse 21, well, let's go back to verse 20, it says, "And he rose and came to his father, but while he was still a long way off, his father saw him, underlined that, his father saw him, just like he sees you, when you're far off, when you're at a distance, his father saw him and felt compassion and ran and embraced him and kissed him." This is after he had already said, "Well, I'm not worthy to be this guy's son, but I'm going to go try to be one of his service." Verse 21, "And he said to him, 'My dad, get off of me, I'm not worthy for you to hug me, I'm not your son, he resisted the embrace of grace that his father wanted to throw his way." And in verse 21, "And he said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you, I'm no longer worthy.'" Somebody say, "Worthy, this is where his worth came from.
[time=1716] I'm no longer worthy to be called your son." But the father said to his service, "Bring quickly the best robe and put it on him.
[time=1724] Put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and bring the fat and calf and kill it unless eat and celebrate for my son was dead and is alive again." He was lost and is found and they began to celebrate.
[time=1738] They threw a party.
[time=1741] Love that story.
[time=1742] Love that picture.
[time=1743] Where's your worth come from?
[time=1745] A lot of you think you're a son of God by worth today, but Jesus looks at you and says, "You're not a son of God, a part of the family of God by worth.
[time=1754] You're a part of the family of God by birth." Mason, who was just baptized, became a part of the family of God because he was born again, scripture says.
[time=1764] How were we born twice?
[time=1765] Well, it's a physical birth that we have when we're babies, but we're born again spiritually when we enter from death unto life because we see this gap between us and God closed
[time=1775] and bridged because Jesus paid that price for us to get from where we are to where he is.
[time=1782] We become a son and a daughter of the king by birth, not by worth.
[time=1788] You're not worth enough to be a part of the family of God and of yourself.
[time=1793] You're not worth enough to get there on your own because we're separated from God because of that sin, but Jesus bridged that gap and we become a son and a daughter by birth.
[time=1802] Just like this father looked at that son and said, "You know what?
[time=1805] You were born into my family.
[time=1807] You're always going to be my family and I'm going to give you an embrace of grace even though you don't deserve it.
[time=1812] God does that for you and for me." And says, "You're a son and a daughter of the king because of your birth and because
[time=1821] of the worth that I brought to the table." Jesus removes a little pressure, doesn't he?
[time=1827] Some of you are already saying, "Well, that means I can just go live like the prodigal son and it doesn't even matter.
[time=1833] Do you think this prodigal son's life was ever a little bit different after he saw this embrace of grace?
[time=1838] Do you think it changed his outlook on life?
[time=1840] Do you think he made future mistakes?
[time=1841] Oh, you better believe it, but you better know it changed everything about his perspective around the world around him.
[time=1847] And I believe this when it comes to what we believe, what I believe will always show up in who I become.
[time=1854] What I believe, what you believe about you, what you believe about Jesus is always going to show up in who you're becoming.
[time=1861] We often squirm when it comes to this embrace called grace because we think we can impress God truthfully.
[time=1866] It's like he said, "No, Dad, don't kiss me, kiss my neck and hug me.
[time=1870] I'm a terrible son.
[time=1872] Go away.
[time=1873] Get away from me.
[time=1874] I'm not worthy to be called your son.
[time=1876] I've sinned against heaven and against you." Yet the father says, "I don't care.
[time=1880] Go kill the fatted calf.
[time=1881] Let's throw a party.
[time=1882] Put a robe around him." And he loved him in spite of him.
[time=1886] What I believe about me is going to show up in who I become and it's time for some of you to stop squirming away from the embrace of grace because you don't think you're worthy of it because that is the starting point.
[time=1897] You're not worthy, but he has already been worthy on your behalf and he still wants to give you the same embrace of grace that we see in this story.
[time=1906] It's time for somebody in this building to stop squirming, to stop running away from a father who's running towards you because he saw you off in the distance.
[time=1917] That means you're going to have to part ways with some of how you've seen yourself, some of the things from your past that have held you back and made you feel like you're not worthy to be a son of God, a daughter of God.
[time=1928] He wants to help you build some separation from those things and close the gap between where you are and where he is in this place today.
[time=1935] And that's why, you know, there's only one thing that impresses God, really to say that I don't need the embrace of grace is to say I can impress God, I can bring worth to the table.
[time=1944] You know what impresses God?
[time=1945] There's only one thing, Jesus.
[time=1947] It's impossible to impress God without Jesus, it's in your nose.
[time=1951] You cannot impress God without Jesus and that's why in scripture it says to us that it's
[time=1957] impossible to please God without faith because if we don't have faith in Jesus, we don't please God because we don't please God without Jesus.
[time=1965] And when we embrace this man Jesus who paid the price for our sins, we receive his embrace
[time=1973] of grace.
[time=1974] God doesn't look at you and see your sin anymore, just like this Father, he sees you off in the distance and sees the blood and the perfection of Jesus and Jesus alone.
[time=1986] Some of you, it's time to receive the embrace of grace.
[time=1989] You've been putting it off, but today is that day for you.
[time=1992] You're going to have an opportunity, even this serves, you can do it right now.
[time=1994] You don't need me to leave you, cry out to him, step out of the building.
[time=1998] There's nothing more important than receiving this embrace of grace, believing that it's the embrace of grace that is my worth.
[time=2007] Number two, another thing we learn from the story is to broadcast, broadcast, the word broadcast means to cast or scatter abroad over an area as seed and sowing, to broadcast
[time=2018] God's embrace of grace to the world.
[time=2021] Here's where our vision comes into play for us here.
[time=2024] Luke 19, 10 says, "For the Son of Man came to seek and save the," God say that a lot
[time=2031] louder.
[time=2032] I'm going to preach a lot longer, "Seek and save thee, lost to seek and save that which
[time=2038] is lost in this world." And so I believe that discovering my worth compels me to deliver the source of my worth
[time=2046] to the world that I live in.
[time=2049] That's the vision that Jesus has for his church.
[time=2051] Look at verse three with me.
[time=2054] This is good.
[time=2055] This excites me.
[time=2057] Verse three says, "So he told them, a parable, singular." And what Jesus is really doing now is telling us three stories that narrows his focus of
[time=2068] vision that he wants you and I to see.
[time=2071] Now I want us to look at that vision and at that focus.
[time=2074] Consider a couple of things, and I'm going to look at a couple of the verses.
[time=2077] With the three stories, consider first of all the proportions, write that down if you're taking notes, proportions.
[time=2081] The first story, there's a proportion of 100 to 1.
[time=2084] Out of 100 sheep, 1 goes missing and he leaves the 99 and goes after the 1.
[time=2088] The second story, the portion, narrows from 100 to 1 to 10 to 1.
[time=2092] There are 10 coins, 1 gets lost and she tears the house apart to find the 1 coin.
[time=2097] It narrows from 100 to 1 to 10 to 1.
[time=2099] The third story, it narrows from 100 to 1 to 10 to 1 down to 1 to 2, 2 to 1.
[time=2104] There are 2 signs, 1 gets lost and becomes found.
[time=2108] Consider those proportions, but also consider the parties.
[time=2112] Consider the celebrations.
[time=2113] Look at the verses with me, start with verse 7.
[time=2115] The first party is at the end of the sheep story.
[time=2119] Verse 7, Jesus ends it by saying, "Just so I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous persons who need no repentance."
[time=2129] The first party is in heaven, pretty big picture party.
[time=2132] Second story, narrows to just the angels.
[time=2135] Look at that with me in verse number 10.
[time=2137] Verse 10, Jesus says, "Just so about the coins I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents." Look at verse 32, we narrow down from heaven to the angels to just a father.
[time=2153] It was fitting, he says, after his son, we're going to look at that story now, but his older brother is angry about the embrace of grace that his younger brother received.
[time=2163] And he says, "It was fitting to celebrate and be glad because your brother was dead and is alive.
[time=2168] He was lost." And now he's found.
[time=2172] Consider the narrowing of that story.
[time=2174] It funnels down to just one.
[time=2176] Let's look at how that story did end, so maybe you can identify with this older brother, maybe even more than the prodigal son.
[time=2182] Verse 25, look there with me, says, "Now his older son was in the field and he came and drew near to the house and he heard music and dancing and he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant." And verse 27, "He said to him, 'Your brother has come, your father has killed the fat and calf because he has received him back safe and sound.' But he was angry, give me your best grumble again.
[time=2207] He was angry, I've been angry many times, jealous many times in my life.
[time=2213] Maybe you have too and I can identify with this guy because it makes no sense.
[time=2216] He was angry and refused to go in.
[time=2219] This his father came out into the treaty and said, 'What's going on?
[time=2221] Why are you angry?' And verse 29, "But he answered his father, 'Look, for many years I have served you.
[time=2226] I have never disobeyed your command, yet you never gave me a young goat that I might celebrate
[time=2232] with my friends.
[time=2233] You gave him the fat and calf.
[time=2234] You didn't even give me a goat, dad.'" Verse 30, "But when this son of yours," I like that, underline that, "when this son of yours," he's no longer a brother of mine, he's just a son of yours, "but when this son of yours came who has devoured your property with prostitutes, you killed the fat and calf for him, and he said to him, 'Son, you're always with me, and all that is mine is yours.'"
[time=2258] Back to that verse, it was fitting to celebrate and be glad because your brother was dead and is alive, he was lost and is found.
[time=2266] Jesus narrows the story, not just with those proportions, not just with the parties that were thrown, the celebrations that we see, but could it be that, 'I love this?
[time=2274] This is good.
[time=2275] Those could it be that this one parable has three stories that also narrows the focus to
[time=2281] you, and to me, those three stories even point to the last story.
[time=2285] Could it be that the first story about the lost sheep, he was in the pasture, he was in the house, he was where you were supposed to be, but he wandered off and got lost from inside where he was supposed to be, that that points to the lost son, the prodigal son who went and squandered the inheritance.
[time=2301] Hang with me.
[time=2302] Could it be that the second story about the lost coin, where was the coin lost?
[time=2308] In the house, the coin was lost in the house, the sheep left the pasture, the sheep left the building, the coin was in the house, but it was still lost.
[time=2317] Could it be that that is a description of the older brother who never left the house, always served his dad, was right where he was supposed to be, but yet he was still lost?
[time=2328] Could it be that Jesus is describing people that we can often become, that he's narrowing this story down, not just to the prodigal son, usually we say it's singular, the prodigal
[time=2339] son, because he left, but could it be that the older brother was just as lost inside the house of his father as the prodigal son who left, so could it be that this is not a
[time=2350] story parable about a prodigal son, but a story about prodigal sons?
[time=2358] Could it be that you and I may be one of those sons today, that we get lost inside the house,
[time=2367] just like that coin?
[time=2370] There have been seasons in my life where I sat in the house of God, I did the right things,
[time=2377] I put on the church smile, I was in my father's house, but I missed my father's heart.
[time=2387] Most of them wanted their father's hand, but both of them missed their father's heart.
[time=2392] You can be just as lost doing all the right things with the wrong motives as you could be lost doing all the wrong things with the wrong motives.
[time=2401] I think we see that clearly in this story, and we see a description that narrows it down to where we are, and I want you to know folks, it's a dangerous place to be, to be in the house of God but missing the heart of God, but it's so possible, and it's so probable.
[time=2418] That's why we've got to run after the vision, focus that Jesus gave to us on a daily basis
[time=2424] because when we get distracted, we can be like the coin, we can be like the older brother, we can be right where we're supposed to be, but missing the entire point and be lost inside the house.
[time=2435] In 2012, there was a paradigm shift for me in ministry and in life as a follower of Jesus.
[time=2441] I went out to Idaho.
[time=2442] That's where I heard that statement, "Historically, the church has divorced the message of Jesus from his methods." We like to talk about what Jesus said without actually doing what Jesus did, and that all sounds good, but I learned to apply it in this time where we actually were looking at Luke 15.
[time=2457] I'll never forget it.
[time=2458] I was sitting there, we were looking at Luke 15.
[time=2460] It was supposed to be this leadership training, and I was so unimpressed.
[time=2463] I was like, "Well, I preached this passage, you know, crossed my arms and acting like
[time=2469] that older brother, huh?" I was sitting there and we were supposed to talk about which of the characters in the story we identify with, and I knew the story, and I didn't really care to engage in that discussion because I was very unimpressed, and then God did something in me, and I'll never forget what He did in me.
[time=2486] He said, "You're the older brother." I began to weep, because I realized for years, in so many ways, I had been sitting in the
[time=2502] house of God.
[time=2503] I was a pastor.
[time=2505] I had been sitting in the house of God, but missing the heart of God, getting comfortable,
[time=2513] building walls around the church, making it as comfortable as I could make it for myself, and all of those who are already connected to the church, that I was missing the focus that Jesus had for His church to begin with.
[time=2524] And I made a promise to God from that day forward that I would never, that I would never
[time=2530] get to a place where I lost focus on what Jesus came to focus on, because you want to know why, because that focus is me.
[time=2537] I wouldn't be who I am if Jesus didn't choose to focus on me before I deserved Him.
[time=2543] That's why every single week we make the Gospel clear at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=2548] I made a promise to God from that moment that any time a church or a place would be crazy enough to hand this guy or microphone that, "God, I will make the Gospel clear."
[time=2558] That's why we do that from week to week.
[time=2559] That's why I drive you crazy about celebrating baptisms, because that's what stirs the heart of God.
[time=2567] That's where He focused His vision.
[time=2571] Don't be in the house of God but miss the heart of God and His focus for His vision,
[time=2577] not just for His church, but for you, for me.
[time=2581] I'll never forget that season is what drives me and compels me forward right now, and that's why I believe what's true of Jesus personally should be true of us collectively.
[time=2589] There's a statement that I always go back to, and it's this, that church is not a hotel
[time=2595] for the saints, it's a hospital for sinners.
[time=2599] Church is not a hotel for saints, it's a hospital for sinners.
[time=2605] Some of you feel more welcome already now that I just said that, right?
[time=2609] Because you're sick and need a doctor, Jesus even said it's not the well, the healthy that need a doctor, it's the sick.
[time=2616] I came for that reason.
[time=2617] I came to go after those people, because those people are you and me.
[time=2621] You often think, well, I'm a saint now, but you used to be a sinner.
[time=2625] Sometimes you still act like one, even though you still are a saint, right?
[time=2629] Don't throw that elbow, I saw that.
[time=2632] I believe, think about this with me, I believe the true measure, this is tough stuff, this is going to challenge you, but I believe it's going to help us focus our vision to what Jesus focused on.
[time=2640] I believe the true measure of spirituality is ultimately determined by how well one goes,
[time=2646] not how much one knows.
[time=2649] How well I sit with broken people.
[time=2652] How well I walk with broken people is a better measure of my spirituality and my growth as
[time=2659] a follower of Jesus than how well it is I sit with blessed people.
[time=2664] I've always tried to ask myself, put myself outside the Christian bubble, and I don't always do well at it.
[time=2670] It's easy to get in the Christian bubble and just make things comfortable, but I want to be outside that bubble where the broken are.
[time=2676] I'm going to ask, how am I being a blessing to the broken because I'm serving my Savior,
[time=2682] not how well can I bless the blessed and serve the saved?
[time=2685] And you say, well, that's me, that means you don't like me, no, that means we've got to get to work together because people are broken, because people are hurting, because that's the vision of the church, is to take the hope to take the worth that the embrace
[time=2700] of grace that God extended to us gives to us and go take it, broadcast it, scatter it
[time=2706] like seed in a broken and dying and hurting world that needs the same Jesus that we have found.
[time=2713] That's our vision.
[time=2714] That's why Jesus came.
[time=2716] And you know, the gravitational pull, here's what I know, because I've been in church a long time.
[time=2720] I love the church.
[time=2723] I love church people.
[time=2726] If you grew up in the church and you were one of the saints that maybe sometimes you like for it to be a hotel for saints, I'm you.
[time=2733] I grew up around you.
[time=2735] I've known nothing but the church since I was five years old when I gave my life to Jesus.
[time=2739] I love the church.
[time=2742] But what I've learned about the church, us, is that the gravitational pull of the church is away from the one and towards the 99.
[time=2753] It's natural for us to get consumed with comfort so much that we missed the point of
[time=2760] the vision, the focus of the vision for which Jesus came and died and was raised from the dead.
[time=2766] The gravitational pull pulls us away from the one and to the 99.
[time=2770] We want to build walls and make comfortable that which we love about the church.
[time=2775] And I'm all for that never though to the expense of missing the point of why Jesus came to
[time=2781] begin with.
[time=2782] And you know, people talk about this, well, what should Sunday morning be focused on?
[time=2785] You get this question a lot.
[time=2786] You know, that's a good question.
[time=2787] It's a very good question.
[time=2789] What should Sunday morning?
[time=2790] Should church be focused on the found or the lost?
[time=2792] The saints or the sinners?
[time=2794] Should it be about discipleship or evangelism?
[time=2797] And there seems to be a tension there with those things, doesn't there sometimes?
[time=2801] You know what?
[time=2802] I've got the answers.
[time=2803] Very profound.
[time=2804] So kind of sit back and get ready to take some notes.
[time=2805] It's a profound essay.
[time=2806] You ready for it?
[time=2808] Which one should it be about?
[time=2810] Yes.
[time=2812] The gospel of Jesus Christ does both.
[time=2816] The same passage that speaks to a Christian of 50 plus years and challenges you like never
[time=2822] before.
[time=2823] Maybe like has happened to you today is also the passage that Jesus uses in the life of someone who doesn't even know if they believe there is a God to draw them to repentance and point them to Jesus.
[time=2834] That's the power of the gospel.
[time=2836] When you hold this book in your hands, it's not a book.
[time=2838] That's why we believe in it so much is it's so much more than a book.
[time=2842] It has the power to cut through and penetrate the heart of those who've known Jesus for all of their life and those who don't even think they want to know him.
[time=2851] That's the Bible.
[time=2853] That's the gospel.
[time=2855] That's why Jesus came for you and for me.
[time=2860] And you know, one of the things that I would say concerns me the most as a pastor, as a
[time=2866] leader, as a follower of Jesus is that we would work really hard and build really nice,
[time=2873] big buildings, build really nice churches that are really comfortable, but lose our focus
[time=2880] in our vision on the disconnected at the expense of just making sure that the connected are
[time=2887] taken care of well.
[time=2889] Jesus said, "I came to seek and save that which was lost.
[time=2892] It keeps me up at night because I know the gravitational pull says make it about the 99.
[time=2898] Make it comfortable." But Jesus said, "Get uncomfortable and go outside the walls that you build.
[time=2903] Build the wall so that there's a place for those outside the walls to come and see who I am.
[time=2908] And then while you're building those walls and while they're coming, go find the ones who aren't coming.
[time=2914] It keeps me up at night to think that we might just build things that are comfortable.
[time=2919] Do things that are comfortable, missing the disconnected, that Jesus, the Father, that
[time=2927] His eyes are focused on off at a distance just like that prodigal sign.
[time=2932] May it never be said of us at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=2935] May we be a church who has the same vision that Jesus built His church with.
[time=2941] We believe in creating a safe environment.
[time=2943] Here, maybe this is you today, we believe in creating a safe environment where you can hear me, where you can belong even way before you believe.
[time=2952] You can belong at Black Hawk Ministries even if you say, "I think that pastor is crazy sometimes.
[time=2956] The stuff that he believes, the stuff that that church stands for, I don't think I believe any of that stuff at all." We still want you to belong.
[time=2965] You're who Jesus went and sat and ate dinner with.
[time=2968] Is that a dividing line between us?
[time=2970] No.
[time=2971] We're about you because Jesus was about you because Jesus was about us in the same way.
[time=2976] When you look to your right, when you look to your left, you'll see people.
[time=2979] You'll see some that are more mature than you spiritually.
[time=2981] You'll see some that are less mature than you spiritually, but there's one thing that ties us all together.
[time=2985] We all need Jesus, and He met us right where we are.
[time=2996] We close your eyes for a moment, bow your heads and just think about what that may mean to you today.
[time=3001] You really want Black Hawk to be a place where the unchurched, the lost, loved to come because
[time=3008] we have a place and a venue where you can work through your doubts, where you can work through your fears, where you can work through your questions.
[time=3014] Maybe that's where some of you sit now.
[time=3015] Maybe you're here today and there's a question I want to leave you with.
[time=3019] If you're a believer, if you know Jesus right now, then the question I want to leave you with is how this week can my belief turn into a broadcast?
[time=3026] How can my belief turn into a broadcast?
[time=3031] As you contemplate that, nobody looking around, some of you would say, "I'm who Jesus focused on.
[time=3037] I'm that lost son." Maybe you even grew up in church.
[time=3041] You're the older brother.
[time=3043] You've been in the house of God, but you're still just as lost as that coin was lost in the house.
[time=3050] You're the point of the gospel.
[time=3053] You're what matters to Jesus.
[time=3057] You can become a son or a daughter of God by birth, even though your worth is not enough
[time=3064] to get you there.
[time=3066] You say, "That sounds so nice, pastor, but I just don't know if that could apply to me.
[time=3071] The gospel is for you." You're the focus of the vision of Jesus.
[time=3075] While he was on the cross, you were on his mind.
[time=3078] As you think about what that may mean for you right where you sit, I don't know what's going on in your life.
[time=3084] I want you to know God doesn't care what's going on in your life.
[time=3086] He cares about you.
[time=3087] He cares about your life, but he doesn't care about the obstacles because he's bigger than those obstacles.
[time=3094] Don't wait any longer.
[time=3095] The gospel is simply this, that we recognize we're separated from God by our sin, but that Jesus paid the price for that sin by dying the death we could never die because he lived
[time=3106] the sinless life we could never live.
[time=3109] You could at least get with me until there, but by doing that, he paid the price for you to bridge the gap between you and God because of his perfection, because of who he is, because
[time=3120] of the price he paid, and it didn't stop there.
[time=3123] He rose from the dead.
[time=3126] We under emphasized the resurrection sometimes because without that, we could have no victory over death, hell and the grave, but Jesus won that victory.
[time=3133] You don't have to fight for victory.
[time=3135] You get to fight from the victory that Jesus has won.
[time=3140] You say, "But I can't say it like you just did.
[time=3142] God doesn't want you to.
[time=3143] I don't want your heart to cry out to him.
[time=3145] Salvation doesn't come from a prayer.
[time=3146] I'm not going to lead you in a prayer because I believe your heart is screaming it in this place right now.
[time=3152] God wants your heart to turn towards him, and when you say, "Jesus, I do need you," will you save me?
[time=3158] And your words to him, the gospel promises you that he'll meet you where you sit.
[time=3165] On this day, the 28th of May, 2017, can be the day of salvation for you.
[time=3173] Especially will you cry out to him in your own words, laying your life down at his feet and asking him to save you, and he will do that now.
[time=3185] Every secret, every shame, every fear, every pain, live inside the dark.
[time=3205] But that's not who we are.
[time=3208] We are children of the day.
[time=3213] And so wake up sweet, we'll lift our head.
[time=3217] We were meant for more than this.
[time=3220] Light the shadows, conquer death.
[time=3223] Make the most of the time we have left.
[time=3227] We are the light of the world.
[time=3230] We are the city on a hill.
[time=3233] We are the light of the world.
[time=3236] We got it, we got it, we got it.
[time=3238] Let the light shine.
[time=3240] We are the light of the world.
[time=3243] We are the city on a hill.
[time=3246] We are the light of the world.
[time=3248] We got it, we got it, we got it.
[time=3250] Let the light shine.
[time=3254] Let the light shine, let the light shine.
[time=3265] We are called to spread the news to help the world.
[time=3274] We are simple truths that Jesus came to say.
[time=3281] We are straight up in his name.
[time=3284] So let his love reign through you.
[time=3290] We are the light of the world.
[time=3293] We are the city on a hill.
[time=3296] We are the light of the world.
[time=3299] We got it, we got it, we got it.
[time=3301] Let the light shine.
[time=3303] We are the light of the world.
[time=3306] We are the city on a hill.
[time=3309] We are the light of the world.
[time=3312] We got it, we got it, we got it.
[time=3314] Let the light shine.
[time=3317] We are the light, we got it, we got it.
[time=3320] Let the light shine brighter.
[time=3323] We are the light, we are the light, we are the light.
[time=3328] Jesus, you are the light, you are the light, you are the light.
[time=3334] We will lift you high and shine, shine.
[time=3343] We are the light of the world.
[time=3346] We are the city on a hill.
[time=3349] We are the light of the world.
[time=3352] We got it, we got it, we got it.
[time=3354] Let the light shine.
[time=3356] We are the light of the world.
[time=3359] We are the city on a hill.
[time=3362] We are the light of the world.
[time=3365] We got it, we got it, we got it.
[time=3367] Let the light shine.
[time=3376] Let the light shine, let the light shine.
[time=3383] Where has your focus been?
[time=3392] Maybe the vision that God has for your life has been brought to life in a new way today as we've looked at how Jesus went after the one at the expense of the 99.
[time=3402] He would leave the 99 to go after the one, you are that one, I am that one.
[time=3407] Isn't it a beautiful thing to know that when we're lost, when we're wondering whether we're lost inside the house or whether we're lost outside the house, that Jesus knows where we are, first of all, but secondly, he comes to find us.
[time=3420] He meets us where we are.
[time=3422] I think he's done that in your life and in mind today and if maybe it's time for you to take that step of faith, that leap of faith, maybe it feels like to just lay your life down at the foot of the cross.
[time=3431] And say, Jesus, I do need you to save me as we've talked about today.
[time=3435] I challenge you, don't hold back.
[time=3437] Take that step today and you will never regret it.
[time=3441] It doesn't mean everything in your life is going to be fixed and easy.
[time=3444] It does mean, though, that whatever you face, you have an eternal foundation that comes from Jesus and Jesus alone.
[time=3451] If you need to take that step, don't hold back.
[time=3453] Take that step now.
[time=3454] If you have taken that step, we want to know, we want to hear about that from you.
[time=3458] We've got a book that we want to get into your hands and we're willing to mail this to you.
[time=3462] We'd love to have you come here to Blackhawk Ministries and pick it up in person.
[time=3466] But the book is called Beginning Steps, a growth guide for new believers.
[time=3470] And what I want to tell you is if you're entering into a relationship with Jesus Christ, it is a beginning in your life.
[time=3476] It's not an end of something.
[time=3478] It's an end of hopelessness.
[time=3480] It's an end of not knowing about eternity.
[time=3482] It's an end of uncertainty, but it's the beginning of life.
[time=3486] It's the beginning of eternal life because you have entered from death to life all because of Jesus.
[time=3492] And so today, if you've taken that step, let us get one of these in your hands.
[time=3495] There's going to be some information on your screen.
[time=3497] Phone number, email address where you can reach out to us and our desire, our hope is to walk with you however we can walk with you to help you walk on this journey together.
[time=3508] We believe that life is better together.
[time=3510] We even want to help you find one of our life groups that meets seven days a week throughout our community and here at the church so that you can find other people who are struggling through this thing called life just like you, just like me, so we can do it together.
[time=3522] So reach out to us, tell us your story, and if you've prayed to receive Jesus today, I congratulate you.
[time=3528] I celebrate with you because Jesus is alive and well, and he's just getting started in your life.
[time=3534] I also want to invite you back next week.
[time=3536] We're going to continue our focus on vision.
[time=3538] We're going to be talking about having a vision for my future, having a vision for where I'm going in life.
[time=3544] Do you ever struggle with that?
[time=3545] Wondering how to find Jesus, how to find what God wants for your future?
[time=3550] Well, the Bible has a lot to say. God has a lot to say to you about that very thing.
[time=3554] So join us next week as we continue exploring what God's vision for his church looks like and what God's vision for you looks like because I assure you he definitely has one.
[time=3564] We'll see you next week.
[time=3574] You
