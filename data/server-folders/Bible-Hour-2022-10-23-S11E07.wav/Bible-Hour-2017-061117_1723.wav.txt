[time=491] Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[time=496] Our God is lying, the lion of Judah.
[time=501] He's roaring with power and fighting our battles and every knee will bow before him.
[time=510] Our God is the lamb, the lamb that was slain for the sin of the world.
[time=519] His blood breaks the chains and every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb.
[time=528] Oh, every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb.
[time=542] So open up the gates and pray before the king of kings.
[time=550] [MUSIC]
[time=580] My God is the lamb, the lamb that was slain for the sin of the world.
[time=591] His blood breaks the chains and every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb.
[time=599] Oh, every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb.
[time=606] [MUSIC]
[time=636] Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[time=654] Who can stop the Lord?
[time=659] Our God is lying, the lion of Judah.
[time=665] He's roaring with power and fighting our battles and every knee will bow before him.
[time=675] Our God is the lamb, the lamb that was slain for the sin of the world.
[time=684] His blood breaks the chains and every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb.
[time=692] Oh, every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb.
[time=722] [MUSIC]
[time=744] In Christ alone, my hope is found.
[time=750] He is my light by strength, my song.
[time=755] This quarter's gone, this solid ground.
[time=761] Fear through the fiercest drought and storm.
[time=766] What heights of love, what depths of peace.
[time=772] When fears are still, when strife ensues.
[time=778] In my convert era, my holy law.
[time=784] Fear in the love of Christ I state.
[time=790] [MUSIC]
[time=811] Fear in the love of Christ I state.
[time=822] [MUSIC]
[time=843] Fear in the love of Christ I state.
[time=858] [MUSIC]
[time=879] Fear in the love of Christ I state.
[time=1090] [MUSIC]
[time=1107] Good morning.
[time=1109] Hey pray for me I struggle with my technology this morning.
[time=1113] Graduation Sunday isn't that exciting?
[time=1116] Graduation Sunday signifies the culmination of years of hard work and responsibility.
[time=1122] Homework, test, quizzes, presentations, journals, portfolios and of course research papers are over.
[time=1131] At least for now.
[time=1133] Graduation also brings with many new tomorrows.
[time=1138] Most exciting but also filled with the unknown and many many decisions just ask your parents.
[time=1146] Decisions don't stop they just escalate you have a lot more decisions to make.
[time=1151] As you graduate you probably have a preferred future a desired path even a picturesque journey and you should.
[time=1159] You've accomplished something great you really have and your life and the world are wide open ahead of you.
[time=1166] Today we celebrate your accomplishments and we join you in excitement for your future.
[time=1172] At the graduation ceremony it is traditional for graduates to move the tassel from right to left.
[time=1179] Right Mr. Harmon, right to left, got it?
[time=1182] Okay, right to left.
[time=1184] It's as if to signify that hey I have accomplished everything that I need to do to be identified as a graduate of this
[time=1192] particular institution whether it's a school or a high school or a college.
[time=1196] And what they do is they take the tassel as a group and they move it from right to left.
[time=1202] Leaving the known, leaving the familiar, leaving what we like into something that we maybe don't even know yet, right?
[time=1211] We don't know what it's going to look like.
[time=1213] We don't know what the future is going to look like but when we graduate we move our tassel from the right to left and I like to call that our tassel moment.
[time=1221] Maybe we have tassel moments that we need to address.
[time=1225] Part of graduating is taking what you've learned, who you've become, and facing and tackling the next set of experiences, but be ready.
[time=1236] Many times those experiences can radically change your life because no matter what we do the future always comes and with the future comes change.
[time=1248] And that's where our fear lies.
[time=1256] If we were 100% guaranteed that tomorrow would be like today or next week would be like today or next month or next year would be like today would we be fearful.
[time=1267] Not if we knew, but that's what makes tomorrow so fearful.
[time=1273] Deep inside of us, if we're honest, most of us have a healthy fear or a concern for the future.
[time=1280] Our fear of the future is almost always connected to a fear of change.
[time=1285] Listen to this quote from a popular television show.
[time=1289] This particular quote was given at the end of the show and I don't espouse what the show talks about but they have good writers and sometimes they write good things, right?
[time=1299] So here we go, we spend our whole lives worrying about the future, planning for the future, trying to predict the future as if figuring it out will cushion the blow.
[time=1309] But the future is always changing.
[time=1311] The future is the home of our deepest fears and wildest hopes, but one thing is certain when it finally reveals itself, the future is never the way we imagined it.
[time=1322] And that's true. There's a very high percentage of students that go on to college that change their majors.
[time=1330] How many of you have graduated and during your college years you change your major?
[time=1334] Yeah, very high percentage of that happens.
[time=1338] I went to college, I took a Bible major, I was actually a Bible major and I was going to be a pastor.
[time=1344] And then my sophomore, junior year, I felt God was calling me into education.
[time=1350] So that happens a lot. So your future doesn't always look the way that you might think it is.
[time=1355] It's really fun and I don't want to throw anybody in the bus, but it's really fun to talk to high school kids when they graduate.
[time=1360] What are you going to do with yourself? Well, I'm going to go to Purdue and I'm going to style biomechanics and I'm going to become, you know?
[time=1366] And I just want to love them and say, that's great, probably not, right?
[time=1372] You're probably going to change your major, you're probably going to change your direction because we don't really have all the answers until we're walking the journey.
[time=1382] And so as our future rolls in, we get to carve through it and continue to look for good, just like tomorrow, change is inevitable.
[time=1392] In our language, tomorrow can be the next day, it can mean the next day, or it can mean another period of time, right?
[time=1399] So we can talk about tomorrow being Monday, June the 5th, or we can talk about tomorrow being 2020, either one.
[time=1408] So what I wanted to do is I want to take a look back at where the church was and came from so we can get better understanding of where it might go in the future.
[time=1421] Back in the 1970s, when I began attending church, things were much, much different. If we could jump into the DeLorean, engage the flux capacitor, and travel back to the 70s, we would see a worship experience much different.
[time=1435] I grew up at Rise Baptist Church in Rise Junction, Michigan, and Rise Baptist was a very conservative Baptist Church at the time, much like I would think Blackhawk might have been back in the 70s, a conservative Baptist Church.
[time=1450] There are many things that are different today than they were back then. The way we worship, how we decorate, how we dress, what we do, the demographics of our congregation, the way we do ministry, and how about technology.
[time=1464] A lot of difference from today.
[time=1467] As a matter of fact, when I first started to go into church, and some of you who are younger than I am, you may not have seen these things happen during church, but I promise you that those who are older than I am went through these changes, and they were hard changes.
[time=1482] We look at them now and say, "Well, that's really no big deal," but those were hard changes for us to make.
[time=1488] So there was a lot of pain, a lot of tears, and a lot of discussions about a lot of these changes.
[time=1495] Back in the 1970s, when you would go to church, 95% of men would wear a suit and a tie.
[time=1502] 95% easy, maybe more than that. I didn't say 100 because I'm sure there was one of you guys that didn't.
[time=1509] But you would wear a suit and a tie, and a suit meant the jacket and the pants were made of the same material.
[time=1516] You didn't wear a blazer.
[time=1518] No, you were a suit and a tie.
[time=1520] As a matter of fact, in our church, if you didn't wear a suit and a tie, you could not usher.
[time=1526] You were not allowed to usher without a suit and a tie.
[time=1531] Maybe even a higher percentage of women wore dresses and skirts, right?
[time=1536] Women wore dresses and skirts.
[time=1538] What you didn't see was ladies and pantsuits or pants of any size.
[time=1542] You just didn't see that.
[time=1543] As a matter of fact, I remember, and some of you will remember too, when ladies started wearing pants to church.
[time=1550] Man, you looked at them like this.
[time=1552] Over top of the glasses, you know what I mean?
[time=1554] What are you doing wearing pants to church?
[time=1557] Did you see she wore pants to church today?
[time=1561] That was the environment that we lived in.
[time=1565] We sang hymns exclusively.
[time=1569] And everything was very formal and honestly kind of sterile, right?
[time=1576] Projectors?
[time=1577] No, we didn't have anything like that.
[time=1579] Of course, that technology wasn't available back then, but I'm guessing we probably wouldn't have used it anyways.
[time=1584] Because we sang our hymnals from the hymn book, right?
[time=1589] Remember Pete Covey standing up here saying, please turn to page 274, right?
[time=1594] We sang from the hymn book.
[time=1598] We took notes, either on a piece of paper or on the back side of the bulletin.
[time=1603] Or maybe some people brought a spiral binder.
[time=1606] When our pastor put notes pages in the bulletin, that was huge.
[time=1612] I was pretty excited because my mom would ask me if I took notes today.
[time=1616] And of course, if you know me, I don't write well at all.
[time=1619] You can't hardly ever read things I write.
[time=1621] But there were blanks I could write a word or two, and that was exciting.
[time=1624] So that's how we did that.
[time=1627] The stage, take a look back here.
[time=1631] Isn't this beautiful?
[time=1632] Christian and Beth and their team, they do all of this.
[time=1635] They put all this stuff together.
[time=1637] Back in the day, you wouldn't have seen this on the stage.
[time=1640] You wouldn't have seen anything on the stage.
[time=1642] The stage, the platform was almost sacred, right?
[time=1647] Other than maybe a Christmas pageant, you might see something there.
[time=1650] But on a regular Sunday, you wouldn't see things like this on the platform.
[time=1654] But today, we see them.
[time=1658] But you know what?
[time=1660] Even then, we were taught the Bible.
[time=1664] We followed Jesus, and we knew the gospel.
[time=1669] And then, three words crept their way into church that I remember.
[time=1675] One, this right here became the stage, not the platform.
[time=1680] So you would never call it a stage because a stage meant a concert, right?
[time=1686] And to be honest with you, to conservative Baptist churches back then, stage didn't just mean concert, it meant rock concert.
[time=1693] That's what that meant.
[time=1694] So we would always call it a platform.
[time=1696] Even today, at my age, I still have a hard time referring to this as a stage.
[time=1701] Not because I think it's anything different, but because that's the way I was raised.
[time=1705] But this is a stage.
[time=1706] The second thing is, back here, I played the trombone at our church, and Carl played the trombone, Randy played the trumpet, and Ed and Sherry played the saxophone, Lisa played the flute.
[time=1719] What did we call that?
[time=1721] Orchestra.
[time=1723] We would never call it a band.
[time=1725] You would never call it that.
[time=1727] We called it an orchestra.
[time=1730] That was a difficult transition for many people to call this a worship band or a praise band.
[time=1736] That was hard.
[time=1738] But without question, in my journey through the church, and possibly many of you, the one word that made the biggest impact was contemporary.
[time=1749] Contemporary.
[time=1750] We started using phrases like contemporary music, contemporary service, contemporary style.
[time=1758] And I will tell you, many tears were shed over the word contemporary in a church.
[time=1766] Churches split over the word contemporary.
[time=1770] People left churches because of the word contemporary.
[time=1776] Some of you remember that, don't you?
[time=1778] You remember those days when we made that transition.
[time=1782] Those were difficult times.
[time=1784] And I know that those of you who are maybe on the younger side might think, well, that's really not a big deal.
[time=1789] It really isn't, but it was a huge, huge deal.
[time=1794] But you know what?
[time=1796] Throughout those transitions, we continued to teach the Bible.
[time=1800] We continued to follow Jesus, and we continued to spread the gospel.
[time=1807] And then this began.
[time=1810] Pastors would preach without a tie on.
[time=1814] You remember those days?
[time=1816] Wow, the conversations I've heard on that.
[time=1819] He doesn't even wear a tie anymore.
[time=1822] And then pastors had the audacity to do that.
[time=1828] How many of you remember that?
[time=1830] If you're like, these people, he doesn't dress like a pastor.
[time=1834] I'm putting my jacket back on, it's cold up here.
[time=1839] Plus, you know what?
[time=1842] I feel comfortable coming to a church in a jacket.
[time=1846] And when I look at men who wear suits and ties, they're not more spiritual than they are.
[time=1852] They're just comfortable doing that.
[time=1853] That's what it is.
[time=1854] That's what they're comfortable doing.
[time=1856] Right?
[time=1858] Just because Rich wears a jacket to church every Sunday doesn't mean I'm more spiritual than you are, that has nothing to do with it.
[time=1864] It's just the comfort level for me after growing up through the church this way.
[time=1869] Do I think it's bad to take my jacket off and preach in a shirt and home?
[time=1872] I don't have any issues with that whatsoever.
[time=1874] I better not, my pastor does it all the time.
[time=1877] Right? It doesn't matter.
[time=1880] What I learned through that whole transition was that this doesn't matter.
[time=1886] This doesn't matter whether it's a stage or a platform or a band or an orchestra, whether we have props on the stage or where I wear a suit and a tie.
[time=1895] Because we continue to teach the Bible, we continue to follow Jesus, and we continue to preach the gospel.
[time=1904] That's what church is.
[time=1907] When it comes to dress, that's why we don't make a big deal about dress at Black Hawk.
[time=1913] My philosophy has always been, as long as I modest according to the Bible and not distracting from the word, I can wear whatever you want.
[time=1922] Whatever you're comfortable in.
[time=1924] But it wasn't always that way.
[time=1926] These were difficult transitions for us to make within the church body.
[time=1930] And so those of you who are younger, you look at our older and understand, they went through those transitions and those were hard.
[time=1938] I don't know what the next transition is going to look like.
[time=1941] We do not or cannot ever know what tomorrow brings.
[time=1945] I've heard my whole life, haven't you?
[time=1947] That you're not promised tomorrow.
[time=1949] Jesus could call you home today.
[time=1951] You could receive an undesirable diagnosis, right?
[time=1956] And when we think about our tomorrow could be different.
[time=1958] We always think about those negative things.
[time=1960] But what about this?
[time=1961] What if, what if sometime in the next few days, God brings someone in your life that changes your life forever in a great way?
[time=1975] What if you respond to a leading by God and take faithful steps
[time=1983] and He gives you a passion that you have never known.
[time=1987] Wouldn't that be exciting?
[time=1988] Wouldn't that change your life?
[time=1991] What if you took a step of faith and God blessed you,
[time=1998] put yourself in a position that maybe it's uncomfortable, but God blessed you because see what God wants is He wants your heart, right?
[time=2006] He wants your heart 100% of the time.
[time=2009] 100% of your heart, 100% of the time He'll take care of the rest.
[time=2014] So even with the campaign that Pastor Kevin talked about this morning, what if each of us took a step of faith, put ourselves in a position that was
[time=2024] maybe risky a little bit or uncomfortable.
[time=2026] Let's use that word, maybe uncomfortable.
[time=2028] And we ended up raising the dollars that we need for that campaign and even paying off the mortgage before the month of June.
[time=2034] Wouldn't that be exciting?
[time=2036] Well, see, God will bless you in those situations.
[time=2041] He will lead you and it's important that we listen because here's the thing.
[time=2046] We may not know what the future holds, but we know who holds the future, don't we?
[time=2052] And He has things to tell us in our passage today, Matthew chapter 6, verse 25 to 34.
[time=2061] This is part of what we call the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=2064] Jesus would often be followed around by His disciples and then many, many other people, thousands, even at times, would be following.
[time=2071] And then Jesus would just sit down.
[time=2073] He would just sit down on the mountain.
[time=2074] He would just talk into Him.
[time=2075] He wasn't standing on a platform with a microphone preaching to people like that.
[time=2079] He was sitting down just chatting.
[time=2081] He said, "Hey, I want to tell you something." And what Jesus was telling was how to live.
[time=2087] Because up to this point, they had lived a certain way.
[time=2090] Jesus Christ created a brand new gospel.
[time=2095] He brought a new gospel to the people radically different than anything they had ever heard before.
[time=2099] And He was saying, "This is how you ought to live." Let's take a look at some of those.
[time=2104] We'll start in verse 25.
[time=2108] The first point of your outline is, "Live a life free of anxiety.
[time=2113] Therefore, I tell you, do not be anxious about your life.
[time=2116] What you eat or what you will drink, not about your body, what you will put on.
[time=2121] Is not life more than food in the body, more than clothing?" Another word for anxiety is worry.
[time=2127] Worry about what could happen, how things might turn out.
[time=2130] Where am I going to college?
[time=2131] Am I studying the right major?
[time=2133] Am I going to get that job promotion?
[time=2135] Are we going to move?
[time=2137] Are we going to relocate a business?
[time=2140] All of those things are worry.
[time=2141] We worry about those things.
[time=2142] We spend time doing that.
[time=2145] William Inn says worry is interest paid on trouble before it comes due.
[time=2151] Wow.
[time=2152] The National Institute of Mental Health said anxiety is the most common mental issue.
[time=2158] 40 million Americans, 18 and older, have an anxiety disorder.
[time=2162] Now, I'm not a medical doctor, and I can't help with that necessarily.
[time=2166] But I do know that God loves you and desires for all of us to live a carefree, anxiety-free life.
[time=2173] He tells us so in Philippians 4, 6, do not be anxious about anything, but in everything
[time=2180] by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.
[time=2186] Part of being a Christian, the difference between being a Christian and not being a Christian is one of the parts is anxiety.
[time=2192] God wants us to put our trust in faith in Him, not in ourselves.
[time=2199] They said that 40% of what we worry about never happens.
[time=2204] 40% of what we worry about never happens.
[time=2208] 30% of what we worry about are things from the past that we cannot change.
[time=2215] 12% of what we worry about are criticisms by other people, mostly untrue.
[time=2222] 10% we worry about our health.
[time=2226] That leaves 8%.
[time=2229] 8% of what we worry about are legitimate concerns in our life.
[time=2233] That means that 92% of the time we're worrying about something we can't do anything about.
[time=2239] And that's what creates anxiety.
[time=2242] Okay, so how do I live anxiety-free?
[time=2244] I get it.
[time=2245] God wants me to live anxiety-free.
[time=2247] How do I do that?
[time=2248] Well, make Jesus the master of your life.
[time=2252] Boy, that sounds simple, doesn't it?
[time=2254] Make Jesus the master of your life.
[time=2257] How?
[time=2258] Have you given your heart and life to Christ?
[time=2261] Do you read your Bible regularly?
[time=2265] God is in love with you.
[time=2267] God is in love with you, and He has written this, and He has so many things He wants to teach you.
[time=2274] Spend time here.
[time=2276] Read it.
[time=2277] Study it.
[time=2278] Understand it.
[time=2279] And not nobody can explain, but this changes you.
[time=2285] This changes you.
[time=2288] Read this.
[time=2289] Do you pray daily?
[time=2291] Prayer is putting ourselves in a position of submission to God, and not asking God for a bunch of a list of things, right?
[time=2298] But for us, our will to become in line with His will, do you pray?
[time=2306] Maybe.
[time=2307] Do you surround yourself with like-minded believers who can walk with you during difficult times?
[time=2314] Yeah?
[time=2317] I live in Ohio today.
[time=2319] Another week I live in Indiana, but living in Ohio today, my son and I are Michigan fans, don't boo.
[time=2325] That's a good thing.
[time=2327] All right?
[time=2328] We're Michigan fans.
[time=2329] We live in Ohio, and we have been battling Ohio, Michigan state stuff forever.
[time=2335] But about six or seven Saturdays in the fall, we drive to a little place called Ann Arbor.
[time=2342] And you know what?
[time=2344] It's so fun to be with people who are like-minded.
[time=2349] We're not the only ones wearing Michigan gear.
[time=2353] We-other people have hats on.
[time=2355] They're a lot more decked out than Ty and I are.
[time=2357] We're pretty conservative, man.
[time=2358] They're people with paint everywhere and all this.
[time=2360] We like to be with people that aren't like-minded.
[time=2363] The same in the Christian faith.
[time=2365] Are you surrounding yourself with-with like-minded people?
[time=2369] That's how you can build yourself up and get to a point where you can release to Jesus Christ.
[time=2375] Maybe some of you need a tassel moment here.
[time=2378] Maybe some of you need a tassel moment of-it's all about me, but I want to now make it all
[time=2385] about God.
[time=2386] Amen?
[time=2387] Yeah.
[time=2388] Number two says God's promised provisions.
[time=2392] And this one always gets me.
[time=2394] God's promised provisions.
[time=2395] Look at verse 26.
[time=2397] Look at the birds of the air.
[time=2398] They're neither sore nor-so nor-reat nor gathering to barns, and yet your heavenly father feeds them.
[time=2403] Are you not of more value than they are?
[time=2408] I could just see Jesus pleading on the mountain with the people.
[time=2410] I love you so much.
[time=2412] Look at the birds.
[time=2413] They don't do anything and I feed them.
[time=2414] Why wouldn't I feed you?
[time=2417] Back in Genesis, God gave me and the dominion over the earth and all the animals and all the creatures.
[time=2422] Obviously we mean more to him than the-excuse me.
[time=2429] Jesus Christ gave his life.
[time=2432] Who did he give his life for?
[time=2434] Us.
[time=2435] People, right?
[time=2437] Jesus did not come to this earth and die on a cross to save salamanders and pigeons.
[time=2442] He came to save you and me.
[time=2446] That's how much God values you.
[time=2449] Verse 27, "And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to a span of life?
[time=2455] And why are you anxious about clothing?
[time=2457] Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow.
[time=2459] They neither toil nor spin.
[time=2461] Yet I tell you, even Solomon, in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of these.
[time=2467] But if God so closed the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown up the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
[time=2478] Therefore, do not be anxious saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we wear, for the Gentiles seek after these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them." Back in that time, food was a lot harder to come by, clothing was a lot harder to come by.
[time=2492] I would guess that anybody who is listening here in our congregation or even in our family online doesn't worry about not having any clothes to wear, now we sometimes think we
[time=2502] don't have any clothes to wear, right?
[time=2504] But we have clothes that we can wear.
[time=2505] Back then, it was a much bigger deal.
[time=2508] And I think we can make this association to, "He knows your needs.
[time=2514] He knows what you need." Even before you ask him, even before you drop to your knees and ask him for your needs, he knows what they are.
[time=2522] Does that mean you shouldn't ask him?
[time=2524] No, that's not what that means.
[time=2525] You just need to know, you are asking someone who knows what you need already.
[time=2532] Interesting it says that, "O ye of little faith," and then he talks about Gentiles in
[time=2538] verse 32.
[time=2539] Gentile is a word that is often used for pagans or sinners, okay?
[time=2545] Worry is a characteristic of unbelievers.
[time=2553] Because the unsaved, those who are not believers, they don't have access to God's provision.
[time=2562] We as Christians have access to God's provision.
[time=2564] He says he will provide for us.
[time=2569] He says that he will provide.
[time=2574] God loves you and he will take care of you.
[time=2576] I want to throw another verse at you today, Romans 8, verse 32.
[time=2580] He who did he God, who did not spare his God's own son Jesus, but gave him Jesus up for us
[time=2589] all.
[time=2590] That's us, we're in the Bible right there, us all.
[time=2592] How will he God, not also with Jesus, graciously give us all things?
[time=2600] God who did not spare his son wants to provide for you.
[time=2604] Would you let him?
[time=2609] If you listen in those verses in 26 and on, you can almost hear Jesus' heart.
[time=2615] It's almost as if he's saying, "I've got it, I'll take care of you, just let me."
[time=2623] Psalm 4610 is a verse that I use a lot, it says, "Be still and know that I am God." My wife ran across that in her devotional one day and she said, "Hey, you got to listen to this." Because she knows that, I mean, you can email from me, it's at the bottom of my email.
[time=2636] The author of her devotional said that this means, "Relax and let God be God." Now, honestly, how many times do you try to play God in your life?
[time=2645] Yeah, we do, don't we?
[time=2648] God says, "Don't.
[time=2649] I got that job.
[time=2651] Let him do that." Maybe some of us need a tassel moment, a tassel moment about provision, who's providing?
[time=2665] I'm providing, God's providing.
[time=2669] We need to recognize that.
[time=2671] So if God is providing it, I get it.
[time=2674] Does that mean that if I worry, I'm an unbeliever?
[time=2677] Because you just said worry is a product of the unbelievers.
[time=2679] If I worry, am I an unbeliever?
[time=2681] No, I don't believe that.
[time=2682] But I think maybe that you're not living out your belief completely.
[time=2686] Maybe I'm not doing that or maybe I'm allowing something else to steal my joy because ultimately
[time=2692] God is my father, he is providing for me.
[time=2695] Okay, so does that mean I don't have to work?
[time=2697] God's going to provide it anyways.
[time=2698] No, I don't think that would be the case either.
[time=2701] Because if you look back in Genesis, remember that work came before the fall, work came before
[time=2710] sin and in the world.
[time=2711] Work was designed to be a good thing.
[time=2713] Now you think about it.
[time=2714] If you've done work and you've done a project and you've done it well, how energizing is that?
[time=2720] Yeah, work is a good thing.
[time=2721] So yes, we should work.
[time=2723] But remember in class of 323 it says whatever you do, work heartily, work heartily for the
[time=2731] Lord, not for men, knowing that from the Lord you receive the reward of the inheritance.
[time=2736] You are serving the Lord Christ.
[time=2738] So when you go to work, do you work for your boss or do you work for yourself or do you work for the Lord?
[time=2744] We work for the Lord.
[time=2745] That's the mystery of the Christian faith.
[time=2747] When I go to work and I'm working diligently as unto the Lord, God just directs things.
[time=2754] I can't explain it, it just happens, right?
[time=2758] It just happens.
[time=2761] So maybe you do need a tassel moment about who provides for you.
[time=2766] I provide for me, God provides for me.
[time=2771] Number three, God-focused passion.
[time=2774] Number 32, again, for the Gentiles seek after these things and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.
[time=2781] But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things will be added to you.
[time=2786] The Gentiles seek after the needs.
[time=2789] That's where their passion is.
[time=2790] Seek is more than just looking.
[time=2792] Seek.
[time=2793] Seek is an action.
[time=2796] It's an action with determination, a pursuit with a determination to seek.
[time=2803] The Gentiles or the unbelievers, they seek after those things.
[time=2806] That's what drives them.
[time=2807] That's their passion.
[time=2808] That's what gets them up in the morning.
[time=2810] And God says, "No, seek first the kingdom of God.
[time=2815] Let your passion be seeking Jesus." I'll take care of the other stuff.
[time=2820] That's the mystery of our faith.
[time=2823] None of us understand it completely, but that's the way that Jesus taught His people back on the mountain.
[time=2830] So where is your passion?
[time=2832] Be honest with yourself, what drives you?
[time=2834] What gets you up in the morning?
[time=2835] What's going to get you up tomorrow morning?
[time=2838] Is it going to be your job, your passion for your job?
[time=2843] Or is it going to be passion for Christ, and by that I will do my job well?
[time=2850] Passion for Jesus, a God-focused passion.
[time=2855] Maybe you need a tassel moment about that.
[time=2858] Maybe your tassel moment is, "My drive is about what I can do, but my drive needs to
[time=2864] be about Jesus Christ." And that's what Jesus is teaching the people on the mountain.
[time=2872] And the fourth point, "Plan for tomorrow, but live today," is in verse 34, "Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself.
[time=2881] It's sufficient for the day is its own trouble." Basically, "I've got to live today." Jesus said, "Don't worry about tomorrow, there will be enough to worry about when you get there.
[time=2895] Just take care of today.
[time=2897] What does that mean?
[time=2898] I don't need to plan for the future." No?
[time=2900] Look at Proverbs 6, 6 through 8.
[time=2902] I don't think I put this on this screen.
[time=2904] Go to the ant-o-sluggard.
[time=2906] This o-sluggard is the person who's lazy and doesn't plan.
[time=2910] Go to the ant-o-sluggard, consider her ways and be wise without having any chief officer or ruler.
[time=2916] She prepares her bread and summer and gathers her food and harvest.
[time=2920] Plan for the future, but be willing and ready to understand God might have a different plan.
[time=2927] A couple of years ago, Debbie and I went to a party, and it's one of those -- y'all have this friend.
[time=2932] They're going to come to the party and they're going to bring A, B, C, D, but you're one wonder if they'll even remember there's a party, whether or not they'll bring anything.
[time=2940] You know what I'm talking about, right?
[time=2942] In your family.
[time=2943] Well, so Debbie and I said, "What are we going to do?
[time=2946] What if we get there and they don't have those things?" Because they've been known to forget things in the past.
[time=2950] So we went to the store and we bought everything needed for the party.
[time=2953] All the paper and all the plastic, all the cups and drinks and everything like that.
[time=2958] Had it in the truck.
[time=2959] And we went to the party.
[time=2961] And lo and behold, that person had remembered things.
[time=2963] So we had planned for it, but when we got there, the plan had worked out so we left everything
[time=2969] in the truck.
[time=2970] Okay?
[time=2971] And so when you plan for your future, yes, plan for your future.
[time=2974] Look out tomorrow and next week and next month and next year.
[time=2978] But understand God might change your plan and you've got to be okay with that.
[time=2983] Because ultimately, He's running the show anyways, right?
[time=2988] Plan for the future, but live for today.
[time=2990] We spend too much time focused and worried on tomorrow.
[time=2994] We lose the joy of this day.
[time=2998] That's what Jesus is telling us there.
[time=3004] Maybe you need to task a moment about who controls your future.
[time=3009] Maybe right now you're sitting here saying, "I'm controlling my future.
[time=3012] I've got it planned out.
[time=3013] I've got the book.
[time=3014] I've got the map.
[time=3015] I've got the charts and the graphs.
[time=3016] And this is what's going to happen.
[time=3017] And maybe we need to slide it over and say, "You know what?
[time=3020] I'm going to let God plan my future.
[time=3022] I'm going to put in the work and all that stuff and if He changes my heart or changes in my direction, I'm going to be okay with that." Maybe you need to task a moment about your future.
[time=3033] I don't know.
[time=3038] We don't know what the future holds but we know who holds the future.
[time=3041] There's a note on your notes that says, "Place your tomorrow's in the hands of the one who
[time=3047] is already there," and we know that God is already there waiting for us.
[time=3053] So what is our vision for the future?
[time=3055] Well, Matthew 6 teaches us that our Lord desires that we live a life free of anxiety because He's got us.
[time=3062] Let us not do His job.
[time=3065] Let God be God.
[time=3068] He also teaches us that we need to rely on God's promised revisions, not our own.
[time=3073] And when we force the issue that we are going to be doing this, then we're missing out on His blessing.
[time=3079] We need to let God provide for us.
[time=3084] We must maintain a God-focused passion.
[time=3087] Jesus said, "Seek first His kingdom." That should be our priority one, seeking first the kingdom of God.
[time=3096] And then we need to plan for tomorrow but live today.
[time=3100] Put those plans out there but live today and take care of the things that are on our plate today.
[time=3105] And we can do all that.
[time=3107] You know why we can do all that?
[time=3109] Because our heavenly Father is faithful.
[time=3112] He is trustworthy.
[time=3113] He is a good, good Father.
[time=3117] Listen to the words of this song that we'll be singing shortly.
[time=3121] I've seen many searching for answers far and wide but I know we're all searching for answers
[time=3127] only you can provide because you know just what we need before we say a word.
[time=3134] You're a good, good Father.
[time=3136] It's who you are.
[time=3138] And I'm loved by you.
[time=3140] That's who I am.
[time=3143] My tassel moment, just got to let God be God.
[time=3149] Just got to let God be God.
[time=3151] That's why at Blackhawk, we believe that this is the inspired Word of God.
[time=3157] It's not part of His Word, some of His Word or that it contains His Word but that it is simply a complete inspired in the original writings Word of God.
[time=3168] And we're committed to teaching this.
[time=3171] We are committed to teaching this, not a subset of this, not a different parallel this.
[time=3179] We will unswervingly follow Jesus at Blackhawk.
[time=3183] And at Blackhawk, we will forever stand firm on the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=3192] That's what our future looks like.
[time=3195] What does our future look like?
[time=3197] It looks a lot like the day Jesus sat on the mountain and shared with the people.
[time=3203] We're going to teach His Word, we're going to follow Jesus and we are going to preach the gospel and stand firm on that.
[time=3211] That's our vision for the future.
[time=3214] No matter what comes, how God plays it out, how God works it out.
[time=3218] What happens on this stage?
[time=3223] We are going to teach the Bible, follow Jesus, stand firm on the gospel.
[time=3242] Oh, I heard a thousand stories of what they think you're like, but I heard the tender
[time=3259] whisper of love, the dead of night and you tell me that you're pleased and that I never
[time=3272] know what you're like, what you're like, what you're like, what you're like, what you
