[time=313] Thank you so much for watching today.
[time=318] We truly value you taking time to tune in each and every week.
[time=322] What we are all about here at Black Hawk Ministries is just sharing the good news of Jesus.
[time=327] That is exactly what you are going to find today as we look at God's Word.
[time=331] We are going to be talking more about vision and how God does have a vision for you.
[time=336] Not just for His church, not just for all the different pieces of what is going on here at Black Hawk Ministries, but for you and for me individually.
[time=344] If you know Jesus, you are the church.
[time=346] Today we are going to be in the book of Leviticus.
[time=348] Maybe a while since you have heard a sermon from Leviticus, but I am really excited about what God has revealed through His Word, and Jesus is in every book of the Bible.
[time=358] Think about that.
[time=359] Even before He came onto the scene, He was in every single book.
[time=363] I am looking forward to uncovering some truth and discovering what God's vision can look like for you when it comes to burning out.
[time=370] Do you ever get burned out?
[time=371] Do you ever feel like you had a vision?
[time=373] You had a plan?
[time=374] You were going for it?
[time=375] You were all in, but then you just got tired.
[time=377] You just got burned out.
[time=379] You just ran out of gas.
[time=380] Well, today we are going to look at how to keep that light burning, to keep the passion going.
[time=385] I am truly excited to see what God is going to do in your life.
[time=388] No matter what God is doing in your life, we want to connect with you here at Black Hawk and just walk alongside of you and just be the church alongside of and with you as you journey through this thing we call life.

[time=465] Whoever lives and waits for me, my name is great and on his hands.
[time=476] My name is Red and on his heart, I know that love in him he stands.
[time=487] No tongue can bend me and stay pong. No tongue can bend me and stay pong.
[time=500] You say sometimes he too despair and tells me of the guilt within.
[time=511] A word I look and see him there who made him into all my sin.
[time=522] Because the sin, the sin, your dad, my sinful soul is counted free.
[time=532] For God the just is satisfied to look on him and pardon me.
[time=542] To look on him and pardon me.
[time=550] Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise the one who is inside of God.
[time=570] He holds in there the risen land, a perfect spot near righteousness.
[time=581] The great unchangeable I am, the king of glory and the praise.
[time=591] One with himself I cannot die.
[time=596] My soul is heard and sigh his love, my life is here with Christ on high.
[time=607] With Christ my Savior and my God.
[time=620] Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise the one who is inside of God.
[time=743] Good morning, Black Hawk family.
[time=759] It's good to be back with you.
[time=761] I want to thank Rich to Vernier executive pastor for delivering a great message last Sunday as we're continuing to look at vision.
[time=768] If you're a guest with us, sit back and relax, just know that you are among family today.
[time=773] It's been a great day.
[time=774] Has it not seen the little kids be baptized?
[time=777] And what great beautiful picture that is of what the gospel is all about.
[time=782] So can we celebrate what God's done already?
[time=784] Absolutely.
[time=788] Well today I want to thank our worship team too.
[time=790] Aren't these guys doing a wonderful job leading us particularly?
[time=793] Yeah, let's thank them.
[time=796] They show up while you're still trying to get out of bed and everybody behind the scenes here is working very hard to just point people to Jesus as best we know how.
[time=804] And so thank you last week as well for helping me honor Darren McCown so well.
[time=808] And so I want to thank Chris and Jonathan and the team for leading us for now.
[time=812] We're excited about where that's going.
[time=814] I wanted to share that with you as I know you've had questions.
[time=816] We've got Chip Clark.
[time=818] Many of you may remember Chip Clark.
[time=820] He is a mission partner of ours through Youth for Christ and City Life, an inner city organization that ministers to kids.
[time=827] And he is going to come for the month of July.
[time=829] I agree just to help us out during this time of transition as we're searching for what God's going to do next in our worship ministry.
[time=835] So I want you to know that.
[time=836] And in the meantime we've got some amazing leadership.
[time=838] Do we not?
[time=839] They're leading the way and pointing us to Jesus.
[time=841] Thank God.
[time=842] It's all about the gospel no matter what we do here at Black Hawk.
[time=845] Speaking of that we're in a series looking at just simply vision.
[time=848] Somebody say vision.
[time=850] You need some.
[time=852] And God has one for you.
[time=854] That's what we've been looking at.
[time=855] We started a few weeks ago just looking at the fact that God has a vision for Black Hawk.
[time=860] We laid all of those things out as far as the buildings, the expansions and those types of things.
[time=865] It's a big part of our vision.
[time=867] But it's a small part of our vision because God's vision for his church.
[time=872] And if you've been around me long enough, who's the church?
[time=875] You're the church.
[time=877] God's vision for the church.
[time=879] So therefore God's vision for you is huge.
[time=882] And that's what we're looking at today.
[time=884] Today I want us to look at a foundation for our vision.
[time=887] Vision for my foundation.
[time=889] We all want a vision that's going to last.
[time=891] So we're coming off of last week looking at vision for my future.
[time=894] Where do I go from now?
[time=895] We celebrated graduates and no doubt you have things about your future that seem uncertain.
[time=900] But I'll tell you you cannot get there.
[time=902] Whatever God is stirring in your heart.
[time=904] You won't be able to get there and get there God's way without the right kind of foundation.
[time=909] Without the right kind of lasting fuel to help you get to where God is taking you.
[time=914] Luckily for us, and I don't believe in luck by the way, blessed as we are.
[time=918] God has given us all of the fuel, all the things that we truly need.
[time=923] So let me ask you two questions to start things off today.
[time=927] When is the last time you've heard a sermon from Leviticus?
[time=932] Well I want to ask you to turn to the book of Leviticus.
[time=935] Leviticus chapter number 20, yes I'm serious.
[time=937] Leviticus chapter 24.
[time=939] Yes that is in your Bible.
[time=941] Yes I promise it's there.
[time=942] It's a big part of the scriptures and so it's been a while since I've heard one.
[time=946] But today I want us to look at Leviticus chapter 24.
[time=948] We're going to look at the first four verses and I can't wait to share with you what God's laid on my heart when it comes to this idea of building a foundation.
[time=956] Having a light that's going to last and burn brightly.
[time=960] So that's what we will look at today in Leviticus 24.
[time=963] Here's the second question.
[time=965] The second question is have you ever struggled with burning out?
[time=971] That happens doesn't it?
[time=973] You get a vision for your life.
[time=974] You get a vision for what God's trying to do.
[time=976] You get an idea.
[time=977] That's what vision really is.
[time=978] It's just a big picture that you arrange all the little small pieces around to try to achieve.
[time=983] Right God put something on your heart.
[time=985] Maybe it's a vision to lose weight.
[time=987] Can I get a name in?
[time=988] And you go a whole day and you don't eat any sweets.
[time=991] And then the next day is just one of those days.
[time=994] You laugh because you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[time=997] I've been there with you my friends.
[time=998] I struggle with that too.
[time=1000] But you get a vision for something like that or maybe it's something spiritually.
[time=1003] And you know that you want to dig into the Word.
[time=1005] Maybe you just want to try to connect with God.
[time=1007] Maybe you're here today and you feel very disconnected from God.
[time=1010] Maybe you don't even like the church but you just came because God prompted something in you or maybe somebody just simply invited you.
[time=1016] You're not even sure how you feel about this Jesus that we talk about.
[time=1020] But you set forth with a vision to go try and find it.
[time=1023] But then things happen.
[time=1024] Life gets in the way.
[time=1026] You try to take a next step.
[time=1028] You get two steps forward and what happens?
[time=1030] Three steps back.
[time=1032] And it feels like you burn out and you run out of energy.
[time=1035] You run out of fuel.
[time=1036] That's what I want to talk about because you say, well, why is Leviticus and vision and burn out all related?
[time=1042] How does that relate to vision?
[time=1043] It's because if we don't have a foundation that's firm, then no vision that we pursue is ever going to last.
[time=1050] We know that, don't we?
[time=1051] Because we tried it and we've seen our visions.
[time=1054] We've seen the plans that we make fail.
[time=1057] Can I get a name in?
[time=1058] I hope you'll be encouraged.
[time=1059] That was really discouraging.
[time=1060] But let's look at Leviticus for some encouragement.
[time=1063] Now, Leviticus 24.
[time=1064] I want to read the first four verses.
[time=1066] Who's ready for the Word today?
[time=1068] Alright, verse number one, Leviticus chapter 24.
[time=1073] The Lord spoke to Moses saying, "Command the people of Israel to bring you pure oil from beaten olives for the lamp." Somebody say lamp.
[time=1084] That a light may be kept burning regularly.
[time=1090] Verse three, "Outside the veil of the testimony and the tent of meeting Aaron shall arrange it from evening to morning before the Lord regularly.
[time=1098] It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.
[time=1103] He shall arrange the lamps on the lampstand of pure gold before the Lord." What?
[time=1108] Regularly.
[time=1110] You notice the theme in that.
[time=1111] And if you want to write down Exodus chapter 27, we won't turn there.
[time=1114] It's a mirror of this passage, the same account.
[time=1117] And it is exactly to the tea, the same things that we see there.
[time=1121] What's happening here is God is telling the people of Israel about how to build this place, a tent of meeting where God's presence would come and meet with His people.
[time=1130] They have just been delivered from bondage, delivered from slavery in Egypt.
[time=1134] The Ten Commandments have already been given.
[time=1136] And now God's helping them learn what it means to live in freedom.
[time=1140] I'll get there in a minute.
[time=1141] So as he's doing that, he says, "Build this place.
[time=1143] It's over 11,000 square feet." It's the tabernacle.
[time=1146] Maybe you've heard of that in the Old Testament.
[time=1148] That's why we're here in Leviticus.
[time=1150] But there's some things there that I know I've skipped over that just grabbed me as I studied this passage today when it comes to burning out, when it comes to a light that actually lasts.
[time=1160] A light that makes the kind of difference that I know God wants it to do.
[time=1164] So the curtain that's there, if you're not familiar with the temple, they had this curtain that separated the holy of holies, or the ark of the covenant.
[time=1172] That's the testimony that we're talking about here.
[time=1174] And it would separate the presence of God.
[time=1176] The ark of the covenant had the Ten Commandments, the holy of holies, that testimony spy.
[time=1181] That's what even in the future temples it would always be separated because that represented the very presence of God.
[time=1187] And you couldn't even walk in there unless you were priests.
[time=1190] That's why Aaron was to do some of these things because the priests represented God to the people and the people to God.
[time=1196] And so that's what they're building.
[time=1198] They're getting the instructions for how to do that.
[time=1200] And now you are saying, "What does that have to do with me?" And I'll tell you what I believe it has to do with you.
[time=1207] I think, I believe, I know.
[time=1209] There's a message that's directly linked to the building of this temple, this light, this lamp that was to keep burning, and your pursuit of longevity, of a foundation that lasts when it comes to the vision God has for your life.
[time=1223] There's a direct connection here, and I want us to look at that and even see how Jesus is even in the book of Leviticus.
[time=1230] Three things stood out to me.
[time=1232] When I read this, I underlined them in my Bible.
[time=1234] The first is pure oil.
[time=1235] Maybe you underlined it in yours as well.
[time=1237] Maybe make a note of that.
[time=1238] Pure oil.
[time=1239] We're going to revisit all three of these things.
[time=1241] Beaten olives.
[time=1242] Any olive fans in the building?
[time=1244] I hate olives.
[time=1246] Ugh.
[time=1247] Yeah, I know.
[time=1248] Yeah, I just can't do it.
[time=1250] I can't do it.
[time=1251] I just can't even eat those things, but they're good in this passage.
[time=1253] And so we're going to learn some things about them.
[time=1255] Beaten olives kept burning.
[time=1257] Underlined those words, too.
[time=1258] Kept burning.
[time=1259] Pure oil.
[time=1260] Beaten olives kept burning.
[time=1262] All three of those things really point us to this idea of having a lasting light.
[time=1267] And so that's really the bottom line.
[time=1268] If you're taking notes today, we always have notes available for you here.
[time=1272] You can do it on our church app.
[time=1273] If you're watching us online as a part of our extended family, there's notes there as you watch us live.
[time=1278] You can fill those in.
[time=1279] We welcome you and we're glad to have you as a part of the big Black Hawk family that we know and love here.
[time=1284] The bottom line is this.
[time=1285] That lasting vision takes the right light.
[time=1292] That's what was going on here in the building of this tent of meeting where God's presence would come and meet with his people.
[time=1299] I love this idea of light because back in Genesis 1, Genesis 1, 3 through 4, you don't have to turn there, but Genesis 1, 3 through 4, light is the first thing God created.
[time=1308] God said, let there be.
[time=1310] Let there be light.
[time=1312] So light is what starts the Word of God.
[time=1314] And in Revelation chapter 22 and verse 5, we see that darkness will be forever eliminated by the living light of God known as Jesus Christ.
[time=1323] So it starts with darkness.
[time=1325] God creates light.
[time=1326] That same light forever will eliminate darkness at the end of the book.
[time=1331] If you read the end, if you haven't, you should.
[time=1333] He wins.
[time=1334] And I want to be on his team.
[time=1336] But light is the beginning and the end of this book.
[time=1339] And in between the beginning and the end, Genesis and Revelation, this theme of light is referenced over 200 times in the Word of God.
[time=1348] Interesting stuff.
[time=1349] And so I believe that the right light is important.
[time=1352] And so today, when you think about light for us, how many of you take selfies?
[time=1357] Right?
[time=1358] You're not going to raise your hand for sure, but you did this morning, most likely.
[time=1361] We all know.
[time=1362] But the right light is important, isn't it?
[time=1364] If you're taking a picture, if you're taking a selfie, if you're a photographer, the light surrounding what you're photographing, photographing, whatever the word is for that, the light that surrounds the picture is just as important as what you're photographing.
[time=1378] Is that not true?
[time=1379] Right?
[time=1380] Because you know, because you hold it up and you look at it and you see that picture that you got.
[time=1384] It's just the right light.
[time=1385] And it makes you look a little more trim, little more built than you usually do.
[time=1390] And you post that bad boy.
[time=1392] Then you take some sometimes and the light's just bad.
[time=1394] It kind of makes you, you know, and you go, can I get a filter?
[time=1399] Can I get a filter and you have these light filters and you plug those things in?
[time=1403] The light is important.
[time=1405] And that's what we're going to look at today.
[time=1406] I think that's what this passage points us to.
[time=1408] It's not just about selfies.
[time=1410] It's even about our spiritual walk.
[time=1412] It's even about the vision that God has for our heart and our life.
[time=1417] But a lot of times we burn out, don't we?
[time=1419] That light isn't quite as bright as it used to be.
[time=1422] We maybe rely on the wrong kinds of lights and burn out, really, it's more of a product not of how long you've lived but how you're living is what I've learned.
[time=1431] It's not about how long I've been at it, how long I've been trying.
[time=1434] It's about how I'm trying.
[time=1435] It's about how I'm going, about pursuing the vision that God has for my life.
[time=1439] And the vision I read a description of burn out.
[time=1441] When it comes to burn out, here's a good one for you.
[time=1443] It's when the demands placed on you exceed the resources available to you.
[time=1449] Pretty good, huh?
[time=1451] You ever been there?
[time=1452] Some of you are there right now, right?
[time=1454] Can I get an amen?
[time=1455] We've all been in those shoes.
[time=1457] But there's this direct connection, I believe, in how Jesus is going to teach us and how God was teaching the Israelites.
[time=1464] They had just come from bondage in Egypt.
[time=1467] But here's a statement I want you to think about that applied to those coming from bondage into freedom, the Israelites, and also for you, and for me, and the statement is that being set free and living in freedom are two very different things.
[time=1481] Did you know that you can be set free spiritually but still choose to live in bondage?
[time=1489] Did you know that you can be set free spiritually?
[time=1492] You can know Jesus, you can have eternal life because you've got a personal relationship with God through his son Jesus.
[time=1498] But you can look at things in the wrong light even though the right light exists and it's there and it's even inside of you is what we're going to look at today.
[time=1506] But you can still live in such a way that feels like you're dragging a ball and chain.
[time=1511] You can burn out.
[time=1514] Is it true?
[time=1515] Ever been there?
[time=1516] I know I have many, many times.
[time=1518] So today I want to talk about this freedom fuel that we see here.
[time=1521] It came from the olives.
[time=1522] It's really all about freedom fuel and how we can live in freedom.
[time=1525] Two things I want to share with you about this fuel that I believe is going to fuel the right kind of light in our lives so that the vision, the passion of God burns brightly and it burns regularly and it's kept burning for you and for me and for our church.
[time=1540] The first thing is this.
[time=1542] If you're taking notes, it's fuel from the right source.
[time=1546] Fuel from the right source.
[time=1549] So many times I think we get burned out because we just use the wrong fuel.
[time=1554] We look to the wrong sources to fuel us, to keep us moving, to keep us focused.
[time=1558] We have, if you know Jesus today, if you don't, I'm going to introduce you to him and you've already been introduced to him and he's already working inside your heart just so you know my agenda is always clear every week that the gospel is clear.
[time=1570] I can't save you but he can and he wants to.
[time=1573] If you don't know him today, step out.
[time=1576] The rest of the sermon, you know what, it's nowhere near as important as that decision.
[time=1579] If you need to go get that right, it's as simple as we make it.
[time=1582] If not, I'll walk you through that in just a few minutes.
[time=1584] But if you do know Jesus, if you do know Jesus today, I want you to know that you've got the right source.
[time=1592] You have fuel that will last.
[time=1595] You have fuel that will ignite a fire that will burn much brighter, much longer, much stronger than whatever it is that is facing you today.
[time=1605] If I were to ask you, what's been putting out your fire lately?
[time=1609] What's been robbing your joy?
[time=1614] What would your answer be?
[time=1615] Don't say it out loud.
[time=1616] Maybe you jot it down, just have a mental note of it and listen to the rest of what I want to talk about today in light of what your answer was to this need that you maybe have in your life.
[time=1625] And as God's child, the demands on you can never think about this.
[time=1629] The demands on you can never exceed the resources available to you.
[time=1634] A lot of times we say, oh, that'll preach, but I don't believe it.
[time=1638] I don't believe it.
[time=1639] It doesn't fill that way right now, but it is true.
[time=1642] A lot of times people will say that God will never put more on you than you can bear.
[time=1646] Have you ever heard that?
[time=1647] Maybe you still believe that.
[time=1648] Did you know that it's not in the Bible?
[time=1651] The passage that it's referring to simply tells us that we will never be tempted beyond what we are able to manage or make it through because of his strength, not us, because of what I just shared with you, the demands on me as a follower, a child of Jesus.
[time=1666] A child of the king will never exceed his ability, his resources to handle that.
[time=1672] But yes, you will go through times in your life where you will have more on you than you can bear.
[time=1677] But when you know Jesus, it's never more than he can bear.
[time=1680] There's a big difference.
[time=1681] Can I get an amen?
[time=1683] A lot of times that's one of the things I think that causes us to burn out.
[time=1687] We think, well, God won't put it on me if I can't handle it.
[time=1689] Well, yeah, you will.
[time=1691] There have been a lot of times I've been flat on my back and I couldn't handle a situation.
[time=1695] And I had to throw my hands up, hit my knees and say, Jesus, this is yours.
[time=1699] Jesus, take the wheel.
[time=1700] Amen?
[time=1701] You drive.
[time=1702] I'm just going to ride.
[time=1703] I don't know what to do, but it's in those moments.
[time=1705] It's in those times that his glory, his resources, we see to be something so much bigger than the demands placed on us by our situations.
[time=1715] That's how our light can truly burn.
[time=1717] Maybe you've been trying to plug into your own source.
[time=1720] Maybe you've been the source of fuel for the light in your life.
[time=1723] Maybe some other person has been the source of fuel for the light and the relationships in your life.
[time=1729] Maybe it's time to plug back into the right source today for some of you in sound of my voice today.
[time=1734] Maybe you're looking at your struggle in the wrong light.
[time=1737] It's like those pictures.
[time=1738] Maybe you're looking at your struggle through the lens, through the filter of the wrong kind of light.
[time=1743] Maybe God wants to illuminate things for you in a new way.
[time=1747] Did you know that unlimited resources, even these kind of resources, unlimited resources become useless if you can't see them?
[time=1756] We could have everything available to us to walk through the valley, the problems that we're facing.
[time=1763] But if we can't see the resources, then we feel alone.
[time=1767] We feel discouraged.
[time=1768] Well, maybe it's time today for the light switch to be flipped.
[time=1772] Maybe it's time to illuminate some things in your life to see what you truly have available to you.
[time=1778] And so I love in this.
[time=1779] Let's go back to the tabernacle here.
[time=1781] I love in this story.
[time=1782] One of the terms for the tabernacle that they were building is a place of promised presence.
[time=1788] I love that.
[time=1789] Write that down if you're taking notes.
[time=1790] A place of promised presence.
[time=1792] Why?
[time=1793] It's because God promised to come and meet with His people to meet them there, and it was done around a place in this day and time as we read here in Leviticus and you look at Exodus 27, it's the place driven kind of thing.
[time=1807] You know, we don't do that anymore, do we?
[time=1809] Why is it that we don't do that?
[time=1810] We don't do it surrounding a place.
[time=1812] You say, "Well, we're at church, but I don't have to pray to a priest." A lot of you may still think that you've got to do that.
[time=1818] I can pray directly to God.
[time=1820] You know why?
[time=1821] Because that veil, you remember the curtain in the temple?
[time=1823] That veil that divided what was known as the presence of God and blocked that off from the normal average person like you and me when Jesus died on the cross, when He breathed His last breath, that curtain was torn in two, not just from bottom to top, but from top to bottom because it symbolized God coming down to us and meeting us where we are in this low place, He ripped that barrier between His presence and His people so that we could boldly approach the throne of God.
[time=1854] Do you feel like you've got a good source of light yet?
[time=1856] You can boldly approach the throne of God and you're called as a follower of Jesus, a child of the king.
[time=1864] You're called a royal priesthood.
[time=1867] Yes, you.
[time=1869] Yes, her.
[time=1871] Yes, Him.
[time=1873] Yes, that person you're sitting with and wanting to elbow right now.
[time=1877] You're a royal priesthood and a holy nation.
[time=1882] We have the right source available to us, but sometimes we blind ourselves to be able to see it.
[time=1889] And another thing I love in this passage is God told Moses, tell the people, look at that.
[time=1893] Tell the people to bring the olives, the oil.
[time=1897] Remember that?
[time=1898] Tell the people, not the priests.
[time=1900] He said, tell the people.
[time=1901] Already we see Jesus in this passage and Jesus has never been mentioned by name at this point, but Jesus is here because He says, tell the people to bring the resources, to bring the fuel for the light.
[time=1913] Did you know that you have the right source and it's your responsibility to be what I call a self feeder.
[time=1918] Somebody say self feeder.
[time=1921] Self feeder.
[time=1922] Look at somebody say you're a self feeder.
[time=1926] They didn't look very convinced yet, but I'm going to convince you.
[time=1929] I love in this passage because a lot of times we come to church and we'll say things like, I'm going to rely on that preacher.
[time=1935] Hopefully he'll fill me up today.
[time=1937] I want you to know it's not my job to light the fire in your life.
[time=1942] I want you to know I'm going to poke you.
[time=1944] I'm going to poke the bear.
[time=1945] I'm going to prod you.
[time=1946] I hope to inspire you, but all I can do as your pastor is point you to Jesus and I want to challenge you just as Moses told the people to go get the fuel for the fire.
[time=1957] Your job during the week, your responsibility during the week is to be a self feeder plugging into the throne room of God because again, you can boldly approach the throne on your own, plug into scripture on your own and I'm going to come and I'm going to inspire and I'm going to poke you and I'm going to prod you and I hope I can send you out.
[time=1974] We can go out as an army together, but that will hear me.
[time=1977] That will never ever happen if we don't have a church full of people who are just like these people going and getting their own fuel, stoking their own fires and keeping it kindled and burning every single day in your life.
[time=1991] That's how we be the church.
[time=1994] I often say, I'm not just called to go to church, I'm called to be the church.
[time=1998] We come together to celebrate how the church is being the church and to come together to worship and pour out our hearts to God and to share the gospel and see people come to know Jesus in this place because it's a doorway to the kingdom of God just so that we can be sent out to go be something that's better and greater and more eternal than anything this world and this life can lay at your feet.
[time=2019] That's what we do.
[time=2021] We're here to learn to be the church.
[time=2024] So that's my challenge to you.
[time=2025] Find ways to be a self feeder.
[time=2027] Maybe you need to download the Bible app.
[time=2029] I've mentioned it in times in the past.
[time=2031] Read scripture.
[time=2032] Write that down if you need a good app.
[time=2033] I had that mentioned to me by one of the melee clan around here a while back and several of you downloaded it.
[time=2038] The last time I mentioned it.
[time=2039] Read scripture app has great plans there.
[time=2041] There's so many more out there.
[time=2043] Find one.
[time=2044] Dig into that.
[time=2045] Be a self feeder this week.
[time=2046] Flip over to the New Testament.
[time=2047] We're moving from Leviticus now.
[time=2049] Now I want us to see how Jesus is even in Leviticus.
[time=2051] Look at Matthew chapter six.
[time=2053] You were there last week if you were here.
[time=2055] But I'm going to read a few verses prior to the passage you looked at last Sunday.
[time=2059] Matthew chapter six verse 22 and 23.
[time=2065] And in verses 19 through 21 you may be familiar with this passage where it says I'll read it to you while you find verse 22.
[time=2071] Verse 19 of Matthew six.
[time=2073] Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroyed where thieves break in and still but lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven where neither moss nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and still for where your treasure is there your heart will be also.
[time=2089] I want you to know the context of the next two verses.
[time=2092] I love that the context verses 19 through 21 really point us to a lasting eternal mindset.
[time=2098] Is it not?
[time=2099] Well your treasure is there your heart will be but he's talking about laying up for yourselves treasure for eternity.
[time=2105] Living in light of eternity is what Jesus is talking about.
[time=2108] These are red letters Jesus is saying them.
[time=2110] But then he follows that up with some interesting verses about light.
[time=2114] Some interesting verses about a lamp.
[time=2116] And I want to tie that to what we've just read in Leviticus chapter 24 and Exodus chapter 27.
[time=2123] Read that with me verse 22.
[time=2125] The eye is the what?
[time=2127] The lamp.
[time=2128] The eye is the lamp of the body.
[time=2130] So if your eye is healthy your whole body will be full of light.
[time=2134] Now the eye of the body really is more what we would look at is like your heart is your soul is sure.
[time=2139] It's the internal workings of your spirit that Jesus wants to minister to Jesus always went straight for the heart.
[time=2145] And so if that sees clearly everything else starts to look a little bit differently is what Jesus is sharing.
[time=2150] Verse 23.
[time=2151] But if your eye is bad your whole body will be full of darkness.
[time=2155] And then underline this if then the light in you.
[time=2160] The light in you we're coming back there in just a moment is darkness.
[time=2164] How great is the darkness?
[time=2167] Have you ever said how great is the darkness?
[time=2170] Ever felt like you got out of bed and everything was against you before you even got started and even though the sun was up it was pretty dark in the light of your life around you.
[time=2179] Well maybe that's where you're at and maybe God wants to illuminate some new things here.
[time=2183] Jesus is in this passage.
[time=2185] Jesus is in Exodus.
[time=2186] Jesus is in Leviticus.
[time=2188] And he's referencing those types of things.
[time=2190] Have you ever noticed how Jesus took things?
[time=2193] Think about this.
[time=2194] There were external.
[time=2195] The lamp in Leviticus chapter 24 was an external lamp.
[time=2198] He set it up around the presence of God so you can see it.
[time=2201] It was tied to a place.
[time=2203] Jesus took something that was external and made it internal.
[time=2206] He took external things, made it internal.
[time=2209] He took the presence of God that was illuminated because it was tied to a place and he made it an internal thing that becomes a part of our person.
[time=2218] It was a place of promised presence in Leviticus.
[time=2221] Jesus says when I enter the picture, the presence of God is not a place of promised presence.
[time=2227] He said when I enter the picture, you become a person of promised presence.
[time=2233] Inside of you lies the presence of God.
[time=2239] Let that sink in for a minute because some of you still don't believe that that can be possible in your life.
[time=2245] When Jesus entered the picture, he took things from external a place, made them internal about a person.
[time=2252] Now you can experience the presence of God living inside of you through his Holy Spirit.
[time=2258] That's why Jesus later on was telling his disciples when he said I'm going to die and I'm going to leave.
[time=2262] That's why he said it's better for you that I go away.
[time=2265] Why?
[time=2266] That the promised Holy Spirit can come.
[time=2269] The comforter can come and he can teach you and admonish you and convict you and walk with you.
[time=2274] He's saying it's better for me.
[time=2275] I'm tied to a place and I'm ending this season where the presence of God was tied to a place and I'm making it available to you as a person.
[time=2284] That's what Jesus does.
[time=2285] That's what the gospel is truly all about.
[time=2288] That's what Jesus did in Matthew chapter 6.
[time=2291] I love that picture of it going from outside to inside.
[time=2294] In Matthew chapter 23, the light in you is something that becomes something that's internalized inside of you.
[time=2301] Have you ever noticed that a lot of times it becomes very difficult to meet with God when you've lost yourself?
[time=2307] You've lost your vision.
[time=2311] When we lose the fire of our passion, it becomes difficult to locate the presence of God.
[time=2317] Have you ever noticed that God's there?
[time=2319] We know he'll never leave for sake but when the light goes out, it becomes harder and harder to find the presence of God and I'm convinced that somebody is leaving this place today and there's going to be a new fire illuminated inside of you today where you're going to see things, have things illuminated that you haven't noticed before, not just in the book of Leviticus but in your life and the plans that God has for you.
[time=2342] Everybody look at me for a minute.
[time=2343] I want you to know something.
[time=2344] Some of you came today to hear this.
[time=2346] You can't see it perhaps right now because maybe your light is kind of dim.
[time=2350] But God is not through with you.
[time=2353] God is not finished with you.
[time=2356] God has not given up on you.
[time=2359] God knows the struggles that you have in your life.
[time=2362] He knows the messes that you have made, the messes that other people have made and in the midst of the mess, he has a message for you.
[time=2370] In the middle of the test that you find yourself in, there's a testimony that God wants to illuminate and bring out.
[time=2376] God is not finished with you.
[time=2380] He's just getting started.
[time=2383] It takes us plugging into the fuel from the right source.
[time=2386] But when we do that, the second thing is we end up with fuel for every season.
[time=2392] Fuel for every season.
[time=2394] When we get to the right source, we see that no matter what we're facing, we've got the right kind of fuel.
[time=2399] We've got the right kind of light.
[time=2401] And regardless of our season, we know that we can still burn.
[time=2405] We know that we can make it.
[time=2407] We know that God's not finished with us yet.
[time=2409] I told you about the words kept burning.
[time=2411] How that just grabbed me, kept burning.
[time=2413] Keep the light burning surrounding the presence of God at this tabernacle, at this tent of meeting, at this place of promised presence.
[time=2420] But God wants the same thing to happen in us.
[time=2422] He wants the light to continue burning.
[time=2425] He says, "Bring pure oil from beaten olives." Those are the other things.
[time=2429] I want us to look at those.
[time=2431] I truly believe that in our lowest moments, I love that word "beaten olives." We're going to look at that process of making pure oil here in just a moment.
[time=2439] But to have pure oil, it's got to come from olives that have been beaten, that have been crushed very intentionally.
[time=2446] In your life, in your life where you sit right now, whatever you thought of, that question a few moments ago, that steals your joy, that dims your light, the growth that is going to be the most powerful, amazing, God-centered growth in your life is often going to come from your most beaten, low moments.
[time=2465] God's often going to have to lead you through the valley, the times where you feel beaten down to bring out the pure oil of his vision and his plan in your life.
[time=2474] And so don't discount the season that you're in now as a wasted season, no matter what season that may mean for you today because God's working and he's just getting started in the midst of that very season.
[time=2486] I've said before that your most fun seasons won't always be your most fruitful seasons and your most fruitful seasons won't always be your most fun seasons.
[time=2495] Do you ever notice that?
[time=2497] The seasons that bring about the best results, the most fruit, aren't always the most fun, but God can use even those kinds of things.
[time=2505] I love him Philippians 4-8.
[time=2507] Paul reminds us, he simply says, whatever is pure, whatever, and he gives this list of things, but I love whatever is pure, meditate, think on these things.
[time=2518] And I've learned in my life that the quality of the joy I live in will never exceed the purity of the thoughts that I'm thinking.
[time=2525] The quality of the joy that I live in, that I walk out is never going to exceed the purity of my thoughts.
[time=2531] And I don't always think very purely, but I have the right fuel, I have the right source to illuminate things because of the source that is Jesus, not Kevin, to be able to see things God's way, to be able to walk through the valleys that I don't feel I can walk through.
[time=2547] Oil in the Bible, I love this as well.
[time=2549] If you look at oil, it always represents the presence of God.
[time=2552] It represents his Holy Spirit.
[time=2555] And it's pure oil that they had to go and get.
[time=2558] It does matter what you put in your motor.
[time=2560] If you ever put diesel fuel in your gasoline motor, I did that one time, it didn't work really well.
[time=2567] It's pretty costly.
[time=2568] You don't want to do that, do you?
[time=2570] You know, there was a youth pastor from years ago who would always make brownies with the youth ministry.
[time=2576] And those brownies that would be good brownies, he'd give them out, the kids would eat some brownies, but there would always not be enough of them for everybody.
[time=2583] And then he'd bring out, he says, "Okay, I've got some more." And they already start getting into the brownies and digging in.
[time=2589] He'd say, "No, no, no, no, no, before you do that, I just want you to know the ingredients." They're not that different than the other brownies.
[time=2594] I know those were so good.
[time=2596] Hershey's gooey chocolate fudge.
[time=2598] Oh, it's great, I know.
[time=2600] This one I put just a little, I just got a little teaspoon of cow manure, and I mixed it in.
[time=2605] But you probably won't taste it.
[time=2607] It's just a little.
[time=2608] How many of those brownies do you think went missing?
[time=2611] A tiny little bit of impurity as an ingredient ruins the whole
[time=2617] batch so many times.
[time=2618] If you ever had that happen, this one tiny little ingredient, this one tiny little fault that keeps popping into your mind, keeps still in your joy, keeps dimming your light and causing you to burn out.
[time=2628] Just like the quality of my joy will never exceed the purity of my thoughts.
[time=2632] The thoughts, just like these brownies, that one tiny ingredient, the quality of those ingredients are going to determine the quality, the goodness, the direction of how those brownies are going to be consumed.
[time=2645] Consider what you're putting in when it comes to that pure oil in your own life.
[time=2650] And I believe this, when you look at this passage here, you'll look at the process, if you will, of making the oil, and you can't have lasting light, there's a reason he said bring pure oil.
[time=2659] That's the first thing you remember I had you underline, pure oil.
[time=2662] You can't have lasting light without pure oil, and you can't have pure oil without beaten olives.
[time=2669] Here's why.
[time=2670] To press olives back in the day they'd take a basket.
[time=2673] They would always use a basket.
[time=2675] And they would by hand they'd press the olives in the basket.
[time=2679] Pure oil is defined as oil that does not have the pulp of the olives.
[time=2684] Some of you like those.
[time=2686] But they'd hand press.
[time=2688] It took a lot more time to get pure oil, because in the basket they'd press the olives.
[time=2693] The pulp would stay in the basket, but the pure oil would drip from the bottom of the basket and into a jar.
[time=2700] That's how they would get pure oil in that day and time.
[time=2705] It's interesting to me that I think about Jesus and his most pressed moment, his darkest moment in the garden of guest symphony, also known as the Mount of olives.
[time=2715] When he was about to be pressed there, he prayed to the father.
[time=2719] I love that picture of who Jesus was.
[time=2721] He knew that he had to be pressed.
[time=2724] That's why he said, "Father, it's not my will, but yours that I won't done in your life." Isaiah 61 and verse 2 talks about having the oil of joy.
[time=2733] You see oil all throughout Scripture.
[time=2735] The oil of joy.
[time=2736] I want to remind some of you here that are here today.
[time=2738] You're expecting this big downpour of the oil of joy in your life.
[time=2741] Sometimes the oil of joy is going to be a drip.
[time=2745] Not a downpour.
[time=2747] You take a drop at a time knowing it's from God and it fuels you to have your light burn and your light last and your vision continue even though there's not this downpour of feelings.
[time=2758] That's why faith is not about the feelings that come and go and go up and down, but it's about the fact of the Word of God and that Jesus is not finished with you yet.
[time=2768] He has a vision for your life.
[time=2771] I want to give you a take home statement when you think about that pure oil because in that basket the pulp would stay.
[time=2777] But the pulp wouldn't say the oil wouldn't be pure if the pulp made it into the jar of oil.
[time=2783] The basket caught all of the pulp.
[time=2785] You've got a lot of pulp in your life.
[time=2787] I've got a lot of pulp of a lot of imperfections in my life, but sometimes the season God has us in is just a time where God just wants to press by hand, walk you through by hand the season that you're in so that you can reach the most blessed season that maybe he wants to bring about.
[time=2804] Here's the statement you can take away.
[time=2806] Our most pressed seasons of life often become our most blessed seasons when we look at them in the right light of Jesus.
[time=2817] Paul said it this way.
[time=2818] 2 Corinthians chapter 4, you can jot that down.
[time=2820] 2 Corinthians chapter 4 verses 6 and 7.
[time=2823] Paul says for God who said let light, let light shine out of darkness.
[time=2829] He made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God's glory displayed in the face of Christ.
[time=2836] But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show this all surpassing power is from God, not from us.
[time=2844] Here's my favorite part when it comes to this oil and our pressed seasons becoming blessed seasons is we are hard pressed Paul says.
[time=2851] We're hard pressed on every side but not crushed.
[time=2856] We're perplexed but not in despair.
[time=2859] We are persecuted but not abandoned, struck down but not destroyed.
[time=2866] I'm going to ask you just to bow your heads and think about what it means to be pressed but not crushed.
[time=2874] If God's pressing you by hand right now, it's because he sees a pure, valuable, treasured oil on the inside of you.
[time=2883] You're so treasured, you're so valued that even in our most
[time=2889] pressed seasons, God wants to bless.
[time=2892] God wants to meet you where you are and if you don't know him today, he wants to save you where you sit.
[time=2898] He wants you to know how valuable you are to him.
[time=2903] If you know Jesus today and you're a believer, maybe you're in a time, a season of being pressed.
[time=2911] Maybe you feel like that beaten olive.
[time=2915] God's got some pure oil.
[time=2917] It's going to serve as fuel that comes from the right source and it will last through every single season that you face right now.
[time=2924] Whatever that means for you, whatever it means for you to have that lasting glad I pray you would just lay it at the feet of Jesus now.
[time=2930] But some of you don't know Jesus today.
[time=2932] Some of you would say, I would love to know that if I were to die today, then I would spend eternity in heaven with God because I have a personal relationship with Jesus.
[time=2943] You would love to be able to say that perhaps, but maybe you would look at me and say it as much as I'd love to say it, I can't.
[time=2950] I'm not able to say that I know I have that nailed down in my life.
[time=2953] If that's you, I've got the best news, the most eternal news that you will ever hear in this life and it's a privilege to try to just get over to you and let you run with it right now.
[time=2963] The best news is that there's good news.
[time=2966] That's what gospel means.
[time=2967] It means good news.
[time=2968] It's news because it already happened.
[time=2970] It's news because Jesus already died on the cross.
[time=2973] He lived a sinless life, that same sinless life that you could never live and will never live, that I could never live and will never live.
[time=2981] He lived a sinless life and he died of death on the cross after being brutally beaten and bruised and spat upon.
[time=2989] And while he hung on that cross, you were on his mind.
[time=2992] I know some of you don't believe me, but it's true.
[time=2995] God loves you that much and he died on that cross and he paid the price, the penalty for our sins, giving us a bridge when it comes to the presence of God.
[time=3004] We have a bridge.
[time=3005] There was this big gap because of our sin, but Jesus bridged that gap.
[time=3009] He built a bridge so you could come into the presence of God.
[time=3013] He tore that curtain in the very temple we just read about from top of the bottom because God came down and met with you through the person of Jesus.
[time=3021] Now his presence is not tied to a place.
[time=3024] His presence is all about the person of Jesus and he wants to meet you where you sit.
[time=3031] You are that person of promised presence.
[time=3035] It didn't stop there.
[time=3036] Jesus then rose from the dead.
[time=3038] They buried him in a borrowed tomb, but he came back to life defeating death hell in the grave so that you could live with eternal life that you could never attain on your own.
[time=3049] It really is that simple, that Jesus died, that he rose again.
[time=3054] Scripture makes it so clear that if we put our faith and our trust in that, and that alone to save us, turning away from ourselves and saying, I can't do that, he did that.
[time=3063] So I'm going to trust in that, that you'll believe those things that you shall be saved.
[time=3069] Yes, it is that simple.
[time=3072] There's an enemy who wants to whisper into your ear right now that it's not that easy, but it truly is.
[time=3076] And if that's you, I'm not going to lead you in a prayer because I think your heart is screaming.
[time=3079] You say, well I can't say it the way that you just said it.
[time=3081] God doesn't want you to.
[time=3082] He wants to scream it out from your heart to his and your own words and I promise you, hear me.
[time=3088] If you cry out to Jesus, he will listen.
[time=3092] He will meet you where you are in the middle of all the mess that you call your life and he'll save your soul.
[time=3098] If that's you, would you just take a moment in this time of silence and just cry out to Jesus right where you are?

[time=3372] I pray you've been blessed today.
[time=3378] I pray that God has revealed some new things in your life.
[time=3382] And today I want you to know that whatever vision God is revealing, whatever He's prompting inside of you is real.
[time=3388] You can trust it because Jesus is trustworthy.
[time=3391] He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[time=3394] In a world that's constantly changing, He's the only solid foundational truth that will never burn out.
[time=3401] And so as we've looked at having a foundation for vision today, He is that foundation.
[time=3406] And perhaps you, for the first time, have seen that, and you're ready to follow Jesus with your life.
[time=3411] And maybe you've known for a while you needed to take a step of faith, but you just didn't feel worthy or whatever it may be that was holding you back.
[time=3418] Maybe God's helping you overcome that very thing in your life in this moment.
[time=3423] My challenge, my encouragement, my excitement, my joy for you in this moment is that if you'll take that leap of faith, you will not regret it.
[time=3431] Jesus will meet you right where you are.
[time=3433] And just as I've shared with you now, salvation truly is that simple.
[time=3436] It's all about turning away from that old self, the self that was trying to maybe save your own self.
[time=3442] Maybe I could be good enough to make it to heaven one day, to turn away from that mindset and just lay your life down at the further cross, to say, Jesus, I do need you to save me.
[time=3452] The gospel is truly that simple.
[time=3454] He did die for you in your sins.
[time=3456] He is alive because he rose from the grave, and I'm sure glad of it.
[time=3460] And you can trust in that.
[time=3461] And if you have taken that step, or maybe you are taking that step, we want to hear from you.
[time=3466] There's going to be some information on your screen.
[time=3467] There's going to be an email address, a phone number, where you can reach out to us and just tell us a little bit about what God is teaching you, a little bit about what God is doing in your life.
[time=3476] We want to walk alongside of you.
[time=3478] We want to give you some resources.
[time=3479] Speaking of resources, there's a great book that I want to get into your hands.
[time=3483] It's called Beginning Steps, A Growth Guide for New Believers.
[time=3487] And this book is really just going to help you see what's next.
[time=3490] You've taken a step.
[time=3491] So what?
[time=3492] So now what?
[time=3493] Where do I go from here?
[time=3494] Maybe you're asking, well, we want to help you answer those questions, walk with you because your journey is your story, but we want to come alongside you and equip you.
[time=3502] So we'd love to mail one of these books to you.
[time=3504] We would love to give one of these books to you in person.
[time=3507] You can stop by here at the church anytime we'd love to see you in person, or we'll reach out to you if you're watching from a different location and can't get by here.
[time=3515] We want to reach out.
[time=3516] We want to send that to you because we believe in you, because Jesus believes in His church, and you're a part of that if you've given your life to Jesus.
[time=3523] Now, as you move forward into this week, one final word of encouragement to you is, you're still going to feel at times like you're going to burn out.
[time=3531] You're going to burn out.
[time=3532] You're still going to feel tired.
[time=3533] You're still going to feel like your passion is waning as we've talked about today.
[time=3537] But no matter what you face this week, the foundation of Jesus, that light, that passion, that fire that burns within coming from Him is the only thing in this life that will never burn out.
[time=3549] My challenge to you is trust in that and that along this week, and I know that God has big things in store for you as you walk through this week as you journey through this thing called faith and life, and we're going to do it together here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=3562] I look forward to seeing you next week.
[time=3564] God bless you.
