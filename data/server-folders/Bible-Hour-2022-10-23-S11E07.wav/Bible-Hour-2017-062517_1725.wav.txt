[time=303] Thank you so much for watching today.
[time=305] You're in for a treat because God has a plan for you on the Bible hour today.
[time=310] We're so honored just to have you tuning in to give a little bit of your time each and every week.
[time=314] We want to connect with you however we can.
[time=316] So I encourage you to reach out to us.
[time=324] We love stories at Black Hawk and yours matters to us.
[time=328] We'd love to hear from you.
[time=330] Today is going to be a little different.
[time=332] We're going to be talking some about Black Hawk Ministries and our vision as we wrap up this emphasis on vision.
[time=338] We're going to talk about our church's vision and then we're going to narrow that a little bit to our vision for our family.
[time=344] And so that's where we'll be diving into a text that I just truly love from the Bible.
[time=349] It's Deuteronomy chapter six and this text is known as the Shammai.
[time=353] It was the basic confession of faith of Judaism.
[time=356] And so it's something they truly lived by and it has some really practical truths for your family and for mine.
[time=362] And so join in with me today, sit back and relax and worship.
[time=365] And we're going to be talking some about Black Hawk Ministries and our vision.
[time=368] And then we're going to narrow that down to you and to me.
[time=371] And so no matter where you're at in your life, just know that Jesus has a plan for you.
[time=375] He wants to meet you right where you are.
[time=377] And so I would challenge you today to just allow Him to do just that.
[time=381] Allow Him to speak into your heart in new ways today and know that you're going to be blessed.
[time=385] Always feel free to reach out to us.
[time=387] Connect with us on our social media platforms @BHawkMinistries on Twitter and Instagram.

[time=787] [MUSIC]
[time=803] Happy Father's Day.
[time=806] You guys awake, ready today.
[time=808] I'm excited about God's Word today.
[time=810] And just to finish out this five-week focus that we've had on vision.
[time=814] Again, as has been mentioned, our vision Sunday that we do once a year.
[time=819] And so we laid out a lot of different things.
[time=821] And so I want to walk through a few of those things with you.
[time=823] Because I'm truly just excited about all that God is doing here.
[time=827] And so as we wrap up this five-week emphasis, I want to tie a few of those pieces together.
[time=833] And then I want to land on vision for our family.
[time=836] And so what we've done so far in this series, after vision Sundays, we went through several different things.
[time=841] We talked about our focus.
[time=845] On graduation Sunday, last week I talked to you about our foundation.
[time=849] Having a foundation for your vision that's going to last.
[time=852] So today, I want to close out this focus by just talking about vision for our family.
[time=857] Vision for our family.
[time=859] Having a vision for your family individually, but then for our church family at large as well.
[time=865] And so today, if you got your Bibles, you can look at Deuteronomy.
[time=868] Deuteronomy, there in your Old Testament toward the beginning of your Bible.
[time=872] Chapter six, we will get there in just a few minutes, but you can find your place there.
[time=877] Deuteronomy chapter six, we'll be reading verses four through nine.
[time=880] I want to take the opportunity to welcome our extended family.
[time=883] Black Hawk family goes a lot further than just what we see in this room.
[time=887] Watching us online or television or at home, PJs, whatever it looks like for you.
[time=892] Welcome, we welcome you into our family here at Black Hawk.
[time=895] And it's an exciting time to be a part of what God is doing.
[time=898] Can I get a name in?
[time=900] I love looking around and seeing all the kids that God blesses us with.
[time=904] I love looking around and seeing our youth ministry just coming back from a mission trip, giving up a week of their summer to go and serve other churches and be the church.
[time=913] I love looking around this room and seeing a diverse group of people coming together for one purpose and that purpose is the gospel, that purpose is Jesus.
[time=922] And when that happens, folks, the sky is the limit.
[time=926] God is just getting started.
[time=928] So I want to talk to you for just a couple of minutes about some of that vision, our future together as we've looked at how to move forward.
[time=935] And I want to remind you of what we're doing as this is the end of this vision series.
[time=939] I want to show you, maybe new to some of you.
[time=941] So I want to show you the circle that I have shown you in the previous weeks.
[time=945] And it has seven key elements.
[time=947] You'll see on there, you'll see a kitchen, auxiliary gym, children's classrooms, a gathering area, some of our expansion parts of our project.
[time=955] You'll see eliminating our existing debt, which is our number one priority for the funds we're raising, as I will share with you in a moment.
[time=962] And then an LED light project that saves us a lot of money for your innovations.
[time=966] That'll include carpet, that'll include just really updating a lot of our areas, showing some love to the facilities that have shown us love for many years.
[time=974] But they are worn and we're looking forward to updating some of those.
[time=977] And then some other facility upgrades for our worship center and sound and those different pieces.
[time=982] And so if you want more information on that, or to watch where I outlined every piece and every component of that, as has been mentioned, go to blackcalkministries.org/ourfuturetogether.
[time=992] And you can see all of those.
[time=993] But I'm excited a lot about our children.
[time=996] Even just this week, last Sunday we baptized four children.
[time=999] If you were here, we're seeing kids come to Christ.
[time=1002] And I am excited to see us have better venues to share the gospel with our kids.
[time=1007] And if you didn't know, we believe in children's ministry for a lot of reasons.
[time=1011] Number one, Jesus believed in kids.
[time=1014] When everybody else said, "Get the kids away from Jesus," he has more important things to do.
[time=1018] He said, "No, let the kids come to me because of such is the kingdom of God." And if you can't look at me, if you can't come to me, if you can't be like one of these little children, then you cannot inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=1030] So we believe in our kids.
[time=1031] And if you didn't know, it's over half of the people who decide to follow Jesus at any point in their lifetime.
[time=1037] Over half of them do so before the age of 12.
[time=1042] And did you know that from the time your baby is born to the time that they turn 18?
[time=1047] You only have 936 weeks to invest in them.
[time=1051] You say, "Well, that's plenty of time." But if you've ever had kids, you know, that's not plenty of time.
[time=1056] You've got to make the most of that.
[time=1058] So here's a couple of pictures.
[time=1059] Just to jog your memory, we're going to have a gathering space for our kids.
[time=1062] Or give you an overview first where you can see the picture of the addition there.
[time=1066] It's that bottom part of your screen that we'll be adding there that'll include a kitchen and a new gym.
[time=1071] They'll include our children's area.
[time=1073] They'll include a gathering space that I'll now show you a picture of.
[time=1076] Something similar to that where we can actually gather our kids in a dedicated and secure space.
[time=1082] I'm pumped about that.
[time=1083] Anybody else excited about that?
[time=1084] I know I am, sure.
[time=1086] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1089] And then let me go back to some of those elements.
[time=1091] Our first goal that we set has to do, as you see on the right of that circle, our existing debt.
[time=1097] Now, I wanted to give you a glimpse at the goal that I set for all of us a while back.
[time=1102] And you've responded so well, but we still have a ways to go, so I want to challenge you with that.
[time=1106] I set a goal for us to even moving into this campaign by the end of June to pay off, to get enough pledges in.
[time=1113] That doesn't mean all the cash is in hand.
[time=1115] I'm fully aware of that because pledge is a three-year campaign that we have entered into our future together.
[time=1120] We wanted to get in enough pledges, enough commitments to cover our existing debt.
[time=1126] That back before the beginning of the year was over 490,000, currently it is 317,181 dollars.
[time=1134] That's worth celebrating.
[time=1135] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1137] But I'm also excited to tell you that we already have current commitments that have come into the campaign
[time=1143] that are totaling 225,300 dollars.
[time=1147] Now, that is within the 1.5 million.
[time=1150] So, before you get too excited, we've got a ways to go.
[time=1153] And we're going to get there by God's grace and with all of our generosity all in together.
[time=1158] It's exciting too, just so you know about your leadership.
[time=1160] We have asked all of our elders, deacons, staff leadership, all school leadership to come together
[time=1166] and lead the way in this.
[time=1167] That's part of the reason you see some of the numbers because 100% of your leadership have already decided we are going to make personal, sacrificial, above and beyond our normal giving commitments to this to lead the way.
[time=1180] Why do you say that, Pastor, to be boastful about you and about the leadership team?
[time=1184] No, to show you're part of something that's unified, to show you're a part of a team, you're a part of a church that God has placed leadership in place to lead the way, not just with words, but with walk.
[time=1195] And that's what we are blessed with here at Black Hawk, and I invite you to join in on that.
[time=1200] And so the last pieces I've walked you through in the past, but I wanted to challenge you to go to that website if you haven't seen those pieces yet, as we're wrapping up this vision emphasis today.
[time=1210] It's a great time to jump back in and see that message go to our website there.
[time=1214] The town hall gatherings, that's for some of you that maybe you say I've still got some more questions.
[time=1219] This is kind of new to me.
[time=1220] We've got four of those.
[time=1221] It's in that insert that you received today, as has been mentioned.
[time=1224] But then also you can go on our website, submit your questions there, contact our steering team.
[time=1231] So grateful, so grateful for our steering team led by Bill and Jan Hartman.
[time=1236] A lot of different people from our church have stepped in to be a part of that, and they have led the way in this whole thing.
[time=1241] At those town hall gatherings, I'll be introducing all of them individually so you can get to know them a little bit as well.
[time=1247] Can we just for a moment just thank those of them that joined the steering team?
[time=1251] So let's join me in that.
[time=1254] So where do we have to go?
[time=1259] We're just over $90,000 short in commitments to meet our goal by the end of June.
[time=1264] But then I want to get you to write down August the 6th.
[time=1267] August the 6th is in that same insert.
[time=1270] That's going to be our future together Sunday.
[time=1273] And that is going to be our goal date to have all of our commitments in.
[time=1277] And so it'll be a special Sunday where we'll emphasize this vision, this goal.
[time=1281] We'll emphasize what God has already been doing, but even more so where He's taking us as a church.
[time=1286] And so I invite you to make sure you're here.
[time=1288] You don't want to miss that Sunday.
[time=1290] And in the meantime, pick up those commitment cards.
[time=1292] If you're ready to make that commitment, by all means, jump in on that June goal.
[time=1296] But if you need to take that and just pray over that, I would challenge you to join me in making your commitment on August the 6th.
[time=1303] So that will be coming up here very soon.
[time=1306] So I want to challenge you to do that.
[time=1308] And you know, why do we do all these things?
[time=1310] It's a lot of you are thinking right now.
[time=1312] I thought he was going to preach a sermon.
[time=1314] He's talking about money.
[time=1315] I just read your mind, didn't I?
[time=1317] You didn't know I had that power.
[time=1318] Why do we do all that?
[time=1319] Do I enjoy talking about money?
[time=1321] Do I enjoy these kind of pieces?
[time=1323] Sometimes, not all the time.
[time=1325] Why do we do it?
[time=1327] We do it because of the four kids that were baptized last Sunday.
[time=1330] We do it because of those little feet that just trampled out of this room.
[time=1334] We do it because of stories like I heard even just this last week of someone watching online having no clue.
[time=1340] No clue.
[time=1341] Who Black Hawk Ministries is?
[time=1343] Somebody just said, you should go on this website.
[time=1345] I think they stream their services and they let God work in their life and they're coming here.
[time=1349] Maybe you're here today.
[time=1350] I'm not going to say names because you may.
[time=1352] I don't want to call you out.
[time=1353] So you may be here if that's you, then welcome.
[time=1355] We're glad you're here.
[time=1356] We do it for people like that.
[time=1357] We do it because the gospel compels us never, ever to settle.
[time=1362] Few weeks back or a few months back, I did a series on Elisha.
[time=1365] We talked about bold faith.
[time=1366] Somebody say bold faith.
[time=1368] Bold faith.
[time=1370] And within that bold faith focus, I shared this statement with you every week.
[time=1374] And the statement was, a lot of times we ask and we pray and we beg God to do signs and wonders and miracles among us.
[time=1382] Yet then we refuse to put ourselves in a position to need the very miracles we've been praying for.
[time=1388] We say, God, do big things.
[time=1390] Do things that are bigger than me.
[time=1391] Use my life.
[time=1392] Take my life and do what you please.
[time=1394] But don't ask me to go through any hard times or trials or tribulations or troubles.
[time=1398] Don't ask me to get out of my comfort zone.
[time=1400] I'm not talking about you.
[time=1401] You're way more spiritual than me.
[time=1403] That's me.
[time=1404] I do that a lot.
[time=1405] Where I say, God, do big things, but then say, you know what?
[time=1407] I'm not going to take the steps to get there.
[time=1409] And that's who we are as people, but who God's church is, is the opposite.
[time=1414] Because Jesus said, I'm going to build my church and even the gates of hell cannot prevail against it.
[time=1422] That's the team I'm going to talk about you.
[time=1425] It excites me to be a part of a church.
[time=1427] And because of that statement, because of God's call, because of who He is, we refuse to settle at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=1434] If you want to come to a church that's just going to stay the same and just die off gradually and be comfortable, this is not going to be the church for you.
[time=1440] I just want to be honest with you.
[time=1442] Because we're called and compelled to never settle.
[time=1445] Why?
[time=1446] Because Jesus never settled.
[time=1448] And He built a church that's going to last and is going to grow.
[time=1451] And we're going to reach people of the Gospel in Fort Wayne and around the world all for His glory.
[time=1456] No matter what it costs.
[time=1458] I think you refuse to settle too.
[time=1464] You.
[time=1465] I think you're here because you don't want to settle with your life.
[time=1468] Can I get an amen?
[time=1470] I think you're here because you want to live that kind of life and following Jesus.
[time=1475] Maybe it's not even about following Jesus to you.
[time=1477] Maybe you're just trying to figure this faith thing out and it's new to you and you don't know what to do with Jesus.
[time=1482] You don't know what to believe about Jesus.
[time=1484] Well, we want to be the kind of place where you can come and figure those things out with people who love you where you are, walk beside you and show you the way to Jesus.
[time=1493] Because that's all we can do.
[time=1494] We don't have much to offer you except Jesus, but guess what?
[time=1497] That's everything.
[time=1498] So in turn, we have everything to offer you because we know Jesus.
[time=1502] So let me ask you a question to start today.
[time=1504] I want to move from there to your vision for your life and in a series like this, a lot of you would say, well, I don't really have a vision for my life.
[time=1512] What does that even look like?
[time=1513] Well, that's what I want to zoom in on today when it comes to family.
[time=1515] How many of you would say your vision, personal vision for you?
[time=1519] This is a puzzle, by the way.
[time=1520] It feels like a puzzle.
[time=1522] How many of you would say vision for me often feels puzzling?
[time=1526] I try to put the pieces of my life together, but sometimes it just does not make sense.
[time=1531] It feels like a puzzle.
[time=1533] And this is a puzzle with a lot of different candy pieces.
[time=1535] You saw Hershey's.
[time=1536] You thought I was giving out candy again.
[time=1538] Sorry.
[time=1539] But so many times our vision feels like a puzzle.
[time=1544] What I would offer you is I think that vision is often like the lid of the box, of the puzzle.
[time=1550] It gives you the destination.
[time=1552] It gives you the end result.
[time=1554] It gives you the big picture.
[time=1556] How many of you put puzzles together?
[time=1558] You enjoy that.
[time=1559] I'm putting my hand down.
[time=1561] You keep yours up.
[time=1562] I'm putting mine down.
[time=1564] Puzzles take patience.
[time=1568] The P word.
[time=1569] I don't have a lot of that P word in my life.
[time=1571] My little girl, she's four.
[time=1573] Her name is Callie.
[time=1574] She loves puzzles.
[time=1575] She could probably take a puzzle like this and get it together with a little bit of help.
[time=1579] And she'll say, "Dad, you want to do a puzzle with me?" And I'll go, "Mm-hmm." Because I'm a good father.
[time=1586] I'm a father's day, especially, right?
[time=1588] So I'll put puzzles together.
[time=1590] But you know, having a vision for your life, for the church, and today we're going to talk about the church family and your own family, because guess what?
[time=1597] It's all one family.
[time=1598] But having a vision for your family really is a lot like the lid of a puzzle box.
[time=1602] You've got to have something to guide you.
[time=1604] You've got to have a big picture, a goal, a destination to get to.
[time=1608] Have you ever tried to put a puzzle together that didn't have the lid?
[time=1611] It didn't go too well, especially one like this.
[time=1614] Right?
[time=1615] It'd be hard to do.
[time=1616] And so today I want to talk about the lid to our puzzle box with our vision.
[time=1620] I want us to look at how we can have that kind of vision for our family.
[time=1623] And I want to give you a statement here.
[time=1625] And, you know, like a thousand-piece puzzle, it's pretty intimidating to me.
[time=1629] So some of you, it may not be.
[time=1630] I want to give you a statement just to stir you a little this morning.
[time=1633] It's this, "I believe that if the size of your vision isn't intimidating to you, it's likely insulting to God.
[time=1642] Now that I've insulted half the room, I do have a point.
[time=1646] And I want to make that point with you today.
[time=1648] I wanted to wake you up a little bit.
[time=1649] It's a bold statement.
[time=1651] But I've come to believe that.
[time=1652] Why?
[time=1653] Because I truly believe, hear me, folks, before you turn me off because I insulted you about insulting God, I truly believe that we sell God so short and we put God in such a box
[time=1664] sometimes with our life and we say, "Well, I could never get out of this situation." I could never use someone like me, "Father's in the room.
[time=1671] You may have been told all of your life.
[time=1673] You'll never be a good dad.
[time=1674] You're going to end up in prison one day.
[time=1676] You'll never make it.
[time=1677] You'll never amount to anything.
[time=1678] And you feel like you can't be a good dad because of what's been told to you, perhaps.
[time=1682] Whatever it is in your life, I feel like so many times.
[time=1686] We sell God short with our vision for how we move forward in our life.
[time=1692] And we put God in a box, making Him a lot smaller in our minds than He truly is.
[time=1697] I want to tell you that you cannot put God in a box, a puzzle box or any kind of box you try to construct.
[time=1702] I believe God has a bigger vision for your life than you even realize.
[time=1707] So my challenge to you is to let God intimidate you today with the vision that He has for your
[time=1714] life.
[time=1715] Jesus, I believe, truly meets us where we are in life, but He never leaves us there.
[time=1720] That's why I think we should have a bigger vision, a big vision that intimidates us and scares us at times.
[time=1727] And here's what it's about.
[time=1728] A lot of times we think vision is always this huge grandiose thing that takes years and years and years and years to accomplish.
[time=1735] And while it might be that for you, I think vision begins, and I truly believe God will often launch a vision for you that's larger than life, but He's going to start you at a starting
[time=1747] place that seems small and insignificant.
[time=1752] Now what I mean by that is I think a lot of times that God's going to stir something in you, but vision is a lot less for us on a personal level at times about the big picture
[time=1762] than it is about the small step.
[time=1764] I think that vision should cause us to believe big but start small, to take a step of faith,
[time=1770] to take a small baby step towards where He's taking us, because that one little step can blow up and become a lot bigger than you ever think it could be.
[time=1778] Have you ever lived in those moments?
[time=1780] You finally took that step and it's like, man, I should have done this years ago.
[time=1784] Well, there's a step for you, and I want to ask you the question of the day.
[time=1788] As we look at Deuteronomy today, I want to ask you this question.
[time=1791] Listen in light of this question.
[time=1793] What small step of vision does God have lined up for you this week?
[time=1798] It could be as simple as a phone call to mend a relationship.
[time=1802] It could be as simple as an apology.
[time=1804] Asking someone for your forgiveness for something you did wrong.
[time=1807] It could be as simple as telling someone in your family that you loved them.
[time=1811] Maybe that's not as common in your family, but you need to pass that along.
[time=1814] It could be as simple as just reaching out to someone that you think just might need Jesus, because He's been prompting you to do that for quite some time.
[time=1821] I don't know what it is, but I think there's a small step of vision that God has asked you to take this week, and so it's not always big or cleverly worded.
[time=1829] You know, churches have cleverly worded vision statements and all.
[time=1832] For you, it could just be make that phone call.
[time=1834] Somebody say make that phone call.
[time=1837] You may need to do that this week.
[time=1839] You may need to take a small step of vision, and so now that you're asking, "Well, you know, how do I have a vision?" I think I kind of answered that.
[time=1845] It's that first small step, but it is about having a bigger picture, and that's what I want us to look at today.
[time=1850] So we've talked about our future together as a church vision, but let's talk about your vision.
[time=1855] Now, before I read Deuteronomy, this passage of Scripture, Deuteronomy 6, 4 through 9, be reading from the English standard version.
[time=1863] If you want to get your electronics, iPads, phones, whatever you use out, I still go with the old school regularly because as sure as I didn't, I'd come up here and it would go off.
[time=1872] And so this one never goes off, it stays there, but you use what you have.
[time=1875] I'll be reading from the ESV.
[time=1877] This passage is known as the Shema.
[time=1879] Somebody say Shema.
[time=1881] It became the basic confession of fate for Judaism.
[time=1885] It's something that was commonly read, commonly practiced, commonly drawn from in that faith, that walk of life.
[time=1892] It's translated from the Hebrew word that just simply means "here" to "here" with your ears, to "here." And so it's a very, very important piece of Old Testament Scripture to many,
[time=1905] but what I love about it for us in the context of having a vision for our family is that it's very action-oriented.
[time=1913] You'll notice everything in here requires a small step of vision.
[time=1917] And I think it informs a vision for a family extremely, extremely well.
[time=1922] And the bottom line of it, I want to give it as I've read it over and over this past couple of weeks, is that I believe vision without venture is pointless.
[time=1931] Vision without venture is pointless.
[time=1933] It's one thing to acknowledge God's vision, but it's another thing to act on God's vision.
[time=1939] This passage of Scripture is a call to action, and I've asked you to venture out with me as a church into this "Our Future Together" thing.
[time=1947] I've asked you to venture out with me in taking a small step of faith in your own life this week to pursue God's vision for your life this week.
[time=1955] And so I want us to look at what that venture can look like for us in Deuteronomy.
[time=1960] Who's ready for the word this morning?
[time=1962] Deuteronomy 6, starting there in verse 4, says, "Here, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
[time=1970] You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might." And these words I command you today shall be on your heart.
[time=1980] Here's where it starts to cut into our family into those steps, maybe that we need to take even this week.
[time=1984] Verse 7, "You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk, by the way, and when you lie down.
[time=1994] And when you rise." I like that because it's in the formal moments like at church, and in the informal moments like your living room.
[time=2001] Like the Father's Day meal that you're going to perhaps later today.
[time=2004] Verse 8, "You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.
[time=2010] You shall write them on the doorposts of your house, and own your gates."
[time=2017] I think that's an excellent vision for a family.
[time=2021] To have the words of Christ, to have Jesus himself, to have the Word posted, known,
[time=2028] lived out in the formal moments, in the informal moments, in the happy moments, in the sad moments, where your kids, your grandkids, your family, the people you pour into, even if you're single here today,
[time=2039] who you are building relationships and community with, if you're not doing that, no matter what season of life you're in,
[time=2045] we believe that life's better together and you should do it with other people.
[time=2048] No doubt you influence some, and so what a vision that could be for our life, for our families moving forward as a venture,
[time=2055] and so I want to give you a couple of thoughts today on what it means to venture out.
[time=2060] But here's what I know as Father's Day, and I truly believe that some of the best visions,
[time=2066] the most important visions that are cast, don't come from amazing orators on big stages with hundreds of people listening.
[time=2073] I think the best visions are often cast by the kid's bedside, before bedtime, in your living room,
[time=2081] in those impromptu talks, or at the coffee shop with that person that you meet up with.
[time=2086] I think that's the place our vision becomes known, where it really truly taps into the power of Jesus.
[time=2092] Even just this week, if I can brag on my little boy for a minute, he has a rough dad.
[time=2098] He still does okay sometimes, and God works in those little kids' lives.
[time=2103] And just this last week, Caleb has been really wrestling with faith lately, and he prayed very specifically for people that don't know Jesus.
[time=2112] He knew we moved to Indiana partly because, you know, people need to hear about Jesus, and God's called us to go make Jesus known and to take steps of faith to do that.
[time=2120] And he prayed, and he said, "God, I just want to pray for people that don't know you, that's sad."
[time=2126] I want to help people know you.
[time=2131] He said that.
[time=2134] From the mouth of a child comes the vision that Jesus had in mind for his church and for your family.
[time=2142] I don't want you to feel discouraged today feeling like you don't have enough to bring to the table.
[time=2148] Because, guess what, you're right, you really don't.
[time=2151] But Jesus already brought it to the table.
[time=2154] It's fitting that we're doing communion, Lord's Supper today.
[time=2157] Jesus already brought the sacrifice to the table.
[time=2160] He won the victory, he cast the vision, and his vision is going to succeed with or without us.
[time=2167] But he invites you into it.
[time=2169] And so I don't care what background you have, how inadequate you feel, what hand maybe you've been dealt.
[time=2177] I care about you, and Jesus cares about those pieces, but he doesn't care about that in terms of his vision coming to life in your life.
[time=2183] Because he's not done with you yet.
[time=2186] You're here because God has a vision for you, and you feel it.
[time=2189] You sense it.
[time=2190] You know he's drawing something out of you.
[time=2192] You just don't know what it is yet, and I want to challenge you.
[time=2194] Don't hold back.
[time=2196] Venture out.
[time=2197] Take that vision and venture out.
[time=2199] Take a step.
[time=2200] Whatever it is he's laying on your heart.
[time=2202] Because if a little six-year-old child can see the point of God's vision, surely we can too.
[time=2209] I love the childlike faith that God calls us to.
[time=2212] I'm pretty childish.
[time=2213] And so it helps to know that that's what he has in mind for us.
[time=2216] But for some of you today, I know that you're going to have to break some cycles.
[time=2220] I'm full aware that maybe you have cycles in your family's history, your family's makeup, your past, that you will have to break in your life.
[time=2228] So I want to give you a couple of thoughts on breaking cycles today from this passage.
[time=2232] And just as a follow up to that vision to truly let the word of Jesus reign in your family's life today.
[time=2239] I want to talk to you about breaking cycles and being consistent.
[time=2241] The first one is this that breaking cycles takes consistency.
[time=2245] I believe consistency is quite a challenge.
[time=2249] Is consistency ever a challenge for you?
[time=2252] Recently a church member here, part of our Black Caught family challenged me to join him on drinking water and becoming more healthy.
[time=2260] And he shall remain nameless in case he beats me at the challenge because he would make sure you know about it.
[time=2266] But that's difficult.
[time=2267] I'm a Coke Zero fan.
[time=2268] But I've been trying to drink just water.
[time=2270] And you know, I've been doing okay, but it's hard to stay consistent, isn't it?
[time=2274] You've been on those plans, the new year plan, right?
[time=2277] The new year plan rolls around, you take steps.
[time=2279] Consistently, consistency is a challenge for us.
[time=2282] But I truly believe so many times that excuses get in the way of our consistency.
[time=2287] I think consistency begins where excuses end.
[time=2295] I believe, hear me, I believe some excuses are going to get thrown away today.
[time=2300] I believe somebody's leaving here and some excuses that you had are going to be no more because God is so at work and present in your life.
[time=2307] I believe that somebody is going to find consistency like never before, building on that in the days ahead.
[time=2313] Now I've shared this before, but it's just so good as worth sharing again.
[time=2316] There's a list of excuses from the Bible that you may remember back sometime fall of last year.
[time=2321] I think I shared with you, but I'm going to share it with you again in case you think your excuses are so big that maybe you can't take that step of faith.
[time=2329] Here are some excuses from the Bible.
[time=2331] Moses stuttered.
[time=2332] David's armor didn't fit.
[time=2334] Hosea married a prostitute.
[time=2336] David had an affair.
[time=2337] Solomon had too much money and too many women.
[time=2340] Abraham was too old.
[time=2342] Timothy had ulcers.
[time=2343] Paul was ugly.
[time=2344] Jeremiah was suicidal.
[time=2346] Elijah suffered from depression.
[time=2348] Paul was a murderer.
[time=2350] So was Moses.
[time=2351] So was David.
[time=2353] John the Baptist dressed weird and ate bugs.
[time=2357] Samson needed a haircut.
[time=2359] Zacchaeus was too short.
[time=2361] David was only a teenager.
[time=2363] So was Mary the mother of Jesus.
[time=2365] So was Daniel.
[time=2366] And my personal favorite, Lazarus was dead.
[time=2372] How's your excuses working out for you?
[time=2375] Does that excuse feel a little smaller now?
[time=2378] I believe so many times that the enemy just whispers those excuses in our head and it holds us back from the consistency of vision, taking hold, taking root in our lives.
[time=2387] So some of you may say today, I'm not wealthy enough.
[time=2391] I'm not strong enough.
[time=2392] If I got that job or if I got that relationship, you may say I'm not blank enough.
[time=2396] You just feel like you're not enough.
[time=2398] Some of you would say I'm not smart enough.
[time=2400] And I heard a statement a couple of weeks ago that I just have to share with you and I think it's so true.
[time=2405] I would personally rather be ignorance on fire than intellect on ice.
[time=2411] If you don't think you're smart enough, take your ignorance, light your ignorance on fire.
[time=2416] And I would rather have that any day than intellect on ice.
[time=2419] Now if I could go on a semi-ratt for a minute, one of the things that drives me the most crazy in the church world sometimes is we're good at amassing knowledge.
[time=2428] We come and we sit and we get notebooks and we fill up our shelves with these big notebooks
[time=2434] of all these studies that we've done and I'm four studies.
[time=2436] We have Bible studies meaning all across the city.
[time=2439] We have Bible studies meaning across our campus all the time.
[time=2442] We have a school that teaches the Bible to people.
[time=2444] I think we believe completely in Bible studies, but it doesn't do any good if that bleeds to an intellect that just sits on ice, that just sits in comfort.
[time=2452] And so many times in the church world, we're good at building knowledge, but not building
[time=2458] outward.
[time=2459] We're good at building knowledge inwardly without outwardly taking that knowledge, taking the implications, the applications of that knowledge to a world that's hurting and needs Jesus.
[time=2469] You get to be with a family that just lost a little baby.
[time=2472] I've done little babies funerals and had a little white casket.
[time=2478] You tell me that your intellect and theological depth is going to help you in that moment.
[time=2485] When they just look at you and say, "I don't know what to believe about God.
[time=2491] Why would God let this happen to me?" You know what you need in that moment?
[time=2495] You need an embrace of grace.
[time=2499] You need the love of Jesus and arms open wide.
[time=2504] I'm for the theology.
[time=2505] I've gone to seminary.
[time=2506] I've amassed some of that knowledge.
[time=2508] People are so much smarter than I will ever be, but none of it compares to just living out the love of Jesus.
[time=2517] That's a good vision to follow.
[time=2519] So if you don't feel like you're smart enough or you bring enough to the table, I would much rather have my ignorance on fire than have intellect on ice.
[time=2526] Now what happens if those of us who God's gifted some intellect far more than I will ever have?
[time=2531] What if you let that on fire?
[time=2532] Maybe that's your step.
[time=2533] This week, take a match to that intellect and go burn it.
[time=2536] You probably are, but burn it some more.
[time=2538] Light it on fire.
[time=2539] Send it out.
[time=2540] Let our intellect, what we build inwardly, turn outwardly the way that Jesus did when he left his throne in heaven, came here to this earth and lived it out in front of us.
[time=2550] A praise God for how he did that.
[time=2552] And maybe today you've got another blank that you'd feel in.
[time=2555] Not blank enough.
[time=2556] What would you put in the blank?
[time=2558] I'm not blank enough.
[time=2562] And I want you to know today everywhere you aren't enough, Jesus already was.
[time=2567] Jesus was already enough and he is enough.
[time=2571] God really isn't even after your ability.
[time=2573] He's after your availability.
[time=2575] Whatever you've got, it's enough because Jesus makes it enough because he is enough.
[time=2579] The second thought I want to give you is consistency.
[time=2582] We need consistency to break cycles in our life.
[time=2586] Consistency comes from Christ is what I want to share with you about.
[time=2589] I believe that Jesus is the most consistent, constant Savior that we could have ever dreamed of.
[time=2595] He's the picture of consistency.
[time=2596] Hebrews 13 verse 8, Jesus Christ is the same, say it with me if you know it, the same yesterday, today and forever.
[time=2604] He's always going to be the same Jesus.
[time=2608] If you want to be consistent, fathers, let me speak to you for a minute.
[time=2612] We have all the Father's eyes up here.
[time=2615] We try to lead our homes, don't we?
[time=2617] Try to be a good leader who leads by example in our homes.
[time=2621] A lot of times if you're like me, you fall flat on your face and this applies to all of us in the room.
[time=2626] But on this Father's Day, I want you to know that the best leaders among us really are always the best followers among us.
[time=2634] A lot of times we think it's the ones who are the loudest.
[time=2637] The ones whose voice can be heard the most.
[time=2641] I think the best leaders among us are those that have learned how to follow Jesus the best.
[time=2646] The best soldiers of Jesus are those who know how to strap on the armor and take orders from a God who cares about us where we are and when we follow Jesus well that vision comes
[time=2657] to life in our family and then we lead by our fellowship.
[time=2661] People want to follow the same God that we're following when we follow Him so well that we lead the way in our fellowship.
[time=2668] Does that make sense?
[time=2669] That's where God calls you to be as a parent.
[time=2673] That's where God calls you to be in your workplace.
[time=2675] That's what God calls you to be in the relationships that He's given to you.
[time=2679] That's what God calls you to be when those little eyes look up at you and you don't know what to say.
[time=2683] That's what God calls you to be in those moments when you face a trial or a situation that you don't have the answers to.
[time=2690] That's what He calls you to be when others face that kind of situation and they look to you as He calls you to be a follower of Jesus.
[time=2697] The best leaders will always simply be the best followers so may we follow Him well together
[time=2703] and if you're like me you like to do it your way, the Burger King way, have it your way.
[time=2709] How many of you would say that's normal for you?
[time=2711] That's yeah?
[time=2712] I'd have it my way.
[time=2713] No, it's just me.
[time=2714] Okay.
[time=2715] Well, I like to have it my way.
[time=2716] You do too.
[time=2717] Jay Vernon McGee said this about God's universe and doing things God's way.
[time=2720] He said this is God's universe and He does things His way.
[time=2724] You may have a better way but you don't have a universe.
[time=2730] Thought that was pretty good.
[time=2731] So until we have a universe I would submit to you, I would suggest that hey let's just do things His way.
[time=2738] That's what I try to live my life like and it seems you say well it seems such an oversimplification of vision today but I don't think so.
[time=2745] I think God's going to take the small step that He's called you to and He's going to do things that you never dream possible.
[time=2751] To wrap this up today I just want to give you one more thought when it comes to this consistency.
[time=2757] We're going to take communion together, we're going to do it as a family but I'm so aware as a pastor you get to hear so many different stories and it just I don't know this last couple of weeks have been heavy for a lot of people in our church family have gone through a lot of really challenging things and I truly want our church to be a church not only where
[time=2781] people are loved and cared for and I truly believe that these people have been so many people have lost a loved one so many people are going through crazy awful challenging
[time=2791] unfathomable situations but I also want to be a church where we don't just come and sit to be comfortable but we come and sit to be changed.
[time=2801] How many of you know that you can come to church all of your life and be comfortable in church but walk away every single week completely unchanged.
[time=2811] Did you know it's possible but did you know that Jesus even though He meets you right where you are and He certainly does that Jesus meets you where you are but He never leaves you that way.
[time=2821] God wants to change something inside of you it's not because you're good enough and if you just try harder you'll get there no I think we try harder when we realize what we have inside of us to give us the capacity to try to get up another day and some of you are ready to just throw in the towel and not get up again and I want to challenge you I want to encourage you in this moment get up one more day because God is always going to get up for you before you rise while you're still asleep.
[time=2846] He's awake.
[time=2847] He cares about you where you are before He formed you in your mother's womb.
[time=2852] He knew you and He cares about every single part of who you are and what your life looks like he knows how many errors you have on your head and for some of us that number is decreasing quickly.
[time=2866] God knows where you are.
[time=2869] He has not quit on you and so I want to challenge you let Him change you because He still has a vision for your life.
[time=2876] He's not finished.
[time=2877] He hasn't given up and He wants you to get up one more day try one more time and to be
[time=2883] changed by your situation here's the statement I want to share with you maybe you go chew on it this week I truly believe that I don't need God to change my situation for Him to change me.
[time=2894] When we pray so often the focus of our prayer is God please affect the situation at work
[time=2900] God please help that person to make this decision.
[time=2903] God please help my kid to stop being a knucklehead.
[time=2906] God please God please God please God please give me that job give me that relationship.
[time=2909] God please change my situation change my situation should we pray like that can we pray like that yes let your request be made known to God absolutely pour them out before Him with thanksgiving thank Him for what He's doing make those requests known but what if
[time=2925] God doesn't choose to change that situation yet because that situation is something that He wants to use to change you.
[time=2933] I believe that God cannot change your situation sometimes while still changing you in the midst of your situation and those can be the vision moments the moments where God's vision
[time=2944] comes to life inside of you and around you in ways that you never dreamed possible.
[time=2950] Let's be a church full of people who invite Jesus to change us even if our situation looks
[time=2956] dire.
[time=2957] I want to ask you just to bow your heads for a moment just reflect on that very thought in a moment we're going to partake of communion but before we do I want to invite some of you to join the family of God as all of us who know Jesus pray about what it means to
[time=2971] be consistent to break cycles to pour into Christ and His vision for our life today.
[time=2976] I want to challenge those of you who may say you know I would love to know I would love to know that I would spend eternity in heaven with Jesus if I were to die today but some
[time=2987] of you would say you know as much as I want to say that pastor I just don't know that I can so with nobody looking around it's just you and Jesus for a moment I want to guide you and just thinking through what the gospel might mean for you some of you came in searching and seeking but today God has decided to ignite a fire in you he's been drawing you for quite
[time=3006] some time perhaps but I want you to know that the gospel truly is as simple as Jesus makes it out to be that the gospel truly does apply even to somebody like you to somebody
[time=3018] like me the gospel is good news it's the good news of Jesus it's news because it already
[time=3024] happened but it's still going it's still changing lives what already happened Jesus already died on the cross after living the sinless life you could never live and I could never live he died on that cross paying a penalty for your sin that you and I could never
[time=3041] pay if we pulled all of our resources we could never scratch the surface of the debt that our sin has brought about we're separated from God because we sin and salvation is all about believing that Jesus died on that cross for your sins knowing your sin separates you from
[time=3057] God that you can't get there without his help believing he died paying that price for your sin that you could never pay believing that he rose again defeating death defeating hell
[time=3069] defeating the grave and wanting to tap into that victory by turning away turning away
[time=3076] from the old me because before you meet Jesus you're trying to save you that's what people say repentance what's repentance all about it's about turning away it's about turning away from me trying to save me and turning to Jesus and saying Jesus I can't save me will
[time=3091] you that's what it's all about so all heads I whole heads bowed eyes closed some of you need to take that step and you say well I can't say it like you just did you don't need to nor does God even want you to he wants you to cry out from your heart to him ask him to save you believing in your heart that he paid that price and that he's alive today
[time=3110] and scripture says not you might be saved if God's in a good mood no you shall be saved
[time=3116] if that's you I'm not going to lead you in a prayer because your heart is already screaming it perhaps you've already prayed it but if that's you we take a moment right now where you sit and cry out to Jesus ask him to save you and he'll meet you there
[time=3153] well all the love I've ever found comes like a flood comes flowing down at the cross
[time=3172] at the cross at the render my life I'm in love you I'm in love you
[time=3183] where your love ever in my sin was died I owe all to you I owe all to you Jesus

[time=3361] So a vision for our family you've heard a lot about our vision as a church today but then more
[time=3389] specifically about how God has a vision for you and for your family today as we've looked at the book of Deuteronomy I would just challenge you to ask the question what is that next small step of vision that God has challenged you to take because oftentimes it's those little small steps that really make the biggest splash the biggest impact when it comes to living out a vision God's vision
[time=3410] for our lives maybe that vision for you is to take that step of salvation is to trust Jesus as your
[time=3416] Savior today if that is you as we've talked about it truly is as simple as I have outlined it to be
[time=3422] for you today and I challenge you to step away push pause whatever you've got to do to take that step follow Jesus and I can promise you you'll never regret it it doesn't mean that life's going to
[time=3432] become easy all of a sudden it doesn't mean that all the problems you had before you gave your life to Christ are just going to dissipate and go away they'll still be there but you'll be able to face them with a different foundation a different vision a different purpose a different hope and a different
[time=3448] meaning God's going to walk you through all of those things and if you're giving your life to Christ or if you've done that recently we want to hear from you there's going to be some information on your screen there'll be an email address a phone number where you can just reach out to us and tell us your story and our commitment to you is to listen our commitment to you is to walk
[time=3465] alongside of you and just to point you to Jesus in a continual fashion this is not an end this is a beginning and speaking of beginnings there's a resource I really want to get into your hands it's called beginning steps a growth guide for you believers it's just a small booklet that will walk you through some next steps for you as you've entered into this life of faith of following Jesus we want to show you what's next because it truly is just the start of all that God has in
[time=3490] store for you so reach out to us we will mail one of those books to you you can come by here at the office at the church and we'd be glad to hand one to you in person but either way let us know what God is doing in your life and I can promise you he is just getting started and our commitment
[time=3505] is to walk with you to shoulder the load beside you to bear burdens alongside of you we have these
[time=3511] things called life groups they're small groups of people because we believe that life is better together we'd love to get you connected into one of those life groups so that you could not just plug into what's happening on Sunday mornings at Black Hawk but to be able to be the church throughout the week together with other people who struggle just like you who have wins just like you who have losses just like you we're in this together and it's an honor a joy and a privilege to
