[time=202] All I have, I get to you, my God. Take my hands, to take my hands and make them clean.

[time=483] like a val that is tested, like a covenant of gold. Your love is enduring through the winter rain,
[time=499] and beyond the horizon with mercy for today. And faithful you have been.
[time=512] And faithful you will be. You played yourself to me, and it's why I sing. Your praise will never be on my lips,
[time=527] your praise will never be on my lips, your praise will never be on my lips,

[time=569] You follow your plan, your kindness makes us whole, your shoulder weakness,
[time=580] your strength becomes our own. Now you're making me like you, holding me in wide,
[time=591] bringing beauty from ashes, where you will have your pride, free of all her gifts,
[time=602] rid of all her shame, and you don't buy her through the air. And it's why I sing. Your praise will never be on my lips,
[time=616] ever be on my lips, your praise will never be on my lips, ever be on my lips,
[time=626] your praise will never be on my lips, ever be on my lips, your praise will never be on my lips,

[time=657] we will be friends, we will be friends, with angels and saints, we sing worthy, are you loved,
[time=701] you will be friends, you will be friends, you will be friends, you will be friends, you will be friends,
[time=722] ever be on my lips, your praise will never be on my lips, ever be on my lips.
[time=743] Thank you so much for tuning in today. We here at Black Hawk Ministries cannot wait just to see God inspire and work in your life today.
[time=753] I want to challenge you before I share about where we're going with our new series today to connect with us.
[time=758] We want to hear your story, we want to walk with you, we want to know what God's doing in your life so we can show you some next steps and go on that journey with you.
[time=766] Several ways you can connect with us. My favorite is through our church app, Black Hawk Church app, you can just search for that in your app store.
[time=773] You can look at what messages are coming up when you go to this week's message, you can send in prayer requests, you can see what events we have going on at our church, that and so much more there.
[time=783] As well as our website, blackcockministries.org, we stream our services live there at 10.30am every Sunday morning and you can find lots more information as well as past messages on that website.
[time=794] You can also go on our social media platforms, just look for the Bible Hour or for Black Hawk Ministries on Facebook or on Twitter or Instagram, just look for @bhawkMinistries.
[time=805] We'd love to hear from you, we'd love to connect with you through all of those platforms.
[time=809] But today, I cannot wait for you to hear from our outreach pastor, Christian Whitmer. You are going to be blessed to hear from his heart, to hear some of his story even as he leads us through Psalm 121.
[time=821] The reason he's in Psalm 121 is we're starting a brand new focus for this summer on the Psalms.
[time=826] The book of the Psalms is really just a divinely inspired hymn book, if you will, where we get to hear from God through the venue of songs.
[time=834] If you like music like I do, it's going to be a blessing to you. What I love about this series is we're calling it The Songs of Jesus.
[time=841] Jesus not only quoted the Psalms, but Jesus is in every Old Testament book.
[time=846] Now, all the Old Testament books were before Jesus came on the scene, but they all point to the good news of the Gospel, the good news of Jesus himself.
[time=854] Therefore, we're calling it Songs of Jesus.
[time=857] Not only is it going to be a great time for you to hear from Jesus, but those songs are, I believe, going to transform your summer.
[time=864] We can't wait to see what God does in your heart, in your life, in your journey this summer as we go through this amazing book of songs together, Songs of Jesus.
[time=873] Sit back, relax, know that you're a part of our extended family at Black Hawk today, that we love you and we can't wait to see what God is going to do in your life.
[time=884] There is a truth, older than the ages. There is a promise of things yet to come.
[time=898] There is one born for our salvation. Jesus, there is a light that overwhelms darkness, there is a kingdom that forever reigns.
[time=926] There is real, from the chains of binders. Jesus, Jesus, who walks upon the walls, who speaks to the sea, who stands in the fire beside me.
[time=954] He roars like a lion, he bled as a lamb, he carries my healing in his hands.
[time=968] Jesus, there is a name that calls in times of travel. There is a song that comforts in the night. There is a voice that comes to strong the ages.
[time=995] Jesus, Jesus, who walks upon the walls, who speaks to the sea, who stands in the fire beside me.
[time=1015] He roars like a lion, he bled as a lamb, he carries my healing in his hands. Jesus.
[time=1035] The sign, my Savior, there is power in your name. You're my rock and my Redeemer, there is power in your name, in your name.
[time=1064] You walk upon the waters, you speak to the sea, you stand in the fire beside me.
[time=1082] You are like a lion, you bled as a lamb, you carry my healing in your name.
[time=1094] You walk upon the waters, you speak to the sea, you stand in the fire beside me.
[time=1109] You roar like a lion, you bled as a lamb, you carry my healing in your hands. Jesus.
[time=1127] There is no one like you, Jesus. There is no one like you.
[time=1144] I am really excited about today, are you excited about today?
[time=1148] That was pretty weak, are you excited about today?
[time=1151] Good, I'm excited about today because we're kicking off a new series in the book of Psalms, and it's called Songs of Jesus. Jesus quoted the Psalms, Jesus was all about quoting scripture and the Psalms were a big part of that.
[time=1164] And to kick off this series today, I've got Christian Whitmer, who is our outreach pastor has been with us for the last few months, and his job is overseeing a lot of different things, all of our ways that our ministries here at Black Talk Ministries connect to the community and the world around us.
[time=1180] And so that's including all of our web, all of our print, all of our technology in so many different areas of making sure that our ministries are known in the community because Jesus built his church so that it would be known in the community.
[time=1192] Can I get a name, man? I'm so glad of it.
[time=1194] And so as he comes and shares today, Christian, come on up and join us.
[time=1197] Christian and I have been doing ministry together since 2009, and so we've been able to do a lot of ministry off and on for a lot of years, and he followed God's call to come up and fill some big needs here at Black Talk.
[time=1209] And so Christian, thank you for doing that.
[time=1211] And I want to ask you now as he kicks off this series, well before I do, one thing you should know, I told a story a little while back about Christian and I, almost in that ministry time together, we almost burned a church down together.
[time=1224] And those of you who are here know what I'm talking about.
[time=1227] Those of you who are not here, you don't need to know.
[time=1229] All right.
[time=1230] So I want to ask you now just to join me.
[time=1232] Give your full attention.
[time=1233] I know you're going to be blessed today as God speaks through this guy and shares his heart with you.
[time=1237] Give a warm welcome to Christian Whitman this morning.
[time=1239] Share your heart, man.
[time=1240] Love you, bro.
[time=1241] Thanks, Kevin.
[time=1243] As Kevin said, we started our ministry career about eight years ago, which it really doesn't feel like that long.
[time=1252] I was kind of doing the math this week and eight years ago, but I like to think that God started our path together much sooner.
[time=1259] In fact, it's kind of a little nugget that we've had figured out, I guess last year or the year before, even, that back in, it was around 2000, I was on a youth trip to Panama City Beach, Florida.
[time=1271] And I accepted the call in the ministry as a young man.
[time=1274] And about four years after that, I was from Kentucky at the time on a youth trip.
[time=1280] And about four years after that, there was another young man from Georgia that accepted the call in the ministry two miles from that exact spot.
[time=1288] Where I was.
[time=1289] And I just like to think that even then that God had our paths headed so that way one day that we would meet, that we would cross, and we would have now done ministry together for eight years, which is just incredible.
[time=1301] So thank you for those kind words, Kevin.
[time=1304] I want to talk about our story and talking about just our paths.
[time=1310] There's been several times in my life where I felt like a pilgrim.
[time=1313] One was actually back in March here when I moved to Indiana for the first time and left Georgia, felt very much like a pilgrim, very much like I was going on a spiritual journey, very much that I was trying something new for the first time.
[time=1330] And before that, I guess probably when I moved from Kentucky to Georgia, where I finally met Kevin, was probably a time where I felt like a pilgrim.
[time=1339] And one of my earliest memories where I really felt very much like a pilgrim was in college.
[time=1345] And so when I first went off to college, as many of you know, college is such a time of just self discovery and new challenges and there's this whole world out there that I had no idea existed.
[time=1356] And by that I mean like paying bills.
[time=1358] What is that, right?
[time=1359] And so when I first went to college and we have all these new things and all this was going around.
[time=1364] And I remember that first semester in particular just being incredibly difficult.
[time=1369] Not so much the schoolwork or the challenges of, you know, like finding lunch and you know that, but just all of the other life stuff, you know, paying bills and trying to like set my own sleep schedule, right?
[time=1382] Because you can't stay up for 24 hours at a time, 48 hours at a time, right?
[time=1387] Like I actually have to go to bed and do these things. And so I remember just that time being very difficult and I remember that our, the dorm that I lived in my first, this was about two years, lived in a dorm was called Broadway.
[time=1401] And it was at the bottom of a hill.
[time=1403] And I know, I thought about this as I was going to tell the story today and I thought, you know, now that I live here in Indiana, I don't really know what hills are here in Indiana.
[time=1414] I'm not sure, I had a chance, last night I had to be with the ravers and I'm out there at their place.
[time=1421] And you can see for like five miles around in every direction and there's like, there's no hills, okay?
[time=1427] And he's trying to point out like, oh well, see over there, there's kind of like a rut and like that's not a hill.
[time=1433] So I want to give you a little bit of more of an idea like what a hill is since I'm here in Indiana.
[time=1437] And so this is the kind of hill that a lot of people rode their bikes around campus and rode their bikes, you know, to and from class and lunch.
[time=1444] So this is the kind of hill where if you woke up that morning, got out of the dorm and got on your bike, by the time you got to the bottom of this hill, you realize that was a bad idea and you just hop off the bike and walk it up the hill.
[time=1458] And it was that kind of hill where like, you didn't care if people saw you walking your bike up the hill because they knew, like they knew it was okay, there was no judgment.
[time=1466] And so there's that kind of hill.
[time=1468] And on this particular day that I remember, this hill just started to represent my life for me.
[time=1476] And I felt like that I was on an uphill battle in every possible way.
[time=1481] And I didn't want to go to class, like I didn't want to get up in the morning, I didn't want to have to tackle this hill every single day.
[time=1490] And I remember going up this hill, headed to class one day, and just saying, "God, how, how, where are you at?
[time=1503] How am I going to do this? How am I going to do this life? How am I going to get through this?
[time=1506] How am I going to survive four more years of this?
[time=1509] I've only been at this for a few months and this is miserable.
[time=1512] I need help.
[time=1514] And I remember looking up over to my right.
[time=1517] I had never seen it before. I'd walk this hill every day for months now.
[time=1521] And I'd never seen it before, but up all over to my right, through the trees, I could see the steeple, the large, white, narrow steeple of the first Baptist church that was right off side the campus.
[time=1533] And I remember in that moment, just being in awe of God, and in that small moment that he would speak to me and say, "I'm here.
[time=1541] I'm just right here. You've got to look up and see me. I'm right there." And so, in that exact moment, the words to how great that art, that him, came to my mind.
[time=1552] And as I stood in awe of God thinking about how my soul sings, how great that art God, I went back to my room, probably skipped class that day now that I tell the story.
[time=1565] I don't remember, because I remember going back to my room, which is probably a bad idea. Don't do that.
[time=1570] I went back to my room and printed out, looked up on the internet, printed out words to the song, how great that art, and tacked him up right beside my desk.
[time=1581] So, I would always remember to be in awe of God in every day and to always look up and see him.
[time=1588] It's amazing how, like in those moments, that the songs and the hymns of our childhood come back to us, and we remember them.
[time=1596] And those words, as I remember how great that art, there was a song this morning that's come now found that I had in my head on my way here this morning for some weird reason.
[time=1604] But we think about those songs, and songs go back so far in the history.
[time=1610] We've always had music with us. We've always had songs with us.
[time=1613] The Israelites, as they left Egypt, would sing about deliverance and sing about leaving Egypt.
[time=1620] King David wrote many, many songs, and in fact, we have them, a lot of them recorded, in our Bible, and that is in the songs.
[time=1629] In fact, really, the songs are a divinely inspired hymnbook.
[time=1634] We have a collection of songs and prayers and promises and challenges from God that were divinely inspired and written over the years.
[time=1643] The songs were used in public gatherings for song and prayer.
[time=1647] I think about Mary and Joseph actually would have sung the songs, as Mary cooked in when she was in the kitchen, and when Joseph was building pables and chairs, that they would have sang the songs and even taught a young Jesus.
[time=1663] The songs. Jesus would have known the songs, would have sung the songs with Mary and Joseph.
[time=1669] And we know that Jesus loved the songs, as I think Kevin mentioned this morning, that he quoted the songs many times.
[time=1676] In fact, he quoted the book of songs more than any other book of the Bible, and even quoted the songs on the cross.
[time=1683] This we'll be hearing more about later in the series.
[time=1686] And the songs really were, then, the song book of Jesus, the songs of Jesus, as we call the series.
[time=1694] And not only were they the songs of Jesus because Jesus knew and sung them, but the songs are the songs of Jesus because they are about Jesus.
[time=1705] The day that I pinned up the song, how great they are on my desk, I pinned up another song that day.
[time=1718] And that song was Psalm 121. It was one of the earliest songs that I had memorized as a child.
[time=1728] And so today, if you would turn your Bible with me to Psalm 121, I'd like just to read it together and see what God has for us in this song.
[time=1737] Psalm 121 starts off a song of a sense.
[time=1742] I lift up my eyes to the hills from where does my help come?
[time=1748] My help comes from the Lord who made heaven and earth.
[time=1754] He will not let your foot be moved. He who keeps you will not slumber.
[time=1759] Behold, he who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
[time=1765] The Lord is your keeper. The Lord is your shade on your right hand. The sun will not strike you by day nor the moon by night.
[time=1775] The Lord will keep you from all evil. He will keep your life.
[time=1780] The Lord will keep your going out and your coming in from this time forth and forevermore.
[time=1792] I love for the songs I think began with my mother.
[time=1797] My mother just an incredibly godly woman in such a role model in my life, especially early on growing up.
[time=1804] I remember that if you woke up early enough, chances are you would find my mother somewhere.
[time=1811] That was a nice day. She would be outside on a chair, couch, and she would have her Bible open. She would have a journal and a pen.
[time=1822] If you wanted to make a safe bet, you could probably bet that mom was in the songs every morning in the songs.
[time=1831] My mother has a thing where she reads the songs and she comes across prayers and songs and promises of God
[time=1840] that she will actually take her pen and either date if there is a particular date that she has prayed this song
[time=1848] or there is a particular person that she would like pray this song over. She would initial.
[time=1853] If you take my mother's Bible even now, you could open it up and flip through the songs and see little CW's.
[time=1859] Christian Whitmers throughout the songs where she had prayed those over me.
[time=1864] Sometimes when my father, we got news that my father had had cancer, DW, Daniel Whitmer right there in the songs,
[time=1874] praying over my father. When we found out that my father's cancer, they was cancer free, they had gone.
[time=1881] DW, praise God with his songs. When my niece and nephew were born.
[time=1886] And I haven't talked about this, but I imagine that the day that I moved to Indiana here back in March
[time=1892] and maybe even today as I preached through Psalm 121, CW.
[time=1897] So that's how I began my journey in the songs and my love for the songs.
[time=1902] And I think the reason I pinned up Psalm 121 that day is Psalm 121 is about a pilgrimage, about a pilgrimage.
[time=1910] That's how I felt that day that I was a pilgrim of sorts.
[time=1914] And see, there's a heading right at the beginning of the songs and sometimes we skip those as we read through the Bible because, like, I ordered all those headings for, I don't really know, skip getting the good stuff.
[time=1923] But I want to point it out, it says a song of the ascents.
[time=1925] And so in Israel, there were three festivals, or three Jewish festivals in which the people would travel to Jerusalem for.
[time=1934] And as they traveled to Jerusalem, Jerusalem would have been up on a hill.
[time=1938] And marching to Jerusalem was not like today, like where we would hop in a car and run to Indy, okay?
[time=1945] Or it's nice and paved and incredibly, incredibly flat and straight.
[time=1950] Because, as I said, we are in Indiana.
[time=1954] In fact, the road to Jerusalem would have been incredibly treacherous, right?
[time=1961] So you would have had robbers and bandits.
[time=1963] I mean, think about the Good Samaritan.
[time=1966] Like, that's kind of the story that we're talking about, where someone is traveling and they get taken and beaten.
[time=1973] And during these festivals, like, they, you know, there wasn't a respecter of persons.
[time=1977] Like, if you were old or young or pregnant or, you know, as we know that, like, Mary when she was pregnant and was going to Bethlehem for the census.
[time=1987] Like, it was that kind of thing where just very treacherous, very dangerous.
[time=1991] There would have been a ton of fear as people.
[time=1994] And so this is the songs that, and there's several of them in this passage that were the songs of the ascents.
[time=2001] And so it was songs that they would have sang to each other and sang with each other as a group as they're completely terrified of what's happening all around them.
[time=2009] All of the hills and the things that were going on in this overwhelming journey.
[time=2013] And they would have sang to each other and for comfort on the, on the ascent to Jerusalem.
[time=2020] And I think as a, as I said, as a young pilgrim just in college.
[time=2025] As I stood at that bottom of that hill looking up, thinking about what that hill represented in my entire life.
[time=2032] That I felt, I felt that in that moment.
[time=2035] That I was, I was on a pilgrimage.
[time=2037] That the world was big and scary around me.
[time=2040] That all of the fear and the feelings of overwhelming theness that I had.
[time=2044] That I could take comfort from this particular songs.
[time=2049] And so I think back to that, that moment, I don't even know that I really, you know, I don't even know that I really understood that songs.
[time=2058] And I don't even know that in that moment that I completely understood everything.
[time=2062] But I knew that, that that gave me comfort.
[time=2065] And so as I think back on that, there's four things that, that I would have liked to have told my younger self in that moment standing at the bottom of the hill.
[time=2074] And so today as we, as we go through it, just really this is a sermon from me to me.
[time=2080] And you guys can just listen in on what I would kind of tell myself that young man standing at the bottom of the hill feeling completely overwhelmed about life.
[time=2090] And the first thing I would say is look up, look up.
[time=2095] And that's probably the only thing I did do, right?
[time=2097] Because I did look up and I saw the steeple.
[time=2099] And if you're like me so many times when you're going through life or you hit a roadblock, our tendency is to look down, right?
[time=2106] To droop our head.
[time=2108] And the problem with that is, is that our hope is just right in front of us.
[time=2112] Our hope is there.
[time=2114] Look up, look up child, look up young man, look up young lady.
[time=2119] Hope is just right there.
[time=2123] I think the next thing I would want to tell myself is, make sure you recognize as the, as the verse says, I lift up my eyes to the hills from where does my help come from.
[time=2134] My help comes from the Lord.
[time=2140] I think that second one is to recognize the source of our help.
[time=2145] Because if you're like me, this is most often where I turn for the source of my help.
[time=2152] When something goes wrong, my number one inclination is to go to Christian for help, right?
[time=2159] To rely on myself, like I can figure this out.
[time=2163] I can do this.
[time=2165] And so, so normally, and if I'm not turning to God, I'm turning to Christian for help.
[time=2170] Number one, the source of my help would be Christian.
[time=2172] And then if I can't figure it out, I go to my friends, right?
[time=2175] I pull friends around.
[time=2177] You know, sometimes at different times in my life, I was pulling godly friends and sometimes throughout my life, I pulled ungodly friends into that circle to try to help me figure this out, help me figure life out.
[time=2189] And then if all else failed, I would end up on my knees before God's saying, what do I do?
[time=2196] I'm a mess.
[time=2197] I'm a wreck.
[time=2198] Please help me.
[time=2200] Now, my question for you is today is, as you run into situations in life, where does your help come from?
[time=2207] It's easy for us to give that Sunday school answer, and it's kind of like the church smile and say, oh, yeah, things great.
[time=2213] My help comes from God.
[time=2215] The real question is, how do you live your life?
[time=2218] Do you live your life in a way that other people would say, oh, yeah, I see them.
[time=2222] Their help definitely comes from God.
[time=2224] Or do we live our life in a way where we're relying on our finances?
[time=2228] And if I just make enough money, I can make most of my problems go away, right?
[time=2233] If I can just get a better job, that can be the source of my help, and I can make most of my problems go away.
[time=2241] Maybe it's my status, right?
[time=2243] Like if I just get a better status and more respect and people see me and think that I'm amazing and great, then all this other stuff can go away.
[time=2252] Maybe it is our friends or ourselves.
[time=2254] Maybe we rely on the government and we say, hey, you know what?
[time=2257] Depending on whose office they're going to make everything right, and it's going to be great, right?
[time=2261] And that's where I rely on my help.
[time=2263] So where today?
[time=2265] And that's where the question I would have for that young man, young Christian, is to say, Christian, where are you putting your source of help right now?
[time=2273] Where are you putting your trust in today?
[time=2276] Is it God?
[time=2278] Is that the way you're living?
[time=2280] Or is that just lip service where you're just saying it?
[time=2285] How are you living your life?
[time=2287] I think the third thing that I would want to tell a young Christian is worship God even at the bottom.
[time=2304] See, for me, it's a lot easier to worship God when everything's going well, right?
[time=2308] We can say, oh, praise God, everything's going well.
[time=2311] But worship God at the bottom of the hill, worship God when you're down.
[time=2319] I love that the Bible doesn't hide away from real pain and like real suffering.
[time=2328] Like some of the imagery in the Bible, especially in Psalms, is just gut wrenching.
[time=2334] And it doesn't hide away from the fact that there are serious, serious issues in life and sin really messes stuff up.
[time=2343] In Psalm 57, David is hiding literally for his life.
[time=2349] He's in a cave and there's an entire army that's coming to kill him.
[time=2354] I don't know that I felt like I had an entire army coming to kill me, but that is where David found himself.
[time=2362] And here's what he says.
[time=2364] He said, "I am in the midst of lions, lions.
[time=2368] I am forced to dwell among ravenous beasts, men whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords."
[time=2379] David's not shying away from the real situation that he's in when he says, "I'm in the midst of lions."
[time=2387] Have you ever felt like the world was against you?
[time=2389] Have you ever been a situation where you felt like the people who were talking about you, who were talking to you,
[time=2395] who were degrading you, whose teeth were spears and arrows, whose tongue was as sharp as a sword?
[time=2403] And just what that does to your self-esteem?
[time=2408] In the very next verse, David says, "But be exalted, O God, above the heavens.
[time=2418] Let your glory be over all the earth."
[time=2424] Even in this moment where David is feeling the weight of the world, it's feeling like I could die at any second,
[time=2432] that God's put me in this position where there's lions surrounding me, I'm at the bottom of a hill looking up and I'm completely overwhelmed by the world.
[time=2439] Even still in that moment, I can say be exalted, O God, above the heavens.
[time=2446] Let your glory be in all the earth." Our psalmist in Psalm 121 recognizes that when he says, "My help comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth."
[time=2458] And in this moment, that he can still worship a creator that made heaven and earth.
[time=2463] Even as he looks out and sees the bandits and the robbers and the people that want to come and kill and steal and destroy his life.
[time=2473] Romans 8 is one of my favorite passages, actually quotes Psalm 42 when it says, "For your sake we face death all day long.
[time=2482] We are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.
[time=2486] We face death all day long as sheep to be slaughtered."
[time=2493] In the very next verse it says, "But in all things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us."
[time=2502] And Romans, they're telling us, "Look up, look up because we are more than conquerors in all things through Jesus who loves us."
[time=2513] Today, we're just saying there's a beautiful song ever be.
[time=2518] And that part of that song, your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips.
[time=2526] I love that part of the song, it actually comes from Psalm 34.1.
[time=2530] And you can look that up, but your praise will ever be on my lips.
[time=2536] And you know what that means, Church? That means that when my marriage is falling apart, your praise will ever be on my lips, God, ever be on my lips.
[time=2546] Even when I lose my job, your praise God will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips.
[time=2553] It means when I have a family member that's in a hospital and I don't know if they're going to make it out, your praise God will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips.
[time=2564] Then no matter what we're going through, no matter what hill we find ourselves at the bottom of, your praise God will ever be on my lips, ever, forever be on my lips.
[time=2578] And we can sing that because we know about the faithfulness of God.
[time=2585] If I would be able to tell that young man at that time that, "Hey Christian, I know as you look at the bottom of this hill and you look up and you don't know what to do in this world, but I want you to hold on to one thing, hold on to God's promises."
[time=2599] The songs are full of God's promises.
[time=2601] The only one thing about a promise is God always keeps his promise.
[time=2608] In fact, this entire Bible, this entire Bible is truly a chronicle of God keeping his promise over and over and over and over and how he's faithful to show up again and again and again and again.
[time=2622] Hold on to God's promises.
[time=2626] Some of those promises in Psalm 121, that passage begins to go through them starting in verse 3, just reading these out loud.
[time=2635] Verse 3, "He will not let your foot be moved.
[time=2641] He who keeps you will not slumber.
[time=2644] Behold, he who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep."
[time=2650] We serve a God that doesn't sleep.
[time=2654] We serve a God and when we call out to him in the middle of the night, on our knees crying begging because we don't know what else to do, we don't have to wait for him to wake up.
[time=2664] We don't have to wait for God to roll out of bed and try to come find us.
[time=2669] He's right there.
[time=2671] We serve a God who doesn't sleep.
[time=2677] Verse 5, "The Lord is your keeper." Hold on to that promise, "The Lord is your keeper."
[time=2684] "The Lord is your shade on your right hand.
[time=2688] The sun will not shall not strike you by day, nor the moon by night." Is there anyone here today that needs shade?
[time=2696] Is there anyone here today that as the son of life has been beating down on you, that you're just long for shade?
[time=2706] The Lord is our shade.
[time=2709] The Lord will keep you from all evil. He will keep your life.
[time=2713] The Lord will keep, in verse 8, the Lord will keep you going out and you're coming in from this time forth and forevermore.
[time=2724] One of the things I love about verse 8 is, verse 8 is actually a, uses actually some military terminology there that as the army would go out.
[time=2735] And battle that the Lord would keep them.
[time=2740] The Lord would protect them. The Lord would fight for them.
[time=2743] But then even as they returned home that the Lord would keep them even in that moment too.
[time=2752] I think there's a lot of people here today that feel like they're out to battle.
[time=2757] They feel like they're trying to tackle this hill, whatever it is in your life on your own.
[time=2762] That you feel alone, that you feel helpless, that you feel like you're fighting.
[time=2766] Every time you turn a corner, there's another battle. Every time you wake up, there's a new challenge.
[time=2771] And that you feel like that you're out fighting the battle and this first tells us that you're kept by God even in those times.
[time=2780] But even so, the Lord will also keep you as you come home.
[time=2788] And for a lot of people here today, it's time to come home.
[time=2793] It's time to return to the shade of our Father, God.
[time=2799] It's time to take that step, to look up, to realize that God has all of these promises and these great things for His children.
[time=2809] To hold fast to those promises and to come home.
[time=2816] There's another story of a hill.
[time=2825] And this particular hill was outside of a large city, a rural, very populous city.
[time=2831] And right beside this hill was, we believe, a fairly major road that would have led people in and out of the city.
[time=2840] And also nearby, there was a garden. You got a hill, road, garden. Are you almost there with me?
[time=2849] And in this garden, there was a tomb that had been cut out of stone.
[time=2855] And that tomb had never been used.
[time=2860] An early one morning word went out that there was an execution happening on top of this hill.
[time=2869] And people from all over the city would have gathered at the base of this hill to see the execution.
[time=2878] And if you had been there that day, if you had gotten the word and showed up at the hill and stood at the bottom of the hill and looked up,
[time=2888] you would have seen the hope of the world die for you and me.
[time=2894] As Jesus was crucified and bled and died on that hill, we call Calvary.
[time=2904] And no matter where you find yourself today, no matter what hill you find yourself at the bottom of,
[time=2912] today you can look up and see the resurrected Son of God, who died for you and me,
[time=2926] who's seated at the right hand, and his name is Jesus.
[time=2934] I don't know where your journey began. I don't know how you got here today.
[time=2943] But I do know that whatever circumstance you find yourself in, God's not sleeping on you.
[time=2952] He's not asleep on you. He's awake. He's alert. And he loves you.
[time=2958] He loves you so much that he would send his son to stand in your place on a cross.
[time=2968] Just bow your head and close your eyes with me today.
[time=2973] If you're here today and you say, Pastor Christian, my hill seems pretty overwhelming.
[time=2984] I need prayer. Pray for me. Just lift your hand up. Just let me see you.
[time=2990] If you say, I've got a hill, then I don't know how to conquer it. I see you. I see you back there.
[time=2995] Say, I see you back here and I hear all over the building. I see you. I see you. I see you up in the balcony.
[time=3011] I think our message for you today is to look up, hold to God's promises, hold fast to him.
[time=3019] We're going to have a time here in a minute where we can pray.
[time=3024] We're going to sing a song called All My Hope. And all my hope, our hope, our the source of our hope, the source of our strength, the source of life is in Jesus.
[time=3036] And if you've never tapped into that before, if you've never got to a place in your life where you're trusting Jesus, and you say, Pastor Christian, I want to trust Jesus today.
[time=3049] I want to take that first step of salvation. Raise your hand. Put your hand up.
[time=3055] If you would say, Pastor Christian, I want to trust Jesus for the first time today. Put your hand up. Put your hand up.
[time=3064] We want to pray for you. We want to walk alongside of you. And so here in just a few minutes, we're going to sing. All of my hope is in Jesus.
[time=3077] And if you want to pray at your seat or you want to pray with a friend or if your family wants to get together and say, you know what, we're going to tackle this hill together.
[time=3086] But we're going to tackle it for maybe the first time with Jesus at the front. Then do so. You can do it in your seat. You can come forward. You can pray at the altar. I'd be happy to pray with you.
[time=3097] And if you want to trust Jesus for the very first time, we want to hear from you and we want to walk alongside of you.
[time=3105] So please let us know we can come forward. Now you can find us after the service. But today, let today be your day where you trust Jesus.
[time=3117] No matter where you find yourself, no matter which hill you find yourself at the bottom of.
[time=3135] Light in my darkness. Peace for my soul. You are my rescue. You'll never let go.
[time=3181] All my hope is in you. All my strength is in you with every breath. My soul will rest in you.
[time=3203] Here in my weakness, always the same. Your love is my shelter. Your life is my way.
[time=3226] All my hope is in you. All my strength is in you with every breath. My soul will rest in you.
[time=3273] God, stay, stay, your friend forever. Lord, you have my heart.
[time=3296] Sure foundation, ever failing. Lord, you have my heart.
[time=3315] Let's all stand and sing that.
[time=3339] Sure foundation, ever failing. Lord, you have my heart.
[time=3365] All my hope is in you. All my strength is in you with every breath. My soul will rest in you.
[time=3388] All the earth beneath you. All my life before you with every breath. My soul will rest in you with every breath.
[time=3411] With every breath, my soul will rest in you. All with every breath.
[time=3424] With every breath, my soul will rest in you.
[time=3439] Look up. I hope those two words may mean something new to you in this moment. Perhaps looking up for you today means you looked up and you see Jesus in a new life.
[time=3449] Maybe God has spoken to you and said today is the day of salvation. As Pastor Christian has shared with you today, God really prompted you in your heart and your spirit to know that I need to lay my life down at the foot of the cross. I need to give my life to Jesus.
[time=3462] You know we use a lot of different phrases to talk about salvation in the church, but really what it all comes down to is your surrender. You're saying, "I can't save me Jesus, so I need you to do that."
[time=3473] If you can get to that place in your heart believing that he died for you, believing that he rose again, then you shall be saved according to Scripture.
[time=3482] It's a promise. It's not something that's contingent on how good of a mood God is in. It's not something that's contingent on how well you did that week. It's something that comes to you by grace through faith. It's not of us. It's all about him.
[time=3495] Take that step. If you haven't taken it before, take that leap of faith and know that we're here to walk with you. We even have a resource we'd love to get into your hands today.
[time=3503] It's simply called beginning steps, a growth guide for new believers. We'll mail this to you. You can pick one up here at Black Hawk Ministries, but we want to get one of these in your hands. If you've given your life to Jesus, if you're ready to follow him in believers' baptism, if you're ready to find a life group, you're starting this journey, we want to help you with all of those pieces.
[time=3522] To wrap up today, I want to challenge you with this. I truly believe in my heart that somebody came in today, that maybe you tuned in today, and your head was down, and you were discouraged, and you couldn't really look up and see anything that God was doing.
[time=3537] But I believe that God has lifted perhaps your chin today, and it's time for you to look up to see Jesus for who he truly is as we look at the songs of Jesus, and this week is going to be totally different in your life because he has lifted your chin, and you can look up to the source, the maker of your help, the maker of your life, the creator of the universe who loves you right where you are. Thanks for tuning in. Join me next week as we continue this series, Songs of Jesus. See you then.
