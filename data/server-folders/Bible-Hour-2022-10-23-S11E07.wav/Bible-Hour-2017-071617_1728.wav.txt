[time=466] In Jesus' name, thank God, amen.
[time=475] Praising grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[time=490] I once was lost, but now I found was blind, but now I see you.
[time=504] The Lord has promised good to me, his word, my hope, secure.
[time=525] He will my shield and horse and me as long as life endures.
[time=543] When we've been there ten thousand years, bright shining as the sun.
[time=562] We love the day to sing God's praise.
[time=573] Then when we first begin.
[time=585] By his stripes, we are healed, by his nephews as we're free.
[time=598] By his blood, when we was clean, now we have the victory.
[time=612] The power of sin is broken, Jesus overcame it all.
[time=625] He is the one I've freed up, Jesus has won it all.
[time=639] Hallelujah, you have won the victory.
[time=652] Hallelujah, you have won it all for me.
[time=662] That could not hold you down.
[time=668] You are the reason, King, sitting majesty.
[time=681] You are the reason, King.
[time=688] By his stripes, we are healed, by his nephews as we're free.
[time=701] By his blood, when we was clean, now we have the victory.
[time=715] The power of sin is broken, Jesus has stolen the pain.
[time=728] He has won our freedom, Jesus has won it all.
[time=738] Hallelujah.
[time=746] You have won the victory.
[time=751] Hallelujah.
[time=759] You have won it all for me.
[time=763] It's death that could not hold you down.
[time=770] You are the reason, King.
[time=777] Sitting majesty.
[time=783] You are the reason, King.
[time=787] It's death that could not hold you down.
[time=796] You are the reason, King.
[time=802] Sitting majesty.
[time=807] You are the reason, King.
[time=813] It's death that could not hold you down.
[time=820] You are the reason, King.
[time=843] Our God is risen.
[time=847] He is alive.
[time=850] He is amazing.
[time=853] He reigns on high.
[time=856] Our God is risen.
[time=860] He is alive.
[time=863] He's won the victory.
[time=866] He reigns on high.
[time=869] Hallelujah.
[time=877] You have won the victory.
[time=882] Hallelujah.
[time=890] You have won it all for me.
[time=896] It's death that could not hold you down.
[time=903] You are the reason, King.
[time=910] Sitting majesty.
[time=916] You are the reason, King.
[time=925] Yes.
[time=939] The Lord is shepherd, I shall not want.
[time=949] In green pastures He makes me lie down.
[time=956] He restores my soul and leads me on for His name.
[time=966] For His great name.
[time=970] Surely goodness, surely mercy.
[time=978] Right beside me, you are my day.
[time=985] And I will dwell in your house forever.
[time=993] And unless your holy name, you prepare.
[time=1001] You prepare to table right before me.
[time=1008] In the presence of my enemies.
[time=1015] Though the arrows fly in the terror of light is at my door.
[time=1025] I trust you.
[time=1029] Surely goodness, surely mercy.
[time=1036] Right beside me, you are my day.
[time=1044] And I will dwell in your house forever.
[time=1053] And unless your holy name.
[time=1059] And even though I walk through the valley of the shadow day,
[time=1065] I will feel no evil.
[time=1073] And even though I walk through the valley of the shadow day,
[time=1079] you are by my side.
[time=1087] And even though I walk through the valley of the shadow day,
[time=1094] I will feel no evil.
[time=1101] And even though I walk through the valley of the shadow day,
[time=1107] you are by my side.
[time=1114] Surely goodness, surely mercy.
[time=1122] Right beside me, you are my day.
[time=1129] And I will dwell in your house forever.
[time=1137] And unless your holy name.
[time=1152] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1158] Love Psalm 23.
[time=1160] If you got your Bibles, look there with me.
[time=1162] Psalm 23.
[time=1164] We're in a series right now called The Songs of Jesus.
[time=1167] And in this series, we are looking at several different Psalms, but the focus is how Jesus is in every book of the Bible.
[time=1175] Now, maybe you don't know, but Jesus hasn't come onto the scene yet and David wrote this Psalm and many of the other Psalms that we maybe know so well.
[time=1184] Maybe they're new to us, but Jesus hasn't technically come onto the scene yet, but every book of the Bible contains this one that we call Jesus.
[time=1193] Anybody excited about Jesus today?
[time=1196] Just a sweet spirit in this place, and I thank you for just diving into what God has for your life.
[time=1201] If you don't know me, my name is Kevin.
[time=1203] And if you're a guest with us, we want to say welcome.
[time=1205] Sit back and relax. You're coming in the middle of this series, but there's a relevant word for you today.
[time=1210] Not because I am here, but because Jesus is.
[time=1213] And he's got something special for you.
[time=1215] I also want to welcome all of our extended Black Hawk family.
[time=1218] We have our family here in the room, but we have a lot of people who watch us online and through television.
[time=1224] So if you're at home in your PJs on your screen, we welcome you as well.
[time=1228] So it's great to serve a body of Jesus that goes far beyond what we could ever imagine
[time=1234] or ask or think. Can I get an amen?
[time=1237] Can I tell you what I believe?
[time=1239] I believe. You've got to talk to me, by the way, if you don't know me very well.
[time=1242] You've got to talk. I preach way better when you talk back to me.
[time=1247] You know what I believe? I believe a lot of things.
[time=1250] But one of the things that I do believe is that somebody came in here today in the middle of a valley.
[time=1257] And what I believe is that somebody that came in today in the middle of a valley is going to leave, not with that valley erased, but with a completely different perspective and outlook on how to walk through that valley.
[time=1271] I believe that with all my heart. I believe that somebody's here and God's been pulling at your heart and you've been pushing away from Jesus.
[time=1278] Maybe you're skeptical about the whole church thing or the Jesus thing that we talk about in church and you don't even know if you really want to be here, but maybe you have the drug problem.
[time=1286] I had a drug problem going up. I got drug to church, Sundays, Wednesdays.
[time=1289] Every time the door was open, maybe you got drug here by somebody today and here you sit.
[time=1294] But I believe if you don't know Jesus, he's going to meet you where you are and your life is going to be changed when you leave today.
[time=1301] I believe that. I want to talk to you about walking through the valley from Psalm 23.
[time=1306] One of the most used familiar Psalms in all of the Bible.
[time=1310] One of the most familiar scriptures in all of the Bible.
[time=1314] A lot of times we'll read it at funerals. It's often become the funeral Psalm.
[time=1319] I've used it at funerals that I've done, but I think it's a lot more to it than just a funeral Psalm.
[time=1325] I think there's some relevant stuff that I can't wait to share with you today.
[time=1329] Let's look at Psalm 23. As you find your spot there, let me ask you this.
[time=1333] Do you ever find the valleys of life? You do have those, right?
[time=1338] Do you ever find that the valleys of life sometimes just get the best of you?
[time=1343] I know I do. Sometimes they just get the best of us.
[time=1347] But today we're going to talk about how to walk through the valley.
[time=1351] Somebody say through. We're going to walk through the valley today.
[time=1355] Who's ready for the word this morning? Psalm 23.
[time=1359] We're just saying it beautifully, but I want to read it to you.
[time=1361] I'm going to read from the English standard version.
[time=1363] It's the same version as the Bibles and the seats surrounding you.
[time=1366] Or if you want to follow along with your tablets or whatever.
[time=1368] Hold your Bible if you've got one.
[time=1370] If your Bible is glowing, it don't count. I'm just kidding.
[time=1374] Those count too. In fact, you've got all the versions there.
[time=1377] Let's look at Psalm 23. Start there in verse 1.
[time=1380] There's six verses and I love this Psalm. Let's read it together.
[time=1383] It says, "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.
[time=1387] He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[time=1390] He leads me besides still waters. He restores my soul.
[time=1395] He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
[time=1400] Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. For you are with me.
[time=1407] Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[time=1410] You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[time=1415] You anoint my head with oil. My cup overflows.
[time=1420] Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.
[time=1426] And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever." And everybody said.
[time=1432] Beautiful passage. What I love about it is that there's action in every verse.
[time=1437] There's verbs. There are verbs in every verse that I want to share with you today that I think can apply and give some actionable items to the valley that maybe you're walking through today.
[time=1448] I'm not going to give you the bottom line. I try to give you a bottom line just so you know.
[time=1451] What are we looking at today? What's the point?
[time=1453] I try not to pull any punches. I just share straight from the word.
[time=1456] That's what we believe in black call. The word has the last word every week.
[time=1460] And so we're going to dig into this passage verse by verse.
[time=1463] Your bottom line is this, that when my situation is shaky, my shepherd is steady.
[time=1470] When my situation is shaky, my shepherd is steady.
[time=1475] He's a rock. And that's what this passage, that's what Psalm 23 is about, is about this fact that we have a shepherd. And here's what I'm going to tell you.
[time=1483] You're not promised. A lot of people say, if you come to Jesus, life is better.
[time=1486] I believe that statement, but that does not mean that your situation won't get shaky.
[time=1490] Sometimes it gets shaky-er. Somebody say-er.
[time=1495] Sometimes it gets shaky-er when you decide to follow Jesus and do things his way.
[time=1500] So here's what I'll tell you. You're not promised a perfect situation, but you are promised a perfect shepherd.
[time=1506] And only Christians, only Christians can have a shaky situation but still have a stable, steady life that's rooted in something that's going to last far beyond any situation this world can throw your way.
[time=1519] Only a follower of Jesus can have that. You can have that.
[time=1524] What's your shaky situation? Don't say it out loud.
[time=1528] If you could pick one, you say, I've got a list, which one you want.
[time=1532] If you could pick one, what's that shaky situation that popped into your mind when I started talking to you? You can have stability in the middle of that.
[time=1541] Yes, that. Yes, that.
[time=1544] God's going to meet you there. I truly believe today David wrote this Psalm and he think about who he was. He's a king. He's a shepherd.
[time=1552] He's a murderer. And he's a man after God's own heart.
[time=1559] God met him in the middle of all that stuff.
[time=1563] As a stable, steady shepherd who met a guy who knew what it was like to be on the highest of the mountains and on the lowest of the valleys.
[time=1574] But a guy who knew what it was like to walk through the valley.
[time=1577] I don't know your valley. I don't pretend to know.
[time=1580] I try not to be that guy that says, I know how you feel. No, I don't.
[time=1584] Don't say that, by the way. If you're walking with somebody through a valley, don't say, I know how you feel. No, you don't. Only they do.
[time=1591] And Jesus. But that's why he's that steady shepherd that's going to walk us through it.
[time=1595] And you know a lot of times this Psalm, this funeral Psalm, as we often know it, we miss a lot this there. And today I want to dig into that.
[time=1602] And because really here's what it's all about. This is a Psalm of the leader.
[time=1606] This is the conqueror of nations, King David, the anointed man after God's own heart who knew what it was like to walk through valleys.
[time=1615] This is him writing this as a leader embracing a role of being led.
[time=1621] Think about that for a minute. This is a leader talking about a role that requires him to be led. If he's talking about Jesus, if he's talking about God as his shepherd, what does that make him?
[time=1633] You can say it. You're right. It's not a trick question.
[time=1636] If he's got a shepherd, then he must be a sheep.
[time=1640] That means if God is our shepherd, then we must be a...
[time=1643] Look at somebody tell them they look pretty sheepish today.
[time=1647] You know that's what I want to talk to you about, actually.
[time=1651] How we can be more sheepish, but not the way that you think.
[time=1654] I want to talk about embracing our role as sheep today.
[time=1658] How can we be a good flock? How can we be good followers of Jesus embrace our role as a sheep?
[time=1665] Did you know that no situation is going to come to you that your shepherd can't lead you through?
[time=1672] Some of you don't believe that yet, but you're going to.
[time=1674] Let's talk about how to live as sheep.
[time=1676] I want to give you four action things.
[time=1678] These are verbs. Sometimes pastors at the end of a message will give you some action, some verbs.
[time=1683] Well, all four of my points I'm going to share with you today are actions.
[time=1686] So you better get ready to get busy.
[time=1687] Tell somebody to get busy because we're going to get busy.
[time=1689] Let's do it. Number one, chase the right shepherd.
[time=1693] So we just read all of the six verses of Psalm 23.
[time=1696] Now I want to go back through them one at a time.
[time=1698] Verse one is where we see this, chase the right shepherd.
[time=1702] If God's the shepherd, we're the sheep.
[time=1704] Do you ever wonder why did God pick sheep?
[time=1706] Think about a sheep.
[time=1708] They're not very cool animals at all.
[time=1711] They smell bad. They look bad.
[time=1715] They don't have fangs. They don't have wings.
[time=1718] They can't fly. They can't even go in reverse.
[time=1722] Why does God pick sheep for us?
[time=1725] You feel offended yet? I think I know why.
[time=1728] Sheep are one of the only animals that really when you look at them, they really can't survive very well without a shepherd.
[time=1736] And you may say, well, I'm offended by that, but you know what?
[time=1739] When I look in the mirror, I realize sheep, God, you're probably right.
[time=1743] You ever had those days? I look in the mirror and I say, God, you're right.
[time=1746] I'm a sheep. I feel as dumb as a sheep a lot of times.
[time=1750] Some days I don't. I think I've got it all together, but we're going to talk about that as well.
[time=1754] So we've got to chase the right shepherd.
[time=1756] And so here's what I've done. I've become a sheepologist just to preach this message to you today.
[time=1762] And if you want to become a sheepologist, look at this picture on the screen.
[time=1765] This is the best website about sheep I could find, sheep 101.
[time=1771] Some of you are already pulling your phones out right now to see if it's for real.
[time=1775] And yes, it is for real, sheep101.info.
[time=1779] I want to read it. There's going to be two passages, not from the Bible, but from sheep101 that I want to read. Here's the first one.
[time=1785] Sheep, you'll find this on this site.
[time=1787] Sheep have a strong instinct to follow the sheep in front of them.
[time=1790] When one sheep decides to go somewhere, the rest of the flock usually follows, even if it's not a good decision.
[time=1796] For example, sheep will follow each other to slaughter.
[time=1800] If one sheep jumps over a cliff, the others are likely to follow.
[time=1806] From birth, lambs are conditioned to follow the older sheep of the flock.
[time=1812] The instinct is hardwired into sheep. It's not really something they think about.
[time=1817] Feeling like a sheep yet.
[time=1821] You know I love this song a whole lot.
[time=1823] If I said that before, I think I say that about every passage.
[time=1826] I get accused of that a lot. You say every passage is your favorite passage.
[time=1829] What is? The whole thing is, I just like it all, because it all points to Jesus.
[time=1833] But this is definitely near the top of my list.
[time=1835] And you know, there's three words.
[time=1837] The first three words of this song is really all you need.
[time=1839] Say them with me.
[time=1840] The Lord is.
[time=1843] Say them again.
[time=1844] The Lord is.
[time=1847] That's really all you need to know from this song.
[time=1850] He is the beginning, the end, the alpha, the omega.
[time=1855] He is.
[time=1856] Whatever you're searching for when you came in the doors today, the Lord is.
[time=1860] Whatever gap you feel like you have in your life, the Lord is.
[time=1868] The Lord is.
[time=1870] He is everything you're searching for.
[time=1874] He is what can walk you through the valley that you find yourself in the middle of today.
[time=1880] The Lord is.
[time=1883] Some of you don't believe that yet.
[time=1885] So I'm going to convince you that it starts with us realizing this about the Lord is.
[time=1889] The biggest implication of the Lord is, you ready for this?
[time=1892] So here it is.
[time=1893] Let's look at these words.
[time=1894] The Lord is.
[time=1896] And I want to give you the implication of that.
[time=1898] And that is that if the Lord is, you ain't.
[time=1905] If he is, I ain't.
[time=1907] A lot of times we think that we is because we have been in the middle of some good days.
[time=1913] We've been on the mountaintops and we think that we is because we didn't really need him.
[time=1917] I know it's terrible English, but it's great theology.
[time=1921] The Lord is.
[time=1922] And if the Lord is, then we're not.
[time=1924] It's all about the shepherd because we are just his sheep.
[time=1929] And you know, I've learned as I've embraced my role as a sheep, I find myself in the best places that I could ever find myself in because even in the middle of a valley, I know I have a shepherd who's carrying me at times, a shepherd who's leading me, walking before me, walking with me.
[time=1944] So if the Lord is, it means that we're not.
[time=1946] And you know what?
[time=1947] I'm glad to not be it because if I was it, if I was God, first of all, you should run.
[time=1950] We're at this world's in big trouble.
[time=1953] But I'm not it.
[time=1955] He is it.
[time=1957] The Lord is.
[time=1958] Let's look at the next word.
[time=1959] The Lord is.
[time=1961] My.
[time=1962] The Lord is my.
[time=1963] He's a personal shepherd who's going to meet you in the middle of your struggles and know you.
[time=1969] He's a personal God, a personal shepherd who cares about you in your unique situation.
[time=1974] The Lord is my.
[time=1977] Shepherd, now we add a dynamic to the relationship.
[time=1981] The Lord is.
[time=1982] He is all.
[time=1983] He's the Alpha, the Omega, the beginning, and the end, the first, and the last.
[time=1987] He is my.
[time=1988] He's a personal God, but he is my shepherd.
[time=1990] We add a dynamic to the relationship.
[time=1993] You ever have those dynamics to your relationship?
[time=1996] I'll give you an example.
[time=1997] My wife and I have a dynamic in our relationship.
[time=1999] She says what to do and I do it.
[time=2003] And that getting married 101, right?
[time=2006] We all have dynamics and different dynamics for different relationships.
[time=2011] But this adds the dynamic to our relationship.
[time=2013] That's what this Psalm is really all about.
[time=2015] And you know, if we learn to chase the right shepherd that he is the first and the last,
[time=2021] the beginning and the end, that he is all that we need, then we don't think about this.
[time=2026] You don't any longer have to chase the right situation.
[time=2029] You just chase the right shepherd.
[time=2032] So many of us spend our whole life chasing after a better situation, greener pasture.
[time=2037] Still think you know how to cheat?
[time=2039] We chase after the right situation our whole life, thinking that we're missing out when Jesus is saying just chase the right shepherd.
[time=2047] Know my voice.
[time=2048] John chapter 10.
[time=2049] You can jot that down.
[time=2050] One of my favorite passages says nothing can snatch us from the hand of our Father who is our shepherd.
[time=2056] And Jesus says my sheep know my voice.
[time=2059] My challenge to you is know your shepherd's voice, chase after your shepherd.
[time=2063] Don't be chasing the right situation.
[time=2065] Chase your shepherd, and it doesn't matter what situation you end up in.
[time=2069] When we chase our shepherd, our situation matters less, and our stress levels go down.
[time=2077] Some of you are going to be able to sleep like a baby like we talked about last week because you're going to start chasing the right shepherd.
[time=2084] Because two and three, the second thing I want to tell you, chase the right shepherd, but number two, stop striving.
[time=2092] Stop striving.
[time=2093] You ever met a striver, show me your best driving face.
[time=2099] You've got one.
[time=2101] Your spouse, if they're here, they'd be like, "Mm-hmm, I saw that yesterday." You know what it's like to strive, but you know sometimes I believe that we strive so much that we muddle the voice of our shepherd.
[time=2114] And we can't hear the voice of our shepherd because we're striving so hard.
[time=2118] Psalm 46 verse 10, one of my favorite verses, just says simply be still.
[time=2123] Be still.
[time=2125] And know that I'm God.
[time=2126] You know what that word be still means?
[time=2128] It means to cease.
[time=2130] Cease you're striving perhaps.
[time=2132] Cease means to cease, to stop, to be still, to faint, to weaken, or to let alone.
[time=2139] That's what the word means there in Psalm 46 verse 10.
[time=2144] She know how to rest in the presence of their shepherd.
[time=2146] Look there at verses two and three again.
[time=2148] He leads me, he leads me, and he makes me.
[time=2152] It starts with he makes me lie down in green pastures, then he leads me in quiet waters to still waters.
[time=2160] And you know, I think God has seasons of rest for us, and God wants to give us a buffet of rest sometimes.
[time=2166] And I love in verse three it says that he restores my soul.
[time=2171] He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[time=2174] Has God ever made you just sit down, sit down, boy?
[time=2179] I've been told that a lot of times growing up.
[time=2181] Even more times when I got to sit down, boy, he makes me lie down.
[time=2186] He leads me.
[time=2188] He walks before me.
[time=2190] He walks with me.
[time=2192] And you know what the word rest means, the restore means?
[time=2194] He restores my soul.
[time=2196] I love this in verse three.
[time=2198] It means to make functional again.
[time=2203] Some of your souls have been broken for a long time, and it hasn't been functional.
[time=2208] In the middle of the valley, your soul has been broken, your spirit has been broken.
[time=2212] It hasn't been functional.
[time=2213] The only function that you have is striving and worrying, and there's no being still.
[time=2219] There's no restoration.
[time=2220] There's no rest, but God wants to swoop into the middle of your valley today, and he wants to give you rest, and he wants to restore your soul.
[time=2228] He wants to make functional again that has been broken.
[time=2234] Some of you need that today, because you are so broken.
[time=2239] Don't look at him.
[time=2240] It's probably you.
[time=2241] If you're thinking about looking at somebody else, it's probably you.
[time=2243] Don't throw an elbow, but we get broken.
[time=2246] And that's what I love about our shepherd, is even when we get broken, he walks with us.
[time=2250] And I think God's got a buffet of rest.
[time=2252] And you know you can't have restoration without rest.
[time=2256] It's in the beginning.
[time=2257] R-E-S-T.
[time=2258] You don't get restoration without rest.
[time=2262] Somebody here needs to learn how to rest, needs to learn how to stop striving.
[time=2267] How many self-admitted, self-proclaimed warriors do we have in the room?
[time=2270] Just be honest.
[time=2272] Good for you.
[time=2273] After I preach that hard, you still raise your hand.
[time=2276] I'm proud of you.
[time=2277] I've been there for sure.
[time=2278] We all have that.
[time=2279] How many of you have ever taken a group of children to a buffet before, nor those expensive ones?
[time=2284] Yeah.
[time=2285] I can remember one time, I think it was golden corral.
[time=2289] We went and paid all this money and they charged all this for these kids that are going to nibble with you.
[time=2294] You take them in there and you sit down, you get them a plate of food, and what do you think they say?
[time=2299] Three words.
[time=2301] I'm not hungry.
[time=2305] And then you leave and you spend all that money.
[time=2309] And what's the first thing?
[time=2310] They say two words, about five minutes down the road.
[time=2312] I'm hungry.
[time=2315] I thought about that this week, even with this song when it comes to striving.
[time=2319] I think sometimes we have a buffet of faithfulness, a buffet of promises, a buffet of rest, a
[time=2326] buffet of restoration that God has spread before us.
[time=2330] And so many times we sit down at His table and fold our arms and say, God, I'm not hungry.
[time=2336] And then when we move on and we walk away from His table on our own, we say, I'm hungry.
[time=2341] Why is God not feeding me?
[time=2342] Why is God not giving me rest?
[time=2344] Why is God not meeting me in the middle of the situation?
[time=2346] And God looks at us and says, I can give you a buffet where you just sit down and eat.
[time=2353] Some of you have got to sit down at the table today and find some rest.
[time=2357] Find some restoration because of what God has for you.
[time=2361] He'll make functional again that that was broken.
[time=2363] One of my favorite things about sheep, let's go back to sheep for a minute because we've got to be good ones this week.
[time=2368] My favorite thing about sheep is that sheep don't strive, sheep don't strive.
[time=2375] You ever met a striving sheep?
[time=2377] They just wander around.
[time=2382] You ever met a non-striving person like that?
[time=2385] You wonder if they're just wandering around their whole life.
[time=2387] Is that what I'm saying?
[time=2388] Not to be active?
[time=2389] No.
[time=2390] Let me show you a peaceful sheep.
[time=2391] Look at this sheep.
[time=2392] Look at this guy.
[time=2395] Does he look like he's striving to you?
[time=2399] I want to live life like this guy.
[time=2402] Just relax.
[time=2404] He's found some restoration, folks.
[time=2406] I want to be that kind of sheep.
[time=2408] But some of you don't look like this when you look in the mirror.
[time=2410] You look more like this striving sheep, check him out.
[time=2417] Some of you said, I know him.
[time=2420] You notice I picked the guy, too.
[time=2422] I'm smarter than I look.
[time=2425] So many of us, you better take that guy down.
[time=2427] Nobody's going to hear anything I have to say.
[time=2429] We'll get striving sheep off the screen here.
[time=2431] But I want you to know that some of you are striving so much, you can't hear the voice of your shepherd.
[time=2437] It's time to sit down at the buffet of rest that God has for you.
[time=2440] You know a lot of us, in our identities, we get them consumed.
[time=2446] We get them consumed by what's happening.
[time=2449] We get them consumed by our situation.
[time=2450] We feel like we're defined by the situation that we're in.
[time=2453] But when you chase the right shepherd, it leads you to this place where you don't feel like you've got to strive so much and you don't have to form your own identity because Jesus already did that.
[time=2464] When you chase the right shepherd, your situation stops mattering so much.
[time=2468] Your stress levels can go down and you can stop striving and start trusting because your shepherd is leading the way and he's making you say, "Sit down, boy.
[time=2477] Sit down and rest.
[time=2478] Sit down at the table.
[time=2479] Let me restore and make functional again that which has been so broken."
[time=2486] When we know Jesus, he consumes that identity, it's not about our situation.
[time=2491] That's when the world around me can be shaky but he remains steady and that's when we can stop striving.
[time=2497] Number three, go into verse four.
[time=2499] Put your shadows in their place.
[time=2504] Verse four, "Do you notice I emphasized the word through several times already?" It's probably my favorite word in this verse, in this whole passage, is through.
[time=2514] Even though I walk through, even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
[time=2521] I'll fear no evil for you with me or rod in your staff.
[time=2523] They comfort me.
[time=2524] How many of you are afraid of the dark growing up?
[time=2527] Okay, three of us.
[time=2529] No, there's some more.
[time=2531] I was.
[time=2532] I remember a shadow on my bedroom window.
[time=2535] It looked like a hand.
[time=2536] It was a branch, you know, but it was a branch, but it looked like it was just going to come through the window and just frost and take me somewhere where it was going to take me.
[time=2543] I don't know.
[time=2544] But I remember it just would swoop up and down and I was afraid of that.
[time=2548] And a lot of you are afraid of some shadows in your life.
[time=2551] Some of you, this verse talks about the valley of the shadow of death.
[time=2555] Some of you are in the valley of the shadow of death.
[time=2562] Some of you are in the valley of the shadow of discouragement or depression.
[time=2567] But whatever your shadow may be, I want to tell you a few things about shadows, three things about shadows.
[time=2573] You ready for these?
[time=2574] Number one, a shadow can't hurt you.
[time=2577] You ever notice that?
[time=2579] A shadow can't hurt you.
[time=2581] That thing in my window, it wasn't going to bust through the window unless there was a tornado and then I got other things to worry about.
[time=2586] But the shadow wasn't going to hurt me.
[time=2588] The shadow of whatever it is in your life that you're afraid of that consumes you with fear.
[time=2593] I love the song that we sing.
[time=2594] I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[time=2596] Why?
[time=2597] Because I'm a child of God, because I have chased the right shepherd.
[time=2600] I don't have to strive and I can put my shadows in their place.
[time=2604] Shadows can't hurt you.
[time=2605] The second thing about shadows is that they're always bigger than their source.
[time=2611] They're always bigger than their source.
[time=2613] You do a shadow puppet?
[time=2615] It's just a hand, but it can be as big as a wall.
[time=2619] The shadow is always bigger than the source, and you have an enemy who wants to use shadows that are bigger than the source, bigger than they really are to consume you with fear and to scare you away from what God has for you in the middle of the valley that you find yourself in.
[time=2634] Shadows are bigger than their source, but my favorite part, number three, is that shadows cannot exist without light.
[time=2642] A shadow cannot exist without light.
[time=2646] And so what do we do when there's a shadow?
[time=2648] When I'm looking at a shadow that's scaring me, I would suggest to you to turn your back on the shadow and look at the light.
[time=2655] And so whatever shadow of death, of doubt, of discouragement, of depression, of confusion,
[time=2661] of fear, of pain, whatever you're in, turn your back on its shadows and look at the light of the world who is Jesus, who is this shepherd.
[time=2669] Turn your back on the shadow, look at the light, and the shadows are just in the background.
[time=2674] Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, put those shadows where they belong, and I believe there won't be quite as scary for you this week as you walk through this life.
[time=2684] You know what I've learned about shadows?
[time=2687] There's a lot of times God will often walk us through positions or shadows of pain so
[time=2694] that we can learn how to trust His promises.
[time=2697] If I don't have shadows in my life, I don't have to trust the light very much, do I?
[time=2700] If I have no shadows, I don't really need His help.
[time=2703] And that's why verse four through is my favorite part.
[time=2706] God says even though you walk through the valley of the shadow of death, He doesn't say even though you walk to it and pitch a tent, even though you walk to it and build a house, He didn't say blog from it, He didn't say do Facebook post from it, He didn't say to camp there, He didn't say to move your family there, He said you're going to walk through it because our God is a moving kind of God.
[time=2727] He never sits still, He meets you where you are, but He never leaves you there.
[time=2732] And even though you're going to walk to and you're going to see the shadows, you're going to see valleys and you're going to find yourself in the midst of valleys you never asked for.
[time=2740] Your God is a moving kind of God and after you chase Him, He's going to walk you through the valley and our Lord, our shepherd is a through kind of God, not a to kind of God.
[time=2752] Even if you came today to hear that because maybe you've been wondering did God do this to me, you ever said that before or I have, God why did you do this to me?
[time=2764] But today I want you to know that you serve a shepherd when you chase after Him, He wants you to learn that it's not all about me doing something to you, but no, what's happening to you, I want to meet you in the valley, walk through that valley with you, I want to meet you in the valley so I can do something through you because of the valley.
[time=2783] So don't get consumed by the valley, don't get consumed by the shadows of the valley of whatever shadows are consuming you because your shepherd is a moving kind of shepherd who makes you lie down, who leads you, who takes you through the valley, not to the valley.
[time=2799] And when you serve a through kind of shepherd, it doesn't matter what happens to you.
[time=2805] Some of you don't believe that, I don't believe that some days I wake up and it's like it's
[time=2811] all about what happened to me.
[time=2813] Don't feel alone, you don't have a perfect pastor, I struggle just like you and I end up seeing something that's happening to me, the two ends up consuming me.
[time=2822] But what your shepherd wants for you is say, hey we're walking through this, you're not walking through this, we are walking through this, so you've got to put the shadows in their place and God's going to meet you there and walk through it with you.
[time=2835] That's going to lead you to the fourth thing, verses five and six and God really messed me up with verses five and six this week.
[time=2840] I want to share with you the fourth thing is find security in your shepherd's protection, in your shepherd's protection.
[time=2849] Sometimes in life we end up as very insecure people.
[time=2853] We feel very insecure because we're consumed by shadows or we're consumed with us happening to us, not the fact that our shepherd wants to walk us through what happened to me.
[time=2863] We get consumed with that, but today David, I love verses four and five.
[time=2867] Look there with me, verses four and five.
[time=2869] You see a shift in verses one through three, he's talking about God and verses four and five as you go to the end of there, verse four and particularly verses five and six, he goes from talking about God to talking to God.
[time=2884] Did you know that you can be in a place all day talking about God but miss the fact that
[time=2891] he's in the room with you?
[time=2894] Did you know that you can talk about God in the middle of any valley but still miss the fact that he's walking you through the valley?
[time=2900] You can miss the presence of your shepherd in just talking about God, but David takes us on that journey of talking about God to just now talking to God when we look here at verses five and six and I love these verses before I read them though, there's another
[time=2916] sheep 101 fact that you need to know, sheep 101 website tells us this about sheep's vision.
[time=2921] It's pretty interesting and it's pretty applicable to what we're gonna look at in verses five and six here in a moment when we talk about our security.
[time=2929] It says that sheep depend heavily on their vision.
[time=2932] They have excellent peripheral vision and can see behind themselves without turning their heads.
[time=2938] However, they have poor depth perception.
[time=2941] They cannot see immediately in front of their noses.
[time=2947] Feeling sheepish yet?
[time=2949] So many times I think about what God is doing around my life and I get consumed about maybe what he's not doing and we say, "God, why didn't you save me from this but we miss all the stuff he's been saving us from all along?
[time=2960] Have you ever pondered what God has done that you don't even know about?
[time=2964] What God has protected you from?
[time=2965] A car wreck?
[time=2966] A relationship?
[time=2967] I don't know what it could be but God has protected us.
[time=2970] I believe from so many things that we don't even know he protected us from.
[time=2975] I call a lot of those things.
[time=2976] Sometimes he lets you in on them too.
[time=2977] You ever notice that?
[time=2978] Or you'll be in the middle of something and it'll be sometimes something small but you'll say, "God did that." I call him God winks or God just kinda winks at you and says, "I got you."
[time=2992] He meets you in the middle of situations when he shouldn't even be around.
[time=2995] You ever have those?
[time=2996] I wonder how many times our shepherd has protected us from things that we don't even see.
[time=3001] So many times we get mad at what got to us.
[time=3004] God, why did you let this get to me?
[time=3006] Sometimes we get mad at what got to us so much so that we don't see what God kept from us.
[time=3011] We worry about what got here but what didn't get here.
[time=3014] I think God protects us in ways we don't even see and when we get to that point we can say, "This is our security plea for the week.
[time=3022] This is your security anthem for your week.
[time=3025] I want you to believe this week that my security comes from my shepherd, not my situation.
[time=3033] My security comes from my shepherd, not my situation."
[time=3039] And when we think about this shepherd, I love in verse 5, he says, "You anoint my head with oil." And you know in the Bible oil is always a representative and almost every case you see it of the presence of God, His Holy Spirit.
[time=3053] But there's some things that hit me about verses 5 and 6 that I haven't noticed and studying and I want to share with you, "You anoint my head with oil." Beautiful picture of God's presence being all over you, yes, that's what I've always understood it to be.
[time=3064] But I learned something about shepherds, as they would often get down on their knees, get a sheep to them and they would take oil and they'd smear it all over the sheep's face.
[time=3075] They'd stick it in his ears, they'd stick it up his nose, rub it around his eyes and
[time=3081] you know he hated that, but he would bend down, get on his level and rub oil all over the sheep's face.
[time=3088] Why?
[time=3089] A sheep would often get bugs and swarms and they'd fly, if you've had cattle or horses you've seen it, there's stuff that you do for them, just like that when you do it with our horses.
[time=3099] The flies would get in their ears and it's bad.
[time=3100] So they would use oil, the shepherds would use oil and it would keep the bugs away.
[time=3104] But sometimes if they didn't do that, bugs would get in their eyes, they'd get in their nose, they'd get in their ears and it would become so painful, you ready for this, that sheep would crawl over and to rocks and start hitting their head on a rock to try to get
[time=3119] rid of the pain, to try to get the bugs out of their ears.
[time=3122] Sometimes they would do that to the point, they would even die, they would beat their head on a rock until they got to the point of death because of the pain these bugs would
[time=3131] bring to their bodies.
[time=3133] You're feeling sheepish yet, you ever feel like you're beating your head against a rock?
[time=3137] I don't know I've had those days for sure, but so think about that, that you anoint my head with oil, it's also a shepherding picture of a shepherd who's protecting you from things
[time=3148] you don't even know you need protection from.
[time=3151] Sometimes think about this, hear me on this, sometimes when you think God's not listening, when you've got these prayer requests you're pouring before God, you say, well God's not even hearing me, he's not even listening, I wonder if sometimes that's him anointing your head with oil because sometimes for our shepherd to protect us as sheep from things we don't even know we need to be protected from, he may need to even protect you from your own prayer requests.
[time=3174] If we're going to do it, go ahead and do it, celebrate the shepherd.
[time=3181] Sometimes God's going to protect you from things you don't even know you need protection from.
[time=3186] A lot of times I think God will block things from us that we think we need, that we want
[time=3192] so that He can lead us to what we really need.
[time=3195] Maybe He's anointing your head with oil today and it feels painful and it feels like He's not listening, but maybe He's protecting you from things you don't even know you need protection from.
[time=3206] My cup overflows, you ever wondered why that's in there?
[time=3209] I just thought it was the joy of the Lord, I'm overflowing with joy.
[time=3213] I think there's a very applicable interpretation there, sure, I think David overflows, but in
[time=3219] David's culture, if you're a guest, think about this with me, oh, I just love this.
[time=3224] I love the Bible.
[time=3225] I've told you that lately.
[time=3226] I just love that in David's culture, this is what he would be writing about, if you're a guest in someone's home, you know that you're still welcome to stay in someone's home if
[time=3236] they keep filling your glass, and a lot of times they'd even fill it to overflowing seriously as a symbol of you're welcome to stay.
[time=3244] I just gave some of you life group leaders a great trick to use this week.
[time=3248] For that guest that just stays until 10 o'clock, stop filling their dream.
[time=3254] Now they know.
[time=3256] But how cool is this, though, that in Psalm 23, maybe you didn't know that was there.
[time=3260] This is just something that just grabbed me.
[time=3262] I love this picture because what David is saying is God, I'm your sheep and you're my shepherd.
[time=3268] God, you're the host.
[time=3269] I'm your guest and you are filling my cup up until it overflows, telling me that my presence
[time=3275] is welcome with you, that your presence is always going to be with me and that I am always welcome to sit at your table.
[time=3284] My cup overflows.
[time=3286] I get to stay in the presence of a shepherd.
[time=3289] I can chase the right shepherd because he's filling my cup up with joy, he's filling my cup up with his presence and saying no matter what valley you walk through, I'm going to walk with you, I'm going to go before you, I'm going to surround you and you're always welcome to latch on to me as your shepherd.
[time=3313] I got to tell you as a pastor my heart breaks sometimes because I get to see a lot and you do too.
[time=3319] You don't have to be a pastor to know that people around you hurt.
[time=3322] You hurt too, but as a pastor sometimes the toughest moments are when people are going
[time=3329] through a valley and you see that they just don't have a shepherd to latch on to.
[time=3337] Somebody's here, maybe it's you, and you're just not latched onto the shepherd, but your
[time=3343] cup is overflowing if you just look at the table.
[time=3346] God's welcoming you in his presence in this very moment, he's not done with you, your cup is overflowing.
[time=3352] At the end of verse 6 he says, "Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life.
[time=3358] I want to give you one last statement that I want to share with you.
[time=3361] I want it to be your anthem this week." You notice that the shepherd makes you lie down, he leads you, so that means he's ahead
[time=3369] of me, he's with me, but will follow me.
[time=3375] Surely goodness and mercy will follow me, it's behind me.
[time=3379] You know what you are today?
[time=3382] You ever had anybody tell you that?
[time=3384] You know what you are?
[time=3385] You are surrounded by your shepherd.
[time=3387] He's ahead of you, he's with you, he's following you.
[time=3392] You're surrounded by a shepherd who says, "You know what, I'm going to fill up your cup until it overflows because you're always welcome in my presence because I'm going to go with you, I'm going to go before you, I'm going to be your shepherd and I don't care how shaky your situation is today.
[time=3407] I am steady.
[time=3409] The Lord is." We bow your heads with me and close your eyes for just a moment.
[time=3415] If you know Jesus today, the Lord is, perhaps means something new to you.
[time=3421] The Lord is.
[time=3423] Who do you need him to be?
[time=3425] How many of you would say, "If you know Jesus right now, I'm just going to pray for you for a moment." How many of you would just simply say that God's laid something heavy on my heart, some situation,
[time=3436] and I need a latch on to my shepherd, something very specific I've got to do this week to trust my shepherd.
[time=3441] Do you raise your hand if you know Jesus and God did something new in your life and you got to lean on him?
[time=3445] Raise it, raise it high all over the place.
[time=3447] Praise God.
[time=3448] Thank you for your honesty and your transparency.
[time=3449] You can put your hands down.
[time=3450] I want to pray for you in a moment.
[time=3452] But the most important thing I believe is going to happen in this place today is that somebody's here and you would look at me and say, "Pastor, as much as I would like to know that if I were to die today, I would spend eternity in heaven with Jesus because of Jesus and only because of Jesus.
[time=3469] But if I were to say if you were to die today, do you know a hundred percent sure that you would spend eternity with God in heaven?" You would say, "You know, I'd like to think so, but I really don't know.
[time=3479] Nobody's looking around and I want you to know in just a moment and give you a chance to do that.
[time=3483] Nobody's going to pull you out of the room.
[time=3484] This is just your journey." But I want to point you to the gospel.
[time=3487] You know what the gospel is?
[time=3488] It's good news.
[time=3489] It's the good news of Jesus.
[time=3490] It's news because it happened, because Jesus died, because he paid that price you could not pay.
[time=3496] It's done.
[time=3497] It's finished.
[time=3498] He already did that.
[time=3499] That's the good news of the gospel.
[time=3500] You know what else he did?
[time=3501] He rose from the dead.
[time=3503] He's alive forevermore.
[time=3508] And when he rose from the dead out of that grave in his hand, he brought out a victory over death and hell and the grave.
[time=3518] It's a victory he offers freely to you.
[time=3520] What is salvation about?
[time=3521] Anyone that calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved, confessing with your mouth, believing in your heart that Jesus is Lord.
[time=3527] What does all that mean?
[time=3528] I can't say it like you do, pastor.
[time=3530] God doesn't want you to say it how your pastor says it.
[time=3532] In fact, I'm not even going to lead you in a prayer, because I think your heart is screaming it.
[time=3537] It's all about you saying, "Jesus, I do need you in your own way.
[time=3540] I need you to save me.
[time=3541] I do believe and I want to ask you to forgive me, wash away my sin.
[time=3546] I give you me." That's the anthem of salvation.
[time=3548] I give you me, not some of me, all of me.
[time=3553] I lay me down at your feet.
[time=3555] If you have never asked him to save you, would you take a moment and do that right now, right where you sit?
[time=3560] Cry out to him in your own words.
[time=3561] He hears you in the depths of your heart.
[time=3563] Cry out to him right now.
