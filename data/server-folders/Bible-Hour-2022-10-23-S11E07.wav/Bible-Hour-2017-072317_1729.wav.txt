[time=90] Who am I that you are mindful of me, that you hear me when I call?
[time=105] Is it true that you are thinking of me, how you love me?
[time=144] It's amazing, I am a friend of God, I am a friend of God.
[time=156] I am a friend of God, he calls me friend.
[time=163] I am a friend of God, I am a friend of God.
[time=170] I am a friend of God, he calls me friend.
[time=178] We will find that you are mindful of me, that you hear me, that you hear me.
[time=188] When I call, when I call, is it true that you are thinking of me?
[time=197] How you love me, how you love me.
[time=202] It's amazing, it's amazing, it's amazing, it's amazing.
[time=213] I am a friend of God, I am a friend of God, I am a friend of God, he calls me friend.
[time=256] God almighty, Lord algory, you have called me friend.
[time=313] I am a friend of God, I am a friend of God, he calls me friend.
[time=355] I am a friend of God, I am a friend of God, I am a friend of God, you call me friend.
[time=372] Oh I've heard a thousand stories of what they think you like, but I've heard the tender whispers of love
[time=392] and the dead of night and they tell me that you're pleasing that I never alone.
[time=405] You're a good good father, to you I, to you I, to you I, and I'm up by you.
[time=418] To who I am, to who I am, to who I am, and I've seen many searching branches far and wide, but I know
[time=440] we're all sent in branches, only you crawl like as you know just what we mean before we say a word.
[time=456] You're a good good father, to you I, to you I, to you I, and I'm up by you, to who I am.
[time=469] To who I am, to who I am, to who I am.
[time=475] You're a good good father, to you I, to you I, to you I, and I'm up by you.
[time=486] To who I am, to who I am, to who I am.
[time=493] You are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, to who I am.
[time=521] You are perfect in all of your ways, to who I am.
[time=549] You are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways.
[time=572] You are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, and I'm up by you.
[time=602] You are a good good father, you are, into you are, into you are, and I'm up by you, into I am, into I am, into I am, into I am, because you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways.
[time=632] You are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, to one.
[time=662] Good morning, Blackhawk, hasn't it been a great morning already?
[time=667] One of the things that is so awesome about what's going on around here at Blackhawk these days is that we support missions and missionary work all over the world, and this morning we want to introduce you to two couples that are doing that work that are here visiting with us this morning.
[time=686] The first, John and Catherine Epley, we got to stand up, John is a Blackhawk alum, he grew up here at Blackhawk, went to BCS, class of '93, and for the past 20 years he's been in the Wycliffe Bible Translation Ministry, this is his wife Catherine, they got married 11 weeks ago yesterday.
[time=709] Congratulations, and this is their first visit home since getting married, they spoke during first hour, they're with us this morning for church, and in the coming weeks we're going to sit down and do a more extensive interview with John and Catherine and learn more about what they're doing in the mission field.
[time=732] John and Catherine, thank you for being with us this morning.
[time=740] The next couple I want to introduce you to is Jim and Becky's story, I'm going to invite them up on the stage with Judy Baker, Judy is our youth ministry leader, and Judy over the past several years, many years, has been leading our high school youth group.
[time=757] That ministry is called 212 in a mission trip each summer, and duty for many years that has taken place in Columbus, this year you had the heart to change it up and do something different, tell us what you did.
[time=771] Absolutely, like Curtis said, last couple years we've been going to Columbus, Ohio, we've been serving with some friends there in the inner city, and God just told us this year was going to be different.
[time=782] He said, I'm going to send you somewhere on that mission wall that we have out these doors, and we didn't know where that was going to be at the time, we just said okay, so we asked the global mission team, where do you think we need to go?
[time=797] And they came back with Jim and Becky's story, so we were so thankful, we had no connection, we had not met you guys before that, so God just said that's where you're going this year.
[time=805] So you took about 15 people, about 11 kids, and went to Missouri to missionary acres when Jim and Becky live, and what did you do for that week, what was that like?
[time=815] The first day we served at a local Baptist church where Jim and Becky are serving currently, and just did a lot of clean up work, power wash, the church, just did a lot of work around the church, repainted the sign, and then the rest of the time we were actually at missionary acres where Jim and Becky live, and we did a lot of hard concrete work, a lot of demo and putting in new sidewalks, so that was good.
[time=839] So you prayed about it ahead of time, you felt called to go to a different place this year with these kids, did you see a change, did it pay off, was it fruitful to be at missionary acres, did the kids really connect deeper with God and with the people they were with?
[time=856] Absolutely. Jim and Becky, they hosted us every meal, I believe it was, and it was amazing, we were able to ask questions, share our stories, they were able to ask us questions, share their stories, they have so many stories of faith, and the kids all were just, we felt all loved, not only by Jim and Becky, but all the missionaries that live there at missionary acres, and we came out of that experience, just encouraged, and just the stories, the heroes, and all that.
[time=885] And the stories, the heroes of faith that we listened to, not just missionaries, but wherever we are, just to follow God, and it was great to have that connection, that relationship made with the students and the staff.
[time=896] That's awesome, thanks, Judy. Jim and Becky have been in the mission field for many, many years with Baptist Midmissions, Becky for 35 years, Jim for 31, now follow me on this path and see if you think God is trying to teach them something.
[time=909] They started in Jamaica, went to Scotland, then to Canada, and now to Missouri. You think God is trying to humble you guys?
[time=921] I guess he is because we are becoming more and more humble all the time.
[time=926] Jim, what was it like this week that you spent with the Black Hawk Kids last month?
[time=931] I have to tell you, we were so impressed. I don't know what you feed these kids around here, but they came with a great deal of energy.
[time=940] They accomplished more in the time that they were there than most groups do.
[time=945] The first day, they tore up a sidewalk and put a new sidewalk back down. It usually takes each group two days to do that project.
[time=953] So it was literally twice as much as usual, yes, so we were really impressed.
[time=958] Becky, this place, Missionary Acres is a place where you live. It's a place for retired missionaries.
[time=965] You're semi-retired. Tell us about this place. You're not semi-retired.
[time=970] It's just that we are getting closer to that time when we're going to retire, and we did the math and decided that Missionary Acres was where we wanted to retire, when we retire.
[time=981] So we talked to our mission and asked them if we could go ahead and choose our house, because for the last five years, we've been living in an RV as we traveled to the different churches that we've been helping, and so we didn't have furniture.
[time=994] So they agreed to let us choose our house so we could start buying furniture, which you guys gave us an offering that helped tremendously.
[time=1004] But when we finished the ministry we were doing in North Carolina with the church there, we were told about several churches in Missouri, and so because we're helping our church about 25 miles from Missionary Acres, they let us go ahead and start living there, even though we are not retired.
[time=1022] Not even semi-retired. Not even semi.
[time=1025] And I know that you guys do want to thank the Blackhawk family for the prayer support, this Christmas gift which led to furniture, and for this week with the kids last month.
[time=1035] Thank you for interesting us with your young people. I hope that we took good care of them and they came home with a good report.
[time=1042] For over 30 years now, your church has faithfully given to the ministry that we have done in Jamaica, Scotland, Canada, and now in the United States, and we thank you for your faithfulness.
[time=1053] We know when you give faithfully that you are praying for us, it takes money to get a missionary to the field, it takes prayer to keep them there.
[time=1062] And so I just appreciate your prayer so much. And then as we began moving into this home, recognizing the expense of furniture and everything, we had no idea that your church was even considering us for a special gift.
[time=1076] But that has been such a blessing. We have just been able to sit down and take a deep breath and say, "Praise God. Our needs are met." So thank you so much.
[time=1085] That is awesome. Thank you.
[time=1086] I just want you to know that the gift you sent us to help us buy furniture was the largest one-time gift we have ever received.
[time=1094] In 35 years of mission work. Wow.
[time=1097] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1103] I want to do two rounds of applause as a way to thank folks here. Can we first thank Judy and the team of high schoolers for going and representing Black Hawk?
[time=1112] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1113] Thanks, Judy.
[time=1115] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1118] If you've ever worked with high school kids, or if you're a parent, you know what it's like to take 11 of them across the country. That's a chore.
[time=1126] And can we thank Jim and Becky for more than three decades of mission work supported by Black Hawk? Thank you so much for all that you've done.
[time=1135] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1140] [MUSIC - 226 seconds]
[time=1373] ♪
[time=1399] - Last Sunday, I got to preach at a friend's church across town.
[time=1409] And they hired him on his pastor in March of this year.
[time=1413] I knew him from Wheaton going back many years.
[time=1417] And I started the sermon with these exact words.
[time=1421] Let me start this morning by commending you on your choice of a pastor.
[time=1427] Mike Daling, that's his name, is one of the most sincere, godly, and capable men I know.
[time=1434] He has a pastor's heart, I'm reading from my notes.
[time=1437] He has a pastor's heart, he wants to serve you well.
[time=1440] He loves his family and has come to you ready to open God's Word and to care for you as a shepherd.
[time=1448] I've been with him several times since he has come on as your pastor and all of my convictions about those things have been confirmed.
[time=1456] I could say every one of those words about Kevin, every single one.
[time=1462] I commend you on your choice of a pastor.
[time=1465] Kevin has become a dear friend to me.
[time=1469] He is leading this ministry.
[time=1471] I am immensely grateful for him and I commend you on your choice of a pastor.
[time=1477] My name is Steve Webster.
[time=1478] I am the chairman of the Bible department at the school.
[time=1481] It's been a couple of years since I've been up here doing this.
[time=1483] I've been up in the last few weeks in various capacities, but it's very good to be here with you this morning in this capacity.
[time=1490] If you have a Bible, please go to Psalm 22.
[time=1493] That's where we'll be this morning.
[time=1497] Remarkable how the Lord orchestrates things.
[time=1500] Remarkable how every component of the service all works toward a focus.
[time=1506] Christ at the center.
[time=1509] The fact that Christ quotes the opening line of this Psalm from the cross
[time=1517] should tell you that it would be hard for me to overstate how important that is.
[time=1522] That Jesus himself quotes these words.
[time=1525] They're remarkable words that you probably know whether you realize it or not.
[time=1529] He quotes these words in Mark 15.
[time=1532] Mark's gospel has been a passion of mine for 20 years.
[time=1535] You know that.
[time=1536] And Mark's gospel, everything in Mark, marches toward Christ on the cross.
[time=1542] One author refers to Mark as a passion narrative with a long introduction.
[time=1547] I think that's true.
[time=1549] And so the line that opens Psalm 22 is put in the mouth of Jesus.
[time=1556] He himself quotes this Psalm at the high point of the most important moment in history.
[time=1564] In the history of the world to that point.
[time=1567] So friends, I'm a tragic over hyper.
[time=1570] I can do that, but it's hard to overstate how important that is.
[time=1577] Jesus is the righteous sufferer.
[time=1582] If you've ever felt abandoned.
[time=1586] I hope you're listening.
[time=1587] Kevin says this word is for someone this morning.
[time=1590] This is for someone this morning.
[time=1592] If you've ever felt abandoned.
[time=1595] Or forsaken.
[time=1597] Or unheard.
[time=1600] Rest in the knowledge that Jesus has to.
[time=1605] And none of your suffering.
[time=1607] None of your pain.
[time=1609] None of the silence of God is missed.
[time=1613] He understands.
[time=1615] He is able to sympathize with your weaknesses.
[time=1619] And this morning I stand before you and I could stop there.
[time=1623] It's important to know that.
[time=1625] Every one of your sufferings and they are as varied as the people in this room.
[time=1629] Some of you have suffered terribly in recent days.
[time=1632] This Psalm.
[time=1634] The words of Jesus from Psalm 22 are for you.
[time=1639] Listen to the last verse of Andrew Peterson's classic song.
[time=1645] The silence of God.
[time=1648] He sings this.
[time=1650] There's a statue of Jesus in a monastery known in the hills of Kentucky.
[time=1658] All quiet and cold.
[time=1661] And he's kneeling in the garden.
[time=1664] Silence as a stone.
[time=1667] And all his friends are sleeping.
[time=1670] He's weeping all alone.
[time=1673] And the man of all sorrows never forgot what sorrow is carried by the hearts that he bought.
[time=1685] So when the questions dissolve into the silence of God, the aching may remain.
[time=1695] The breaking does not, the aching may remain, but the breaking does not.
[time=1704] In the holy lonesome echo of the silence of God.
[time=1713] Everyone of your sufferings.
[time=1716] I'm sorry for my singing.
[time=1719] Everyone of your sufferings is known by Jesus.
[time=1724] His story is your story.
[time=1728] Consider these staggering words from Paul in 2 Corinthians chapter 5.
[time=1733] God made him, that is Jesus, who had no sin to be sin for us so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
[time=1748] None of his suffering was meaningless.
[time=1756] It's all personal.
[time=1758] I'll come back to that in just a minute.
[time=1761] It's important to recognize that we may feel a certain way that betrays the truth of our situation.
[time=1767] I'm going to say that again.
[time=1769] It's important to understand that the way that I feel I've been teaching high school students since 1995.
[time=1777] I tell them a lot that I'm so grateful I didn't have access to my phone when I was in high school to vent all my feelings in a bad moment.
[time=1787] If I want to know what somebody felt they had to actually ask them, then there was a process to find that out.
[time=1794] These days, I think it.
[time=1796] I feel it.
[time=1797] It's on the internet.
[time=1798] Just like that.
[time=1799] Those feelings, guys, students especially, some of those feelings, those feelings are all real and I would never tell you that they're not.
[time=1806] But giving vent to them in that way, letting them shape your reality is a bad move.
[time=1814] The Psalms help us navigate, especially things like depression or emotions in a way that's always hemmed in or should be by the truth of who God is.
[time=1824] That's why the title of today's message is "Yet." So the opening line of Psalm 22 says, "My God, my God,
[time=1834] why have you forsaken me?" That's real.
[time=1838] That is the realest emotion that I can think of.
[time=1842] But emotions make for bad masters.
[time=1844] I would always tell you guys in years gone by, "Don't let your feelings drive the bus." That's still true this morning.
[time=1851] Emotions make for bad masters.
[time=1853] Listen to the Psalmist.
[time=1854] This is very, very helpful to us friends as we navigate some of those things that we feel day by day.
[time=1861] Psalm 22 begins this way again.
[time=1863] "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[time=1870] Why are you so far from saving me from the words of my groaning?
[time=1877] Oh my God, I cry by day, but you do not answer.
[time=1883] And by night, but I find no rest.
[time=1887] Silence of God.
[time=1890] Is God far from saving us?
[time=1893] It feels that way sometimes.
[time=1895] So you need to understand.
[time=1897] We need to understand.
[time=1899] The way that I feel in that moment.
[time=1902] God, where are you?
[time=1904] Why aren't you listening?
[time=1905] Those are real things.
[time=1907] And David pours his heart out to God.
[time=1910] God, this is how I feel in this moment.
[time=1916] Is God not listening?
[time=1918] Again, the story of Jesus, Christ, the center of it all.
[time=1921] The story of Jesus is a definitive answer to those questions.
[time=1925] God, where have you forsaken me?
[time=1927] Are you far from saving me?
[time=1933] Number one in your notes is just that word forsaken.
[time=1937] And these are feelings that are always, there's a, there's a rhythm in this Psalm that David cries out
[time=1944] and then he hems in.
[time=1946] He puts the brackets on his complaint before God.
[time=1949] But number one in your notes is forsaken.
[time=1952] And letter A, friends, is this.
[time=1954] God is not afraid of your honesty.
[time=1957] If you read the Psalms, we've been in the Psalms this summer.
[time=1960] What a great place to be.
[time=1962] And the Psalms are littered with real emotions.
[time=1966] I'll show you some more in just a moment.
[time=1968] God is not afraid of your honesty.
[time=1971] What is the first word of Psalm 22?
[time=1974] Class?
[time=1976] My.
[time=1977] This is very personal to David.
[time=1979] It's not just God.
[time=1981] God out there somewhere.
[time=1982] Hey God, if you're there, he says my God.
[time=1985] It says it twice.
[time=1987] My God, my God.
[time=1989] So it's real and then it gets even more real because it's my God, he says.
[time=1994] Very, very personal.
[time=1997] David is crying out to a personal God.
[time=2000] Not the idea of a God.
[time=2002] Not this thing that he may have heard about somewhere, but his own God.
[time=2007] The best interpreter of the Bible is the Bible.
[time=2012] And so Psalm 42 sounds an awful lot like Psalm 22.
[time=2017] Watch what David does, same author.
[time=2020] David does in Psalm 42.
[time=2023] You can put over a few pages if you want to, it should be on the screens behind me.
[time=2027] Psalm 42, listen to what David does, much like Psalm 22.
[time=2031] As a dear pants for flowing streams, so pants my soul for you, oh God.
[time=2038] My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.
[time=2042] When shall I come and appear before God?
[time=2045] My tears have been my food day and night.
[time=2051] While they say to me all the day long, where is your God?
[time=2055] See what's personal again, your God?
[time=2058] These things I remember as I pour out my soul, so important.
[time=2066] How I would go with the throng and lead them in procession to the house of God.
[time=2071] With glad shouts and songs of praise, a multitude keeping festival.
[time=2076] And now David talks to himself as we should too.
[time=2080] Why are you cast down?
[time=2082] Oh my soul.
[time=2084] Why are you in turmoil within me?
[time=2087] Has the language of like waters being disturbed?
[time=2092] Hope in God.
[time=2094] For I shall again praise him, my salvation in my God.
[time=2099] I think her name was Alyssa, she was sitting right next to you.
[time=2102] And she was singing an ice runner this morning, her little voice, and it just took me there.
[time=2111] The voice of a child, I surrender all.
[time=2115] It's so beautiful.
[time=2117] And David says, I remember when I used to go into the house of worship and cry out to you, God.
[time=2123] And that's what keeps him from teetering off the cliff.
[time=2127] You can do that for you too.
[time=2129] We need to be together, friends.
[time=2131] We need to be together, especially because whenever Christians gather, they've always done this.
[time=2136] They sing.
[time=2137] They sing music.
[time=2138] Why?
[time=2139] Because it keeps me from drifting off into the margins.
[time=2144] I sing what God's word says more on that in just a moment.
[time=2146] Again, our emotions are real.
[time=2149] God isn't inviting you to the way of denial to say that those things aren't real.
[time=2153] God knows who you are.
[time=2155] He knows your weakness, always -- this would be a good feature right down.
[time=2161] Always condition your emotions and bring to them information.
[time=2169] From Ravi Zechariahs, always condition your emotions and bring to them information.
[time=2176] That's what David does in Psalm 42.
[time=2179] My tears had been my food -- whoa, hope in God.
[time=2185] Hope in God.
[time=2186] I remember when I went in with the festive throng, he says.
[time=2190] I remember when I went to go worship you.
[time=2192] God, it's going to be okay.
[time=2194] Self-talk.
[time=2197] If we don't know what God's word says, then we'll always be prisoners of our emotions.
[time=2201] We'll be flopping the breeze back and forth and back and forth.
[time=2205] The anchor, we had this hope as the anchor of our soul.
[time=2209] That's the anchor that we need.
[time=2212] In the beginning was the word.
[time=2214] In the beginning was word, information.
[time=2218] Christ reveals Himself to us as the word.
[time=2221] God has spoken to us across the ages.
[time=2224] This is what Peter says in 2 Peter chapter 1.
[time=2226] Listen to this.
[time=2227] 2 Peter chapter 1 verses 16 through 19.
[time=2230] I cannot get over this.
[time=2232] For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power.
[time=2240] But we were eyewitnesses of His majesty.
[time=2243] He received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to Him from majestic glory, saying,
[time=2251] "This is my Son, whom I love.
[time=2254] With Him I am well pleased.
[time=2256] We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with Him on the sacred mountain."
[time=2263] Watch this.
[time=2264] We also have the prophetic message, God's word, as something completely reliable.
[time=2271] And you will do well to pay attention to it as to a light shining in a dark place until the day dawns
[time=2278] and the morning star rises in your hearts.
[time=2281] Verse 19 says in other translations, "Made more certain." In other words, it would not be better.
[time=2289] He's talking about the transfiguration when Peter and James and John go up on a mountain and Christ is revealed
[time=2295] for a moment to be who He actually is.
[time=2298] He's metamorphosed in front of them.
[time=2302] And Peter says, "You know what?
[time=2304] It's better that I have God's word than if I was actually there seeing that on the mountain." That sounds hard to believe to me.
[time=2310] That's what He says.
[time=2312] It would be better.
[time=2313] It's better to have what God says.
[time=2316] Oh goodness.
[time=2317] The prophetic message is completely reliable.
[time=2321] So if you want to hem in your emotions and not get carried away, the best thing to do, friends, is bring to them information.
[time=2328] And remember, let her be in your number B, number B in your outline.
[time=2333] That God is God.
[time=2336] We're not.
[time=2338] Those are two truths that we would be wise to rest in.
[time=2342] God may have some perspective that you don't have.
[time=2347] I don't know who said this, but it's given me great comfort over the years.
[time=2351] Some of you have lots of questions to ask God when I get to heaven.
[time=2355] I got some questions for Him.
[time=2358] You know, a list of complaints, right?
[time=2361] You won't, by the way, when you get there.
[time=2364] But whatever is haunting, something is haunting you this morning.
[time=2370] Something about the way the world works.
[time=2373] Why God?
[time=2374] Like David says, why?
[time=2376] Why?
[time=2377] You don't have the answer.
[time=2380] Let me encourage you with this.
[time=2382] Whenever you find out what the answer is from God Himself, you won't be like, really?
[time=2388] You'll be totally satisfied with the answer.
[time=2391] Whatever that answer happens to be.
[time=2393] I encourage you with that this morning.
[time=2395] One of the best ways for me to bring information to my feelings is through music.
[time=2399] I love music.
[time=2401] I want to give you some examples that have really helped me.
[time=2404] Music that's soaked in Scripture because it helps me.
[time=2407] Hillsong United is my favorite band.
[time=2410] There are other bands that met more to me for longer in my life.
[time=2412] Hillsong United is my favorite band.
[time=2414] This is an album they released just recently.
[time=2416] These are some lyrics from that album.
[time=2420] God of creation, they're at the start before the beginning of time.
[time=2425] With no point, I won't sing this.
[time=2427] With no point of reference, you spoke to the dark and fleshed out the wonder of light.
[time=2432] And as you speak, 100 billion galaxies are born in the vapor of your breath, the planets form
[time=2439] if the stars were made to worship so I.
[time=2444] I need to drench myself in that, like, drench my soul.
[time=2448] That's Hillsong.
[time=2450] Drench your, immerse yourself on these things, guys.
[time=2453] Robbie C. Mann from Texas released a whole album of Psalms.
[time=2457] The Psalms set to music.
[time=2459] I could not commend it to you highly enough.
[time=2462] Audrey Asad released an album called Inheritance of just ancient hymns like I surrender all and others.
[time=2470] Bring to those emotions information time tested historical real information like David does.
[time=2480] I remember prone to wander.
[time=2485] Lord, I feel it prone to leave the God I love.
[time=2490] That's every one of us.
[time=2491] That's David.
[time=2492] And so David says, I remember when I went into God's house with the people.
[time=2496] And we celebrated his deliverance in our lives.
[time=2500] So we have this number one in the notes friends is forsaken.
[time=2504] And the title of our sermon this morning is yet.
[time=2507] And here we have the first one in verse three.
[time=2509] It's the most important word.
[time=2510] I encourage you to circle that word in your Bibles if you wouldn't mind.
[time=2514] It's in verses three and verse nine.
[time=2517] It's the most important word there, yet.
[time=2521] God, why have you forsaken me?
[time=2524] Why aren't you listening to me?
[time=2527] Where are you yet?
[time=2530] Yet you are holy and thrown on the praises of Israel.
[time=2536] I love that phrase.
[time=2537] "In you are fathers trusted.
[time=2540] They trusted and you delivered them.
[time=2543] To you they cried and were rescued.
[time=2545] In you they trusted and were not put to shame."
[time=2551] Yet number one, letter A, our questions find their answers in him.
[time=2559] David see this?
[time=2560] David goes back and says, my father, my grandfather, trusted in you.
[time=2566] So I will too.
[time=2567] You came through for them.
[time=2568] You'll come through for me.
[time=2569] You're no different friends.
[time=2572] It's important to study history for many, many years.
[time=2576] And of course the saying goes, those that don't learn history are doomed to repeat it.
[time=2580] In this sense, those who forget history are doomed to shortsightedness.
[time=2587] Don't be that person.
[time=2589] Letter B, rest in the constancy.
[time=2593] I love that word.
[time=2594] The constancy of God.
[time=2596] God has always been the way he is right now.
[time=2601] He's never going to change.
[time=2603] He's not like me.
[time=2604] He isn't like you.
[time=2606] My wife's been married to four different men.
[time=2608] I've ever seen one of them.
[time=2611] I have changed over to our 18 years of marriage almost.
[time=2615] 18 years tomorrow.
[time=2617] Is that right?
[time=2619] You can apply Jodie for being married to me for that long.
[time=2624] Four different men, I'm every single one of them.
[time=2626] Like Tim Keller says about his wife, Kathy.
[time=2628] It's true.
[time=2629] I'm changing all the time.
[time=2632] Not for the better sometimes.
[time=2633] God, it's not like me.
[time=2634] It's not like you.
[time=2636] He doesn't change like shifting shadows.
[time=2641] All of your prayers of desperation and loneliness and abandonment should always be hemmed in
[time=2651] by that beautiful word, yet, yet I will trust in you, yet you are holy.
[time=2662] The story of the Old Testament is a long testimony to the surety of God's goodness and steadfastness.
[time=2670] And all of that friends rises over and above, maybe your present circumstances.
[time=2676] You've got to lift your eyes to the horizon.
[time=2679] When you keep your eyes down here, there's struggle and you lose perspective.
[time=2682] When we raise our eyes and see, things are different.
[time=2686] Deuteronomy 7 verse 9 says this.
[time=2689] Deuteronomy 7 verse 9.
[time=2691] No, therefore, the Lord your God is God, the faithful God who keeps covenant and steadfast
[time=2699] love with those who love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations.
[time=2704] It's a long time.
[time=2707] Lamentations 3, I remember this, Lamentations is a book of the Bible in the Old Testament
[time=2714] written by Jeremiah the prophet.
[time=2715] He writes this book, dear friends, in the wreckage and the rubble of Jerusalem.
[time=2723] It's been destroyed by the Babylonians.
[time=2725] The city of God, the shining city on a hill, has been destroyed.
[time=2730] And Jeremiah writes this book of Lamentations, that's what it means, it's a cry of sadness.
[time=2735] In the middle of that cry are these words.
[time=2739] The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases.
[time=2744] Mercies never come to an end.
[time=2746] They are new every morning, great is your faithfulness, rest in the constancy of God.
[time=2756] Now we're going back, so we have God, I'm forsaken, I feel forsaken, yet.
[time=2763] Number three in the notes is scorned.
[time=2769] The first complaint is this way, God, where are you?
[time=2771] And in this cave it stinks, I'm hiding out from this wicked man, I did everything right and where are you?
[time=2778] This complaint is this way, this complaint is horizontal.
[time=2783] But I'm a worm, verse six, and not a man, real, that's real.
[time=2790] Scorned by mankind, despised by the people, all who see me mock me, they make mouths
[time=2796] at me, they make mouths like.
[time=2801] You know, stuff like that.
[time=2803] They wag their heads.
[time=2806] You ever done it to you?
[time=2810] Probably not.
[time=2813] Wagging their heads is just this look of disdain.
[time=2820] He trusts in the Lord, let him deliver him, let him rescue him, for he delights in him.
[time=2827] Number eight here in your notes friends is the importance of self-awareness, the older I get, I'm getting older every day, the older I get, the more I realize how important it is to be self-aware, how much I treasure that in other people.
[time=2840] I'm not doing okay, I'm really struggling, I know my weakness, I know my strength, I navigate
[time=2846] them as best I can.
[time=2848] The importance of self-awareness, the way of faith, let's be good for you to jot down to, the way of faith is the way of realism.
[time=2857] David has a very clear-eyed view of reality.
[time=2861] He isn't talking about escapism or, you know, some kind of pie in the sky, this is real.
[time=2867] I am a worm and not a man, that's real.
[time=2874] He's the object of scorn, derision, mockery, insults, and head-wagging, how pathetic are
[time=2883] you?
[time=2885] People say.
[time=2888] When we face insults unjustly, oh, hear me.
[time=2892] We must always remember that even though we lack solidarity, brotherhood, with the people
[time=2898] from time to time, we can always rest in the reality of our solidarity, our brotherhood,
[time=2906] our friendship with God and our connectedness to Jesus.
[time=2912] This is going to be bad sometimes.
[time=2914] It will be bad.
[time=2916] Teenagers, when you are upset with somebody, put your phone away for like five minutes.
[time=2922] Give it a second.
[time=2924] Give it a second because you're going to regret what you say, 45-year-olds.
[time=2930] Put your phone away for five minutes as for everybody.
[time=2934] Just be careful.
[time=2935] My wife proof reads my emails before, so I don't send back something that's hasty.
[time=2940] I've done it before.
[time=2941] I regret it.
[time=2943] When you face insults unjustly, that's not true.
[time=2949] Nobody has faced that more than Jesus.
[time=2951] Nobody.
[time=2952] You are connected to Him.
[time=2953] He understands what that's like.
[time=2955] He is the righteous, sufferer, par excellence.
[time=2961] The importance of self-awareness, let her be, friends, faithfulness.
[time=2966] This is not a popular thing to say, and I'm okay with that.
[time=2970] Faithfulness does not guarantee safety.
[time=2976] Missionaries around the world can tell you that.
[time=2981] With clear eyes.
[time=2984] Faithfulness does not guarantee safety.
[time=2985] If you come in Jesus, all your problems will go away, it will evaporate.
[time=2988] Have you ever read the Bible?
[time=2991] If you ever read the Bible, you can't say that in Psalm 22.
[time=2994] David is the righteous, chosen king of Israel.
[time=2999] He's not perfect, but he's God's man, and he was faithful, and he ends up in a cave hiding out for his life because Saul hates him.
[time=3007] For no reason.
[time=3012] He is with you in your sorrow.
[time=3016] It's real, but realer, hear me, realer than that sorrow is the perfect, obedient, conquering
[time=3025] Jesus who endured the cross, despising its shame.
[time=3032] More than your sorrow, more real.
[time=3038] He's with you in your sorrow.
[time=3040] Don't say your pains, when someone's in your life is suffering, don't say, "Well, there
[time=3046] are people in other parts of the world who are suffering worse than you, so your suffering isn't really real." That's not true.
[time=3051] That's not true at all.
[time=3053] That's a lie.
[time=3054] Don't lie to people.
[time=3055] Hear them in their pain, and then say to them, "I'm really sorry." "I'm really sorry, Jesus is with you in your pain."
[time=3067] That's the truth.
[time=3068] Don't lie to people.
[time=3069] Don't say their pain doesn't matter, because it does matter, and is it trivial?
[time=3073] That's not my place.
[time=3076] All of my suffering is known to him, and he is with you in it.
[time=3083] Faithfulness doesn't guarantee safety.
[time=3086] Verse 9, as we wind down this morning, is the second yet in the first half of Psalm 22.
[time=3095] Yet all this insults, and mockery, and derision, and headwagging, and making mouths, you know,
[time=3105] yet you are he who took me from the womb.
[time=3108] You made me trust you at my mother's breasts.
[time=3111] When you was, I cast from my birth, and from my mother's womb, you had been my God.
[time=3117] Be not far from me, for trouble is near, and there is none to help.
[time=3123] Litter A, we are what he has made us.
[time=3128] Can you consider for a moment this possibility?
[time=3132] What if everything that has ever happened to you, or ever will happen to you, is not because of the randomness of a universe spinning out of control, but from the hand of an infinite
[time=3143] personal God who loves you?
[time=3147] What if that's the case?
[time=3150] What if everything that you have faced in your life, you can face that in the knowledge, because everything you face isn't good, joblessness isn't good, divorce isn't good.
[time=3160] There are a billion of your kids, that's not good, that's hard.
[time=3166] But what if you could face all of that in the knowledge that God is with you in it?
[time=3170] And none of it is just because.
[time=3175] What if you could do that?
[time=3177] We are what he has made us.
[time=3179] Everything that you face today and tomorrow is from his hand, and we are told in his word to face it with him and because of him, and through him and for him.
[time=3189] The letter B is that what I just said, the infinite personal God, since David was a baby,
[time=3196] he says God, my life is in your hands.
[time=3200] I am what you have made me.
[time=3206] Everything that I faced in my life, my present circumstances are not accidental.
[time=3212] Remember that, friends, as you face difficulty, everything in your life is from the hand of God.
[time=3219] Charles Spurgeon said this, my mom loves Charles Spurgeon, "O thou poor distressed soul who
[time=3228] once lived in the sunshine of God's face, but are now in darkness, remember he has not
[time=3236] really forsaken you, God in the clouds is as much our God as when he shines forth in
[time=3245] all the luster of his grace.
[time=3248] God is as much God in the clouds as when he shines forth in the luster of his grace.
[time=3255] The last half of Psalm 22 was not our focus this morning, but I want to give David the last word, and this psalm is actually a psalm of marvelously encouraging.
[time=3266] It doesn't begin that way.
[time=3267] It begins with, oh God, where are you?
[time=3271] Listen to how it ends.
[time=3272] I want to invite you to let this be our prayer.
[time=3275] So if you would just close your eyes with me, friends, and let me read these last few verses as our prayer, our prayer in response to God, I feel forsaken yet.
[time=3285] God, I'm scorned by all these people around me yet.
[time=3289] Let this be our, the last word this morning, but you, oh Lord, do not be far off, oh you
[time=3300] my help come quickly to my aid, deliver my soul from the sword, my precious life from
[time=3307] the power of the dog, save me from the mouth of the lion.
[time=3311] You have rescued me from the horns of the wild oxen.
[time=3315] I will tell of your name to my brothers.
[time=3317] In the midst of the congregation, I will praise you.
[time=3322] You who fear the Lord, praise him.
[time=3325] All you offspring of Jacob glorify him, and stand in awe of him.
[time=3330] All you offspring of Israel.
[time=3332] For he has not despised or abhorred the affliction of the afflicted.
[time=3338] He has not hidden his face from him, but has heard when he cried to him.
[time=3343] From you comes my praise in the great congregation.
[time=3347] My vows I will perform before those who fear him.
[time=3350] The afflicted shall eat and be satisfied.
[time=3355] Those who seek him shall praise the Lord.
[time=3357] May your hearts live forever.
[time=3359] All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the Lord.
[time=3363] And all the families of the nations shall worship before you.
[time=3367] For kingship belongs to the Lord, and he rules over the nations.
[time=3372] All the prosperous of the earth eat and worship before him shall bow all who go down to the last, even the one who could not keep himself alive.
[time=3382] Pustarity shall serve him.
[time=3384] It shall be told of the Lord to the coming generation.
[time=3387] They shall come and proclaim his righteousness to a people yet unborn that he has done it.
[time=3396] Friends this morning, as your eyes are still closed, and as we have prayerfully heard from
[time=3403] the psalmist, I invite you to consider this.
[time=3408] This morning, what if all of your sorrows were known to him?
[time=3415] I would just invite you in this moment.
[time=3421] If you've ever felt forsaken, if you have felt abandoned, if you felt unheard, with
[time=3428] our heads bowed and our eyes closed, if you've ever felt that way, if you feel that way this morning, would you just raise your hand all across the room and I'll pray for you.
[time=3437] Thank you.
[time=3439] I see your hands all across the room.
[time=3444] Thank you.
[time=3445] Can you put your hands down?
[time=3451] Let me pray.
[time=3454] Father, we remember, we remember the sacrifice of Jesus on our behalf.
[time=3468] Father, my prayer this morning, right now, there's anybody in this room that beyond
[time=3479] it feeling forsaken, beyond feeling abandoned or unheard, God, they don't know you.
[time=3487] As I pray with them and for them right now, God, I pray that they would cry out to you, cry out to be forgiven, that this friendship with God that we sang about would be real for them and all they have to do, Father, is cry out to confess that you are who you say
[time=3504] you are and that you are alive today.
[time=3507] May it be so.
[time=3508] I pray this morning also for those who just raise their hands all across the room, God,
[time=3514] who have felt forsaken, abandoned, unheard.
[time=3517] Would you encourage them with your own words, Father?
[time=3522] Encourage them that your son, Jesus, has entered into all of it and that he loves them
[time=3528] and that none of their suffering was meaningless and is meaningless.
[time=3532] Help us to suffer well this morning, dear Father.
[time=3536] I pray all those things in Jesus' name with great thanksgiving, amen.
[time=3566] [BLANK_AUDIO]
