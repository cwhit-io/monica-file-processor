[time=587] Thank you so much for watching today. We do the Bible hour. We have ministries just like this with people like you in mind. People just like me who walk through life and have our own struggles and our ups and our downs. But I pray that today you will just get some encouragement that will walk with you through your week. And that's what we exist for here at Black Hawk Ministries is to let the name of Jesus be known here in Fort Wayne and around the world. And so today we're going to be looking at Psalm 139, one of my favorites. It's going to, I think help you.
[time=616] I think help you see maybe how you look in the mirror a little bit differently. See yourself in a way that maybe God will see you. And so I pray that you can sit back, relax and just watch God work and teach you some new things today. I want to encourage you to connect with us here at Black Hawk. We love hearing your stories. It's almost every week that I hear somebody's story that either connected with us on the Bible hour or watching us online through these kinds of ministries. So I want to encourage you to share your story with us. You can connect with us on social medium.

[time=675] The head that once was ground with thought is ground with glory now. The Savior now to wash our feet. Now what is made we love.
[time=702] The one who wore our signature. Now wrote in majesty. The radiance of perfect love. Now shines for all to see.
[time=728] Your name. Your name is victory. All praise will rise to Christ our King. Your name. Your name is victory. All praise will rise to Christ our King.
[time=758] [MUSIC]

[time=803] Your name. Your name is victory. All praise will rise to Christ our King. Your name. Your name is victory. All praise will rise to Christ our King.
[time=832] [MUSIC]
[time=838] By your spirit I will rise from the ashes of defeat. The resurrected King is resurrecting me. In your name I come alive to declare your victory.
[time=909] The resurrected King is resurrecting me. It's resurrecting me.
[time=923] [MUSIC]
[time=940] The tomb that soldiers watched in vain was borrowed for three days. His body there would not be made. Our God has not loved me.
[time=966] Our God has not loved me. Your name. Your name is victory. All praise will rise to Christ our King. Your name. Your name is victory. All praise will rise to Christ our King.
[time=994] Your name will rise to Christ our King. By your spirit I will rise from the ashes of defeat. The resurrected King is resurrecting me. In your name I come alive to declare your victory.
[time=1018] The resurrected King is resurrecting me. By your spirit I will rise from the ashes of defeat. The resurrected King is resurrecting me. In your name I come alive to declare your victory.
[time=1042] The resurrected King is resurrecting me. The resurrected King is resurrecting me.
[time=1055] The resurrected King is resurrecting me.
[time=1062] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1073] Psalm 139. Look there with me. I am so excited to continue. In these next two weeks we're going to be wrapping up this series Songs of Jesus. We've been looking at the Psalms over the course of the summer. Looking at how Jesus is in every book of the Bible.
[time=1088] And he even quoted as you saw last week as Steve led us through Psalm 22. Jesus even quoted the Psalms many times. And so today we're going to be in Psalm 139. For this week and next week I want to talk about one simple thing.
[time=1101] Finding Jesus. Finding Jesus. Today particularly I want to talk about finding Jesus in me. Next week I want to talk about finding Jesus in my world. And there are two Psalms that really just stand out with this pursuit of finding Jesus.
[time=1117] And it starts with us. And so I want us to look at us today. And I've got one simple goal. One simple goal. My goal is that you leave this place today feeling a little bit differently about you than when you came in.
[time=1135] Now usually in church we're always preaching really hard. Make it about other people. It's about other people. Well today I want you to kind of turn it inward for just a minute. And why do we do that? That doesn't sound biblical right? Well I think we'll find that it is because the more we see ourselves accurately the way God sees us. The more we see other people and the world around us differently and the more we can make the impact that Jesus has called us to make. So my goal is that you see you differently as you leave than when you came in.
[time=1162] How many of you have been here when I've talked about the church smile before? Raise your hand. Okay there's a lot of you not raising your hand. So we've got to practice it one more time. The church smile is when we go to church and we put on this face that a lot of times isn't very real. Can I get a witness?
[time=1177] You may have had a knock-down drag-out fight all the way. The kids were screaming and they were throwing crayons and one got stuck in your ear and you never know what happens on the way and you're screaming and mad but you get out as soon as your foot hits that new nice parking lot out there you.
[time=1192] Hey brother, hey sister. It's great to see how you do. Oh I'm great. Our family's good. Show me your best church smile. Go ahead. This is a real one for me today. I feel great. I'm energized today.
[time=1209] We've worshipped together but a lot of times it's just not real because on the outside we know how to make it look good. We know how to make it look right but on the inside we feel like we're crumbling.
[time=1220] So here's what I want us to do. I want you to get your phone out if you've got one. I know usually they tell you to put those away in church. We're going to use one and I want you to take a selfie.
[time=1231] I mean if you don't know what a selfie is, anybody just kidding. Somebody will tell you, you're near you. Alright so I've got one here too and I want you to take a selfie but I don't want you to do your church smile.
[time=1241] I want you to do the real you. Nobody's looking. You look at your own phone. Don't look at somebody else's. I want you to take a minute and take a selfie of the real you.
[time=1249] You feel right now. Just you, not your family, not your friends. I'm going to take one with you guys. Ready? Here let's do mine first.
[time=1255] That way I can talk while you do yours. Ready? Get this one. This is the real me.
[time=1260] There we go. That's a good one. Now you take yours and then put your phone away or use it to open Psalm 139 because we're going to come back to that selfie.
[time=1270] Don't delete it. I don't care if you don't like it or not. Keep it. The first one. Some of you already deleted six didn't you?
[time=1278] I know how this selfie game works. I do. I want to give you the bottom line today. Hold on to that selfie because we're going to come back to it just a little while.
[time=1287] The bottom line of today's message as we look at Psalm 139 is that your formation, how you were formed, points to your foundation.
[time=1296] I want us to talk about how we were formed. I want us to talk about our formation. What led us to be the person, the human being that we are today.
[time=1304] I think it's going to point you to a foundation that's going to change your life in the week ahead. Your founder, by the way, is that foundation.
[time=1310] He who formed you. That's what Psalm 139 is all about. That founder values relationships. Do you ever notice that?
[time=1317] Matthew chapter 22, you don't have to turn there. A lawyer came to Jesus and he essentially asked Jesus trying to trap him.
[time=1324] Jesus, what's the most important command in all the law? Really what he was saying is Jesus, what's the most important thing to God?
[time=1331] You could say that's really what he was going for. What's most important to God? Because if it's most important in his law, it must be pretty important.
[time=1338] Jesus said, say it with me. If you know it, love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[time=1343] And then the second is like it to love your neighbor as yourself. So it's two things, right? To love who?
[time=1351] God. And to love. I think there's a third though. Does anybody know what the third one is?
[time=1359] I preach better when you talk to me.
[time=1362] To love your neighbor as, to love your neighbor as yourself.
[time=1369] I want to submit to you today that if we don't learn to love the me that God has given me, we're not going to be able to love the others, nor love God the way that he intends.
[time=1380] That's for some of you, I figured it wouldn't be a lot of amends because that's a hard thing. I am my harshest critic. I am very hard on myself, too hard at times, I would say.
[time=1392] You may join me in that. You may feel like I can't love the me that looks back at me sometimes. I don't post selfies maybe because I don't like the selfie that's in the selfie perhaps.
[time=1402] But today, I want to give you today five things. Straight from this passage, we're going to go through a chunk at a time. Read all 24 verses a chunk at a time.
[time=1410] And I want to give you five things that we see here that will help you find Jesus in you. Find Jesus in you.
[time=1418] So let's look at those. Number one and verses one through four is that God knows me.
[time=1423] You can take notes in your app there on your note sheet as you came in or make mental notes or just act like it. Everybody will think you're doing it and we'll all be good.
[time=1431] God knows me. God knows me. I want you to say these points with me. Say that with me. God knows me.
[time=1439] Who's ready for the word this morning? Verses one through four, Psalm 139. They're reading from the ESV this morning.
[time=1445] If you want to join with me. It's the same version as the Bibles in your seats if you don't have one. David writes this to us.
[time=1452] He says, Oh Lord, you have searched me and known me. You know where I sit down and when I rise up you discern my thoughts from afar.
[time=1461] You search out my path and my lying down and are acquainted with all my ways even before a word is on my tongue.
[time=1470] Behold, O Lord, you know it all together. That last verse scares me a little bit. There's a lot of words that happen here that don't get out here.
[time=1480] Is that just me? A lot of words happen here that don't come out here. You guys are all way more spiritual than me. I can tell you don't think bad thoughts and bad things sometimes.
[time=1490] But to know that God knows all the thoughts, all the words that don't even get to come out of my mouth that I try to suppress and push back in there.
[time=1497] That's a little scary sometimes. I don't know if I want to be known that much sometimes. I feel kind of vulnerable when I read that.
[time=1504] I don't like vulnerability. I don't like knowing that I've got to be out there for anybody to see, especially the creator of the universe.
[time=1511] But that's what we see here is that God truly does know me. We often get hung up I would say on how we should question God.
[time=1519] I love this about David because he's just raw. He's just real. He just pours out all of his troubles, all of his struggles and all of his thoughts about God, sometimes randomly all over the place in the Psalms.
[time=1530] But we get to see a glimpse of who he was at his core. My take after reading about how God knows me is this. This is just a thought that kind of spurred off of this.
[time=1539] I feel like somebody needs this today. It's going to help you see yourself differently. We often struggle with questioning God.
[time=1546] We often struggle and we say, "Oh, it's wrong to question God." I could get there. I get that. I think if we had perfect faith, we would never question God.
[time=1556] How many of you have that? Perfect faith. Let me see. Oh, I don't for sure. If you do, you write the book. I'll be your first customer.
[time=1564] I'll buy that. But we don't have a perfect faith and there are times in our life where we say, "God, I don't know what you're doing. I don't know where you're at. I don't know how to find you Jesus in the middle of a situation."
[time=1575] And so what I would submit to you is if God knows you, like David is writing here, then wouldn't it make sense that he already knows the questions that are swirling around in your head and in your heart?
[time=1585] And if God already knows those things, here's what I would submit to you today. I believe that if God already knows those things, we should lay them at his feet, vocalize them to God because he already knows they're there anyway.
[time=1597] And here's what I've learned about God. He's big enough to handle my questions. God's big enough to handle your questions.
[time=1604] Now, as the pastor preaching that you should go to questioning God, no, I'm preaching that I know you already are. God already knows you are. He already knows your heart. He knows you're getting up and you're lying down. He knows what's in the depths of your heart.
[time=1615] So trust him knowing that he knows you, yet he also cares for you, that he also loves you right where you sit. So God knows me. Number two, God is with me. God is with me.
[time=1630] Say that with me. God is with me. You ever struggle with finding Jesus in a circumstance? I feel like maybe he's a million miles away. For honest, I think we'd all nod to that point.
[time=1641] Let's look at verses 5 through 12. I'm going to read it to you. Is this all about how God is with me? He says, "David Rice, you hem me in behind and before and lay your hand upon me." One of my favorite verses in this whole passage will come back there.
[time=1658] Verse 6, "Such knowledge is too wonderful for me. It is high. I cannot attain it. Where shall I go from your spirit or where shall I flee from your presence? If I ascend to heaven, you are there.
[time=1671] If I make my bed in jail, you are there. If I take wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there your hand shall lead me. And your right hand shall hold me." Verse 11.
[time=1685] "If I say surely the darkness shall cover me and the light about me be night." Verse 12, "Even the darkness is not dark to you. The night is bright as the day, for darkness is as light with you."
[time=1702] Powerful passage there. Several things to unpack. But the first thing I want to address is those times where you don't feel close to God. You feel like he's a million miles away.
[time=1712] That impacts how you see yourself, doesn't it? It impacts how you see your world, doesn't it? But he's with you, even when he's a million miles away.
[time=1720] One of the best lessons I learned as a young Christian that I'm still learning today is that feelings do this. They're like the waves of the sea. How many of you have ever been deep sea fishing before?
[time=1732] How many of you have ever gotten deep sea fishing or otherwise before? What do they tell you to do? Don't get it in the boat, right?
[time=1742] After they tell you that, they say look at the horizon. What I've learned in life, what I'm learning in life is that the waves of the sea are a lot like my feelings.
[time=1754] There's a lot of times I feel like God is right next to me in those moments, like when we're worshiping together as a church, but then Monday comes and I don't feel like God's right next to me as much.
[time=1763] It's in those times where the feelings come and go that I have to learn not to put my faith in the feelings and how I feel, but go back to the fact and the constancy, the horizon of how God looks at me, how God loves me.
[time=1777] And this Jesus that Hebrew says is the same yesterday today and forever. He's that horizon, that constant thing that you can look to when everything else, all your feelings tell you to go up and go down.
[time=1791] Put your faith in the fact of how constant Jesus is and not the feelings that pull you left and right and up and down.
[time=1799] He loves you, He's going to meet you there because He is with you even when He feels a million miles away. Don't believe me, look at verse 5 there again, probably one of my favorite verses.
[time=1809] I think I say that a lot, don't I? My favorite verse, I just like the whole thing, it's just all good. Can I give the name in?
[time=1815] Verse 5, you hem me in behind and before. If you were here when I talked about Psalm 23, I talked about how you are surrounded by your shepherd.
[time=1824] In Psalm 23 we see that God is all around us as our shepherd and we see that here. He hems me in, He's behind me, He's in front of me and He's with me.
[time=1834] I'm surrounded by a shepherd who loves me and is with me all the days of my life.
[time=1840] And that changes the times of darkness, verses 11 and 12 that we just read.
[time=1845] Darkness is not even really dark to you. He said, I love that. Even darkness is not dark to you.
[time=1851] God, in our darkness, when we see storms, when we see the darkness of night, God sees a light shining through the darkness.
[time=1860] God sees something sometimes that we can't see and we've got to put our feelings in this shroud, this cloud of blindness aside.
[time=1867] And we've got to let the light of Jesus pierce through the darkness because what we can only see is darkness.
[time=1873] He sees as a bright light, He sees as a new morning where His mercies will become new for you every single day because He is with you.
[time=1883] God is with me. He's not going anywhere. Number three, go to verse 13.
[time=1890] So we've seen how God is with us.
[time=1893] We've seen very clearly that God knows us, but also God formed me. Say that with me. God formed me. God formed me.
[time=1902] He formed you, verses 13 through 16. Look there with me, verses 13 here.
[time=1908] This is the most popular, perhaps, segment of this passage. There's so much here. Let's look at it together.
[time=1913] For you formed my inward parts. You knitted me together in my mother's womb. I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[time=1923] Wonderful are your works. My soul knows it very well. My frame was not hidden from you when I was being made in secret.
[time=1932] Intricately woven in the depths of the earth. Your eyes saw my unformed substance and your book were written.
[time=1940] Every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them.
[time=1947] Verse 16 pops out too as something we had put something on social media and I saw maybe you're here, maybe you're watching today.
[time=1953] Someone had written, "Help me understand," verse 16. And I love verse 16 and I want to talk about that for a second.
[time=1960] When we focus on those other verses, you formed me. You put me together. You knew all this.
[time=1964] But what we see in this passage that a lot of times we think is about David. We think it's about me.
[time=1969] This passage is really all about God. It's really about the Creator.
[time=1973] It's really about the one who brought about our formation, who now is our foundation for our life.
[time=1979] And in verse 16, you see how God is omnipotent. He's all powerful.
[time=1983] You see how God is omnipresent. Means He's everywhere at once. You see that clearly as you look at verse 16.
[time=1990] And omniscient because He knows everything. You see that there in verse 16 as it talks about our days.
[time=1996] You saw my unformed substance. That's the formation part. But also in your book were written. Meaning you know.
[time=2002] You know God knows me. He's with me. You knew even before my days even started what my days would look like.
[time=2009] What my struggles would be. Even before they even happened, you knew.
[time=2013] That's what verse 16 reminds me of is how powerful, how all knowing, how all loving, how all caring our God is.
[time=2023] He's present with you, just like He's present with me, just like He's present with who sits beside you and people across the globe.
[time=2030] That's the God that we serve. So let's talk about our formation.
[time=2035] I love studying the human body. And just how beautifully made, wonderfully, fearfully made that we truly are.
[time=2043] And so what happened for you, in case you didn't know this, one cell, one cell from your mom and one cell from your dad came together.
[time=2052] And you started as one little simple cell. Did you know that? That's how it all got started for you.
[time=2058] And so now the DNA code in that. I've been looking at some of this. I'm far from a scientist. But wow, you're pretty amazing.
[time=2065] I'm pretty amazing. Look at somebody say I'm pretty amazing.
[time=2069] They'll say you're pretty amazing. Say I'm pretty amazing.
[time=2073] We are. One strand of DNA. If you stretched it out, one character at a time would be about six feet in length.
[time=2081] But for one cell, this is one cell. That's amazing to think about that.
[time=2085] And if you stretch it out, it'd be six feet. Now you have in your body right now is made up of around 75 trillion cells.
[time=2092] Yes, I said trillion cells. Now if you stretch those out, the characters, one at a time, you stretch those out, one of them is about six feet.
[time=2100] About as tall as me. In length, if you stretched all of those out, that would be enough DNA code to go to the moon and back.
[time=2108] 178,000 times. Who comes up with this stuff anyway, right? It's fascinating though.
[time=2117] Now if I were to read to you your DNA code at the rate of one character, so again, it's three billion. Three billion characters just in one cell.
[time=2126] If I were to read your DNA, this is the story of you by the way. God mow you together. It's your story. It's God's language of how He made you to be who you are.
[time=2136] If I were to read that to you one character at a time, one character at a time at the rate of one character per second, I'd do it day and night.
[time=2144] It would take me 96 years to read to you the story of you. Think about that. That's the kind of God that we serve.
[time=2152] Now within that, you're a miracle. That's what I'm trying to tell you. You're a miracle of God.
[time=2157] And as we look at this, by the way, when I said all that, 100,000 or so of your cells died and 100 plus more were regenerated.
[time=2168] So 100,000 plus cells died and over that, regenerated again. And you were wondering why you were tired and need a nap.
[time=2177] You thought it was my preaching, didn't you? You're just working hard, even sitting here. You are a miracle. Augustine said this.
[time=2185] I love this quote. He said, "Men go abroad to wonder at the height of mountains, at the huge waves of the sea, the long course of rivers, the vast compass of the ocean, the circular motion of the stars, and they pass by themselves without even wondering."
[time=2201] You're a miracle. One of my favorite things about the human body is the human eye. Look at this picture on the screen.
[time=2209] There's your eye. The human eye. Now I don't like when people mess with my eyes. I wear contacts.
[time=2217] But I have glasses in eighth grade, and I decided I needed to have contacts so I could play baseball better.
[time=2223] And so I decided I'm going to get contacts. I got them in now, and I've been wearing them since eighth grade.
[time=2228] But man, your eye is pretty sensitive. I don't know if yours is like mine. I had to learn to put my contacts in.
[time=2235] I had to go stand against a wall like this, and I put my hands behind my back and my parents. One would hold my hands and push me against the wall.
[time=2245] The other would hold an eye open and pop that baby in. I'll never forget the first time. It took us probably an hour to get two contacts in my eyes.
[time=2259] I'll never forget it. But the eye. And I learned to appreciate my eyes because eventually I stuck it out and I got them in.
[time=2265] It took about a week and a half. I had some patient parents, you guys. They stuck in there with me.
[time=2270] But I love the human eye. It's the most complex human mechanism, computerized mechanism known to man.
[time=2278] And it's about an inch in diameter, a ping pong ball is about an inch and a half.
[time=2281] So it's two thirds the size of a ping pong ball, and it's the most advanced computerized mechanism known to man.
[time=2288] I'm going to teach you some stuff about yourself today that I've learned about us.
[time=2293] Now, within the retina alone, there's a few things you should know about your eye. This is going to be fascinating.
[time=2298] You have 130 million cells. This is one eye. And 120 million rods and cones that your eye uses to compute and send to your brain what you're seeing.
[time=2310] That's how we realize how small we are in comparison to how big God is.
[time=2314] So your eye begins formation about week four of pregnancy when you're in the womb.
[time=2318] It's completed by about week nine when the baby, when you were about the size of a grape, this complex computerized mechanism that's the most advanced known to man.
[time=2328] In those five weeks it forms. And for that to happen, think about this.
[time=2332] There are literally millions, yes, millions of optic nerves that have to come together.
[time=2338] Now, they don't just need to find another nerve. They have to find their exact match.
[time=2343] They have to find number one has to find number one.
[time=2347] Number six hundred and twenty seven thousand and thirty six has to find number six hundred and twenty seven thousand and thirty six and so on.
[time=2353] They all have to find their match. Can you imagine a million people in this room trying to find somebody with the same number on their chest?
[time=2359] There's a match. There's only one though. They have to come together before you're able to see.
[time=2364] Before eyelids can start forming. That's what happened twice, by the way.
[time=2370] As I think you've got two. Most of the time we do. We have two of those and for that to happen we have to have all of those nerves come together.
[time=2377] Your eyelid and your eye is fused shut. There's a piece of skin that's over your eye until about six months.
[time=2384] When you're in the womb at about the six month mark, your eyes just had one eyelid that didn't have any way of opening an eye.
[time=2390] It's covered. It's fused shut until that six month mark.
[time=2393] Now, if you read scientific journals, I read a lot of them this week just looking up this process.
[time=2397] Not Christian journals, but just secular scientific journals.
[time=2401] You'll read things like a mysterious separation then occurs.
[time=2406] The word mysterious, it can't make this stuff up.
[time=2410] A mysterious slicing mechanism slices the skin so that the eyelid is formed.
[time=2419] Have you ever noticed that all of our eyelids go this way? You don't see anybody blinking like this.
[time=2425] And guess what? All that whole time, that mysterious slicing mechanism was happening around your eye.
[time=2432] Behind it, there was a muscle being formed. Your eyelid has the fastest muscle in your body.
[time=2438] Some people can blink up to five times in just one second. That's fast.
[time=2444] And because I know half the room is secretly trying to see if you could do it right now. Let's do it together.
[time=2449] Let's do it together. Ready? On three. Let's see if we can get five. One, two, three.
[time=2454] Did I get it? Do you tie me? No. It's close. I don't know. Some of you got it.
[time=2459] By the way, women blink more than men have no idea what that has to do with what I'm talking about.
[time=2464] I thought it was interesting. Some of you can take that home and massage it, and I'm sure there's a truth in there, somewhere.
[time=2471] And by the way, you keep going with this. Not only are those muscles forming behind the scenes, but half later eyelashes and eyebrows appear at about month seven of pregnancy, and then you have this complex computerized mechanism, and I barely scratched the surface.
[time=2486] My non-scientific self trying to tell you these things. Wow. God formed you.
[time=2492] Let me tell you something about being the created and how God formed you.
[time=2497] As the created, I believe that we should value what our creator values.
[time=2511] You're fearfully and wonderfully made. I want to see your eyes for just a minute.
[time=2516] Everybody look at me. Some of you came today because you needed to hear this phrase. God values you.
[time=2527] You're fearfully and wonderfully made. God formed you in the womb.
[time=2533] Everything from your eyes to your toenails. God formed you, and he values you.
[time=2538] And I think that we have got to learn how to value what our creator values.
[time=2543] Took a team with me of 12 people here from Black Hawk to Idaho a week or so ago.
[time=2548] And we did some discipleship training.
[time=2550] They asked us a question that kind of fits into this really well, and I want to ask it to you.
[time=2553] And I wrestled with this question. We have several of our team that really wrestled with this question.
[time=2557] I want to ask it to you. And the question is this. What is it about you that brings pleasure to God?
[time=2567] Maybe write that down. You're probably not going to be able to answer all that fully right now.
[time=2571] But what is it about you that brings pleasure to God?
[time=2575] I want to challenge you by next week when we talk about finding Jesus in my world to answer that question for yourself.
[time=2582] You can ask other people and no doubt they'll probably have a list.
[time=2585] Well, you're kind and you're pretty and all these things. But no, I want you to ask God this week.
[time=2592] God, what is it about me that brings pleasure to you?
[time=2596] And here's what I want to challenge you with. If you say there isn't anything, you're wrong.
[time=2600] Because God values you. He formed you. You're fearfully and wonderfully made.
[time=2607] Don't you wrestle with that question this week? That's my challenge.
[time=2610] And you know, here's the thing. A lot of you feel defined by labels.
[time=2614] Think in your mind, what's the worst name you've been called? What's the worst thing someone said?
[time=2618] Painful thought.
[time=2620] But I want you to bring that up for a minute. A lot of times those things consume us and define us.
[time=2624] And some of you are living right now with a named label that drives who you are.
[time=2629] It drives how you think. You can't think of yourself. You can't look at a selfie.
[time=2633] You can't look in the mirror without thinking about these things that you've heard about you.
[time=2637] These labels that are just slapped across your forehead.
[time=2640] But here's what I want to challenge you with. This is going to be tough. You ready for it?
[time=2644] I want to challenge you to know that you don't get to name what you didn't create.
[time=2651] And whoever said that to you, they don't get to name what they didn't create.
[time=2656] My creator formed me. He made me fearfully and wonderfully and intricately in my mother's womb with every detail.
[time=2664] He made me. So he gets to name me. I don't get that privilege. They don't get that privilege.
[time=2670] That privilege is already taken by a God who knows you. A God who formed you.
[time=2675] And a God who loves you and values you.
[time=2679] Somebody's going to leave today and those labels you've been carrying around. You're going to want them up and throw them away.
[time=2686] I believe it because Jesus is not interested in the labels that we often get consumed by.
[time=2691] He's interested in how he sees you. And when God looks at you and you know Jesus Christ and you have a personal relationship with him, as flawed as you are.
[time=2700] When God sees you, God sees Jesus. He doesn't see your mess. He sees the message he brings out of your mess.
[time=2707] He doesn't see just the test that you're in the middle of. He sees the testimony that he's going to bring out in the end.
[time=2713] He is not through with you. He values you and don't let those labels consume you anymore.
[time=2719] God already named you. He created you. You know what he said? Your mind. Your mind.
[time=2728] Number four. It keeps going doesn't it? Number four. Love this passage. God thinks about me.
[time=2737] God formed me but God thinks about me. Verses 17 and 18. Look there with me.
[time=2743] How precious to me are your thoughts so God. How vast is the sum of them. If I were to count them, they are more than the sand.
[time=2752] I awake and I'm still with you. Love that. God thinks about me. I'm going to give you a statement about what it means when God thinks about you.
[time=2762] It's this, that you are who God says you are. You are who God says you are. He created you. He named you.
[time=2769] So you can be who he's called you to be. Some of you are wrestling with a calling.
[time=2773] You're wrestling with something God's trying to ask you to do. A phone call. You've got to make a step of faith that you've got to take.
[time=2779] You've got to take and you've been wrestling with that and you've been holding back because you just don't feel equipped.
[time=2784] But I'm a walking testimony in my whole life. I always said I would never be a pastor like my dad. If you don't know me, that was me.
[time=2790] I will never be a pastor like my dad. Be careful. You never know what God's going to do.
[time=2796] Here's what I've learned that God doesn't always call the equipped but he always equips the called.
[time=2801] Always forever. No matter what God's asking of you, no matter how inadequate you may feel, take a step of faith knowing that God will equip you
[time=2812] because he is with you because God thinks about you. You can be who God's called you to be because you are who God says you are.
[time=2820] He gets to do that naming, that labeling and he's already done it and I praise God for it.
[time=2825] I love how this passage ends. The last thing, number five, is that God is patient with me. God is patient with me.
[time=2833] Can I get the name in? God is patient with me. Verses 19 through 24, look there with me.
[time=2840] You see a shift in David's language. He's doing so well. It's so beautifully written and it flows and it ties everything together really well.
[time=2847] And then there's this weird part where David just kind of pours his heart out and he says, "Oh, that you would slay the wicked." So he says, "I awake and I'm still with you."
[time=2854] "I awake and I'm still with you." Oh, that you would slay the wicked God. What a weird turn in this passage.
[time=2862] Slay the wicked God. Oh, man of blood, depart from me. They speak against you with malicious intent.
[time=2867] Your enemies take your name in vain. Do I not hate those who hate you, O Lord? And do I not loathe those who rise up against you?
[time=2875] Do I hate them with a complete hatred? Know any people like that?
[time=2880] I count them my enemies and then he ends with two beautiful verses. I love this picture of just what the turmoil looks like in David's heart.
[time=2888] You ever chase rabbits? Those preachers do that a lot, knowing.
[time=2892] If I would just stick to the point, quit telling that crazy story. Well, he's telling us a story. Verse 23, "Search me, O God."
[time=2900] Let this be your prayer this week. "Search me, O God. Know my heart. Try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any grievous way in me and lead me in the way everlasting."
[time=2913] That's my prayer, God. Know my heart and guess what he already does. He knows you, yet he loves you.
[time=2921] While you were still a sinner, Christ died for you. He cares about you. He's patient with you.
[time=2926] And I want you to know today that God will often select what man will reject.
[time=2931] God will often select what man will reject. Remember those labels? Maybe you've been rejected here today.
[time=2937] You've been rejected and you feel like you're living in rejection. Well, God selects what man rejects.
[time=2943] Psalm 118, verses 22 through 23, it's in your notes, the stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.
[time=2950] That's Jesus. It's talking about Jesus, but he does the same thing for us.
[time=2955] I love how that verse ends. This is the Lord's doing.
[time=2960] God's not finished with you. God looks at you and he sees the blood of Jesus. For those of you who know him and those of you who don't, that can be you.
[time=2967] You're invited into his family in this moment.
[time=2970] I want you to do two things with me. First of all, I want you to get your phone back out.
[time=2974] I want you to pull up your selfie. I'm serious.
[time=2978] I know for some of you, we joke a little bit about selfies.
[time=2981] For some of you, it's hard to look at yourself, but I want you to just tune everybody else out for a minute and just look at yourself.
[time=2987] And if you didn't get to take a selfie, then just close your eyes and think about you.
[time=2991] I want you to look at yourself.
[time=2993] I want to tell you a few things and I want to ask you to try your best to get to a place where you can really say, I believe what that pastor's saying because it comes from the Bible.
[time=3003] Look at yourself and just know that that you is valued by God. That you is known by God.
[time=3013] That God is with that person in that picture. That God's not through with that person in that picture.
[time=3020] That God loves you, that God formed you intricately with every detail that He's not finished with you and that He's patient with you.
[time=3034] I just want to ask you to close your eyes with me for a moment now with that in mind.
[time=3038] I hope you'll keep that picture if you took one.
[time=3041] I hope you'll just keep it, hold on to it as a reminder of what today's all about that I can find Jesus in me.
[time=3047] A lot of times selfies are really all about what we want the world to see, not the real us, not what God sees, but I want you to today ask God for the filter, the God filter.
[time=3056] We have all these filters with all the selfies we do now.
[time=3058] Ask God for His filter. Look through the filter of how God sees you.
[time=3062] If you're here today and you've got something that you need to get straight with God, maybe you know Jesus today, but you found Him in a new way and God has really spoken to you about how to view yourself in one way or another.
[time=3073] I want to ask you just to raise your hand, say pray for me. I need to see myself differently this week.
[time=3077] I've got some steps. Be bold. Lift it high. Praise God.
[time=3081] You can put your hands down. I'll pray for you in a minute.
[time=3084] But I also want to pray for those of you and talk to those of you who are here and you would say, you know you've talked about how God values me and God sees me through the lens of the blood of Jesus if I have a personal relationship, but pastor, I don't know that I have a personal relationship.
[time=3097] If I were to ask you, if you were to die today, do you know that you would spend eternity with Jesus in heaven? Do you know that you could say yes?
[time=3107] Some of you right now, I think, are wrestling and saying, you know, I'd like to know, I think so, but I'm not totally sure.
[time=3113] I want you to know that today can be the day of salvation for you, not because I'm here, not because you're in a church building, but because Jesus loves you, because Jesus died for you.
[time=3123] Salvation is this. It's the good news. It's the gospel. That's what gospel means. It means good news because the news happened. Jesus did die on the cross.
[time=3131] He lived a sinless life that you could never live. He died a death paying a price you could never pay.
[time=3139] And not only did he die for you and on the cross, they father forgive them because they don't know what they're doing.
[time=3145] After three days, he became that resurrected king. And because he's the resurrected king, when we surrender, when we say, God, I'm yours, we too can be resurrected and brought from death to life.
[time=3161] And salvation is not even about a prayer, so I'm not even going to lead you in one.
[time=3165] I believe your heart's screaming it to God. It's about your heart being surrendered to him.
[time=3170] Nobody looking around, just you and Jesus for a minute, all heads bowed. If that's you today, I want to give you a moment to do just that.
[time=3175] I'm not going to lead you in a prayer. Your heart's screaming it. You say, but I can't say it like you did, pastor. God doesn't want you to.
[time=3181] God wants you as you. God wants you to pour yourself out to him, ask him to save you believing that he died for you, that he's alive.
[time=3190] I'm saying, Jesus, I give you me in this moment. And he's going to do just that. Will you stop? Will you do that?
[time=3220] Come, stretch wide. I know you're here right, right.
[time=3233] Sing to me now. I surrender. I surrender. I surrender. I want to know you more. I want to know you more.
[time=3262] I surrender. I surrender. I want to know you more. I want to know you more.
[time=3292] Sing to me now.
[time=3305] My courage in winning, Jesus screaming God, have your way, God, have your way, be, be.
[time=3321] Like the mighty storm, start with being my soul, Lord, have your way, Lord, have your way, be, be.
[time=3342] Like the bloody storm, start with being my soul, Lord, have your way, be, be.
[time=3362] Like the mighty storm, start with being my soul, Lord, have your way, Lord, have your way, be, be.
[time=3379] Lord, have your way, Lord, have your way, Lord, have your way, be, be.
[time=3390] You can breathe, Lord, have your way, Lord, have your way, be, be.
[time=3401] I surrender. I surrender. I want to know you more.
[time=3417] I want to know you more.
[time=3426] So how's your selfie look?
[time=3428] Maybe today God has spoken to you and you look in the mirror, you look at that selfie and now you see something a little bit different.
[time=3435] Maybe now you see something that God has shown and revealed to you to be something a little more like he had in mind.
[time=3441] Maybe less of what you saw, maybe more of what he thinks about you.
[time=3445] I pray that's the case. If you've been walking with Jesus for a while, I pray that today you see what he sees.
[time=3450] But maybe you're one of those that I've been talking to and as I've walked you through what the gospel is all about, that really stirred something in you.
[time=3457] And God is really drawing you in this moment and today is that day of salvation for you.
[time=3463] Perhaps you've been putting that off because you needed to get things lined up.
[time=3467] Maybe you needed to get things in order first in your mind, but you've realized that maybe if I'm going to wait on that, that day's never going to come.
[time=3473] Don't wait anymore. Today is that day. God wants to meet you where you are in this moment.
[time=3479] And no matter what's going on around you, he's there.
[time=3482] And so I want to encourage you to take the gospel for what it is.
[time=3485] As I've described it, as we've looked at it today, that Jesus is all that you need.
[time=3490] That all you have to do is lay your life down at his feet.
[time=3493] Trust that he died for you after living a sinless life, you can never live.
[time=3497] That he died for you, he's alive, he rose again, he defeated the grave just for you.
[time=3502] If you've trusted in that, we want to know. We want to walk with you.
[time=3505] Because this life, this walk of faith with Jesus is one that is not meant to be done along.
[time=3511] So let us walk with you. If you've taken that step, then let us know.
[time=3515] If you haven't taken that step and you need to, push pause.
[time=3518] Walk away. Take that time and I know that you won't regret it.
[time=3521] There's going to be some information on your screen here in just a moment, an email address and a phone number where you can reach out to us.
[time=3527] And if you've decided to follow Jesus, we've got a booklet that we want to get into your hands.
[time=3531] We'll be glad to mail that booklet to you.
[time=3533] We'd be glad for you to come here to our campus at Black Hawk Ministries and pick one up.
[time=3537] It's just called beginning steps. It's a growth guide.
[time=3540] It's going to help you walk forward in your faith.
[time=3542] Not get stagnant, not just sit here, not let today be the end, but let it be the beginning.
[time=3547] And I just know that God's got some amazing things in store for you.
[time=3551] Thank you again for taking time just to watch, to tune in.
[time=3554] But mainly to let God work. He is just getting started with you.
[time=3558] Now this week, when you look at your selfie, I pray that it looks a little bit different.
[time=3562] And we'll see you next week. God bless you.
