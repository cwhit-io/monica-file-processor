[time=453] [MUSIC - 358 seconds]
[time=835] Thanks so much for tuning in today. We are so excited about all that God has in store for you, for me, and for our whole family. Thanks for being a part of what we call just our extended family. Even if I've never had the privilege of meeting you, I consider you a part of the Black Hawk family. And we try to stay connected as best we can. And anyway, we can hear from you, hear your story, know how we can serve you. That's our goal. That's our heart. And so a lot of the ways we can do that and stay connected is through our social media platform. So if you haven't connected with us, we can't have any other people.
[time=862] You can look through our social media platform. So if you haven't connected with us there, you can look for @BHalkMinistries on both Twitter or Instagram. You can go on Facebook and search for Black Hawk Ministries or the Bible Hour to get some more information and connect with us that way. And the best way to get connected with us, perhaps, is our websites, the hub of our information there, BlackhawkMinistries.org, or download our Church App, Black Hawk Church App, just in your App Store. Look for that. And there's great ways to send in prayer requests, to know the events that are coming up.
[time=890] And just to be able to even catch up on past messages or know what's coming up, even Sundays ahead of us here. And so fall is also a very exciting time at Black Hawk as school, gets back in session.
[time=902] We're excited about all that fall has in store. And so Wednesday, September the 6th, is when we'll be kicking back off on our Wednesday night programming, which includes all of our kids and our youth and our adult programming, simple suppers, where we just have a mealtime together.
[time=916] So invite you to come be a part of that. And then lots of other things, Sundays, Wednesdays throughout the week with all of our adult life groups, many ways for you to connect with us this fall at Black Hawk.
[time=927] I encourage you go to our website, BlackhawkMinistries.org/events. And you'll see a list of all of those things there.
[time=933] But more than anything in this moment, I challenge you just to take a breath with me and just let God work.
[time=940] Worship Him with all that you've got. Open yourself up to what He has in store as we dig into His Word today. I know He's got something special for you.
[time=970] These will come, confess, and know that you are holy, and know that you are holy.
[time=987] In love we'll sing out, hallelujah, and we will cry out, hallelujah.
[time=1013] All the hearts who are content, and all who feel unworthy, and all who hurt with nothing left,
[time=1032] will know that you are holy. In love we'll sing out, hallelujah, and we will cry out, hallelujah.
[time=1051] You know we'll sing out, hallelujah, and we will sing out, hallelujah.
[time=1080] Go on and scream it from the Mount. Go on and tell it to the Mass.
[time=1143] Go on and tell it to the Mass.
[time=1167] Go on and tell it to the Mass. Go on and tell it to the Mass.
[time=1196] Go on and tell it to the Mass.
[time=1202] Go on and tell it to the Mass. Go on and tell it to the Mass.
[time=1218] Go on and sing it from the Mount. Go on and tell it to the Mass.
[time=1245] Go on and tell it to the Mass. Go on and tell it to the Mass.
[time=1291] Can we just celebrate what God's doing in this place today?
[time=1299] I love the church. I love seeing people find Jesus.
[time=1303] And that's what I want to talk to you about today.
[time=1305] We've been in a series of Focus and Emphasis on what we've called Songs of Jesus.
[time=1310] We've been in the Book of Psalms.
[time=1311] And so if you've got your Bibles or phones or iPads or screens or whatever you have, get those out. Look at Psalm 19.
[time=1318] The 19th Psalm will be looking there today.
[time=1321] And so we've been in this series looking at how Jesus is in every Book of the Bible.
[time=1326] We see him portrayed even in the Psalms that were written long before he came on to the scene.
[time=1332] And we've been finding Jesus every week.
[time=1335] And so last week I started kind of a two week focus on finding Jesus.
[time=1339] And we talked about finding Jesus in me.
[time=1341] We looked at Psalm 139. If you missed that, you can go on our website and encourage you to do that.
[time=1347] And we have people from all over that are a part of our family here.
[time=1350] And speaking of want to welcome all of our extended family.
[time=1353] We have a big family in the room, but a big family out there.
[time=1356] And so if you're watching us today online or if you're at home or through television, thank you for plugging into what God is up to.
[time=1363] He's got a plan for you. He's got a plan for all of us.
[time=1366] And so we're going to go today from finding Jesus in me to now finding Jesus in my world.
[time=1372] You ever find it hard to find God?
[time=1375] How many of you be honest and say, yep, I find it hard to find God in certain situations and certain seasons of my life. I've been there as your pastor.
[time=1384] I have trouble sometimes seeing what God's doing, what He's trying to teach me, where He is present in situations.
[time=1392] In those worst of situations that may happen at the hospital, that may happen at the homes that we all live in, those things that leave the biggest question marks.
[time=1401] It may be truly hard to just find Jesus in our world, especially in the world we live in today.
[time=1408] And so I think Psalm 19 gives us a great outline for how we can truly begin to find Jesus
[time=1414] beyond just inside of me, but outside of me at work in me, through me, and around me in my world.
[time=1422] One of my favorite things about the book of Psalms is that there are a lot like my life.
[time=1427] When I look out and I see everything from joy, to praise, to pain, to loss, to grief, to celebration, to strength, weakness, happiness, sadness, suffering, triumph, mourning, hopelessness, waiting, completion, to name a few.
[time=1442] And a lot of times our life is kind of like going from one of those songs to the next.
[time=1446] How many big music fans do we have in the building?
[time=1449] Yeah, I love music, and a lot of times in my life it's like I want to listen to the songs that the season I'm in, am I the one who does that?
[time=1457] And so you kind of go from song to song.
[time=1459] And so we want our songs, the point of this series is that our songs become the songs of Jesus,
[time=1465] that Jesus is at work and present in everything that we're seeing, saying, and doing.
[time=1470] And so one of the biggest themes of that is finding God, just looking for God.
[time=1476] And so some of you, I believe this, if I look at me for a minute, I believe this about you.
[time=1480] I may not know you, you may say you don't know me, you're exactly right.
[time=1483] But what I do know is that if you came in here looking for Jesus, he is here.
[time=1489] If you came in searching for something new, maybe you just came in to hear the kiddos sing, and now you have to endure that loud mouth preacher who gets up there and talks.
[time=1498] If that's you, then God has a plan for you, and he wants to meet you right there where you are.
[time=1505] And I don't know what you're facing.
[time=1507] I don't know what my world, that phrase, my world, finding Jesus in my world.
[time=1511] I don't know what my world means for you, but God's right in the middle of it.
[time=1516] He has not given up on you, even if you've given up on him.
[time=1519] So let's talk about how we can find that God, that Jesus who wants to work inside of us.
[time=1525] So I give you notes every week, you can look at those in your bulletin, or you can take notes on our church app, or however you would like.
[time=1531] You can also always say, just act like you're writing something every now and then, nobody will know the difference. Some of you can just remember it all.
[time=1538] I want to give you the bottom line. I always like giving you just a bottom line.
[time=1541] This is what I see in this passage, and what I believe God has for us today, and I can't wait to share this message with you is this.
[time=1549] That finding Jesus, finding Jesus begins, it starts with filtering the noise.
[time=1556] How many of you live a noisy life?
[time=1560] I've got two kids in my house, and we rarely have a minute of quiet.
[time=1564] At home, outside of home, in ministry here at the church.
[time=1567] This place is hustle and bustle all the time, things happening.
[time=1570] It's a loud place, it's a busy life, it's a busy world that we live in today.
[time=1576] And you know, sometimes what I've learned, I'm sure this is not you.
[time=1581] But with me, I've learned that a lot of times the noisiest mess that I've got a filter is what looks back at me in the mirror.
[time=1588] That I'm my noisiest distraction.
[time=1591] Look at somebody who said, "I think you just said you're noisy." I believe there's some other noisy people in this building right now, and God wants to help you filter through the noise.
[time=1603] So that's what I want us to look at now.
[time=1604] Psalm 19 gives us a great plan for just filtering the noise to try to find Jesus.
[time=1609] C.S. Lewis, I'm going to have you know who C.S. Lewis is.
[time=1612] Some of you may be new, great Christian author of Red Tons of His Stuff.
[time=1615] He said that this was his favorite psalm.
[time=1618] This is his favorite psalm, and he said about the whole book of psalm when it comes to this one.
[time=1623] He said it's the greatest poem in all of the psalms in his mind, one of the greatest lyrics in the world.
[time=1629] I think it's a great description of what we are going to read.
[time=1633] This is the same man, C.S. Lewis, who said that the Bible is not the book that you read, but the Bible is the book that reads you.
[time=1641] You ready to be read this morning?
[time=1644] God knows what you brought in. He knows what you drug in.
[time=1648] The ball, the chain, the noose times around your neck.
[time=1652] He knows what you brought in with you, and he's going to read through all that and help you find some things.
[time=1657] Psalm 119 is the longest chapter in the Bible.
[time=1660] It has 176 verses. I think that Psalm 19, so we go from narrowing 119 down to Psalm 19.
[time=1668] I think this is a great summary psalm for what that whole chapter, that whole passage is all about as we look at filtering the noise.
[time=1677] I just want to give you today three foundations. You can follow along with me.
[time=1680] We're going to go verse by verse. We're going to do three chunks of the verses, and I just want to share with you three foundations that I believe are going to help you find Jesus this week.
[time=1688] Who's ready for the word? That was weak. Who's ready for the word? All right.
[time=1693] I preach better when you talk. You guys know that.
[time=1696] What we're going to see here is two things. Revelation and response.
[time=1700] God reveals himself to us. That's his revelation. That's what we often call as a churchy term.
[time=1706] We often use for God's word, how he gave us who he is and revealed himself to us.
[time=1712] It's God's revelation. The first two things we'll look at really are his revelation.
[time=1716] The last thing we'll look at is our response to God's revelation.
[time=1720] Because God didn't just reveal himself to be heard and seen. He wanted to reveal himself to you and to me
[time=1726] so we could go and do something with what he's given to us.
[time=1730] Let me give you the first thing. It comes from the first six verses there of Psalm 19.
[time=1734] The first thing, the first foundation is God's glory in his world.
[time=1739] We see a big picture, a big foundation of God's glory in his world that he created.
[time=1744] Let's look together at Psalm 19 beginning there in the first verse.
[time=1748] It comes from the ESV, English standard version. If you want to follow along the same with me.
[time=1752] The heavens declare the glory of God and the sky above proclaims his handiwork.
[time=1760] Day to day, pours out speech and night to night reveals knowledge.
[time=1764] There is no speech nor are there words whose voice is not heard. Their voice goes out through all the earth and their words to the end of the world.
[time=1776] And he has set a tent for the sun which comes out like a bridegroom leaving his chamber. And like a strong man runs its course with joy. Verse six, it's rising. It's from the end of the heavens and its circuit to the end of them and there is nothing hidden from its heat.
[time=1796] What a beautiful picture of God's world, God's creation, his glory that's seen all around us here.
[time=1804] And so this first part is really God's revelation nor those two things I told you.
[time=1808] It's really his revelation through his creation is what we see in this passage.
[time=1812] His world, his revelation, how he reveals himself through what he has created. Now I love nature.
[time=1820] I love being outside. We have horses. We've got a little beanie farm.
[time=1824] We've got more animals than we do people I think at our house and they rule the place sometimes and we love that as a family. We just like being outside.
[time=1832] We like seeing God in nature. Who's with me? You just like going outside.
[time=1836] Well I want you to see a picture. This came from the end of June. I think it was June 20th. This is a picture of a rainbow. This right over my barn at our house. Isn't it beautiful? And that picture doesn't even do it justice.
[time=1848] Some of you sent me pictures in fact of this day and I remember this day particularly. This is just an example of what we're talking about. God's glory. It sounds so hard to grasp, right? God's glory in his world.
[time=1860] That means stuff like this. This day I remember it was kind of a low day. It was just one of those days I just couldn't quite get with it.
[time=1868] Never quite caught up with what the day held for me that day and I went home and our kids had just gone to bed. Had just gone to bed. Praise God.
[time=1876] So quiet in the house. Oh I'm not supposed to say that, right?
[time=1880] They were resting. They were just laying down to get their rest and I just walked outside and we both looked out the window and walked outside Jessica and I and we saw this and just reminded us just I call them God winks. Where God just winks at you and says I still got your back. I haven't left you. I'm still here.
[time=1900] May I say well where's the big punch line of that big illustration? The big emotional moment.
[time=1904] We had it right outside. Just a reminder that God's promises are real. And you know what we did? We don't do this often but we went and got the kids up. We did. It was just such a beautiful, you guys sent me the pictures of it. It was just a beautiful, clear rainbow. This picture doesn't do it any justice but we got them out there and we just let them look at it. We said God God has good promises that he wants to keep in your life and we went out there and we just looked at the rainbow and the kids were like hey we can look at rainbows all you want if I don't have to go to bed. But they stayed out there and we just got to teach them a little bit about why God created rainbows. His promises not to flood the earth again after Noah and the flood and God meets you where you are. And so let me challenge you. What's your most recent God wink? The most recent time you've seen God in the world around you. Hold on to those moments but I would challenge you to go past holding on to the past moments and move forward looking for those moments. Look for God and his glory and his amazing stature in the world around you because I promise you he is there. One of the questions I came away after looking at that rainbow is how many times do I miss God in my world around me. Because I'm too busy and too distracted and too noisy and I don't filter myself enough to hear what he's trying to teach me. And so that was one of the things that we saw there. So what I want to do is ask you a question for you to ponder this week. If you're taking notes of challenge you write this question down. Think about what it means for you because the world screams the glory of God. The heavens declare God and all of his glory. And so the question is this. Is your view of God? Is your view of God worthy of who the heavens say he is? Is your view of God worthy
[time=2010] of who the heavens of what creation says he is?
[time=2014] Maybe you can align those two things a little bit in your life because I believe the glorious design should always point us to a glorious designer. He is glorious. His glory is in the world all around us. And I think this some of you need this like me.
[time=2030] I'll tell you one of my weaknesses you want to know what I'm weak at? A lot of things.
[time=2034] My wife could give you a big list but one of the things I'm not real strong at is just making sure I get some silence. I think silence and solitude is a spiritual discipline and I'm not good at it.
[time=2046] I'm not very disciplined in that area a lot of times and so I want to give you a phrase that's just been working on me and it's this that I think sometimes the best way to filter the noise of life is to get an unfiltered glimpse. An unfiltered glimpse of God's glory in his world. Just go, you ready? What does that all that mean?
[time=2066] That's like a big eloquent way to just simply say go out into nature if you're not a nature person just go on your front porch and do this.
[time=2074] Some of you were taking notes I'm going to show you again.
[time=2078] Do this. Look at somebody and say you've been wanting to do that haven't you? You get all kinds of good opportunities at church. See what you've been missing? Just go and be silent. Be still and know that he's God. When's the last time you were still just to see the glory of God in the world around you? Number two we get to verse 7 here. Verse 7 through 10 or even beyond that on 3 verse 12 but verses 7 through 10 primarily we see God's greatness. We go from his glory in his world. We see God's greatness in his word in the Bible in the Scriptures. This is not just God's revelation through creation but God's revelation through his communication. How many of you know that God wants to talk to you? God wants to talk to you and I know what happened in some of your minds well he used to but then I started going down this track. I decided to kind of turn my back on God and I haven't been to church in a long time or I haven't read the Bible in a long time. I've kind of turned away from God so I'm sure he left me a long long time ago. I want you to know today that God still hasn't given up on you and just as much as he wanted to speak to you the first time maybe you listen he's speaking right now. He's got a word for you and I just believe somebody's going to leave this place finding Jesus maybe in terms of salvation. Somebody may be here though that you've been saved you've given your life to Jesus a long time ago but it's time to come back it's time to know that God's greatness is still great and that God's word is still true and that God's love for you is still real.
[time=2182] Somebody's going to leave here believing that maybe you didn't believe it when you walked in these doors I believe that wholeheartedly today because God's constantly speaking over us. Look at verses 7 through 10 with me where we see this greatness through his word. We shift from creation to now God's communication his law his word. Verse 7. The law of the Lord is perfect reviving the soul. The testimony of the Lord is sure making wise the simple. That's my favorite verse in this little section making wise the simple. Who's with me? Can I get a name in?
[time=2214] Making wise the simple. Verse 8. The precepts of the Lord are right rejoicing the heart. The commandment of the Lord is pure enlightening the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean enduring forever. The rules of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. More to be desired.
[time=2234] Underline that. More to be desired. What's the last time you hungered for what God had for you? Some of you are here today because that's you. You've desired to hear from God and he's got something for you. More to be desired are they than gold. Even much fine gold. Sweet are also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb.
[time=2254] I love the artistic way that David writes this out for us to hunger for the word of God. I want to share a few things that just stood out because I was looking at this and I want to share a quick story with you. But there's seven descriptions of the Bible that we see in just verses 7 through 9. Seven descriptions. They're not in your note. I just want to share them with you. They are this. They're perfect that God's word. This is the description of the Bible. We see just in those three verses it's perfect.
[time=2282] It's sure. It's right.
[time=2286] It's pure. It's clean.
[time=2290] It's true. And it's righteous.
[time=2294] Now when I hear those I think man I could use some more of that in my life.
[time=2298] When I hear that I hear solid stable in a world that just goes like this in a world where I feel like I'm on shifting sand. I feel stable when I hear those words.
[time=2310] And if you want some of that in your life I challenge you to look to God's word.
[time=2314] To look at how he wants to communicate with you.
[time=2318] I want to ask you to do something that I rarely will do in church because some of you won't come back.
[time=2322] But I want you to just close your eyes. I want to read a list of things some verbs. I gave you some adjectives, some descriptors of the Bible. But these are some of the things from this passage that God wants to do through his word today in your life. So I ask you just close your eyes and think about what these mean for you.
[time=2338] This is just in verses 7 through 11 we see these things. Powerful, packed passage of stuff. The Bible will restore your soul.
[time=2346] The Bible will renew your mind. The Bible will rejoice your heart. The Bible will refocus your vision. The Bible will refresh your life. The Bible will replace your doubts.
[time=2362] The Bible will redirect your path.
[time=2366] The Bible will reward your obedience.
[time=2370] Now come back to me. If somebody is still sleeping give him a good elbow for me.
[time=2374] How many of you could use some of that in your life?
[time=2378] You say man I'll take one of those R words you gave us there. I'll take one of those actions. One of those verbs. Well God offers all of that to you through his word.
[time=2386] So there was this newspaper passage, a little article.
[time=2390] A religious section in Georgia where I came from. We moved from Georgia last year and so this was actually published in the vicinity of where I first served as a youth pastor way back in the day. And so this religious article had a big fury of letters that started getting written in for this particular part of the paper. I just want to read some of it to you. It's about the Bible. Someone that got disgruntled with church. How many of you have ever been that before?
[time=2414] You've been disgruntled. You've been kind of frustrated with church. Don't tell me. That's all right.
[time=2418] Right now in fact. And you know why by the way this is a side sermon.
[time=2422] I'm going to step to the side because I won't come back. But you know why you're disgruntled with church? You say you don't know. Yes I do. You want to know how I know?
[time=2430] I've been in it a long time but you don't know why you're disgruntled because it's full of people.
[time=2438] It's full of people. And you know what I've been mistaken to do. I've made this mistake over and over. A lot of times I base my view of the church on what other people what God's people do or what God's people say. And you know what I've learned to do?
[time=2454] It's just kind of a remedy. It's a little side sermon. It's going to help somebody. I don't know where it's coming from but here you go. What you need to do is not base your view of the church on what God's people do but on who founded it because Jesus said it's my church. He said I will build my church and even the gates of hell won't prevail against it. And so I would challenge you base your view of the church on its founder, on Jesus. And then you know what those people that are going to let you down it won't hurt nearly as bad. It's still going to hurt but they're still going to be people but Jesus is still going to be Lord.
[time=2486] That's what I want to be a part of. I want to be a part of a church that just follows Jesus even when we, I'll tell you this I'm your pastor. I'll do everything I can to love you like Jesus and to lead well our leadership teams pour into prayer, hit our knees to follow Jesus with all that we've got but all of us myself at the top of the list are imperfect. I'm going to fail you. The person you're sitting with is going to fail you. The person that you put all of your hope and faith in they're going to fail you. But you know what?
[time=2518] Jesus has never failed you. He isn't failing you today and he will never fail you in the future. He's the same yesterday, today and forever.
[time=2530] That was a long side, sir. You guys got to listen faster.
[time=2538] But I truly believe that was for somebody here today because God wants to speak to you no matter what in your world is speaking negativity maybe it's yourself, maybe it's other people. I believe that God wants to do something new inside of you today and you all will often say the church is full of hypocrites. You ever heard that one? That's the normal reason. Have you found that to be true?
[time=2558] My hand was first. You can go second now. You know what I always say?
[time=2562] I don't always say this but to certain people I can say this. When they say you know I don't go to church because it's full of hypocrites. I say hey come on one more won't hurt.
[time=2570] Can I get an amen?
[time=2574] The person you're sitting with right now they struggle just like you struggle. I struggle just like you struggle but God wants to speak truth into our life through his word. So I want to go back to that article that I was telling you about before you guys. You got to stop getting me sidetracked like that.
[time=2590] So this article came into this religious column. Here's what it said about the Bible. I quit going to church this year.
[time=2598] I decided that listening to sermons week after week was a stupid thing to do. I've gone to church for more than 40 years heard more than 5,000 sermons.
[time=2610] I can only remember about 5 of them. What a waste of time. Sign, board, and busy.
[time=2618] Anonymous. And you say well this is just a joke. This is a real article that was written in to a religious column in Georgia years and years ago.
[time=2626] So this sparked a fury of responses. People started writing and trying to convince us religious apologetics. We man we're going to convince him what the Bible says about the church but he didn't care but there was one response that came in that finally just kind of shut the whole argument down and here's what it said.
[time=2642] There's a fury of responses ending with this. I quit eating this year.
[time=2646] Thanks to board and busy's insights, I decided eating was a stupid thing to do. I have been eating for more than 40 years and have eaten more than 5,000 meals. I can only remember about 5 of them. What a waste of time. My favorite part though, maybe a little inappropriate. I'm going to say it anyway. Sign, starved and stupid.
[time=2674] A little over the top maybe but hey, God has a point. Here's what I want to tell you. When it comes to this, when it comes to God's Word, I know there are days where you don't want to pick up the Word of God. I know there are days that you don't believe God has a Word for you. I know there are days you think God has gone into a radio silent in your life and he's not listening and he's not caring and you've tried to pick up the Bible and you've tried to read and you ended up in Leviticus and you read about the temple and you read about the Old Testament law and you said there's nothing relevant in here for me and then you went to the New Testament because somebody said read the book of John and you read it and you saw all those things that maybe you've seen before but it just didn't speak to you and you got nothing out of it and you closed it disappointed, disillusioned, confused and frustrated. There I just said what a lot of you thought no pastor could ever say in church.
[time=2728] I've been there. You've been there too.
[time=2732] But you know what I've learned about God's Word, God's revelation.
[time=2736] It's always true. It's always pure. It's always clean. It's all of those things
[time=2742] but the more I continue, here's what I would say based on that newspaper article, the religious column there, just like even when I'm not really hungry and I'm having a bad day and I don't even feel like eating.
[time=2754] I got to get something inside of me and I'm not going to remember it and I'm probably not even going to like it but I'd like food. Probably a little too much. But there are times where you don't even want that just like you need a source of nutrition and food to survive and thrive as a human. You need even in the down times when it doesn't feel as feelings do this. They're up and they're down.
[time=2774] You need the foundation of the Word of God in your life. Even when you don't feel it, God's going to speak to you.
[time=2782] He's going to break through and just like you need sustenance and food in your life.
[time=2786] Even when you won't remember how great the meal was, open the Word of God and let its truth permeate your heart.
[time=2794] And I believe that in those right moments, God will bring it to life.
[time=2798] For some of you, that moment is happening in this place right now. God's greatness in His Word is coming to life for you for some, maybe it's even for the first time. I don't want to give you a statement about Jesus. It's this, "If Jesus is my Lord, then the Bible will be my God." Jesus gave that to you as His revelation. That's a bold statement. You say, well I can still make Jesus my Lord but I don't like the Bible or I think it contradicts itself. As a pastor I've had all these. I've been to seminary and studied and you know the Bible's over my head in so many places. Every time I read it I learned something new. Praised God for that. He meets us where we are with His Word.
[time=2838] Even when we've read that same passage a hundred thousand times in our life.
[time=2842] I've read through the Bible and every time I've gone through it, every time I've read through it, every time I get to different passages, where I'm at is where God meets me.
[time=2850] And I challenge you to dig into that same thing. The Bible will be your guide because it's Jesus's letter to you. It's his way to communicate with you. Now I'll go back to some of you would say I don't believe the Bible. I think people often reject the Bible and they'll say it's because it contradicts itself. And you know what I found over and over? Most of the time rejections of the Bible really aren't so much based on how we would believe it contradicts itself but more based on how we've learned that it contradicts me. I figured I'd get some silence there. It's a harsh truth but a real truth. A lot of times we will push it towards the Bible contradicts itself but so many times when we dig into it we realize how much it contradicts me. It contradicts who I am and what I bring to the table but the beauty of the Bible even though it makes you see how filthy. Our righteousness scripture says is as filthy rags.
[time=2910] Don't look at anybody and call them a filthy rag. That would just be too much.
[time=2914] But our righteousness is as filthy rags. The Bible shows us that but you know the main thing the Bible shows us shows us the songs of Jesus that even in those most law-driven spots in scripture it points to this Savior who meets us in the mess, turns that mess into a message, turns that test of yours into this big testimony just like you heard from Jill just a little while ago.
[time=2942] God's grace is real and it'll meet you in the middle of how the law, how the Bible, how God's revelation through his communication will show you how far off-base you are and show you how true and loving and grace-filled that Jesus truly is. We've talked about God's glory in his world. We looked at his greatness in his word. Now his grace. Number three, his grace his grace in my weakness. The first two were revelation-based. How God wants to reveal himself to you. Here's where our response comes in. Here's where your response comes in.
[time=2978] It's his grace in my weakness. Verses 11 through 14. David shifts his focus more to what we do with this now.
[time=2986] He says there in verse 11, "Moreover by them, them being the words of God the law, the Bible. Moreover by them your servant is warned in keeping them. There's great reward. Who can discern his errors? Declare me innocent from my hidden faults.
[time=3002] Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins. Let them not have dominion over me. Then I shall be blameless and innocent of great transgression. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, O Lord, my rock and redeemer." That's where we respond and we respond really through grace. How many of you realize that when you try to respond out of your own strength you get about this far and you trip and fall?
[time=3034] Our response to God's revelation really comes through how God's grace is shown in my weakness. I've said to you before and I'll say it again that I truly believe that God best showcases his strength. God best showcases his strength on the stage of my weakness.
[time=3054] God will best showcase, show the world, show you how strong, how great, how pure, how righteous and how holy he is on the stage of your greatest weaknesses. Those things that you really don't want anybody on your road to know about, there's a weakness in your life.
[time=3070] Those things that maybe even your spouse doesn't even know. Those things that you feel like you could never begin to overcome. God wants to take that stage, that platform that doesn't feel like a stage or a platform, it feels like a skeleton, it feels like death that you luck away in a closet somewhere and hope no one ever sees it. God wants to build that into a stage and show the world how powerful he is in your life and through your life so that others will see his glory, his greatness and his grace even in the weakest areas of your life. Some of you have yet to get to a spot where you can believe that. I get there a lot of times for sure, but God wants to meet you in that spot. One of the best pictures of that I think comes from the New Testament. Paul, the Apostle Paul wrote most of the New Testament.
[time=3118] 2 Corinthians 12, you can jot it down. 2 Corinthians 12 verse 9 is where Paul is talking about this thorn in the flesh and people debated for years. What is that thorn? That's not the point of the message, it's something that tormented Paul. Some kind of weakness, some kind of thing that held him back and people debated and we won't talk about that right now, but here's what I do want to talk about. He had a weakness in his life, but what God told him after he begged God to remove this thorn, what God told him was this, that my grace Paul is sufficient for you. My grace is sufficient and my power is made perfect in weakness.
[time=3154] In your weakness I can raise up my greatest strength. In your weakness I can do what you never even dreamed possible. This is in your notes and it's something that I believe God's going to reveal in your life even this week is that God often works the most, God often works the most in the areas you see him the least.
[time=3178] I want you to think about if you have to make a list right now of areas where you're struggling to find God. Maybe it's a problem that you're facing, maybe it's a relationship that you're in the middle of, whatever it might be, you've got a long list.
[time=3190] What would be the number one area of your life that you find yourself struggling to find Jesus in your world?
[time=3198] Well I truly believe that God will often work the most in those areas in that spot where he wants to meet you today. I want to give you as we wrap this up two things that I want to challenge you to do this week. Just jot these down, think on these this week. The first one is this that I want to challenge you to filter the noise in that area.
[time=3218] The area you just thought of, pick one area where you find it hard to find God.
[time=3222] One area where you find it hard to find Jesus and try to filter the noise.
[time=3226] Think about how God is present in his world. Think about how God is communicating through his word and think about how God's grace wants to meet you in the middle of your weakness that's probably swirling around that one thing that you just thought of that you find it hard to find him. And then here's my challenge.
[time=3242] Make one bold decision.
[time=3246] Make one bold decision based on what God shows you in that area.
[time=3250] Filter the noise, use this outline perhaps in that area that's hard to find Jesus. And make a bold decision.
[time=3258] You say, what does that even mean? I don't know. He does.
[time=3262] Ask him. And I believe he'll show you. It may mean picking up the phone.
[time=3266] Making a phone call to somebody you've been estranged from for a long time. It may be to decide to follow Jesus as I'm going to give you an opportunity even right now to just pause and do whatever it is I want to challenge you not to hold back and make that bold decision. I want to ask you just to bow your heads with me. Close your eyes for a moment.
[time=3282] The most important part of our service is right now. Just be still before the Lord. I believe he wants to speak to you in a moment.
[time=3290] We're going to sing. We're going to give you a chance just to respond. To see Jesus work.
[time=3294] To see Jesus teach you some things and give you a chance to respond to what he's revealed. A response to his revelation. And some of you are here and God's already put that bold decision or that area that's so hard to find Jesus on your heart and you've already got decisions swirling around your head. If that's you, would you lift your hand?
[time=3310] Just say pray for me pastor. I've got decisions I know I need to make all over the place.
[time=3314] Praise Jesus for that. Put your hands down. I'll pray for you in a moment.
[time=3318] Contemplate that decision right now and I want to speak those specifically to those of you who are in this room. The most important thing that can happen today is that somebody who came in perhaps is you.
[time=3330] You might say I don't know that if I were to die today pastor that I would spend eternity with Jesus in heaven because I have a personal relationship with him. I don't know that I would spend forever with God because I know Jesus. I'd like to say I know that if I were to die today I'd be with him forever but I just don't know. I think I know I might be but I'm just not sure.
[time=3354] You know my favorite thing about scripture, about the Bible, about Jesus is it's always sure. It's always final.
[time=3362] It's always constant. And today you can nail that down.
[time=3366] They will tell me how, what does that look like?
[time=3370] What I'll tell you is a lot more simple than probably what you have made it.
[time=3374] We like to complicate what God made really simple. He said unless you become like one of these little children you can't enter the kingdom of God.
[time=3382] It just takes a childlike faith. The fate of a mustard seed.
[time=3386] A tiny bit of faith placed in a big God changes eternity.
[time=3390] The gospel is good news because it happened. Jesus already died on that cross carrying your sin and mine. After living the sinless life you could never live and I could never live. He died being that sacrifice that we could never be.
[time=3406] After three days he rose from the dead and he did not stay in that grave. He rose and out from that grave came with him the victory over death and over hell and over the sin that often conquers your life. It's finished.
[time=3422] Some of you for the first time you're starting to believe that you feel God stirring that inside of you. Salvation is just simply confessing with your mouth believing in your heart that Jesus is his Lord. What does that mean?
[time=3434] Crying out to him and saying Jesus I give you me.
[time=3438] I've been trying to save me but today I ask you to do it.
[time=3442] And you know what he's going to do? He's going to meet you right where you sit.
[time=3446] I'm not going to lead you in a prayer. Some of you your hearts already screaming that out of Jesus right now. Would you take a moment if that's you? Cry out to Jesus.
[time=3454] Ask him to save you in your own words from your heart to his. Lift it up right now.
[time=3462] The Gospel, it truly is that simple.
[time=3466] It truly is that good. Jesus wants to meet you right where you are.
[time=3470] Maybe you're one of those people I've been describing and today is that day of salvation.
[time=3474] Maybe today God stirred inside of you this new desire and you just can't turn away from it any longer and it's time to step away. It's time to call out to Jesus and say Jesus I'm yours. If you've done that, we want to know. If you haven't done that but God's stirring that, push Paul.
[time=3490] Step away. Do what you've got to do in this moment to respond to the call that God has on your life to follow Jesus. And if you've taken that step or are taking that step, we want to hear from you. We even have some resources including this great booklet called Beginning Steps. It's a growth guide for new believers that we would love to get into your hands. And so this book is something we can mail to you, something that you could pick up here at our church if we can meet you in person.
[time=3514] But we just want to connect with you. And so there's going to be information on your screen that'll include an email address and a phone number where you can reach out to us and get more information, share your story with us. And I encourage you to do just that. Thank you so much for digging in and thinking about what it means for you to find Jesus in your world. Again those questions were this, what is one area? If you could pick one, one area that you kind of struggle to find Jesus in your world right now. And then now how this week can you make one big bold decision in that area that maybe you've listed? God's got something for you.
[time=3550] I know Jesus is going to show himself, reveal himself as you respond to his revelation in the world around you this week. Thanks for watching.
[time=3558] I cannot wait to see you next week as God continues to pour into us.
[time=3562] [AMEN]
