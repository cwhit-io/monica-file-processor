[time=539] [APPLAUSE]
[time=544] As I look at this day, I see the power of one key thing. It's the power of stories. We've heard stories from those being baptized. We've heard Chip's story, but you know today you have a story. And God is still writing that story in this place today. And I believe that today is going to be one of those story writing days, one of those story writing moments in your life.
[time=571] Because you may have come in carrying a lot of baggage. You may have come in carrying a lot of blanks, a lot of question marks, a lot of uncertainty, a lot of need for recalculating today. But hear me when I tell you this. You ready for this? You ready? You got to talk to me. I preach better when you talk.
[time=589] But I want you to know that no matter what recalculating means for you, God has not left your side and he loves you and wants to meet you right where you are. That's what this series is really all about. Recalculating. We're talking about finding God's will in the midst of life's dead ends. You ever had any of those? As a pastor, the number one thing I hear is when it comes to question is, "Pastor, how can I find the will of God?"
[time=618] How can I find the will of God? How can I know what God's trying to show me? How can I know what God's trying to teach me? And that's what we're going to look at. And so if you miss the beginning of this series, each week is going to stand alone. We're looking at people. Here's the thing we often call them Bible characters, don't we? Like a cartoon character or something. But the thing is, they're real people. They're historical figures who walk through life and struggled and recalculated just like you and just like me. So we're looking one at a time, starting in Genesis, and we're going to go through a lot of the Bible.
[time=647] Not today, you can breathe. But we're going to go through in this 10 week series, a lot of the Bible looking at people, but I would challenge you to go back and look at the first sermon in the series where we talked about God's purpose.
[time=660] We talked about God's path, and we talked about God's plan. And that's a foundation for everything we're looking at in all of these people's stories.
[time=669] And so today we're going to be looking at Jacob. Last week we looked at Abraham, talked about recalculating through uncertainty.
[time=676] Maybe you brought some of that back with you again today. But today we're going to look at Jacob, recalculating when I blow it.
[time=685] You ever been there? I just got to recalculate because of me, because I blew it, because I can't get things right, because I get off track.
[time=695] And when we recalculating, you ever had the GPS do that, and you turn, you get off track, and it goes without annoying voice recalculating.
[time=701] Recalculating. Some of you are doing that because you got off track, but today God's going to get some things squared away in your heart.
[time=708] And Jacob is a great person for us to look at today as we do that. I want to welcome all of you to this church.
[time=715] Some of your first time guests, what you've seen today is what we're all about. We're all about the Gospel.
[time=721] We're all about the name of Jesus, the great I am. We're all about seeing people follow after Him in things like baptism.
[time=729] We're sharing our story because your story matters today, no matter how complicated it may be.
[time=735] And we got a lot of people who are watching us online, our extended family we call you. Your family like it or not.
[time=740] So some of you are watching us online through our stream or through television. If that is you, perhaps you're at home and your PJ's because you stayed up too late watching the fight, can I get a name in?
[time=749] But you're here today, but even if you're home for that reason, thank you for watching and tuning in.
[time=754] We consider all of you. Just a part of a big family that God has assembled together, so we're excited to dig into that together.
[time=761] So there's two principles that I gave you in the first week that apply to every story.
[time=765] The first is that God's will is more about, say it with me, if you know it, now than later.
[time=771] And the second thing is that God's will is more about who than what? Say those with me more about now than later and more about who than what?
[time=781] You're going to see that in Jacob's life. Jacob, Genesis 28, if you've got your Bibles, look there with me.
[time=786] First book of your Bible, Genesis 28, you can get your apps, your iPads, your phones, whatever you've got, get those out, get your Bible out of Genesis 28.
[time=795] I'll be reading from the English standard version, which is the same version as the Bible and the seats around you. If you need one, we will be sharing that together today.
[time=802] Jacob, preparing for Jacob this week, man, did I ever realize how complicated this guy's life was.
[time=810] He is a complicated dude. He has a mess of a life where we're going to pick up in Genesis 28.
[time=817] It's in Genesis 32 that maybe you remember his story. The most often associated thing with Jacob is that he wrestled with God.
[time=825] Do you remember that story? He wrestled with the angels. He wrestled with God.
[time=829] And that doesn't come until Genesis 32. God had already done a lot in his life leading up to that moment, but he's a complicated guy.
[time=837] Man did he struggle. Man did he blow it. And you know, I started to realize he's a lot like me. He's a lot like you.
[time=846] He's a lot like that person you work with. He's a lot like that family member. He's a lot like that mother-in-law.
[time=854] Mine's here, so I got to be careful. I was just seeing if she was awake. She's watching.
[time=860] But don't we all get into such complicated lives? Can I get an amen? Jacob was complicated. You're complicated, but I want to give you a word of encouragement.
[time=870] You ready for this? I believe it's going to help you this week. I believe somebody in this place needs to hear it, and it's that God has compassion for you in the middle of your complications.
[time=882] God has compassion for you in the middle of your complications, just like we see in Jacob's story. So I want to tell you a little bit about Jacob, so we've got to get all the way up to Genesis 28.
[time=893] So to do that, I just want to tell you a little bit about his life, his complicated life that he lives. Last week we talked about Abraham, and God said I'm going to give you all these promises, all these blessings.
[time=902] I'm going to bless you to be a blessing, and I'm going to bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you, and I'm going to make your name great, and from you are going to come all of these nations.
[time=911] And at the age of, he was childless. That was kind of hard to do without children. And guess how old he was when God finally gave him that promised child that would carry his name forward, 100 years old, but God came through.
[time=926] And he had this child, and his name was Isaac. Isaac enters the scene, and so Isaac is now the father. He's going to become the father of Jacob, so you can see how they're connected.
[time=937] So Abraham's promised son Isaac is the father of this Jacob we're going to look at today. And so Sarah died in Genesis 23. We're going to be in 28. That's Abraham's wife, Isaac's mother.
[time=949] And so that's in Genesis 23. She was 127. Abraham dies in Genesis 25. He was 175 years old. Those are the days, right?
[time=961] And so now we enter Esau and Jacob, two twins in Genesis 25. And by the way, I love Genesis 25. I'm not going to read it, but verse 22. You should circle it. Maybe you should just look real quick.
[time=972] Look back. Look real quick. You want a good Mother's Day text? We're a long way out for Mother's Day. This is the best Mother's Day verse in the Bible. You ready for it?
[time=980] Genesis chapter number 25 there in verse 22. It says that the two twins, Esau and Jacob were wrestling. They were struggling. They were fighting together in the Mother's womb.
[time=991] And I love her words in verse 22 of Genesis 25. She said, "Why is this happening to me?" Read it. Is there? Why is this happening to me? Is that not the best Mother's Day verse in the Bible?
[time=1004] Why is this happening to me? Can I get a name, Mom and Dad? But we keep moving. Can we keep moving forward? And so Esau comes out first and he's hairy. He's a hairy baby, manly man.
[time=1016] And that followed him with his life. And then out comes Jacob, these two twin boys. And he had a hold of Esau's heel. His heel on his foot. He had a hold of it.
[time=1026] So Jacob, his name literally means heel holder, heel grabber. You ever had a nickname that just follows you around all of your days, all the days of your life? You just can't get rid of it. You know what I'm talking about? Maybe that's just me. I've been calling a lot of things and they follow me around.
[time=1042] You just can't get rid of those nicknames. Well, his name literally means he's going to try to catch up. And that would become a representation of Jacob's life. He was always reaching forward, trying to get ahead, trying to cheat his way forward to get ahead of other people in his life.
[time=1055] And so many times we can identify with Jacob, but that's even what his name means. But you need to know two things that Jacob did. He became a swindler.
[time=1064] Jacob became a hustler, a con man, a sinner, a knucklehead. You can call him whatever you want. It would probably apply. He blew it. He messed up because he wanted to get ahead in life and grab the heel of whoever is in front of him.
[time=1078] And there are two things in a family order in Jacob's time that's different from our time. It's the birthright and the blessing. So the birthright goes to the firstborn. I'm a little partial to that because I'm a firstborn guy, too.
[time=1089] But, you know, we let that go a long time ago, but you wanted that birthright. It represented a bigger portion. It represented more blessings.
[time=1096] It represented moving ahead in life and leading the way even more. And then it was the father's blessing on the child. And this was going to belong to Esau as well.
[time=1106] So you have the birthright and you have the blessing. Well, Jacob decided he wanted both of those things because he was in line to get neither of those things.
[time=1114] And we can identify with that, right? We always want what we don't have. And that's where Jacob was. And so he tricked Esau, Genesis 25, starting verse 29 in there.
[time=1122] You'll see where he tricks Esau. He was out hunting. Esau was a hunter. He was a manly man. And Jacob was kind of a mama's boy, if you will.
[time=1133] Jacob was a cook. He stayed at home with his mom. He had smooth skin. We learned Esau was Mr. Harry, manly man, macho man.
[time=1141] He was out hunting, though. Esau was. And he comes back and he was so hungry that he thought he was going to die.
[time=1147] And Jacob looks at him and says, "Well, you know, I've got some stew here, and it's a red stew. It's like some beans.
[time=1152] It's really what you'd be looking at. This red stew we read about there in Genesis." And he says, "If you'll sell me your birthright, I'll give you these beans."
[time=1160] And the worst deal in human history. Esau says, "Here's that birthright. Give me them beans. Give me the beans."
[time=1168] And he trades his birthright to the swindler hustler con man known as Jacob for Ebola beans.
[time=1175] And before you laugh too much, you do the same thing. I do the same thing.
[time=1180] We often trade what we really want for what we think we want right now.
[time=1185] We trade in the future God has for us for the things that are right in front of our face.
[time=1191] We look at what we don't have, and we want to try to get those things, and we trade those things in.
[time=1197] And we satisfy that temporary pleasure at the expense of God's future for us.
[time=1202] We do it every day, don't we? We could identify even with Esau.
[time=1206] Second thing that he did. He tricked Isaac, his father, out of Esau's blessing.
[time=1212] So you see this in Genesis 27. Again, Esau is out to hunt.
[time=1217] So Isaac's life was coming to an end, so he sends his son out. He says, "Go hunt. Bring me back this great meal." And after I eat this great meal, I want to give you my blessing. That's what was supposed to happen in this life.
[time=1228] And so he goes out, "Mom, Rebecca, here's this, and tells Jacob, "Hey, I want you to trick your father."
[time=1235] And she goes to this great extent to work with Jacob, and she even gets some goats here and puts it on his arms and on his neck. It even goes to the detail of that Jacob had this smooth neck, and she put it on there, and she said, "That way he'll think it's Esau, and you go in, and you bring him a good meal." And they prepared this good meal, and he brought him a meal, and Isaac, he couldn't see well at the time.
[time=1254] It's kind of the point here. He's getting old. He can't see well.
[time=1257] And they trick Isaac. He threw lots of questioning like, "I'm not sure." She even goes back in the house, and just to make sure not just the goat hair on the arms and on the neck, and get some of Esau's clothing, which, by the way, why is this big grown man still got on his clothes in his mama's house, right?
[time=1271] But he does, and she goes and gets his clothing so it smells like Esau, and he puts that on, and he tricks his father into giving Jacob Esau's blessing.
[time=1282] So now those two things that are so important in the family order have been swindled, hustled away from Esau,
[time=1289] and have been given to Jacob.
[time=1292] And so, you know, by the way, I always used to feel bad for Jacob.
[time=1296] I always was like, "Man, what a mean mom," right?
[time=1299] When you read this story, she tricked her son into tricking their father, his father, right?
[time=1304] And I felt bad for him because I'm envisioning this little, you know, gullible kid, but when you look at the chapter prior,
[time=1310] you'll find that they're at least Esau and Jacob are at least 40 years old.
[time=1314] A lot of scholars think they were 70.
[time=1317] 70 years old, I don't feel bad for Jacob. It's time to quit blaming your mama.
[time=1322] You're a grown man, make your own decision, so I don't feel bad for Jacob.
[time=1327] But he did blow it, and so here we are, he's stolen the birthright and the blessing of his brother.
[time=1333] And so Esau comes back with that great meal, and what do you think happens?
[time=1337] He just said, "Well, I'm sorry, you and I lose Jacob."
[time=1343] If you read the story, you know, that's not the case. This guy was mad, and he vows to kill Jacob, and here's the thing, Esau's good with weapons.
[time=1351] He's good with making things that kill other things. He's a hunter, and Jacob's good with frying pans.
[time=1358] Jacob's in trouble, but here's where we pick up our story.
[time=1362] After this vow of Esau to kill his brother Jacob, Jacob's got to recalculate.
[time=1367] You with me? He's got to recalculate, and what you'll find is for 21 years of Jacob's life, he lives on the run.
[time=1376] He starts to recalculate, and that's where we pick up our story today.
[time=1381] Jacob had blown it, his mistakes had resulted in recalculating.
[time=1385] He felt like probably there was no compassion for him and his complications, but God wanted to show him otherwise, and did you know that like Jacob, you can get what you want, but then not want what you've got.
[time=1398] Somebody needs to hear that again. Did you know that you can often get what you want, but then realize you don't really want what you've got?
[time=1406] Sometimes it's not worth the price. Anybody with me?
[time=1410] Jacob was learning that, but he had to recalculate because he had made those choices, and another thing about Jacob, I truly believe is that God, hear me.
[time=1417] God wanted to bless, and God wanted to show Jacob the Jacob that God saw.
[time=1423] Jacob spent his whole life putting on goat hair, trying to be his brother Esau.
[time=1427] Jacob spent his whole life pretending to be somebody he was not up until this point.
[time=1432] And so God wanted to show Jacob the Jacob that God saw, and I want you to know today you may be putting on the church smile, you may be pretending to be someone you're not, you may be a poser in so many ways that nobody else ever knows.
[time=1446] You may be faking your way through life, but hear me when I tell you that God won't bless who you pretend to be.
[time=1453] But I've got better news than that. God loves the you that he made you to be.
[time=1458] Go for that one. God will meet you there. He will help you recalculate, even if you've gotten so far off course, even if you've blown it.
[time=1466] His compassion will meet you in your complication.
[time=1469] He'll meet you in the you that you are, and that is enough for him so much enough that he sent his son Jesus for you.
[time=1478] Jacob is about to learn that principle in his life, and I want to give us a few thoughts here.
[time=1484] God at this time, think about it, is orchestrating the ultimate purpose that he has of bringing Jesus to this earth.
[time=1492] This is long before Jesus comes on to the scene.
[time=1494] But in the middle of that purpose, if you're here the first week, the encompassing circle of our target of God's will is the purpose of God.
[time=1501] It's inside his purpose that his path will lead us to his plans for our life.
[time=1507] And we see that being orchestrated even in the personal life of Jacob, this guy who had blown it and is now having to recalculate.
[time=1515] I want to give you three things today that I really just see that stand out about how Jacob had to learn to recalculate.
[time=1520] Number one is that choices about voices will often define direction in your life.
[time=1528] I believe choices about voices, who we listen to, what we flood our hearts and our minds with, the people we surround ourselves with.
[time=1536] That's really defined history.
[time=1538] It's really defined your destiny. It's really defined who you are and why you are where you are in this place today if you think about your journey.
[time=1545] And we see that in Genesis 28. Let's look there together.
[time=1548] So we have this vow of Esau to kill his brother.
[time=1551] And now he's on the move.
[time=1552] And there's a story that happens before this where Rebecca wants to make sure to take care of her little boy, understandably so.
[time=1558] And so you lead up to this moment where God's going to use Isaac, who my goodness, poor Isaac.
[time=1564] I think about this poor guy.
[time=1565] His wife's coming to him with this different angle, trying to protect her son.
[time=1568] And there's family against family here.
[time=1570] And it kind of got complicated.
[time=1572] Does that sound like your family?
[time=1573] Sometimes don't answer that.
[time=1575] Sounds like your family doesn't it?
[time=1577] Sounds like my family is complicated.
[time=1579] It's a mess, but God's compassion is true and real.
[time=1581] And God even uses these crazy, recalculating people to change the course,
[time=1588] the direction of Jacob's life.
[time=1590] Genesis 28, verses 1 and 2.
[time=1593] Then Isaac called Jacob and blessed him.
[time=1596] And again, he blessed him again.
[time=1597] He'd already stolen the blessing.
[time=1599] He blessed him again and directed him or called him and commanded him.
[time=1603] It sounds kind of like the God kind of language.
[time=1606] If you read this in the original text and study it out, it really means called and commanded.
[time=1609] Kind of like what God would often do with people.
[time=1612] Interesting, we'll come back to that.
[time=1613] He called him and blessed him and directed him.
[time=1615] You must not take a wife from the Canaanite women.
[time=1617] You say that sounds racist.
[time=1618] It's not racist, it's religious.
[time=1620] The Canaanites were known for the Baal gods.
[time=1624] And they were known for the most pagan, one of the most pagan places on the planet.
[time=1629] And so this was not a racist thing.
[time=1631] It was a religious thing when he says, "Don't get wrapped up in all that." Because if you remember back from last week, God's preserving this family line that's going to now come through Abraham.
[time=1641] So that's why he says that now, verse 2, "Arise, go to Padanaram, the house of Bethuel, your mother's father,
[time=1647] and take as your wife from there." One of the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother.
[time=1652] Okay, seems simple and we often read through that.
[time=1655] But this is huge.
[time=1656] This is a big recalculating moment for Jacob.
[time=1659] He's over 40 years old, he's unmarried, and he's changing the course of direction in his life and his voice is speaking into where he's at.
[time=1667] You would expect that God would call and command.
[time=1670] But it was Isaac, it was his father.
[time=1672] God spoke through his father to redirect, to recalculate some in Jacob's life.
[time=1678] A couple of thoughts on this.
[time=1679] First one is just don't underestimate.
[time=1681] Hear me.
[time=1682] Don't underestimate how God can use the right voices to lead you to the right places.
[time=1689] I did say the right voices.
[time=1690] I'm going to talk about the wrong ones in a minute too.
[time=1692] You've probably got some of both in your life, I'm guessing, don't you?
[time=1696] It's inconvenient for Jacob to leave, but here's what I want you to know.
[time=1699] God may speak to you through people you don't expect.
[time=1701] God may be speaking to you today through somebody that you don't want to listen to.
[time=1706] You've got to discern are they the right voice or the wrong voice, but don't underestimate how God uses people in this recalculating process.
[time=1713] Here you go.
[time=1714] You never know.
[time=1715] Your God may communicate to you, may recalculate through you, through your spouse.
[time=1724] I didn't figure I'd get too many amends with that one, huh?
[time=1726] You should have said, "Hey man, I tried to help your lunch go better, but you didn't take the bait." God may want to communicate to you through your spouse, through your wife, through your husband, through an uncle, through an aunt, through a mother, or a father.
[time=1739] Can I get an amen?
[time=1740] Parents, give me some backup.
[time=1742] Kids that are in the room, teenagers that may be listening to this.
[time=1745] God may want to speak to you through those crazy people you call your parents.
[time=1749] He might just use them.
[time=1751] Some of us would be in the spot, though, where we didn't have godly voices in those places.
[time=1757] But I believe God has godly voices in mind for you, the right voices, in some way, shape
[time=1763] or form, if it's not mom, dad, if it's not this family or that friend.
[time=1766] He's got somebody that wants to speak into your life.
[time=1769] Another challenge for you may be that you know what?
[time=1771] Maybe you need to be that voice in the life of somebody else.
[time=1774] I call Jessica the second Holy Spirit.
[time=1777] That's my wife, by the way.
[time=1779] She's not always right, but she is really close.
[time=1784] See, my lunch is going to go better now.
[time=1789] She's not buying it, though.
[time=1790] You see that face?
[time=1791] Not even close.
[time=1794] Don't underestimate, though, how God will use those right voices.
[time=1797] Here's the thing.
[time=1798] When it comes to God's will, we often look up for God's will to come down from heaven to earth like a lightning bolt.
[time=1804] But God often wants to speak to you instead of a lightning bolt coming down from heaven through the person who sits across your dinner table.
[time=1811] Through the person that wants to speak truth in your life.
[time=1814] We believe in community.
[time=1815] We believe life is better together at this place.
[time=1819] I love this.
[time=1820] Don't you love this?
[time=1821] This sweet spirit in this room, and it's biblical, and it's commanded, and it's essential for us being the church, but it is not enough.
[time=1830] Let me say that again.
[time=1831] This is wonderful, but it is not enough.
[time=1836] God wants you to be in community with other people.
[time=1839] I'm an introverted heart, believe it or not.
[time=1842] I was the shy kid in the back of the class, never would be in front of people.
[time=1845] The aptitude test in high school.
[time=1847] Top ten things, to do, top ten things, not to do.
[time=1850] Number one, anything with people in public speaking.
[time=1853] So God said, "Let's make that guy a pastor." God doesn't call the equip, but he always equips the call.
[time=1861] Side word, that was free of charge.
[time=1865] Somebody needed that today.
[time=1866] I needed it, but you need people.
[time=1869] Even if you're an introvert and it makes you uncomfortable, we need each other, especially in this day, especially in this age when there are a lot of wrong voices.
[time=1878] Can I get an amen?
[time=1880] On the opposite side, if that's true, if I can't underestimate how God will use the right voices to lead me to the right places, then I also can't underestimate how the enemy, we do have one, he's real, he's going to lose, but he's real and alive and moving in this
[time=1894] world around us right now.
[time=1895] Have you noticed?
[time=1896] You can't underestimate how he will use the wrong voices to lead you to the wrong places.
[time=1901] I can't tell you, as a pastor, how many marriages I've seen destroyed and a big factor in the destroying of that marriage was the wrong voices that didn't believe in marriage, speaking
[time=1912] unbiblical bad truth into the heart and the life of a husband or a wife.
[time=1917] I can't tell you how many relationships I've seen in because wrong voices started to creep in.
[time=1923] Some of you are in those spots because you've had those wrong voices, but here's the thing, as bad as those voices can be, as real as our enemy is, God's voice is bigger, it's louder,
[time=1932] it's stronger and he'll bring you through no matter what recalculating is necessary because of how you've blown it with or without the right or wrong voices.
[time=1943] He's not finished with you, don't underestimate what voices mean and what they look like in your life.
[time=1949] We believe in life groups for all this reason here, and there's a list that we have, we have these available at the desk.
[time=1954] This is powerful and important, we have groups available, small groups, we call them life groups, just a small group of people where you discuss, they involve three things, they involve biblical truth, relational authenticity and missional living.
[time=1965] They're all going to look different, they meet different days of the week, but they're all going to involve those three things.
[time=1970] And so I want to invite you to find one, we have them seven days a week, we've got some 30 plus groups, there's a list like this, and our welcome desk, you need to find one.
[time=1978] And I would even tell you this, this is a bold statement, but I mean this, I believe this.
[time=1982] If you've got to choose, I want you to choose, we ask you to do three things at Black Hawk, we want you to gather, connect and go.
[time=1988] Gather, connect, go, gather, we're doing that now, I want you to be in a worship service, we want you to connect, we want you to be in a life group, and we want you to go.
[time=1996] We want you to be missional, we want you to serve, we want you to use your gifts.
[time=1999] That's what we ask of you, we want you to be in every serving opportunity, we want you to be in every group or every worship service that we'll have one of these days.
[time=2007] We want you to just do those things, it's simple, and I believe it's biblical, it's what we're called to do and be as the church.
[time=2013] We believe in being the church here, not just going to church.
[time=2016] I want to challenge you to take those steps, and there's a good on-ramp for that, coming up on September the 10th.
[time=2022] I've mentioned it a few times, but this is the last week to register, go on our website, blackhawkministries.org, send your bulletin, all the information, sign up for that powerful, powerful experience that we're going to have in the afternoon of Sunday, September the 10th, and we're going to be talking about how we can be disciple makers, not just how we do life groups,
[time=2041] that's our primary vehicle for that, but how we can make disciples.
[time=2046] And we're all called to that, can I get a name in?
[time=2049] In your workplace, in your house, wherever you sit, wherever you go, you are a disciple maker
[time=2055] if you follow Jesus, and we're going to look at how we can do that intentionally together, and I want you to know what we want to see happen, our vision statement.
[time=2064] You'll find it on our website, it's been a part of who we are at Blackhawk for a long time, and it's simply this that we just long to see God develop, to build a diverse community of disciples,
[time=2074] Jesus followers whose financial, ethnic, personal differences, whose differences disappear
[time=2082] because of our great, powerful love for God, for each other, and for the world around us for our neighbor.
[time=2089] Have you ever noticed that when Jesus gets involved in a world full of differences, in a world full of divides, in a world full of all of this hate and division, that when Jesus gets involved, all the differences start to disappear?
[time=2103] Look in this room, I love seeing different people, but I want to see more of it.
[time=2108] I believe that Revelation 7 gives us the end game where we see people from all tribes and all nations
[time=2114] and all tongues and all people, so many that we can't even number gathering together
[time=2120] before the Lamb praising Him together as one.
[time=2124] (Applause) That is what community is all about.
[time=2131] And folks, I want to practice right now, right now, for what we're going to be doing in Heaven one day.
[time=2138] The idea, as Martin Luther King said so many years ago, that Sunday at 11 a.m. is the most segregated hour in the United States.
[time=2144] It's still true today, and I don't like it.
[time=2147] I don't think it's biblical, and I believe that we're called to be one, and I want us to do community to do life alongside of each other, with people who don't look like us, live like us, who don't travel like us, who don't have bank accounts like us, people who are different than us, even people who vote different than we do.
[time=2166] I figured it'd get quiet there.
[time=2169] (Laughter) I want you to know something, Jesus isn't coming back on the backs of donkeys or elephants.
[time=2176] He's the Lamb of God, and He's bigger than any political office.
[time=2179] Doesn't matter if it's blue or if it's red or it's black or it's white.
[time=2182] We're one in Jesus.
[time=2184] (Applause) Let's be that kind of community.
[time=2189] Let's come together as one in this world around us.
[time=2193] And this is going to happen when we speak truth into the lives of each other.
[time=2196] It's when we have conversations. I'll tell you, as your pastor, I'm going to have conversations with you in the future that will make you uncomfortable.
[time=2201] We're going to talk about things that make us squirm.
[time=2203] We're going to dig into issues.
[time=2205] We're going to talk about the real world around us because I believe the church is called to be one in a world around us that's hurting and broken because we are the vehicle Jesus built
[time=2215] to carry the hope of the world. It's not the church.
[time=2218] You're not that good. I'm not that good.
[time=2221] Jesus is the hope of the world, but the church is the vehicle that He built and said even the gates of hell won't win against it to carry the hope of Jesus to the world around us that's hopeless.
[time=2232] What voices are you choosing to listen to?
[time=2234] Some of us need to turn down the volume of Fox News, CNN, all of our news stations and turn up the volume of the word.
[time=2241] Some of us need to choose better voices of truth pouring into our lives that consume us and define us because choices about voices will define direction.
[time=2252] Number two, Genesis 28, 3, 3, 5, we see what the enemy uses for extermination.
[time=2260] That's what Esau is up to. You want us to kill this guy.
[time=2263] What the enemy uses for extermination guy can use for expansion.
[time=2268] I love this. You see this picture in Genesis 28, verses 3 through 5, look there with me.
[time=2273] After you blessed Him and said where He needed to go, He said, "God Almighty, bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you." Isaac to Jacob here.
[time=2282] That you may become a company of peoples, a great nation, kind of like Abraham is what he's saying here.
[time=2288] Verse 4, "May He give the blessing of Abraham to you and to your offspring with you
[time=2294] that you may take possession of the land of your sojournings and that God gave Abraham."
[time=2300] Verse 5, "Thus Isaac sent Jacob away." Again, he's using a person to do this.
[time=2305] Isn't it interesting how he does that?
[time=2307] And he went to Padon or on to Laban, the son of Bethuel, the airman, the brother of Rebecca, Jacob, and Esau's mother. What was happening in this moment, you say, what's the big deal about all of this, is that God is sending Jacob, recalculating his life to this place that he never dreamed he would need to go or want to go.
[time=2325] He doesn't know what's ahead of him. He identifies with Abraham in that there was uncertainty in his life, but Esau is plotting extermination, but God, through Isaac, is blessing and directing Jacob's life
[time=2336] and talking about expansion. I'll bless you. You're going to be a great nation.
[time=2340] I'm going to give you all of these things. Well, all around him is extermination and pain and hatred and even death and murder. God's wanting to bless.
[time=2350] Some of you can identify with Jacob. You feel like life is a big extermination plot for you right now.
[time=2356] Can I get a witness?
[time=2359] But while the enemy in the world around you is plotting that extermination, God is planning for expansion to grow you. What the enemy means for evil, God will take it and turn it around and use it for good.
[time=2372] Do you believe that? You've probably seen that. If you haven't seen that, I believe you're going to see that as you follow after Jesus, and he'll do whatever he wants with whomever he wants.
[time=2382] I heard a story one time about that very thing where this little old elderly lady lived next to a really well-known guy in the neighborhood who was an atheist.
[time=2391] He was a known atheist. He didn't believe in God, but she would always talk about.
[time=2395] She would always talk about how God would bless her and how she wouldn't have anything to give and she would tell him stories about how she would give to her church and how God would just bless and provide groceries.
[time=2404] God would send a check in the mail at the right time.
[time=2407] Have you ever seen that happen in your life where you just give?
[time=2409] Have you ever noticed that 90% goes way further than 100% when you give it to God?
[time=2413] Give him the first fruits. We're going to be looking at that more this year.
[time=2416] It goes way deeper than your pocketbooks and your purses.
[time=2419] It's a way of life. So this lady was living that.
[time=2422] And so she was really at a desperate time in her life.
[time=2426] This little old lady, and she didn't even have food to eat, but this atheist would watch her leave every Sunday.
[time=2431] She'd go to church and she'd come home praising God.
[time=2434] And it just drove him crazy. So he plotted some extermination, if you will, in her life.
[time=2440] And he said, "I'm going to teach this lady a lesson." And so one day she went to church and she had, again, given all she had, she didn't even have groceries, didn't have anything for lunch.
[time=2448] And he knew that. So he, while she was at church, went to the grocery store, bought $250, $300 worth of groceries and set it on her doorstep.
[time=2456] And then he watched, looked out the window.
[time=2460] You ever feel like the enemy's doing that in your life, by the way?
[time=2463] He sets a trap and then just watches and waits for you to fall.
[time=2466] Well, that's what this guy was doing. He just wanted to see her come home.
[time=2469] She came home so excited, said, "Praise God.
[time=2471] God, you've given me groceries. I can eat today." And he came out on the front porch and he said, "You know what? God didn't do that." She said, "God did it." He said, "No, God didn't do that." And he walked over. He picked it up and he said, "I bet I can tell you what's in those bags." She said, "God did it." He said, "No, I did it.
[time=2489] I went to the grocery store and I bought it. And that bag is the bread, and that bag is the milk. And over here I got you this bread, this awesome meal, this lasagna you can put in your oven, and all these things say, "I know. I can tell you what brand it is.
[time=2501] Here's what the brand is. I did it." She said, "God did it." He said, "No." He got out his wallet and he said, "Here's the receipt, lady.
[time=2508] Look at the receipt. I bought it. It's my credit card. I did it.
[time=2512] God didn't do it. Your God doesn't exist." She looked at him and she said, "God did it." And he made the devil pay for it.
[time=2529] We serve a God, folks, who in the middle of the worst moments of your life
[time=2535] will bring you forward and he'll make the devil pay for it.
[time=2539] He'll bring you through your biggest obstacles, and he'll make them like a foot stool under your feet.
[time=2545] He won't always do that because he may need to teach you something first, but don't you ever forget that at the end of this book, you don't lose if you know Jesus.
[time=2556] We don't fight for victory. We fight from victory because of Jesus Christ.
[time=2562] That's the God who is working in Jacob's life.
[time=2565] God can take adversity and turn it into an advantage.
[time=2569] Write that down. That's a good one. You need to remember that this week.
[time=2572] Some of you are carrying around adversities and it doesn't feel like an advantage, but God can take even the biggest adversities in your life and he can make it a big advantage in your life.
[time=2580] Some of you would say that I don't have a lot of money, but I've got a lot of time.
[time=2589] And hear me when I say this, if you've got a lot of money, if God's blessed you, you're blessed to be a blessing.
[time=2594] Remember that? You're blessed to be a blessing, and if you have been blessed financially, you don't have to pray about whether or not to be generous.
[time=2602] You don't have to pray about that.
[time=2605] Maybe you've lost your job and you don't have a lot of money, but you've got a lot of time.
[time=2610] You don't have to pray about whether or not you should use that time for God's glory and his good.
[time=2615] Sometimes hear me, folks, we get so super spiritual.
[time=2617] Can I have some grace to make a statement to you that I think maybe you'll remember?
[time=2620] It'll help you to have some grace. Some of you say, I don't know.
[time=2623] I'm going to do it anyway. I didn't really ask for permission.
[time=2625] I'm just doing it anyway.
[time=2626] Sometimes we get so super spiritual that we get stupid
[time=2632] when it comes to God's will.
[time=2634] And we spend months and even years caught in this web that we say is spiritual, and we're saying we've got to pray about this, if God's giving you time, use it for him.
[time=2644] If God's giving you finances, be generous.
[time=2646] If God's giving you a gift, use it for his glory.
[time=2649] We believe in being a church where people can use their gift.
[time=2652] I tell our staff all the time at this church that you won't be on this staff.
[time=2657] Big statement.
[time=2658] You won't be on this staff if you don't build teams.
[time=2661] Why?
[time=2662] Because we believe Ephesians 4 is the prescription of what the church should look like.
[time=2667] There's a place for you to use your gifts.
[time=2669] Don't get so spiritual in the moments of recalculating that you forget to just do the known will of God today so that he'll reveal to you the unknown will that he has for your life tomorrow.
[time=2681] It's more about now than later.
[time=2684] Start using.
[time=2686] Start leveraging the advantages that God has given you.
[time=2689] I've said this before here, and I'll say it again.
[time=2691] I truly believe this in my own life.
[time=2693] Remember that aptitude test?
[time=2695] Don't public speed.
[time=2696] I believe that God will often use the stage of our weaknesses to best showcase his strength.
[time=2708] He wants to do that in your life today.
[time=2710] It's on the stage of your weakness that God will best showcase his strength for your life.
[time=2715] Last thing I want to give you.
[time=2717] Verses 10 through 17, God has plans for you.
[time=2721] God has plans for you in the middle of your problems.
[time=2725] Verses 10 through 17, let's look there together.
[time=2727] Jacob has a dream.
[time=2729] He leaves.
[time=2730] He recalculates.
[time=2732] He left Bathsheba and went toward Huron, and he came to a certain place and stayed there that night because the sun had set, taking one of the stones of the place.
[time=2741] He put it under his head, and he laid down in that place to sleep.
[time=2744] And he dreamed, and behold, there was a ladder.
[time=2747] Climbing the stairway to heaven.
[time=2752] Don't judge me.
[time=2754] If you're judging me right now, you were thinking it too.
[time=2757] You know Led Zeppelin stuff too.
[time=2760] That's not what it's about though.
[time=2762] Total different topic here.
[time=2763] I'm going to back up and start over.
[time=2764] Can I start over for that?
[time=2766] Verses 12, and he dreamed and behold, there was a ladder set up on earth.
[time=2771] And the top of it reached to heaven and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.
[time=2776] And behold, the Lord stood above it and said, "I am the Lord, the God of Abraham, your father, "the God of Isaac, the land on which you lie, "expansion in the middle of extermination, anyone, "the land on which you lie.
[time=2791] "I will give to you in your offspring.
[time=2793] "Your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth "and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east "and to the north and to the south, "and in you and your offspring shall be "all the families of the earth be blessed." Behold, verse 15, "I am with you and will keep you wherever you go." Somebody need to hear that today.
[time=2810] It's not just for Jacob, it's for you.
[time=2812] Will you claim it? Will you believe it?
[time=2815] And with you wherever you go, and I'll keep you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.
[time=2825] Can I give the name in?
[time=2827] Verse 16 and 17 are my favorite verses.
[time=2830] Love the power of this passage.
[time=2832] Verse 16, "Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, "Surely the Lord is in this place, and I did not know it."
[time=2841] Some of you are in a situation right now where you don't see, feel or hear or even sense a trace of God, but he's in that place and you may not even realize it.
[time=2853] Don't miss the God of the miracles in the middle of the miracles.
[time=2856] He's trying to build up and bring out in your life.
[time=2862] We can be in his presence, but miss it.
[time=2864] Jacob says that. Then verse 17, he continues on and says, and he was afraid and he said, how awesome is this place?
[time=2872] How awesome is this place?
[time=2874] I say that every Sunday here with you, we see people come to Jesus and lives change for eternity.
[time=2879] How awesome is this place where God has recalculated, where God has put us on a path, where God has a plan, where his purpose is being revealed, where no matter what extermination is being plotted around us, that his expansion, his plan for building his church is going to prevail.
[time=2894] How awesome is this place?
[time=2897] That's what Jacob is saying even here.
[time=2900] This is none other than the house of God.
[time=2903] And verses 18 through 20, he goes on and he names the place, Bethel.
[time=2907] And Bethel means house of God because that's where he had met with God.
[time=2911] God wants to use your problem.
[time=2914] He wants to use, you got any of those?
[time=2916] God wants to use your problem.
[time=2918] Yeah, that one.
[time=2920] That one too.
[time=2922] Yep, even that one.
[time=2924] That one through your list, God wants to use your problem to lead you into his purpose.
[time=2928] So what do you do?
[time=2929] So just walk in his path.
[time=2933] Look for God's path no matter what's happening.
[time=2936] I want to do something fun for a minute.
[time=2938] You ever seen this before?
[time=2941] Bean-boozled.
[time=2945] Jelly-belly jelly beans.
[time=2947] You ever seen those?
[time=2948] Okay, good.
[time=2949] I need a couple of volunteers too.
[time=2951] All right, you come on up, young man.
[time=2954] I need somebody, somebody older.
[time=2956] Okay, you come on up too.
[time=2957] Come on.
[time=2958] Yeah, we'll do that.
[time=2959] Come up.
[time=2960] Stand right here.
[time=2961] I'm going to do this with you.
[time=2962] There you go.
[time=2963] Stand right here.
[time=2964] You can't preach my sermon.
[time=2965] You got to stay here.
[time=2966] What's your name?
[time=2967] Johnny.
[time=2968] What's your name?
[time=2969] Evan.
[time=2970] Johnny and Evan.
[time=2971] You know what bean-boozled is?
[time=2973] Okay, so here's the thing.
[time=2975] In bean-boozled, there's a real jelly bean.
[time=2977] They all look the same.
[time=2978] They're disguised.
[time=2979] Some of you think that's what God's will is like in your life too.
[time=2982] We'll come back to that.
[time=2983] But there's a few of them.
[time=2984] There's some white ones, and the white ones could be coconut.
[time=2987] Sounds good, right?
[time=2989] Sound good?
[time=2990] Or it could be spoiled milk.
[time=2993] My 13-year-old little sister did this with me.
[time=2995] That was her birthday request.
[time=2997] And I got the rotten egg one.
[time=3000] I'm just here to tell you, that mess is for real.
[time=3004] You didn't know what you were getting into, did you?
[time=3008] You ready to do this?
[time=3009] Okay, so there's those two.
[time=3010] There's toothpaste, or berry blue.
[time=3013] There's lawn clippings, or lime.
[time=3016] There's juicy pear, or booger.
[time=3021] There's chocolate pudding, or canned dog food.
[time=3030] There's caramel corn, or moldy cheese.
[time=3035] All right, you ready?
[time=3037] I'm going to do it with you.
[time=3038] Here's what I want us to do.
[time=3040] I want us to do this pink one.
[time=3042] Take the pink one, don't eat it.
[time=3044] Not yet, we're going to do this together on three.
[time=3047] All right, hang on.
[time=3051] Are you ready?
[time=3053] Ugh, these things just even look bad.
[time=3056] All right, I'm closing it up.
[time=3057] We all have a pink one.
[time=3058] And this is, okay, this is the 2D fruity, or stinky socks.
[time=3064] They're all the same.
[time=3066] You ready to do it?
[time=3068] All right, on three.
[time=3069] One, two, three.
[time=3071] [ Laughter ]
[time=3084] Ugh, stinky socks.
[time=3086] Ugh, did you get good ones?
[time=3089] How did you get the good ones?
[time=3090] You didn't?
[time=3091] Look at this tough guy.
[time=3092] He's not even faced.
[time=3093] I know I got something in here.
[time=3094] I got to get this thing going, man.
[time=3096] There it is.
[time=3098] That ain't happening.
[time=3100] Mm-mm.
[time=3101] That's awful.
[time=3102] Go ahead.
[time=3103] Give them a round of applause, didn't they do great?
[time=3105] [ Cheers and applause ] What's up, guy, man?
[time=3108] Okay, we'll take that.
[time=3109] You can share.
[time=3111] You can go to your seats.
[time=3112] Bean-boozled.
[time=3113] Bean -- ugh, that's terrible.
[time=3115] That was an awful idea.
[time=3117] I'm not sure I can preach anymore after that.
[time=3119] And some of you said amen, brother.
[time=3121] I'm for lunch.
[time=3125] Some of you think God's will is like that.
[time=3127] That God's trying to bean-boozle you.
[time=3130] That he looks at you and says, hey, marry that girl.
[time=3132] And, you know, it won't be until after a few weeks, a few months, that you know whether or not she's sweet or she crazy.
[time=3139] Some of you say, you know, I'm trying to follow God.
[time=3142] And he's leading me down this path, but he's just abandoning me there.
[time=3145] And I don't see you if he's going to trick me here.
[time=3148] Some of you think God is trying to bean-boozle you.
[time=3153] Some of you think God's trying to trick you.
[time=3155] But one thing we've learned from this series, even through the stinky socks, and they're bad, the extermination, we've learned that God has a will.
[time=3164] God has a plan.
[time=3166] And he's mapped out a path because Jesus already walked it to get you to his purpose.
[time=3171] God's not trying to trick you.
[time=3173] God's not trying to bean-boozle you.
[time=3175] God wants you to know his will.
[time=3178] He has one and is for your good and not for evil.
[time=3181] If you just are called according to his purpose, that's those who follow him and trust him, even through the mess of life.
[time=3189] Sometimes you got to spit it out.
[time=3192] It's still tasting pretty rough, just so you know.
[time=3195] Close your eyes for just a minute, if you will.
[time=3199] I want to just challenge you with something.
[time=3202] It's in Genesis 35 that God changes Jacob's name.
[time=3207] Do you remember his name?
[time=3208] I just want you to close your eyes and reflect on your name.
[time=3211] Not just your technical name, but who you see yourself to be.
[time=3214] Remember I told you that God wanted Jacob to see the Jacob he sees?
[time=3219] Well, God proves that to him in Genesis 35.
[time=3221] His name means "heal grabber." Means you're always behind.
[time=3224] It's that nickname that won't go away.
[time=3226] It represents extermination.
[time=3228] It represents the problems in his life.
[time=3231] But today, just like it was in Jacob's life, God has a new name for you if you feel defined by your past, your problems, the extermination plots in your life around you.
[time=3243] In Genesis 35, Jacob's name changed Israel.
[time=3247] Israel has interpreted several different ways, but it comes back to a prevailing and coming from God.
[time=3252] It means prevailed with God was the definition I wrote down.
[time=3256] Israel, Jacob's new name goes from "heal grabber always behind." Can't find God's will, can't catch up in life to prevailed with God.
[time=3269] And as you close your eyes and reflect on that today, what does it mean for you to prevail with God today?
[time=3275] What does that look like?
[time=3277] The Word of God will always lead you to the will of God.
[time=3280] And in God's Word, we see the gospel.
[time=3283] We see the truth of salvation.
[time=3286] If you know Jesus, you're one of his followers today.
[time=3289] I believe God's shown you something.
[time=3291] Maybe you like Jacob need a name change.
[time=3293] It's time to turn a new page, a new chapter in your life, in your story, and in your journey.
[time=3298] And today, I want to challenge you to take that step, if that's you.
[time=3302] Whatever that means, maybe it's baptism like you just saw.
[time=3305] You've been putting that off for quite some time.
[time=3307] It's time to take that step.
[time=3309] Maybe it's to make a phone call and pursue some reconciliation.
[time=3312] This phrase, even this weekend, has been put on my heart, that we've got as the church go from assimilation to reconciliation.
[time=3320] That means we don't just assimilate with people like us and people we get along with, but we reconcile relationships with people who don't look like us, people who don't act like us, people who aren't like us.
[time=3331] Maybe people who have wronged us and you need to extend forgiveness.
[time=3334] Whatever you've got to do, do that.
[time=3337] But somebody's here today and you would say that the gospel means something new to you and this name change idea may mean that you need to enter from death to life.
[time=3345] You may look at me and say today that pastor, I want to know that I would go to heaven if I died today.
[time=3351] I want to know that I'm redeemed.
[time=3354] I'm saved.
[time=3355] Those are some of those churchy words we use.
[time=3357] What does it mean?
[time=3358] It means we're made right with God, even though we're so wrong.
[time=3361] Even though we're so sinful.
[time=3363] Even though we're separated from Him.
[time=3365] Somebody would say today that I just don't know that I've got that right relationship.
[time=3370] Today can be that day.
[time=3372] Not because I say so, but because Jesus already did.
[time=3375] Because Jesus is working in your heart now.
[time=3378] Nobody's looking around for that Jew.
[time=3379] I want to give you a minute just to reach out to God and the silence from your heart to His.
[time=3383] He knows your heart.
[time=3384] He hears your heart.
[time=3385] I'm not even going to lead you in a prayer because I think in your heart, your heart is screaming that prayer.
[time=3390] Prayer is just how we talk to God.
[time=3391] So talk to God.
[time=3392] Tell Him that you need Him.
[time=3394] Tell Him that you believe Jesus died.
[time=3396] Paying for your sins.
[time=3397] That price you could never pay.
[time=3399] Because He lived a sinless life that you never lived.
[time=3402] And just say Jesus I give you me and He will meet you there.
[time=3408] I can't say it that way, you might say.
[time=3410] I don't want you to and neither does God.
[time=3412] Crought to Him in this moment.
[time=3413] Ask Him to save you and He will meet you where you sit.
[time=3415] Will you do that right now?
[time=3420] What does the gospel mean for you today?
[time=3423] Perhaps you're that person that I've been talking to, talking about and you can identify with really how we tend to make complex these things that God has made so simple.
[time=3433] God's will for all of us is that we could come to this place of just knowing we need Jesus as we've looked at today.
[time=3439] Just like Jacob found out.
[time=3441] Even when he blew it, God still met him in the midst of his mess.
[time=3444] And he'll do the same in your life.
[time=3446] If you need to take that step of following Jesus, giving your life to Him today as we've described and discussed at the length today, then take that opportunity.
[time=3454] Don't wait for tomorrow.
[time=3455] Don't wait until you can get things figured out or settled or in line because you'll really just never get there.
[time=3461] We need Jesus to take those steps.
[time=3464] And if you'll just lay your life down at His feet, that's the essence of the gospel.
[time=3468] That's what we're all about here at Black Caucus Ministries.
[time=3471] And there's nothing and no one that can separate you from the love of God that comes from Jesus Christ.
[time=3477] No matter how bad you've blown it like Jacob, he will meet you right there in the middle of it all.
[time=3482] He'll save you, he'll forgive you, he'll walk with you, and it'll be a new beginning.
[time=3487] And I want to get a resource into your hands along those lines.
[time=3490] If you're considering taking that step or maybe if you have, we want to hear your story.
[time=3494] There's even going to be some information on your screen, an email address and a phone number where you can reach out to us and just let us know what God's doing in your life.
[time=3501] And one of the things I want to do is get a resource in your hand called Beginning Steps.
[time=3505] It's a booklet, a growth guide for new believers that will mail to you or you can pick up here at the office.
[time=3510] But we want to get this in your hands because I believe it's just going to help you see that following Jesus is a beginning.
[time=3516] It's not an ending, it's not a lifeline that you just grab hold of and carry around with you every day just in case you need it.
[time=3523] It's a new life, it's a new birth that Jesus has brought about and when that happens, everything in life changes.
[time=3530] It doesn't mean everything gets easy, you're still going to blow it, you're still going to have mistakes, you're still going to have problems, you're still going to have relationships that don't work and a lot of things that are going to get messed up.
[time=3540] But it changes everything because Jesus is now with you in the middle of all the mess and all the problems that you face.
[time=3547] And so we want to get that into your hands, but more than that, we want to build a relationship with you.
[time=3551] We consider you a part of our family.
[time=3553] Thank you for watching today.
[time=3554] I pray you'll come back next week as we continue this journey of recalculating.
[time=3560] We'll find God's will even when life throws us some dead ends.
[time=3563] So God bless you.
[time=3564] I'll see you next week.
