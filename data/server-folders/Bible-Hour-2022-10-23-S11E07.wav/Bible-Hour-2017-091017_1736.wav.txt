[time=216] [APPLAUSE]
[time=226] >> Not only is our God glorious, but I'm going to tell you, he is a good, good Father.
[time=240] [MUSIC]
[time=243] >> Thanks for tuning in today, so glad that you're here, cannot wait to continue this focus on recalculating.
[time=250] Perhaps you, like me, are in a spot where you need to find God's will in the middle of some of life's dead ends.
[time=257] Well, that's what we've been looking at for a few weeks now.
[time=259] We're going to continue this study and just looking at how God can show up right in the middle of our mess,
[time=265] how God can speak truth into our lives even when life gets confusing.
[time=269] So what we've been doing is looking at these people.
[time=272] They're not just characters, like a cartoon character, but real people with real struggles just like you have,
[time=278] and I have from the Bible who really did know what it means to find God's will in the midst of a lot of dead ends,
[time=284] in the midst of a lot of uncertainty, in the midst of a lot of setbacks.
[time=288] And in fact, today, that's what we're going to look at as we look at one of my favorite guys in the Bible, Joseph,
[time=294] who really, truly walked through life in the middle of a lot of setbacks, some of which he brought on himself,
[time=301] but most of which he didn't even choose to bring on himself.
[time=304] They were brought to him.
[time=306] And so today, I hope it can be an encouragement to you as you look at how to navigate through setbacks in this life.
[time=312] So we want to hear from you here at Black Hawk.

[time=374] Of what I've done, what I've become, these hands are dirty.
[time=387] I dare not lift them up to the Holy One.
[time=402] You feed my cost, you ride my rocks, you break my chains, you overcome.
[time=417] You gave your life to give me mine, you say that I am free.
[time=429] How can it be?
[time=434] Yeah, how can it be?
[time=442] I've been hiding, afraid I've led you down.
[time=458] Inside, I doubt that you still love me.
[time=466] But in your eyes, there's only grace now.
[time=482] You feed my cost, you ride my rocks, you break my chains, you overcome.
[time=497] You gave your life to give me mine, you say that I am free.
[time=509] How can it be?
[time=514] Yeah, how can it be?
[time=521] Though I fall, you can make me new.
[time=533] From this death I will rise with you.
[time=541] Oh, the grace reaching out for me.
[time=548] How can it be?
[time=561] Yeah, you gave my cost, you ride my rocks, you break my chains, you overcome.
[time=576] You gave your life to give me mine, you say that I am free.
[time=591] You gave my cost, you ride my rocks, you break my chains, you overcome.
[time=606] You gave your life to give me mine, you say that I am free.
[time=618] How can it be?
[time=623] Yeah, how can it be?
[time=631] Yeah.
[time=636] Well, God, we thank you, you are awesome.
[time=640] All the things that we go to, how can it be that you would receive someone like us?
[time=646] God, we just let it all loose and get put it in your hands, knowing that you are a faithful, forgiving God.
[time=651] We thank you, we praise you in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=657] Amen. Can we celebrate God's Word today? Yes.
[time=665] I just love God's church. I just love God's Word. I just love Jesus.
[time=671] And he loves you in this spot today, no matter what you brought with you.
[time=676] He's here, he's in our midst and I'm excited to continue this series called Recalculating.
[time=681] So that's what we've been looking at for the last several weeks, recalculating, looking at how we can find God's will in the middle of life's dead ends.
[time=690] And there are some days I say, how can it be? How can it be that I can find God's will?
[time=696] How can it be that God would have a will and a plan for a character like myself?
[time=701] And that's what we've been doing in this story, is looking at not the characters of the Bible, but the people of the Bible.
[time=707] They're not cartoon fictional characters, they're real people with real struggles just like you and me.
[time=712] And so we've been looking at these real people who've had real struggles with finding Jesus, finding God's will, finding God's plan for their lives, just like perhaps you find yourself doing today.
[time=724] So if you've got your Bibles, look at Psalm 105, Psalm 105, we're going to be looking there.
[time=730] And we're going to go back to Genesis, Genesis starting in chapter 37.
[time=734] And we're going to go through Genesis chapter, you ready for this? Chapter 50.
[time=739] It's Labor Day weekend and you came to church on Labor Day weekend and we're going to go to work today.
[time=744] So we're going to start in Psalm 105 and if you're a guest with us, sit back and relax today, you're amongst friends.
[time=751] We love the Word of God here at Blackhawk. We always say we want the Word to have the last word.
[time=756] And so that's what we're going to do today and I believe God's Word has some powerful implications for you.
[time=761] Regardless of the setbacks, regardless of the problems that maybe you brought in with you today.
[time=767] So we're glad you're here to be a part of our family.
[time=769] I also want to take this opportunity to welcome those of you who are watching from online or television or at home through streaming or wherever you're at, we see you.
[time=778] And we are glad that you're a part of our extended family. Blackhawk's a big family and it's a joy to be a part of it.
[time=785] Is it not? You're going to have to wake up this morning.
[time=788] You ready? Is it a joy or not? Amen. Praise God. Let's dig into the Word today.
[time=793] I want to talk to you about Joseph, love, love Joseph because he is a perfect picture of how we have a good, good Father who walks us through setbacks that don't often make sense.
[time=807] And so today I want to talk to you about Joseph and recalculating when setbacks strike.
[time=813] When setbacks strike, you likely had some of those and you know the thing about setbacks is a lot of times we bring setbacks on ourselves. Can I get an amen?
[time=823] We blow it like we talked about last week, recalculating when I blow it like Jacob had blown it.
[time=829] We bring setbacks on ourselves but a lot of times we do what's right but setbacks just come. Can I get another amen?
[time=836] You didn't ask for it. You really didn't even bring it on yourself. Maybe somebody brought it to you. Maybe it just came out of nowhere but no matter what setbacks often strike.
[time=846] Now a lot of times I can think of a lot of messes that I've made. One I was thinking about a lot of setbacks. We were getting moved into a new house.
[time=853] We had built a house several years ago in Georgia before we had moved. You ever made just a really big mess, so big a mess that you just kind of stood in the middle of it and said, "Man, what am I going to do now?"
[time=864] And so I was kind of organizing the garage and that sounded like I was nice and organized, didn't it? I needed to organize the garage so I had all these paint buckets and so I had this big five gallon bucket of paint and it was full.
[time=877] And I was like, "You know what, I'm not going to need this for a long time. We just painted, we just built this house. I'm going to put it up on the top shelf and just kind of get it out of the way. Why are you laughing?"
[time=887] And I still remember that thing falling and just busting right on the new concrete right in the garage. It was all over my pants and I just stood there for a minute.
[time=898] I thought a lot of very godly spiritual thoughts that Jesus would have thought in a moment like that and I consider just selling the house.
[time=909] It was one of those kind of messes that I was like, "I'm just going to go inside and say, "Honey, we just got to sell the house. I don't even know how we're going to clean up this mess."
[time=916] But I stood in the middle of it and I eventually just decided just to let, I stepped out of it, took all my clothes off, left them there and I said, "You know what, instead of trying to get this up, I'm just going to leave it for a while because I think it'd be better just to scrape it up."
[time=927] And it worked out okay, but I made such a mess that I had to recalculate my whole plans. You ever put yourself in that position?
[time=934] If you ever had a bucket of paint just dumped on your head that you didn't dump on your own head, you ever had somebody else bring a set back in your life that made you feel like I might as well just sell the house or just give up or throw in the towel?
[time=946] Some of you brought that kind of setback with you into this place today and Joseph is an amazing person, an amazing story that I believe is going to give you some hope.
[time=957] It's going to give you some meaning. It's going to give you some moving forward momentum to help you through the times when you've got to recalculate even when setbacks strike.
[time=967] So let's look at Joseph. In Joseph's story, we see a big theme and I want to read it to you. We're going to read from Psalm 105. You may not have known, but Joseph is clearly pictured in Psalm 105.
[time=979] He's celebrated. His story is celebrated. But I want to give you a statement right before we read his story and how he's celebrated.
[time=986] He says, "And I believe in your notes." And you can take notes on your church app. If you don't have that, Black Hawk Church app, great way to do that. You've got notes as you came in. You've got your own notebooks. You can just nod and everybody will think you're taking notes that works for us too. We don't judge around here. But write this down. It's in your notes. This is a key statement, a key phrase that characterizes Joseph and it's about setbacks. It's that setbacks can become set ups for comebacks.
[time=1012] Everybody needs to come back in this place today. And I believe that a comeback is going to begin in the seat in which you sit right now, even in the middle of the setbacks that you're facing.
[time=1023] I've used that phrase before. I'm going to use it again because with Jesus, it just happens. He can take the worst of setbacks and use them to set up a comeback, to set up a blessing, to set up your purpose.
[time=1037] If you missed the beginning of this series, we talked about three key things that God's circle, the encompassing circle of all of His plans is His purpose.
[time=1045] Inside that purpose is His path. It's His Word. It's the path that Jesus already walked. And inside of that is the plans that God has for your life. And those plans are to prosper you. Does it mean life's going to be easy? Does it mean you're going to be rich?
[time=1062] But His plans are to bless you, to propel you forward, even in the middle of setbacks.
[time=1068] A lot of times when we say prosper you, or his plans are for good, or he wants to bless you, we think that that means everything smooth sailing.
[time=1076] But when you look at Joseph's story, you see that the opposite is often true.
[time=1080] A lot of times it's the stage of our weaknesses, the stage of our setbacks, the stage of our problems that God's strength is best and most powerfully showcased.
[time=1091] And He wants to do some of that in your life through your setbacks, just like He did in Joseph. Let's look at Psalm 105. Who's ready for the Word this morning?
[time=1098] Psalm 105, starting in verse 16 on a read through verse 22. It's all about Joseph. I'm going to read from the English standard version today if you'd like to follow along the same.
[time=1109] People often ask, "By the way, what version of the Bible do you recommend pastor?" And you know what my answer is? The one that you'll read.
[time=1116] But I'm going to read from the English standard version, praise God for His Word as we read it together today, starting in verse 16 of Psalm 105.
[time=1124] When He summoned a famine on the land and broke all supply of bread, He had sent, circled that word. We're going to come back there at the end of the message today.
[time=1132] He had sent a man ahead of them, Joseph, who was sold as a slave. His feet were hurt with fetters. His neck was put in a collar of iron until what He had said came to pass.
[time=1147] The Word of the Lord tested Him. Can I get a name in? Some of you are being tested today, but the Word of the Lord is just as true for you as it is for Joseph, verse 20.
[time=1157] "The king sent and released him the ruler of the people set him free." Verse 21, "He made him Lord over his house and ruler over all his possessions to bind his princes at his pleasure and to teach his elders wisdom."
[time=1175] It's an amazing summary of Joseph's life. Is it not? It's a celebration of the summary of what happened in Joseph's life.
[time=1183] And today, just like it was in Joseph's life, you have setbacks and the situations that seemingly impede your progress, I believe are actually going to be pit stops that are going to propel you into your purpose.
[time=1196] Some of you are in the middle of setbacks that feel overwhelming, but they're just pit stops that God's using to propel you, to prepare you for the purpose He wants to bring about through the plans that you see unfolding in your life.
[time=1208] And the obstacles that we would just assume get away from us, God wants to use those very things to set up something new in your life.
[time=1218] That's why we read a celebration of Joseph's life in Psalm 105.
[time=1223] We see God doing something that He wants to do in your life in Joseph's. He builds into us oftentimes in the present what we need for our future.
[time=1233] God's building something into you today in this present moment that you may not like, that may feel like a setback, but it's going to be something He's going to use to prepare you for your future.
[time=1245] But it's hard to see that in the moment, isn't it? I've learned that life is lived and forward but understood and reverse.
[time=1254] When we can look back and see it, it makes a lot more sense, but when you're in the moment, when a setback has struck you down and you didn't ask for it, if you're in Joseph's shoes, you didn't even really deserve it from our standpoint.
[time=1268] You didn't even bring it on yourself. He did a lot of things that brought things on himself, but he did so much that he was just faithful with, but he felt forgotten so many points of his life, but Psalm 105 celebrates God's redeeming work.
[time=1281] Now, what I love about this is if you go back to verse 8, look at verse 8 of Psalm 105 and then we're going to go back to Genesis, verse 8 before what we read, says, "He remembers His covenant forever."
[time=1294] You serve a covenant making, covenant remembering God. Somebody has come into this place, maybe it's you who feels forgotten.
[time=1304] But I want you to know we serve a God who makes promises and who keeps His promises.
[time=1310] We see that through the summary of Joseph's story, but here's the thing about what we just read.
[time=1316] We just read a summary. Flip back to Genesis now. We're going to start in Genesis 37.
[time=1322] And what I'm doing right now is having you shift from the summary of Joseph's story to the actual story of Joseph's story.
[time=1331] We're going from the summary that sure is pretty, wasn't it?
[time=1334] Isn't that a beautiful passage?
[time=1336] Because it's a summary. It already happened. We see the end result, but I'm taking you back now to the story, and here's what I want you to know.
[time=1343] Sometimes the summary is pretty, but the story is painful.
[time=1350] Sometimes the story is awful, but the summary looks awesome.
[time=1358] Sometimes the summary is miraculous as it is with Joseph, but the story that took to get to the spot of the summary was all messy.
[time=1370] Sometimes the summary of our lives looks miraculous, but the story is pretty messy.
[time=1377] Sometimes the Facebook posts and the Instagram feeds look pretty good, because it's a summary.
[time=1384] We take a snapshot of the best moments, like what we just read in Psalm 105, but the story it took to get there,
[time=1391] or the story that's happening in the middle of a church smile. Let me see your church smile.
[time=1398] You know, if you've been around me long enough, I'm good at the church smile, but I can also pick them out too.
[time=1405] In the church smile, if you don't know if you're a guest with us, that's the smile you put on, no matter what happened on the way to church, no matter how many knock-down, drag-out fights you had on the way to church, you stepped foot in the parking line, and as soon as your foot hits the ground, it's...
[time=1419] Hey, brother. Hey, sister.
[time=1421] I want you to know Black Hawk's a place you can be real.
[time=1424] I want you to know that even if you don't have a church smile, you're going to be loved.
[time=1428] I want you to know that everybody sitting in your section and outside of your section and outside of our church building
[time=1435] also have setbacks just like you do.
[time=1438] Your setbacks aren't unique because we all have them, but you're unique.
[time=1443] But those setbacks don't have to hold you back from the comeback, from the purpose, from the plan, from the path that God has for your life. Sometimes the summary is pretty, but the story is painful,
[time=1455] and that is exactly what we see with Joseph's story.
[time=1459] Let's look at Genesis 37. What I want to do is walk you through three seasons of Joseph's life of recalculating.
[time=1466] Three seasons that I want to walk you through where Joseph had to recalculate, where God met him in the middle of his mess,
[time=1473] in the middle of his story, in the middle of his setbacks, where they continued to strike over and over and over again.
[time=1481] The first season is one of wishing. Write that down if you're taking notes.
[time=1485] Genesis 37 verses 5 through 11 is what we'll read, but what's happening here is Joseph is 17 years old,
[time=1492] and God is implanting inside of him dreams, visions about the future.
[time=1497] If you ever been in a spot where you wished something would come to pass, but you just don't see the fruit of what you're wishing for,
[time=1504] you ever felt like God put something in your heart, and you've gone for it, but you ran into setback after setback
[time=1510] after setback so much that you start wishing it would happen, but then start, your wishing turns into wondering,
[time=1516] "God, did you even put this in my heart to begin with?" You ever been in that seat?
[time=1520] Well, I can imagine Joseph could identify. We're going to read some of his story because he has this dream, and as he has this dream, we see him wishing for a future.
[time=1528] We see him dreaming about what's ahead, and I think maybe you can identify.
[time=1533] Let's read Genesis 37 verses 5 through 11.
[time=1536] It talks about this dream that Joseph had at the age of 17 years old.
[time=1540] Verse 5, Genesis 37.
[time=1542] Now, Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, pause, time out, just so you know.
[time=1548] You'll see this in a minute.
[time=1549] Just because you have a dream doesn't mean all the time that you need to just go start sharing it before you know it before you know what it looks like and before you know what it's supposed to mean in your life.
[time=1558] If that doesn't make sense yet, then it will in just a moment. Let's keep reading.
[time=1561] Now, Joseph had a dream. When he told it to his brothers, they hated him even more.
[time=1566] And they hated him because, by the way, Jacob that we looked at last week, Joseph is Jacob's son by Rachel, Israel.
[time=1572] We talked about last Sunday that his name was changed to Israel.
[time=1575] This is his son, but he loved his son Joseph more than the other brothers, and he showed that to his brothers,
[time=1581] showed that to his children. Bad parenting moved, by the way.
[time=1585] You can learn some parenting from the Bible, too, in case you didn't know.
[time=1589] We should try that, right? His parents.
[time=1591] But here's where we sit. Joseph had a dream. He told it to him.
[time=1593] They hated him even more. Verse 6, he said to them, "Here this dream that I've dreamed.
[time=1598] Behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaves arose and stood upright,
[time=1604] and behold, your sheaves to his brothers here gathered around it and bowed down to my sheaves."
[time=1610] Ooh, buddy.
[time=1614] This is not going well for him. You can already see where this is going. You get my point now.
[time=1618] Verse 8, "His brother said to him, 'Are you indeed to reign over us, or are you indeed to rule over us? So they hated him even more.'" Seems like we've heard that, right? "For his dreams and for his words, then he dreamed another dream and told it to his brothers and said he just kept going, didn't he?
[time=1635] Sometimes we just keep bringing on the setbacks." Like, just bring them on.
[time=1639] Bring on the setbacks. This is where he is. He dreamed another dream, told it to his brothers and said, "Behold, I have dreamed another dream. Behold the sun and the moon, and 11 stars were bowing down to me, but when he told it to his father and to his brothers, his father rebuked him and said to him, "What is this dream that you've dreamed?
[time=1656] Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves to the ground before you?" And his brothers were jealous of him. No kidding.
[time=1666] But his father kept the saying in mind. We're going to come back to that in just a minute.
[time=1671] So this is the story of where Joseph is wishing, dreaming, hoping for something in the future, because God had put it there. He truly believed, and I want to take a minute to address.
[time=1680] How can I know? How can I know that what I'm wishing for is a word from God?
[time=1688] Because if we're real, it doesn't sound spiritual to ask this question, but it's a real question.
[time=1692] When we think we're hearing something from God, if you're like me, a lot of times I'll say, "God, did that come from you? Did that come from me? Did that come from the devil?
[time=1702] My enemy? Or did that come from the Taco Bell I had last night?" You ever been there? It seems crazy to think that we could have a dream, not even just a dream like Joseph had, but a thought, something that God's put on our heart and wonder, "God, is that from you or from your enemy?" It seems impossible to be in that kind of a place, but it can be real, and there are a lot of layers to that.
[time=1725] That's what we're looking at in this whole series, but I want to give you two thoughts on that.
[time=1729] How can I know that a dream, something I wish for, hope for, dream about, have a vision for,
[time=1735] is something that is from God? The first one is, I think it'll stand the test of time.
[time=1740] Slow down. I don't like that word, those two words.
[time=1745] It reminds me, I call it the P word. I can't even say it. Patience.
[time=1751] How many impatient people you got in the building with me today? Anybody with me?
[time=1755] All right, that's me for sure. Slow down sometimes though, and I believe that if it is a word from the Lord,
[time=1761] if God is speaking to you, it's coming from Him, you'll try to leave it alone, but it won't leave you alone.
[time=1769] I often asked when God was calling me in the ministry, "How do you really know?" That's my pastor who baptized me at the age of five years old, and he said, "Try your best. Here's how you know, Kevin. Try your best not to go into ministry.
[time=1781] Do everything you can to avoid it." And I went.
[time=1786] And he said, "That's all." I said, "Well, what do I do next?" And he said, "Well, that's all you need to do. You do that.
[time=1795] And if God means for it to happen, he won't leave you alone.
[time=1799] You won't be able to be happier content doing anything else." And I believe that can be true of a lot of layers to life, not just a calling into ministry, but how I can see whether the dream God's giving me stands the test of time.
[time=1811] A second one is, I think it'll align with the Bible. In this day and age, you will find a lot of people trying to make a dream or an idea something that came from God that goes clearly contrary to scripture.
[time=1823] And what I want you to know, that the will of God will never contradict the word of God. If it is not right, then it is not from God. I'll just help somebody in this place get through a lot of headache. Because if it is not right, if it doesn't come from God, from his word align with what he has given to us, remember the path that's got to become the target. We swapped the plans of God. They're often the bull's eye of the target, but we swapped that. Make walking in God's path. Make that your target. Make the doing the right thing, the target, and that will help you test and approve what is good, what is worthy, what is acceptable, what God has for your life.
[time=1863] It'll stand the test of time, and I believe it align with scripture. And there are a lot of layers with that. You say, well, it's not against scripture what God's placed on my heart, but will it stand the test of time? Is it coming from God in the high moments and the low moments? There are some things that you know are coming from God because God always does them as an example. If you're here today and you don't know Jesus, you don't have to pray about whether it's God's will for you to accept him as your Savior.
[time=1887] Jesus came for all people, and it's not his will that no one should perish, but that all would come to repentance as an example. Is it always God's will to treat those that we're married to? Our spouses with love and respect? Absolutely. That's God's path. We don't have to pray about God's path. He already mapped it out. He already walked it. He already showed us how it's done. I hope that's helpful for somebody in the room today.
[time=1911] This is a word that will help you start to discern what God's doing.
[time=1915] I believe the word of God will lead you to the will of God.
[time=1919] I think you should probably start there. I think we should probably start there.
[time=1923] Let the word of God lead you to the will of God.
[time=1927] Some stuff that's on your heart right now, God may want to do away with push to the side and put something new there. Some stuff that's on your heart today, God wants you to push all elts aside and focus on it.
[time=1939] I'm going to start today. What's God stirring inside of you today?
[time=1943] And here's what I want you to know about Joseph. Sometimes seasons of announcement he announced that dream with boldness, didn't he? Sometimes there's a place for that, but sometimes you may need to process it a little first as we saw in Joseph's life, and we'll see what that does to him in this next season in a moment. But sometimes the season of announcement when God brings something forth into your heart and into your mind is not going to equal the season of fulfillment.
[time=1967] Whatever waiting comes back in patience comes back in.
[time=1971] Sometimes when God announces something doesn't mean that he's going to fulfill it right now.
[time=1975] Sometimes he's going to do in you now some things that he needs to do to get you to the place he wants to take you later. Are you willing to go on that journey?
[time=1983] It's a journey worth taking. Maybe God when it comes to Joseph's life, maybe God showed Joseph the end because that's what happens.
[time=1991] His dream does come to pass, by the way. And we'll see that in Genesis 50 minute here, but maybe God showed Joseph the end of the story at the beginning of the story because he knew Joseph would need to know the end of the story when he got to the middle of the story. And I want you to know today that even though you may not know the end of your story, what God's doing, he may be concealing some parts of his will. He has revealed to you who wins in the end of the story. I've read the end.
[time=2019] You get to win if you're on Jesus' side. And so if you need to know the end of the story at the beginning of the story so you can make it through the middle of the story, pick up the word of God and read who wins in the end because the ending gives us hope in the middle.
[time=2035] We're in the middle. Some of you are in the middle of the worst setbacks you could imagine right now, but if you know Jesus, you know his promise is to walk you through it. If he brings you to it, he will walk you through it.
[time=2047] And if he walks you through it, then he's going to do some things in the middle of it only he could do if only you were walking in the middle of the stuff that you wish would go away. So embrace the setback. Know that it's just a setup for a comeback that God's bringing about in your life as we come and move forward. Before I move to the next thing though, that's not easy. Some people won't make that journey with you. Did you hear me?
[time=2075] Some people won't make that journey with you. When you follow Jesus, when Joseph was trying to do, he may have made some boneheaded moves here and there, but he was following what God had planted inside him. Some people won't make the journey with you and you've got to be okay with that. That you can obey God rather than men. And sometimes when you obey God, rather than men, it doesn't make sense. What you're doing doesn't make sense to men that you're refusing to obey and align with and fit preferences of. Sometimes when you follow Jesus, in fact I'd say oftentimes when you follow Jesus, you're going to lose some people along the way.
[time=2111] But what God's stirring in your heart, somebody is going to celebrate what some people in your life right now won't even tolerate.
[time=2119] Somebody needs what people around you right now may be tearing you down for. If it goes back to the word of God then stand firm in the word of God.
[time=2131] Stand firm in what God's doing in your heart today and some of you would say I wish I could get out of the pit. Joseph ended up in a pit because his brothers ended up selling him into slavery. They got mad at him and they decided we're going to kill him. And one of them said no we're not going to kill him.
[time=2147] Let's just put him in that hole over there. And he goes into this pit and so he starts with his dream and ends up in a pit. Because of his dream he ended up in a pit. He lost some people that were near and dear to his heart as he was going through this season of wishing, looking ahead to the future. And today I would tell you I want to give you a phrase if you want to get out of the pit just embrace the season you're in but do this submit in the pit.
[time=2171] Submit in the pit.
[time=2175] Those can be heavy words to say God even in the middle of a pit feels like the pit of hell in my life right now.
[time=2187] I just submit to you. I'm open handed. I don't know why the setback has come about in my life but God I submit to you in your plans because I know you still have a purpose and I'm going to keep walking in your path even when it doesn't make sense. That's what Joseph had to do and it led him to this next season go to Genesis 39, flip over a couple of pages.
[time=2207] Genesis 39 we go from wishing to working. I want you to know it's hard work to follow Jesus and find God's will for your life.
[time=2215] It's not going to be easy work. Genesis 39 we see that Joseph has been sold by the way he was sold for what would be the tune of and our money 150 dollars. His brothers his blood his kin his family betrayed him because he tried to follow and communicate the vision the dream that God had placed in his life. Sometimes people won't make the journey with you but it ended him up in the pit but he goes from the pit into slavery he sold as a slave that ends up leading him to Potiphar's house. Potiphar works under Pharaoh. He's on his staff. He's on his leadership team if you will and he ends up in Potiphar's house and God has really blessed him as we're going to read we're going to see that he has ended up in charge of all of Potiphar's possessions. So he goes from the pit now to Potiphar's house things seem to be looking up quite a bit here but we'll see how that goes as well. It's hard work to keep following God because setbacks will continue to come. Look at verse number 6 let's start there of Genesis 39 so he left all he had in Joseph's charge this is in Potiphar's house and because of him he had no concern about anything but the food he ate. Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance some of you said well I can definitely relate to the story now right.
[time=2291] Who's with me guys? I'm not you know anyway.
[time=2295] Verse 7 and after a time his master's wife cast her eyes on Joseph and said lie with me but he refused and said to his master's wife behold because of my master has no because my master has no concern about anything in the house and he has put everything he has in my charge he is not greater in this house than I am nor has he kept back anything from me except yourself because you are his wife how then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God. He said how could I betray someone who's been good to me but more than that how could I betray my father in heaven who's done nothing but good for me still following after working striving for what God has for his life and verse 10 and she spoke to Joseph day after day and I'm just guessing it doesn't say this but I'm just guessing that she didn't just speak I'm just guessing that there was some enticing going on I'm just guessing that maybe her dress changed from day to day and Joseph was in a trap and somebody in this place is in a trap and sin is wrapping its ugly hands around your neck and it's a noose that chokes the life out of you every single day and today I want to show you as Joseph worked for the Lord he worked in Potiphar's house but he wasn't just working in Potiphar's house he was working for his God no matter where he ended up in this case it happened to be from a pit to Potiphar's house he worked to follow after Jesus and this is what happened as she tried to entice him he would not listen to her verse 10 and lie beside her to be with her but verse 11 but one day when he went into the house to do his work and none of the men of the house were there in the house she caught him by his garment said lie with me but he left his garment in her hands and fled underline that and fled some of you are entangled in sin right now but you keep sticking your toe in the pool it's time to run away it's time to cut ties with whatever it is that keeps choking you and keeps entangling you into the sin that keeps holding you back it's time to stop dabbling around with it and do it Joseph put on those tennis shoes and run from it does that mean run from situations does that mean quit your job I don't know I can't tell you that but I do know God doesn't want you to dabble in or hang around things that are constantly driving you away from who he is and what he's doing in your life I mean you don't be around sinners well I think Jesus answered that so how do you do both you walk in his path but the path of Jesus will lead you into the midst of sinners it will lead you into the midst of sin can I get an amen because it's everywhere it's in your workplace it's in your home when you go out to lunch today you're going to be around people who are struggling you can be in the middle of setbacks and sin but still walk the path that Jesus has shown you and still run from the things that Satan your enemy is using to pull you down let me tell you the rest of the story what happened so he ran away and she used his garment against him he did the right thing he was faithful but he still ended up feeling forgotten in the middle of his faithfulness he fled temptation he fled sin he worked to follow after Jesus but still ended up in this spot where he was broken he ended up being thrown in prison because potter for believed his wife she accused him of trying to come after her when it was the other way around potter for believed him through him in prison and he's now from the pit to potter for his house took a step up back down into an even worse spot where he's not being sold into slavery he's locked in prison for doing something right it's possible to be faithful but still be in a spot where you feel forgotten I think that's probably where Joseph found himself in this season you're working and hear me hear me just because you're working and not seeing results don't think for a minute that God is not working on your behalf if you're being faithful to him he's working and here's a phrase for you even when your work isn't working God is some of you are working through something right now and you're trying to be faithful but it seems like your work isn't getting the results and you're not getting anywhere but I want you to know that if you're following Jesus if you're walking in his path God is working on your behalf to work out the purposes that he has for the plans that he wants to bring out in your life some of you feel like you're in a wilderness today God's at work in your wilderness who will receive that today God is at work in your wilderness somebody came today to hear that God's not given up on you and even though you're working and not seeing the fruit that you want to see you can still know that the work is worth it what is it that you need to flee today what is it that you need to run to today as we see in Joseph's life and then now let me talk about waiting third season go to Genesis 40 just a little further over Genesis 40 and we see Joseph waiting so he's in prison with a baker and a butler and both have dreams and Joseph by the way God will develop gifts inside of you in the worst lowest of your life to still practice you prepare you for what he needs to do later God's working to help Joseph interpret these dreams because it's an interpretation of Pharaoh's dream that leads him from the pit to Potiphar's house to prison and then eventually to the palace that's what we're about to see but God was working in him because he interprets these dreams one's good one's bad and he tells the butler who his dream was going to tell him you're going to get out of prison to remember me he's in a ball right he's toiling over the dream Joseph helps him with the dream just remember me tell Pharaoh about me maybe he'll help me out maybe he'll hook me up and get me out of this place well all of that stuff comes to pass Genesis 40 butler gets out of prison and do you think he what do you think he does he goes and runs and tells Pharaoh right and he brings him out of prison right then he forgets him it's possible to be faithful but still feel forgotten Joseph's living that in the middle of a setback and for two years for two whole years after that butler leaves prison
[time=2677] Joseph sits there waiting wondering what God's going to do in the wilderness
[time=2683] but he didn't quit I'm sure he felt like at time and time again but there are 13 years why don't you think about this Joseph was 17 years old when the vision God had for his life when the dreams started coming into his world but he was 30 when they started to come true for 13 years this man had to keep wishing keep working and keep waiting but God didn't quit on him even when we're faithless God's faithful some of you say well I wasn't faithful like Joseph I blew it I was the Jacob recalculating when I blew it you need to look at last week's message he blew it too at times but even when we're not a Joseph and we weren't faithful even when you're faithless your God is faithful Joseph went through that season of waiting and what he did is he turned his waiting into worship somebody here you've got to turn the waiting season that you're in into a worship full season you've got a worship in the midst of your waiting and know that God still at work know that the work is worth it and just like Joseph went from the pit to Potiphar's house back to prison he ends up going to the palace because after two years Pharaoh comes along he's having these dreams in the butler oh forgot about this guy in prison you should probably talk to him I think that was just a couple of oh it's been a couple of years he's probably pretty mad at me right now but you should probably check with him right and Pharaoh brings Joseph out he interprets his dream and the dreams that Pharaoh is having is predicting a famine that's coming to the land and because Joseph helps him predict and know what those dreams meant that a famine was coming Pharaoh puts Joseph in the palace he puts him in his house he puts him in charge of the whole kingdom he ended up from a pit to prison now in the palace over a whole kingdom preparing a nation to be able to live and be sustained through a season that no one saw coming except for God himself and he spoke it through this one man Joseph who went through setback after setback and so he ends up in the palace he ends up interpreting the dream he ends up there and go to Genesis 50 I want to there's so much more to his story but I want to get to the end of the story because the end of the story gets us to that summary and we see how God used the messy story to get to a miraculous summary that we read about in Psalm 105 Genesis 50 look there with me verse 15 when Joseph's brother saw that their father was dead this was after a father had died so much has happened in this time frame but I want to skip to the end and show you the fulfillment of those dreams that God had placed in Joseph's life famine had struck and all these people from all these lands including Joseph's family were coming to Egypt because Egypt had food because this guy named Joseph interpreted a dream and they spent all this time preparing and stocking up food and so everywhere for people from everywhere were coming and selling their goods to hear from this Joseph and to get food and so Egypt think about this you remember last week I talked about in the middle of extermination God has plans for expansion well it seems like life was trying to exterminate Joseph but in the middle of a famine because of what God was doing in his life what God had revealed through this one man with all of these setbacks Egypt was expanding because people were so desperate for food they would sell their property they were selling land and so Egypt was expanding in the middle of a famine hear me some of your in the middle of a famine because setbacks have struck in you down and they have shown you what the enemy has in his arsenal and you feel defeated you feel like God cannot even bring you out of this but in the middle of setbacks and a famine God has plans to expand your borders to grow and stretch you and use your setbacks as set ups for comebacks that you never even saw coming Genesis 50 we see the ending of this story look there with me when Joseph's brother saw their father was dead they said it may be that Joseph will hate us and pay us back for all the evil we did to him no kidding right verse 16 so they sent a message to Joseph saying your father gave this command before he died say to Joseph please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin because they did evil to you and now please forgive the transgression of the servants of God of your father Joseph wept when they spoke to him he has the power to kill them but he wept with forgiveness his brothers also came and fell down before him sound familiar and said behold we are your servants but Joseph said to them do not fear for am I not in the place of God I'm in the place of God I'm in the will of God I've recalculated through setbacks and I'm in the path that God's marked out for me verse 20 as for you you meant evil against me but God meant it for good to bring about that many people should be kept alive as they are today so do not fear I will provide for you and your little ones unless he comforted them and spoke kindly to them through the wishing through the working through the waiting God was faithful he didn't quit he didn't give up on Joseph Joseph fulfilled what God had placed in his heart he had a plan he had a destiny he had a purpose Joseph just chose to walk the path God had for him and that's what I want to challenge you with today I want to give you three things Joseph lived 110 years three things I noticed from this story just practically for you some of you are in the middle of a lot of dysfunction relationally right now Joseph I love his story because he came from a family of dysfunction a father who showed favoritism brothers who hated him bumps in the road where he shared dreams that maybe he should have held on to just a little bit longer right but what I love about Joseph's story is we see this is the first thing I want you just to take away and maybe pour into your own life this week we see development through dysfunction God developed and poured into Joseph through the dysfunction of his life the second thing is we see trust through trials maybe you need to trust God through the trials and tribulations of your life today Joseph just continued to trust he continued to wait with faithfulness and then it led to the third thing forgiven us through faith you don't have that kind of forgiveness apart from faith can I get a name in but what God meant for evil those people in your life that have hurt you and struck you down told you you want them out to anything they meant it for evil the enemy meant it for evil but God can use it for good it feels like a setback but God's using it as a set up and it's time to come back from that
[time=3109] maybe it's a phone call some of you need to call somebody and say I'm going to forgive you this week I watched a beautiful picture of that just this last week one of the most beautiful pictures of forgiveness that was never deserved never asked for I watched people come together in ways that only Jesus could do and I want you to know there's hope for that in that relationship you thought of if Joseph can forgive them it's time for you to take that forgiveness step of faith with somebody in your life maybe it's asking for forgiveness maybe it's maybe it's offering forgiveness freely I believe guys going to use something amazing in your life to do that back to Psalm 105 one last verse verse 17 it says in verse 17 he sent a man ahead of them Joseph who was sold as a slave Genesis in the story this messy says he was sold he was sold as a slave but Psalm 105 verse 17 the summary that goes from messy to miraculous says he was sent there's a big difference some of you feel like you're sold as a slave in the setback in the season of your life but God's saying I didn't sell you as a slave to this setback I sent you into the middle of this setback so that I can set it up and build something that's going to become a comeback that's going to change your plans and purpose and your future that's going to be for good know that you're sent you're not sold I want to ask you just to bow your heads and think about what that means for you right now in this moment you may feel like your setback has knocked you down you feel sold into slavery and you feel like you drag around the shackles of slavery and sin and these chains that hold you back but today God says I've sent you into that season so that I can show you who I am and you can follow me more boldly with your life some of you have already chosen to follow Jesus and you need to know your sent into the setback that you're in the middle of but some of you hear me some of you don't know Jesus today some of you would tell me in this moment that if I were to die today I just don't know that I would spend eternity with Jesus in heaven I just don't know I have that personal relationship with him and if that's you it feels hopeless doesn't it it feels like the greatest setback of life and I would tell you it is our sin separates us from God we cannot bridge our way from where we are to where God is he's too holy he's too good but the story didn't stop there the messy story that leads to the miraculous summary went something like this God saw us in the middle of our sin and he sent Jesus Jesus bridged that gap that we could never bridge he lived the sinless life that you couldn't live that I couldn't live that I could never live and then he paid the price that you could never pay and I could never pay by dying on that cross being the perfect sacrifice for our sin and then he went into this borrowed tomb and it was borrowed because he didn't have plans to stay because after three days Jesus came out of that grave and out of that grave with him in his hands was your sin was all of your short comings was death hell and the grave and he won that victory with you in mind that's the story of salvation notice what your part is in that we're saved not because of what we can do what we can bring to the table but because we lay our lives down at the foot of the cross and say Jesus I need you to save me because I can't and you say but I can't tell that story like you just told her I can't say it to God that way God doesn't want to hear from you in the way that I say it he wants to hear from you from your heart to his in this moment all heads bowed all eyes closed somebody needs to take that step if you're watching this online I don't care what's going on you stop and pray you ask Jesus to save you he will meet you where you are if you sit in this building it doesn't matter if you're in a church it doesn't matter if you're in a car it doesn't matter where you are or what setback you're in the middle of lay your life down at his feet and ask him to save you and if you'll do that he'll save you where you sit will you take a moment right now and cry out to Jesus I pray that you've been blessed today as we've looked at how we can recalculate through the setbacks of life setbacks do strike they're a reality they're a part of everyday life and no doubt as you've tuned in today you brought with you a lot of the setbacks in your own life and I still truly believe that all of those setbacks can just be a setup for what God wants to do a comeback if you will that God has in store for you through his purpose because he has a path that he has mapped out for you and he does have a plan for your life perhaps that plan today is for you to take that leap of faith that step that all important eternal step of accepting Jesus as your Lord as your Savior as your Master what does that mean it really does mean something as simple as I've outlined for you today it's a leap of faith a step of trust just doing like Joseph did trust even through trials saying Jesus I can't save me but I believe that you can I believe that you died for me paying a price for my sin I could never pay after you lived that sinless life I could never live I believe you did that for me when you were on the cross I was on your mind and Jesus I want to give you me now because I know you didn't stay in that grave after three days you're alive I believe that you're resurrected you're the resurrected king the king of all kings and I give you Jesus my life that's what salvation is all about it's a turning away from that old me my old way of trying to get there trying to be good enough and a turning to Jesus who is already good enough on my behalf that's what salvation is all about it really is that simple and I want to challenge you maybe in your mind you're thinking I need to get some things straightened out I need to figure some things out first get in church first and then I'll take that step don't wait don't stop don't pause know that God wants to meet you right now where you sit take that leap of faith and I believe you will never ever regret it and I know that it'll change your eternity from this day forward this will be a beginning for you and in fact if you have taken that step if you're looking at taking that step let us know there's going to be some information on your screen an email address a phone number where you can reach out to us and tell us what God's doing and if God's pulling you forward in your faith right now we've got a resource that we really want to get into your hands it's called beginning steps it's a growth guide for new believers and it just walks you through some what's next type steps that'll help you not stick stagnant in your faith but to move forward to take steps moving towards what God has for your life we'd love to mail one of these to you you can pick one up here at the church office but let us know what God's doing tell us your story and we'll walk with you in every single way that we possibly can we'll invite you back next week we're going to continue this recalculating series and maybe just maybe you are like this guy Moses in the Bible who feels like maybe you've missed your chance it's too late for God to do anything with you we're going to continue looking at how even in those moments we can recalculate even in the midst of life's dead ends I want to see you next week can't wait for what God's going to do thank you for sharing some of your precious time with us this week and we'll continue studying God's Word together and growing together as a team we believe life's better together here at Blackhawk and we're glad we get to do it with you
[time=3591] you
