[time=568] [MUSIC - 226 seconds]
[time=797] - Well, God, we just thank you that your love is just that big.
[time=801] No matter what it is that we go through, your love continues to come back.
[time=807] Father, it reminds me of a powder in the clay.
[time=810] Mard, but you didn't throw the piece of clay away.
[time=813] No, you took the clay and you made another vessel.
[time=817] God, continue to make us new.
[time=820] Even when we don't get it right, make us new.
[time=825] Pray this in Jesus' name.
[time=827] Thank you for your love.
[time=829] [AMEN] - My praise, God, for the theme that we've heard
[time=839] through our worship today, and that is that God's love is real, it's alive, it's active, and it's never, ever, ever going to fail.
[time=847] Can I get a name in?
[time=849] If you've got your Bibles, look at the book of Exodus, the second book of your Bible.
[time=855] I'm going to be in Exodus chapter three today and really, really pumped about this week's focus, which is a person.
[time=862] We've been looking at this series called Recalculating, Recalculating, Finding God's will through life's dead ends, and today we're going to be looking at this man named Moses, and identify with Moses as much as probably any other character in the Bible, because there's so many times God's asked me to take a step of fate that required me to do things I considered myself inadequate to be able to do.
[time=888] But another thing about Moses is that he had to learn to recalculate when he felt he had missed his chance, and you would look at his story if you didn't know how it ended and say, "Yep, Moses, you missed your chance.
[time=899] You have missed your shot in life." And so today we're going to be looking at his life and seeing how we can recalculate when we too feel like we have missed our chance, so to speak.
[time=910] And so we've looked in this series at how God's got an encompassing purpose for his will.
[time=915] We looked at how this is played out in all of these people's stories.
[time=918] We're looking at real people with real problems and real struggles and real needs to recalculate just like we have.
[time=924] But God has a path, and Jesus outlined that path for us.
[time=928] He walked that path ahead of us, and that will lead us to the plans that God has for our lives.
[time=934] So far we've looked at Abraham.
[time=936] We've looked at Jacob, and last week we looked at Joseph, and we've recalculated so far through uncertainty.
[time=942] We've recalculated from times when we blow it, and then last week we looked at recalculating when setback strike, and those tend to follow us around, because we follow us around.
[time=953] Am I right?
[time=954] So I'm excited about Moses today, but to set up this story, I want to tell you that in Exodus 1, Joseph really set up this story.
[time=963] Moses enters the picture from where Joseph leaves off, and so I'm pumped about what this means for your life, and I want to tell you today, I want you to look up this way for a minute.
[time=973] I just want you to know.
[time=975] Some of you say we're looking at the Bible, I'm not even sure about this faith thing.
[time=979] I'm watching all these catastrophes in the world around me right now, and I just question whether or not God's real, or whether Jesus is who he says he is, whether you're watching us online and you feel that way today, you're part of our extended family, and I want you to know, we say that every week because, because we serve a God who cares about you where you sit.
[time=1001] And we serve a God who is bigger than your mistakes.
[time=1006] We serve a God who is bigger than your questions, and we serve a God who cares to meet you where you sit in this moment, in this very season of your life.
[time=1018] He cares about you right where we are.
[time=1020] So Joseph left off the scene, and so Moses enters the picture because Joseph had brought a lot of his family, through Jacob, his father, to Egypt.
[time=1029] Now if you remember that story, he was able to forgive his brothers.
[time=1033] We looked at that even last week, but so that's where Moses then enters the picture.
[time=1037] Years and years later, Joseph and his family, that generation has died off.
[time=1042] There's a new king in Egypt.
[time=1044] There's a new Pharaoh, and this Pharaoh doesn't really know a whole lot about, nor certainly not care much about the people of Joseph.
[time=1051] And there was some 70-plus descendants of Joseph and his family, the nation of Israel, who had come to this place of Egypt.
[time=1059] Now this Pharaoh didn't care a lot about this nation of God.
[time=1063] Didn't care much about that, to say the least.
[time=1065] And so that's what brought these people here.
[time=1067] And so he decides he wants to, they're growing.
[time=1070] This chapter one, I think it's verse seven, says that they've multiplied.
[time=1073] This nation of God, Israel, the Hebrew people have multiplied, so that they're spread throughout the land.
[time=1079] Now the Pharaoh wasn't a big fan of that.
[time=1081] Decides to do some population control.
[time=1083] It puts out a decree that all the first born sons of the Hebrews were to be killed.
[time=1090] Tough season, setbacks abound.
[time=1092] Now enter Moses.
[time=1094] Moses goes from doomed to delivered.
[time=1098] He was supposed to die, but his mother takes him and puts him in a basket if you've read his story before you know what happens.
[time=1104] She puts him in a basket, sends him down the river, and he ends up in the hands of Pharaoh's daughter.
[time=1109] And then because God is God, and because God just, I think, winks out of sometimes to remind us he's still on the throne.
[time=1115] When we think nothing that he could do, or have anything to do with what's happening around us, the mother that put the baby Moses in the basket, ends up caring for her son and getting paid by Pharaoh's own house.
[time=1127] The one who said he is to die has his own family paying for care for this little Hebrew baby boy.
[time=1135] Tell me God doesn't work when it seems impossible.
[time=1138] Moses, though, becomes this channel of deliverance.
[time=1142] Deliverance.
[time=1143] That's what today's focus is really going to be as we look at this idea of recalculating.
[time=1147] Recalculating in our own lives today is deliverance.
[time=1150] Moses became a channel of deliverance, but he was first doomed.
[time=1154] God delivered him, though, to be a deliverer for his people.
[time=1158] And that's where this story ultimately goes.
[time=1160] He leads God's people out of Egypt.
[time=1162] And so that's the Moses that we're digging into and looking at today, is this channel of deliverance.
[time=1167] Moses wrote the first five books of your Bible.
[time=1170] It's known as the Torah, the Pentateuch, or the Book of the Law.
[time=1173] Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, your first five books.
[time=1177] He wrote those.
[time=1178] He even wrote Genesis, but he wasn't even there for creation.
[time=1181] How did that happen?
[time=1182] Because God really is the author and finisher of our faith, and he's the author of this book that we call the Bible.
[time=1188] This really not a book.
[time=1189] It's a revelation of God himself that he brought about through regular, normal people like Moses who make mistakes and blow it.
[time=1196] That's the God you serve in case you didn't know.
[time=1199] And I'm excited to serve that kind of a God.
[time=1202] Moses became a revered name in Jewish history.
[time=1204] And here's the thing, though.
[time=1206] Sounds like a good story, doesn't it?
[time=1208] As I've outlined it, I gave you a nice fluffy version, but Moses had really missed his chance.
[time=1213] Moses had blown it in his life, and I want to walk through what that looks like, but I want to give you really the key thought of this whole journey of Moses, and it's the deliverance, even though he became a channel of deliverance for God himself to work amongst his people.
[time=1227] Deliverance is often going to require, you ready for this?
[time=1230] Divine disturbance.
[time=1234] Some of you say, "Praise God, I need some deliverance.
[time=1236] Can I get a name in?" Well, I want to tell you in as much of an encouraging way, but maybe not feeling like much of an encouraging kind of way, it's probably going to require some divine disturbance in your life.
[time=1248] If you're like me a lot of times on the doorknobs of my life, especially in the doorknobs of my spiritual life, I hang a do not disturb sign many times.
[time=1257] God just let me be comfortable just for a day.
[time=1260] Good grief.
[time=1261] Stop stretching me, God.
[time=1263] But you know I've learned about God that he never leaves us how he finds us.
[time=1268] He always stretches.
[time=1270] He always disturbs and interrupts this life that we try to build.
[time=1274] Have you ever noticed that?
[time=1276] You start reading your Bible.
[time=1277] Some of you stop reading your Bible because of this.
[time=1279] You started reading your Bible and God started disturbing your plans.
[time=1282] He started interrupting your life and you said, "I'm closing that book, but I want you to know that deliverance that can only be brought about from God requires a divine disturbance." And even though it may disturb you, it may interrupt plans that you make.
[time=1297] I like making plans and God's four plans, but God is even better at planning than I am.
[time=1302] Do you hear that?
[time=1303] God is a much better planner than you are.
[time=1306] And his plans will always be better than your own.
[time=1309] My plans weren't to come to Indiana.
[time=1313] But I'm so glad that God brought me to this place for this time that we could serve him together right here for this season in Fort Wayne, Indiana because he has been behind that.
[time=1323] I never would have seen it coming.
[time=1325] But God disturbed.
[time=1326] He interrupted my plans and said, "I've got better plans than what you could have mapped out for yourself.
[time=1331] The same is true for you, just like it was for Moses." So before we dig into, I want to give you five things we see about Moses' life.
[time=1338] Before we do, I want to give you three benchmarks.
[time=1340] I want to tell you a little bit about Moses and his story.
[time=1342] These are benchmarks.
[time=1343] It's interesting when you look at Moses' story, it's kind of in 40-year blocks of time.
[time=1348] These big benchmarks, these mile markers in his life are really 40 years at a time.
[time=1353] The first one, I'm going to give you a couple of words that go along with each so you can try to remember these seasons of his life.
[time=1358] The first one is his birth, Exodus chapter two.
[time=1360] And we're going to start in chapter three reading in a moment.
[time=1363] But Exodus two, you can write down baby boy.
[time=1365] That was when Pharaoh decreed that all the baby boys, the first born of the Hebrews, was to be killed.
[time=1370] That's when his story begins after he was born.
[time=1372] He went from doomed to delivered, and then he goes from the delivered to the deliverer because of what God did in his life, meeting him where he is.
[time=1381] It's interesting Moses in Hebrew, his name literally means to draw out or to deliver.
[time=1388] And that's the purpose that God had for his life.
[time=1391] But I love that Moses was drawn out of this river, delivered from certain death in this river,
[time=1399] delivered to be a deliverer, to then be used by God to deliver, to draw out God's people enslaved as slaves under Pharaoh in Egypt.
[time=1409] And all of that, have I mentioned before that Jesus is in every book of the Bible?
[time=1413] This is some 1500 plus years before Jesus enters the scene.
[time=1417] But he's in the book of Exodus because all of this talk about deliverer, Moses becomes a deliverer, he brings deliverance because of the divine disturbance of God in his life.
[time=1427] But it all points to the deliverer who would come and draw us out from this slavery and bondage to sin.
[time=1434] His name is Jesus who would be the ultimate deliverer for all of us who have yet to come.
[time=1440] I love the Bible.
[time=1442] I love how Jesus is in every single story.
[time=1445] And so that's where Moses starts.
[time=1447] He's a baby boy at his birth.
[time=1449] 40 years later, he's 40 years old, Exodus 2, 11 through 14.
[time=1453] You can write down a big blunder.
[time=1456] Big blunder.
[time=1457] You ever had any of those in your life?
[time=1460] Sometimes you feel like you're a walking big blunder.
[time=1462] Well, Moses had gotten to this place in his life where he had identified with the Hebrew people.
[time=1466] Those were his people.
[time=1467] He had understood how he was born.
[time=1469] He had understood some of his story at this point.
[time=1472] And he saw one of his own people, a Hebrew person being mistreated and beaten.
[time=1477] Moses didn't like that.
[time=1478] So the Egyptian that was beating his brother, his fellow Hebrew, he goes and kills him and
[time=1484] hides his body in the sand.
[time=1487] You thought you made a mistake this morning.
[time=1490] Hopefully you didn't kill anybody and bury them in the sand.
[time=1493] If you did, please don't tell me right now.
[time=1495] At least wait till after.
[time=1497] But Moses makes this huge life-altering mistake.
[time=1502] You've got to get this.
[time=1503] He's the prince of Egypt.
[time=1505] He's the next in the line.
[time=1507] He is in command.
[time=1508] He is in control.
[time=1509] He has got it made.
[time=1511] But God was working in him.
[time=1513] God was doing things.
[time=1514] Disturbing his life leading to deliverance in ways that he didn't even truly see coming.
[time=1519] And look at Exodus chapter 2 verse 15.
[time=1522] Here's what happened.
[time=1523] Pharaoh finds out about this.
[time=1525] About this murder.
[time=1526] This big blunder of Moses.
[time=1528] And he decides he's going to kill him.
[time=1531] And so Moses has to flee from Egypt.
[time=1535] This home, this comfort zone that he had lived in verse 15 of Exodus 2.
[time=1539] But Moses fled from Pharaoh and stayed in the land of Midian.
[time=1543] And he sat down by a well.
[time=1547] Circle that.
[time=1548] He sat down by a well.
[time=1555] I think some of you sat down by a well this week.
[time=1558] Maybe you sat down by a well years ago.
[time=1560] I think this is a significant moment in Moses' life.
[time=1563] He sat down.
[time=1564] And life felt like it was over, I'm sure.
[time=1567] All the plans that he had made.
[time=1569] All of the thoughts and dreams of the future ruling in Egypt.
[time=1574] This great and mighty country and nation.
[time=1577] They slipped away.
[time=1579] He made a huge mistake.
[time=1581] A big blunder that would forever alter his life.
[time=1584] Disturb his plans.
[time=1585] And he sat down by a well.
[time=1587] And I would imagine he probably just wanted to sit there forever.
[time=1591] But he sat there feeling like life as I know it is over.
[time=1595] It's altered, it's changed.
[time=1597] It's disturbed.
[time=1599] And he sat there.
[time=1601] Some of you are sitting in your seat.
[time=1603] You're sitting in a church building today.
[time=1605] But spiritually speaking, you're sitting down by a well.
[time=1609] And I want you to know there's good news to this story because Moses' story didn't end at that well in Exodus chapter 2 and verse 15.
[time=1616] Your story doesn't have to end at the well that maybe you sat down beside today.
[time=1622] God wants you to just like Moses is going to do to stand up to take another step of faith and to know he's not done with you yet.
[time=1630] But Moses sat by that well, feeling like I'm sure life is over.
[time=1634] I've missed my chance.
[time=1635] Some of you are in that spot today.
[time=1637] 80 years old.
[time=1638] Fast forward another 40 year.
[time=1639] This is the third benchmark.
[time=1641] I went from this baby boy to his big blunder.
[time=1643] Now we're at the burning bush.
[time=1645] You can remember that as another benchmark of Moses' life.
[time=1648] He's 80 and you would say how do you know he's 80?
[time=1650] You can write down we won't flip there.
[time=1652] Acts chapter 7 verse 23 and verse 30.
[time=1659] We see in Stephen's story.
[time=1661] Stephen was a martyr.
[time=1662] He died giving his life for Jesus.
[time=1665] Preaching the gospel.
[time=1666] He was a martyr of faith.
[time=1668] But he talked about Moses' story.
[time=1670] So interesting.
[time=1671] This is in the book of Acts.
[time=1672] This is after Jesus.
[time=1674] He's still talking about this same Moses who was disturbed in a divine way by God's plans
[time=1680] for his life.
[time=1681] But he tells us that Moses was 40 when he killed the Egyptian.
[time=1684] And then a few verses later verse 30 of Acts chapter 7 he says some 40 years had passed.
[time=1689] So we know that Moses is now 80 years old.
[time=1693] He made his mistake.
[time=1695] He got demoted from Prince of Egypt to shepherd.
[time=1698] By the way to an Egyptian a shepherd would be the lowest of lows.
[time=1702] It would be at the testable position.
[time=1704] But he's a shepherd in this land of Midian.
[time=1707] He's found his wife.
[time=1708] But he just figures I'm going to die in this place I would imagine.
[time=1711] He's 80 years old, 40 years had passed.
[time=1714] Life had gone downhill.
[time=1715] But he encounters a burning bush.
[time=1717] That's what we're going to look at today.
[time=1719] But that's the burning bush moment.
[time=1720] If you wanted a fourth benchmark, 40 years later, interestingly enough, Moses dies at the age of 120.
[time=1726] And if you want to be words without it, I guess you could say bye bye.
[time=1730] Bye bye Moses.
[time=1732] Sometimes cheesiness makes you remember.
[time=1733] So there you go.
[time=1734] You can hold on to that.
[time=1736] Let's look at some takeaways about God, myself, and about Moses, about recalculating.
[time=1741] I want you to know we see in this story that when our plans run into collide with, intersect
[time=1747] with God's purpose, power happens.
[time=1750] I want you to hear me say that again because some of you need this in this place today when our plans intersect with, collide with, run into God's purpose, power happens.
[time=1763] God doesn't always call the equipped, but he always equips the called.
[time=1768] Even a young 17-year-old preacher who was told in high school never to do any kind of job that requires any form of public speaking, number one on the not to do aptitude list.
[time=1779] But God said, I want to disturb those plans that maybe you're making.
[time=1782] I want to do things differently, identify with Moses, he had lots of excuses.
[time=1786] So let's look at Exodus chapter three, the first three verses and we'll see the first big takeaway and that is this, that God's movement in my life, God's movement in my life
[time=1796] starts with me moving.
[time=1798] Look at somebody and say it's time to go.
[time=1800] Tell them it's time to go.
[time=1803] It's time to stop sitting at the well and to start moving.
[time=1807] Look at Exodus chapter three, who's ready for the word this morning?
[time=1810] Verse one, now Moses was keeping the flock, underline that, Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law, Jethro, the priest of Midian, that's where Moses had fled to from Egypt, running away from Pharaoh and he led his flock to the west side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God and an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire in the midst of a bush.
[time=1832] As we look for God's will, how many of you would say, please God give me a burning bush?
[time=1836] We say that a lot, don't we?
[time=1838] We're going to look at this burning bush, but it may not be everything you think it should be.
[time=1842] A lot of times we say, "God, just write it in the sky.
[time=1844] Speak through the plant in my living room." But God doesn't often work that way, but he does in this case with Moses.
[time=1850] He looked, it says, "And behold, the bush was burning, yet it was not consumed." And Moses said, "I will turn aside and see this great sight." No kidding.
[time=1858] If you saw that, I'd be looking, let's looking at that too, when the bush, why the bush is not burned.
[time=1863] But here's what I want us to look at before we go into the burning bush, is that Moses was tending the sheep.
[time=1869] Moses wasn't still sitting down by the well.
[time=1872] Moses, even in this awful season, 40 years of a season now, from 40 years old, killing the Egyptian to eventually now at the age of 80, encountering this burning bush, a voice from God, God was building him up, God was teaching him, disturbing his life, but he wasn't still sitting down by a well.
[time=1890] Even though he had missed his chance, I don't know how well he decided, but he did decide because he was tending the flock.
[time=1896] He was embracing the season God had him in.
[time=1899] He was deciding, "I'm going to at least bloom where God has planted me for now." But God met him in the middle of his statefulness, in the middle of his movement.
[time=1907] He was doing something.
[time=1908] He decided, "I'm not going to stay it that well in Exodus 2, but I'm going to move forward."
[time=1914] Sometimes we're waiting on God to show us his will.
[time=1918] Can I get an amen?
[time=1919] And you say, "Why do you think I'm at recalculating series?
[time=1922] I'm not coming to church other than that." But here you sit because you want to find God's will, and I know that you do or you wouldn't be here.
[time=1929] Sometimes we wait on God to show us his will.
[time=1931] We often sit down at a well, and we decide, "I'm just going to sit right here, God.
[time=1937] Put our hands in our pocket.
[time=1938] I'm just going to sit right here until you show me the way."
[time=1944] We plan our foot and say, "God, I'll be right here when you decide to send that burning bush." I want you to know today that God wants to raise up a generation of leaders, of faithful people like Moses, who even though they had blown it and missed their chance that I'm not going to plant my feet, I'm not going to sit down at a well.
[time=1963] I'm going to get up whatever season I'm in, whatever life looks like, and I'm going to make the most of it, and I'm going to keep following after.
[time=1970] I'm going to keep listening to.
[time=1971] I'm going to keep being faithful and bloom right where God has chosen to plant me today.
[time=1979] Somebody needs that word today, as you feel restless and you're waiting, but God wants you to make this statement, and so the question is, "What step of movement has God asked you to take today?" I believe there is one for you.
[time=1992] I want to invite you into proclaiming this statement this week with me, and the statements in your notes says, "I won't be so consumed by my problems that I'm blinded to my potential."
[time=2003] So many times we get so consumed by our problems that we don't see the potential blessings
[time=2009] that potential plans, the potential purpose that God wants to bring out in our lives.
[time=2015] So let that be your proclamation this week.
[time=2017] Who's with me?
[time=2018] I'm not going to be so consumed by my problems that I'm blinded to the potential that God still has yet to fulfill in my life.
[time=2026] God's plan for deliverance is going to require some of that kind of disturbance.
[time=2030] Number two, God's plan is always built around a close relationship with him.
[time=2036] We see that as we continue in this story, Exodus chapter 3, verse 4, "After He got up and He's tending the sheep, He sees this burning bush, God's plan is always built around a close relationship with Him." Look there at verse 4 with me, "When the Lord saw that He turned aside to see God called Him out of the bush, Moses, Moses." You want to circle that because that's going to be kind of the point that I'm making here about a close relationship, and He said, "Here I am," and He said, "Do not come near, take your sandals off your feet, for the place on which you're standing is holy ground." And He said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, and Moses hit his face." He's afraid to look at God, verse 7.
[time=2077] The Lord said, "I've surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and I've heard their cry because of their taskmasters.
[time=2083] I know their sufferings.
[time=2085] Somebody should be encouraged by that today because you feel like you're enslaved, you feel like you're in bondage, you feel like God has forgotten you, but we serve a covenant keeping, promise making, promise keeping God who has not forgotten you.
[time=2098] He knows your sufferings, but He wants to walk with you through those sufferings to bring you to a place of purpose and a place of His promise."
[time=2108] That part's free.
[time=2110] Verse 8.
[time=2111] "And I've come down now to deliver His deliverance, deliver them out of the Egyptians, out of the hand of the Egyptians, to bring them up to the land of a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
[time=2127] And now behold, the cry of the people of Israel has come to me, and I have also seen their oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them." Verse 10.
[time=2138] "Come, I'll send you to Pharaoh.
[time=2140] Here's where deliverance leads to a calling, deliverance leads to a purpose.
[time=2143] I'll send you to Pharaoh that you may bring my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt." Verse 10.
[time=2150] "I'm 80.
[time=2151] 80 years old.
[time=2152] I've been a shepherd for 40 years.
[time=2153] I had it all.
[time=2154] I lost it all.
[time=2155] I've missed my chance.
[time=2156] Are you kidding me, God?
[time=2157] But God's plan is not built.
[time=2158] Hear me.
[time=2159] God's plan is not built around your ability.
[time=2168] It is built around your availability because God looked at this knucklehead Moses who had murdered, missed his chance, lost everything, is too old now, is way past his prime and
[time=2179] said, "I want you to do what I have outlined for you, and I'm going to do whatever it takes to get you to take that step, and I'm going to equip you every step of the way." God's plan for your life doesn't hinge on how good you are and what your ability looks like.
[time=2194] It hinges on your availability, and you just saying, "Here I am, Lord, send me." Moses said, "Here I am to the bush, but now he's going to say, 'I'm not sure about this.'" So back to verse 4, though.
[time=2203] He says, "Moses, Moses." There's some 15 or so times in the Bible where God speaks or even where others speak
[time=2212] and use this double name.
[time=2214] Double name.
[time=2215] Moses, Moses.
[time=2216] You see it with Abram, in Abraham's story, Abram, Abram.
[time=2220] You see it several times from Jesus.
[time=2222] He says it about Jerusalem.
[time=2224] When his heart is breaking and he's filled with compassion for Jerusalem.
[time=2227] You see it with Elijah and Elisha.
[time=2232] You see it from Jesus with Martha.
[time=2233] He says, "Martha, Martha." You remember that story?
[time=2236] Got any martha's in the room?
[time=2239] And we often give Martha a bad rap.
[time=2241] I'm not preaching that sermon today, I promise, but he meant her, somebody laughed like you don't believe me.
[time=2248] He believed in her and cared about her where she was, and this double name, here's what it means in Scripture, it's a form of intimacy, it's a form of compassion, it's a point, it's a pointer to an intimate relationship.
[time=2261] God's plans for your life are always centered around a close relationship and walk with
[time=2268] Jesus.
[time=2268] Moses, Moses.
[time=2272] God looks at me and he says, "Kevin, Kevin." He says he cares about me and he wants to walk alongside me in my life.
[time=2281] I've been so many times where God should have just been done with me because I've missed
[time=2292] my chance, but God says, "I'm going to meet you there," Kevin, Kevin.
[time=2299] Moses, Moses.
[time=2300] I care about you right where you sit and if you're in a place like Moses is, you don't need another sermon or Bible study, you need a fresh encounter with God.
[time=2310] You need a fresh encounter with Jesus today and he's ready, he's here.
[time=2316] He's saying your name two times because he wants a close, intimate walk right alongside
[time=2322] of you.
[time=2323] Number three, God's name assures me that he's all I need.
[time=2328] God's name, his name alone assures me that he is all I need and Hebrews 11, it's known
[time=2334] as the Hall of Fame of Faith.
[time=2336] Moses is listed there in this Hall of Fame of Faith.
[time=2339] Hebrews 11 at the end of the passage that talks about him, it says that Moses, "He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt because
[time=2350] he was looking ahead to his reward." Now Moses' story happened some 1500 years before Jesus came on the scene.
[time=2358] So why was he doing it for Jesus?
[time=2362] Because there's a big picture in Scripture that every story points to, it's the gospel, it's the good news, it's the name of Jesus, that's the name above every name, the name at which every knee is gonna bow, the name at which every tongue will confess that he is Lord.
[time=2378] And he's the theme of this collection of verses, this collection of books, this collection
[time=2385] of writings that we call the Bible, it all comes together and it points to one and one only his name is Jesus and we see it even in Moses' story, he is the deliverer.
[time=2397] But Moses saw that God's name is all that he would need in his life and I want you to know today until you see in your life that Jesus is enough for you, no person or thing will ever be.
[time=2410] Moses had to get to that kind of a place, until you see that Jesus is enough, no person or thing, no matter what you try, no matter what combination is ever going to be.
[time=2419] But when you run into God like Moses has, you'll be able to say, I can let go of everything I have, open hands because you're all I need.
[time=2427] I can let go of it all because you're all I need.
[time=2429] And that's where Moses gets to, Exodus 3, verse 11, I love this part of the passage here
[time=2435] because it reminds us of the God that we serve, but Moses said to God, verse 11, who am I?
[time=2440] Can I get an amen?
[time=2442] Who am I?
[time=2443] You're waiting on this part.
[time=2445] Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?
[time=2449] He said, but I will be with you.
[time=2451] This will be a sign for you that I have sent to you.
[time=2454] When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.
[time=2458] We're going to talk about that next Sunday, you don't want to miss that.
[time=2461] This very mountain.
[time=2462] Verse 13, then Moses said, if I come to the people of Israel and save them, the God of your fathers has sent me to you and they ask me, what is his name?
[time=2471] I love this, the raw, real picture of Moses in this picture.
[time=2476] What is his name?
[time=2477] What shall I say to them?
[time=2478] God said to Moses, I am who I am.
[time=2483] And he said, say this to the people of Israel, I am has sent me to you.
[time=2490] I am.
[time=2492] Guess what that means?
[time=2493] If he's the I am, that means I am not.
[time=2498] I love that it's present and ongoing.
[time=2500] He said, I am the I am.
[time=2502] He didn't say I am the I was or the I will be.
[time=2504] He said, I am the I am.
[time=2507] Tell them that I am has sent you and I'm going to go before you and I'm going to go with you.
[time=2512] And somebody here today needs the same reassurance that Moses needed in the first couple of verses.
[time=2516] He needed reassurance about himself.
[time=2518] Who am I that I could go?
[time=2520] He needed assurance about his identity and God said, I am your identity.
[time=2523] I will walk with you in the next couple of verses.
[time=2525] He said, who are you?
[time=2527] Who do I tell them?
[time=2528] Who is this God?
[time=2529] If they ask.
[time=2530] What is his name?
[time=2531] And he said, I am.
[time=2532] Tell them that the I am has sent you.
[time=2534] Somebody needs that same reassurance from God in your life today.
[time=2539] You say, I am broken.
[time=2540] God's looking at you and saying, I am your completion.
[time=2543] You say, I am confused.
[time=2545] God said, I am your clarity.
[time=2549] You say, I am nothing.
[time=2552] God says, I am all you need.
[time=2560] You say, I am full of problems.
[time=2564] Maybe you say, I am a problem.
[time=2567] God says, I am your purpose and I have a plan for you.
[time=2571] Just walk in my path in the midst of your problem and I'm going to lead you to some promises you didn't even see coming.
[time=2578] Great I am has a plan for you and it assures you that he's all that you will ever need.
[time=2585] Verse 15 of this whole story says, this is my name, the next verse.
[time=2589] Look at the next verse, verse 15.
[time=2590] God also said to Moses as if that wasn't enough.
[time=2593] Say this to the people of Israel, the Lord, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob has sent me to you.
[time=2601] This is my name forever.
[time=2605] Somebody say forever.
[time=2608] This is my name.
[time=2609] I am the great I am.
[time=2611] Not I was, not I will be, but right now and it applies to you just like it did in the life
[time=2617] of Moses.
[time=2618] God's name reassures me that I've got everything that I need and I'm okay.
[time=2622] I'm glad I serve the I am and I'm glad to say I am not.
[time=2626] Somebody say that.
[time=2627] I am not.
[time=2632] It's the beginning of freedom and a life of faith is to be able to say I am not because I serve the great I am.
[time=2638] Fourth thing, here's where it gets real for you.
[time=2641] God's timing stretches me.
[time=2642] Can I get an amen?
[time=2644] God's timing stretches me, but it's always perfect.
[time=2647] Skip over to verse 19.
[time=2648] We see some more of the conversation.
[time=2650] Read this whole conversation this week is my challenge, but I want to point out a few particular things.
[time=2654] Verse 19, God's talking to Moses about this timing and how he's heard the cry of the Israelites and he says but I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless compelled
[time=2665] by a mighty hand.
[time=2667] You would rather it happen the first day you go with you Moses, but I know it won't happen that way and that's okay because I have the mighty hand that is going to take to move the heart of Pharaoh.
[time=2677] So I will stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all the wonders that I will do in it after that.
[time=2683] He will let you go.
[time=2686] God's timing stretches me.
[time=2692] Anybody been stretched today?
[time=2693] My God's timing, you've been waiting for a while.
[time=2695] You've been waiting for an answer.
[time=2696] You've been praying about this thing, trying to find God's will and you just can't quite figure it out and you wonder why God's waiting so long.
[time=2704] Take it from a guy who's in the wilderness for 40 years as a shepherd after being the prince of Egypt that God's timing does stretch us, but it's always perfect and I think God uses his timing so when you look at this story, the Israelites had been in bondage filling
[time=2719] forgotten for a long, long time crying out to their God and he tells us in this story
[time=2725] that he had heard them, but just like that Moses had spent 40 years.
[time=2729] He was 80 when he heard from God 40 years.
[time=2732] You remember Joseph last week and I talked about the delay and the waiting season.
[time=2736] It was somewhat 17 years.
[time=2738] Well Moses more than doubled that.
[time=2740] He thought 17 years was a long time.
[time=2743] You thought 17 months was a long time.
[time=2746] Sometimes it takes God a little time to get us to the places he needs to take us to.
[time=2750] I think his timing is a lot like sandpaper.
[time=2752] This is a sanding block.
[time=2754] This is your life.
[time=2755] It's a rough looking block.
[time=2758] You say that's me.
[time=2759] I'd be that one.
[time=2761] You got some rough edges probably, don't you?
[time=2763] I know I do.
[time=2765] Lots of rough edges in my life, but as we wait and as we let God's timing stretch us, but
[time=2771] learned that his timing is not my timing, his ways are not my ways, but his timing is always perfect.
[time=2776] He starts sanding.
[time=2779] He starts knocking off some rough edges.
[time=2782] He starts refining our lives.
[time=2785] So this is so rough I can't even sand it.
[time=2788] That's you, isn't it?
[time=2789] That's me.
[time=2790] But God sands away rough edges and he teaches us things in the process and we get to this point where we can understand and see life and see God in a way that we could never see him before.
[time=2800] It's more smooth.
[time=2801] It's more understandable because God has taken this time even though it's not my timing and I don't like it and I didn't choose it to sand off rough edges, teach us new things and prepare us for the purpose that he has for our life because hear me.
[time=2813] He does have plans for you even when his timing doesn't make sense.
[time=2820] He let him sand, his timing is perfect even when it stretches you.
[time=2825] Moses wouldn't have been ready to go into Egypt if God didn't have him there as a shepherd for that 40 years.
[time=2832] He needed him to learn to get up after he sat down at that well.
[time=2835] He needed to learn to get up and move and embrace the season that he was in.
[time=2840] Is that a word for somebody here today?
[time=2842] It was for Moses.
[time=2843] He needed to learn to hear from God, to understand who the great I am, truly is.
[time=2848] God didn't reveal himself to him that fully until 40 years later because Moses wasn't
[time=2854] ready for it.
[time=2855] Somebody needs to hear this today.
[time=2856] You've been waiting on God for something and it's driving you crazy.
[time=2860] You wonder why God doesn't care, why God's not listening, what's going on with this process.
[time=2865] I'm praying, I've listened to this preacher talk about the purpose and how Jesus has a path for my life but God won't reveal to you the stuff that he has for your purpose
[time=2874] and your plans and the plans and the path he has for you until you're ready.
[time=2878] So your challenge right now is not to force God's hand to go ahead and tell you the stuff you think he needs to tell you but to prepare yourself for the purpose he's going to reveal, to get yourself ready, to let him sand those rough edges off, to listen to him and build an intimate relationship and a close walk with him even in your season of waiting so that one day when the time is right, you've got to reveal to you the path he has and the
[time=2903] purpose and the plans he's going to bring about because he hasn't given up on you.
[time=2907] Jesus had missed his chance but God met him right there after sanding for 40 years.
[time=2914] Now even though I said that, some of you have some good excuses and while that's not possible for you, you don't have to say amen, you just did in your head.
[time=2924] The excuses are running through your mind.
[time=2925] The fifth thing that we see, I'm not going to read from Exodus 4 but in Exodus 4 love this passage.
[time=2931] You should read it this week, we see excuses and so the fifth thing that we learned from Moses is that God's power is bigger than my weakness.
[time=2939] God's power is bigger than my weakness.
[time=2942] Moses would lead the Israelites out of Egypt after all these plagues and he would lead them across the Red Sea.
[time=2948] Did you know that the Red Sea is some 1200 miles long in some places at this time, 7,200
[time=2956] feet deep?
[time=2958] That's a weakness, that's an obstacle if I've ever seen one but God took this Moses who had missed his chance with a stick, a stick stuck into the ground, parted that
[time=2971] huge obstacle in the sea and led millions of people out of bondage and into freedom.
[time=2978] Deliverance came because a divine disturbance entered this life who had missed his chance who had blown it as a baby boy should have been doomed but he got delivered.
[time=2988] Made a big blunder, he was doomed again.
[time=2990] He sat down by a will and just decided I'm going to get up and keep moving in this new season but God brings a burning bush and he meets him there and he walks into this place from being the delivered one to the deliverer of the people of God.
[time=3005] Tell me your excuses are too big for that God, for that great I am.
[time=3010] I believe it's not.
[time=3012] Some of the excuses here, what if they don't believe me?
[time=3015] Then he says I'm not eloquent.
[time=3017] He says I can't speak, I don't speak well, I stutter, I don't get words outright.
[time=3023] That was another one and that was me, I identify with Moses and then he eventually just says okay God, you have answers for all that but here's the deal, just send somebody else.
[time=3032] Just send somebody else.
[time=3035] But God meets him there, walks him through all of that.
[time=3037] By the way the first four verses of Exodus 4 is the first snake handling church in the Bible.
[time=3042] If you don't believe me you should read that this week.
[time=3046] But if they don't believe me and God says what do you have in your hand?
[time=3049] He says it's just a staff and he said we'll pick it up and it turns into a snake.
[time=3053] That is where my weakness would have definitely been too big even for God working in this story and I'm just kidding.
[time=3059] He can even overcome that.
[time=3060] Snakes, I don't do snakes.
[time=3062] But Moses gets to hold this snake, it's another sign to show from God that his power is bigger than Moses' weaknesses.
[time=3070] Hear me when I tell you this, do I believe God takes broken people to do amazing things?
[time=3075] Do I absolutely believe it?
[time=3079] Somebody here would say I don't know, don't know if I believe it.
[time=3082] I know you've got that thing you wish you could do better.
[time=3086] You wish you could say it better.
[time=3090] You wish you looked better.
[time=3093] You wish you had more talent.
[time=3095] What's that thing you wish you could do better that constantly holds you back in your life?
[time=3099] I think we all have some of those buried deep within and they often become fear.
[time=3104] I believe God takes those areas of brokenness, takes those very areas and uses them to showcase
[time=3111] his strength in ways he could have never done with your strongest areas.
[time=3115] I often wonder what would the Bible look like if the people that God uses in Scripture,
[time=3124] if they were granted by God strength in the areas that they were the most weak, if Paul
[time=3130] didn't have his thorn in the flesh.
[time=3133] If Moses could speak so eloquently, if he was the head of the debate club, what would
[time=3139] the Bible look like?
[time=3140] I wonder if Paul who had his own weaknesses would have written down as much as he had written down.
[time=3147] I wonder if Aaron wouldn't have even been involved and then we wouldn't have the message that I'm going to preach to you next week about when God seems silent.
[time=3153] Can I get an amen?
[time=3154] Maybe God seems silent and next week we're going to look at how God seems silent, immediately following the delivery, the deliverance of the Israelites from the land of Egypt, Aaron
[time=3164] wouldn't have been sent with Moses to speak with him.
[time=3167] He wouldn't have been a part of the story.
[time=3168] Maybe some of that wouldn't have been written down.
[time=3170] David would have been taller than Goliath and he should have beaten him.
[time=3175] But God said, "No, I want to take the stage of your weakness, those areas that you absolutely couldn't do it and it's on those stages that I want to do the biggest, boldest, most amazing
[time=3187] things so that I can get glory through even your weaknesses so that no one thinks that you are the I am, but that they see that you are not and they know that I am the I am."
[time=3200] Your weakness fits that same category.
[time=3204] Your weakness.
[time=3205] And sometimes it's more important to know about the things that God leaves out than the things that God puts in.
[time=3211] We pray for God to put certain things in.
[time=3214] You should write that down.
[time=3215] That's in your notes.
[time=3216] That's an important thing.
[time=3217] You should consume by what God often, in our terms, leaves out.
[time=3221] But sometimes when the way God works enters the equation, it's more important to know what God's left out than what he's put in.
[time=3229] You say, "Well, God hasn't put in deposited enough in me to do X, Y, or Z." But God says, "Sometimes it's the stuff that I didn't put in that that's the area I'm going to zoom in on and use you for my purpose in ways you never dream possible."
[time=3243] I know you've got that thing.
[time=3244] You wish you could do better.
[time=3246] But God's the great I am.
[time=3248] He'll take that and He'll do with you and through you whatever He pleases, just like
[time=3255] Moses.
[time=3256] I'm going to ask you to bow your heads with me.
[time=3260] Close your eyes.
[time=3261] Nobody looking around?
[time=3262] Just reflect on that.
[time=3263] What does that mean for you in this place today?
[time=3266] What does it mean for you to move forward in your life, to recalculate even if you've missed your chance like Moses had done?
[time=3275] Do those gaps in your life look like?
[time=3277] God has grace for you and those gaps.
[time=3279] God has grace for you right where you sit in this place today.
[time=3282] If you're a believer, if you know Jesus today, then ask Him what step of faith you need to take.
[time=3288] In what way do you need to get up from the well?
[time=3290] Maybe you've been sitting down at that well for quite some time.
[time=3295] What's He teaching you?
[time=3297] But somebody's here today and I just believe that if I were to ask you if you've entered into that faith, if you were to die today, do you know that you would spend eternity with God in heaven because of a personal relationship with Jesus?
[time=3310] You would look at me and you would say, "You know, I'd like to know, but I don't know." And if that is you in this room, the most important thing that's going to happen today, hear me.
[time=3318] The most important thing that's going to happen today is that Jesus wants to meet you where you are because of the good news of the gospel save you in this season of your life.
[time=3328] If that's you, nobody's looking around, the gospel is clear, I'm not going to lead you in a prayer because I think your heart is screaming it.
[time=3335] God's drawing you to Himself.
[time=3336] You know that you're separated from God because you're a sinner just like Moses.
[time=3341] Our sin separates us from God, but God came and did something about that separation.
[time=3347] His name was Jesus.
[time=3348] He came and He died on that cross and while He was on that cross, you were on His mind because He had already lived the sinless life that you and I could never live, that Moses Himself could never live and He paid a price that we could never pay as that sacrifice,
[time=3364] the sinless sacrifice of a Savior who loved you and He died on that cross.
[time=3370] They put Him in a grave, but three days later He came out of the grave, He defeated death,
[time=3379] He defeated your sin and now He's the great I am that when you say I am separated from
[time=3385] God, He looks at you and says I am your Savior who will redeem you from your sins.
[time=3392] Will you receive it today?
[time=3393] That's the call of Scripture.
[time=3395] That's the call of God.
[time=3396] That's the call of Jesus in your life.
[time=3398] Will you pray out to Him if you don't know that you have a personal relationship?
[time=3401] Would you take this moment in your own words to God?
[time=3404] Don't be like Moses and say, well, I can't say it like the pastor said it.
[time=3407] I don't have the right words.
[time=3409] Use your words.
[time=3410] Cry out from your heart to God.
[time=3412] He will meet you where you sit and save you right where you are in this room or wherever you may be watching hearing these words right.
[time=3419] Now will you do that right now as we pray together?
[time=3426] What is recalculating look like for you today?
[time=3429] Maybe you're one of those people I've been talking about.
[time=3431] Maybe it's you and God's spoken to you right where you sit no matter where you're at, what life looks like or what today looks like as you're watching this.
[time=3439] I just pray that you will take that next step and perhaps to just accept Jesus as your Lord, as your Savior to respond to the good news, the gospel of Jesus.
[time=3449] That's what we're all about here at Black Hawk is spreading that good news about Jesus, the gospel all around the world.
[time=3455] It really is as simple as I've outlined for you today.
[time=3457] I know in your mind, perhaps like my mind does so many times, make complicated what God has made so simple.
[time=3464] Just take that leap of faith.
[time=3465] Jesus really will meet you right where you are.
[time=3467] He really did die for your sins, the separation from you and God that comes about because of your sin.
[time=3473] He died, paid for that.
[time=3474] He is alive.
[time=3475] He did not stay in that grave.
[time=3477] He walked out and with it.
[time=3479] He carried the keys to death and hell and to conquer your sin.
[time=3483] He's already done that, the victory's won.
[time=3485] Will you accept it?
[time=3486] Will you trust Him?
[time=3487] Will you follow after Him and say, "Jesus, here is my life, every bit of me.
[time=3492] He will meet you there and He will save you." And the angels in heaven will rejoice just like it has today with all these people in our midst and you're going to be one of those people.
[time=3501] I truly believe it.
[time=3502] And so we would love to walk with you on that journey, show you what's next.
[time=3505] We've got a booklet we would like to get into your hands called Beginning Steps, a growth guide for new believers and we would love to mail one of these to your house.
[time=3513] We would love to have you stop by and pick one up in person so we can meet you face to face.
[time=3518] But there's going to be some information on your screen, email address, a phone number where you can reach out to us and tell us that you've made a decision, you've taken that next step of your faith, you've recalculated.
[time=3529] We would love to hear from you, we'd love to walk with you and just show you that you're not alone in this journey.
[time=3534] So let us do that, give us that privilege and we look forward to the journey that's ahead.
[time=3539] I want to invite you back.
[time=3540] We're going to continue this series called Recalculating, looking at people who really do struggle.
[time=3544] We looked at Moses this week and next week we're going to look at Aaron and we're going to look at how God helps us recalculate, find His will, even when God seems silent.
[time=3555] That's probably pretty relevant for you as it has been for me many times of my life.
[time=3559] So come back, join us as we continue this journey of recalculating.
[time=3563] Thanks for giving us some of your time today.
[time=3564] God bless.
[time=3565] See you next week.
