[time=1221] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1241] [MUSIC - 760 seconds]
[time=2021] I'm even making Jesus nervous. Let's thank Jesus for a minute, for his help. You see what we do? It's a true reality for many of us, isn't it? I want to tell you something about Jesus today. I want to tell you something about you today. Jesus didn't die on the cross to partner with you on the throne of your life. Jesus didn't die on the cross to partner with you on the throne of your life.
[time=2050] Jesus didn't die on the cross to co-sign on your will. Sometimes we say, "God, let me write the script, bump him off the side." It's a good script though, Jesus. I'm going to church in this script, right? And we bumped Jesus off the script, but I want you to know Jesus didn't die on the cross to co-sign on your will. He died on the cross to save you so you could surrender completely to his.
[time=2079] That's the story. That's Exodus chapter 32. The Israelites are in that very spot where they want a God that fits their box. They want an obedient God who does what they say. They didn't quite get this concept and we want a God that operates on our terms and our dynamics. It's time to surrender the throne, my friends.
[time=2108] Where have you bumped Jesus off the chair? This is his chair to begin with. It's a good question to ask. I want to share with you just simply two questions, two choices that we have to make when God seems silent that we learn from this story. The first six verses, we see the first choice that we have to make when God seems silent. The same choice the Israelites were making and it's in those first six verses and it's really just faithfulness or familiarity.
[time=2137] Faithfulness or familiarity. Idols crept in. Idols are good things, bad things, things in the middle, but they're things good or bad that become ultimate things.
[time=2152] Good things, bad things that become ultimate things. It's not about the stuff in your yard. It's not about the money in your bank account. It's about what lies in the throne room of your heart.
[time=2163] That's what tells what idols may exist in our lives and that's what we see the Israelites. Here's what was going on. The Israelites were longing for the right thing.
[time=2172] They were longing for the right thing. In fact, go back to chapter 31, same page most likely in your Bible. The last verse of Exodus 31, there's a very interesting thing that happened.
[time=2182] They were waiting on God, verse 1, verse 1 of Exodus 32 says while they were waiting, God, they saw that Moses delayed coming down from the mountain. Go back to verse 18, last verse of Exodus 31.
[time=2194] And this is about God giving something to Moses and he gave to Moses when he had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai. The two tablets of testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God. Guess what? God had already spoken.
[time=2209] It was already done. The message that seemed so delayed was already written. So many times I think we're like the Israelites. We go back to something familiar and the Israelites were waiting on the right thing.
[time=2223] They were longing for God, but they reached for gold. So many times we long for the right stuff. We long to hear from God. And in this room, somebody, I want you to hear me.
[time=2235] There is a word that has been written from God to you. He may not just be able to deliver it to you yet because you might not be ready to receive it, but it's written, he knows your days.
[time=2247] Your days are numbered. Don't be like the Israelites longing for God, but reaching for gold because it's tangible.
[time=2256] The Israelites longed for a faithful God and they had seen the faithfulness of God in their life, but instead they chose familiarity.
[time=2266] They chose to go back to some of the same stuff that they were in bondage to in Egypt. God had already delivered them, but they chose familiarity.
[time=2275] Have you ever noticed that we do that too? We go back to the same stuff that we pray for God to deliver us from.
[time=2282] When times get tough and God doesn't seem as faithful as we want him to be, we revert back to the past.
[time=2289] Sometimes when God seems silent that we often reach for faithfulness, but end up grasping for familiarity.
[time=2298] And when we go for the familiar, we miss the faithful one and how he wants to work in our heart and in our lives.
[time=2305] I want to read to you, you can just jot it down, you don't have to turn there, keep your place Exodus 32, but Psalm 103.
[time=2311] I want to read this to you, Psalm 103 verses 2 through 5, I'll start in verse 1.
[time=2317] "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name, bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits."
[time=2329] Remember how faithful our God is, who forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit.
[time=2337] You remember Joseph if you were here through this series, he redeemed him from the pit, who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy,
[time=2344] who satisfies you with good so that your youth is renewed like the eagles.
[time=2350] Look, let me see your eyes for a minute, I want you to know something, God sent me to tell somebody here that is starting to maybe not believe this anymore, to tell you that God is faithful.
[time=2361] We serve a promise keeping, all knowing, all loving, caring, compassionate God who is faithful.
[time=2372] Celebrating.
[time=2374] Because it's true.
[time=2377] Some of you have forgotten that though, and I want you to know some of your discouraged.
[time=2383] I believe from the depths of my heart that the best remedy for discouragement in life is remembering the faithfulness of God.
[time=2394] You don't see him, he seems silent, he seems a million miles away today.
[time=2399] We'll remember yesterday how he was so close to you, remember yesterday how he met you in your moment of greatest need, remember all the way back when if you know Jesus today, how he met you in the muck and the mire and the mess of your sin.
[time=2413] And he reached down with his grace and he saved your soul, remember that day, remember how he's walked with you since in the moments where he doesn't seem to be there and he seems to be silent.
[time=2426] Because he's still the same God.
[time=2430] Hebrews tells us, yet Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.
[time=2437] He's a faithful God.
[time=2438] Will you not remember his faithfulness?
[time=2440] Will you hold on to his faithfulness?
[time=2442] The Israelites so quickly forgot God's faithfulness and they started to get caught up in faults of their own life and familiarity.
[time=2449] But I want you to know that the God who got you here is going to get you there.
[time=2454] Did you hear that?
[time=2456] The God that got you here is going to get you there.
[time=2460] Because he's not changing, everything around you will change, but he will remain the same, he'll never leave you or forsake you.
[time=2467] Isaiah 43, 18 and 19, this is what it's going to take for you.
[time=2471] It says, don't remember the things of old, forget the former things it says, the stuff in the past.
[time=2478] Behold, I will do a new thing.
[time=2482] Will you not perceive it?
[time=2484] That word perceives not just will you not see it?
[time=2486] It doesn't mean that, but it's so much more than see it.
[time=2489] Will you not embrace it?
[time=2490] Will you not own it?
[time=2491] Will you not accept what I'm doing this new thing in your life?
[time=2496] But to do that, the first verse of that was, don't remember, don't ponder some versions even say the former things.
[time=2502] Forget the things of old because I'm going to do a new thing and then it gets even better.
[time=2506] It says, I'm going to make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.
[time=2511] Some of you are in a wilderness today, some of you are in a desert today and you don't know what tomorrow holds.
[time=2516] And God seems this million miles away.
[time=2518] He seems silent.
[time=2519] You know he has a purpose.
[time=2521] You know he walked a path, but you can't seem to find his plans, but he will make a way in your wilderness.
[time=2528] He will walk you, feed you, nourish you, have compassion for you making rivers in the desert of your life.
[time=2537] He's not done with you.
[time=2538] He's just getting started with you because he's a faithful God who's not finished with you yet.
[time=2544] But so many times we choose familiarity over the faithfulness of God.
[time=2549] Can I give the name in?
[time=2550] We take the steps like the Israelites.
[time=2553] We reach for pornography when what we really long for is intimacy.
[time=2561] We long for a true relationship so we return to familiar abusive relationships.
[time=2570] We long for completion so we reach for the closest next thing or relationship.
[time=2579] And we find that we can't feel complete.
[time=2582] We long for peace, but we reach for control because we think if I can control my life, control the circumstances of the situation that I'm in, surely then I can have peace.
[time=2598] By the way, you know who's sitting right now next to a control freak because they are sitting like this.
[time=2602] They're looking straight forward.
[time=2603] They're going, I ain't saying nothing.
[time=2605] I ain't saying nothing.
[time=2607] How many self-confessing control freaks do we have in the room?
[time=2613] Good for you.
[time=2614] You only did that though because you want to control the situation, we all know.
[time=2621] We all have some control freak in us.
[time=2623] We all want to control because we think if I can control my destiny, then I can control how much peace I can have in the circumstances that I walk through right now.
[time=2632] We become like the Israelites and we long for God, but we reach for gold.
[time=2636] We long for His faithfulness, but we go back to familiarity just because it's comfortable, because we know, because it's something that we've experienced and the unknown scares us to death.
[time=2649] Look at me for a minute.
[time=2650] It's time for fear to no longer grip your life.
[time=2654] Today is that day for you.
[time=2656] And it's time for you to dig in and say fear of the unknown is no longer going to define me.
[time=2661] Jesus is on the throne of my heart and no matter what I'm afraid of, He's already been there.
[time=2667] He's going to be there.
[time=2668] He will never leave me.
[time=2669] He will never forsake me.
[time=2671] I don't want the familiar things.
[time=2672] I want the faithfulness of God who will eliminate fear in my life because I have faith in Him.
[time=2683] It's time to remember how faithful that God is and choose that faithfulness and say something like my hope is built on nothing less.
[time=2690] Then Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[time=2695] You have a Christ in the middle of the crisis that you're in right now.
[time=2700] And I want to submit to you.
[time=2702] I want to challenge you to surrender control to the Christ of your crisis.
[time=2708] That's the best thing you can do when God seems silent.
[time=2712] Let's talk some more about that.
[time=2714] Continuing on the second choice we make is not just faithfulness or familiarity.
[time=2719] It's grace or gaps.
[time=2721] Grace or gaps.
[time=2722] Which are you going to focus on?
[time=2723] Which is going to define you?
[time=2725] God responds there in verse 7.
[time=2727] We already read it.
[time=2728] He responds and says these people are crazy.
[time=2730] He already knew that though, didn't he?
[time=2733] But you know what struck me about this passage?
[time=2735] Because if you read on in Exodus 32, don't think I'm afraid of it.
[time=2738] I know what's next.
[time=2739] I mean people die.
[time=2740] God's wrath was real, folks.
[time=2743] But here's what I thought about as I read this passage.
[time=2746] God knew how messed up these people or these stiff-necked people.
[time=2751] But He never interrupted His plan of grace to still send Jesus all those hundreds of years later.
[time=2760] That, my friends, is grace.
[time=2763] He knew the gaps that were there.
[time=2765] You have plenty of those, don't you?
[time=2767] Here's where I am.
[time=2769] Where I need to be is probably, I don't know, whatever state is that way, three more states.
[time=2775] There's a gap ahead of you.
[time=2777] You've got a big step that you need to take in your life.
[time=2780] And you're consumed sometimes by the gap in your life.
[time=2783] But God says, you know what I'm knowing about that gap?
[time=2785] And I still have grace because I still sent Jesus into this world.
[time=2790] Sometimes we get called up in the gaps of our life and end up kind of like Aaron.
[time=2794] And over back to Exodus 32, I want to skip a few verses, verse 22, verse 22.
[time=2802] This is after Moses had come back.
[time=2804] Now Aaron is Moses' brother.
[time=2806] He was the mouthpiece, if you remember.
[time=2808] Moses said, "God, I can't speak well.
[time=2810] I stutter." And he said, "Well, your brother Aaron will go with you." He could speak pretty well.
[time=2814] This is that Aaron.
[time=2815] Second in command.
[time=2816] That's why they came to him.
[time=2818] Moses came back and he was not real happy.
[time=2821] As you might imagine, and Aaron said to Moses, verse 22, "Let not the anger of my Lord burn little, little L Lord." You're my, my brother is my Lord now.
[time=2830] You know I must have really messed up if I'm calling my brother my Lord.
[time=2834] But he does.
[time=2835] Let, let it not burn hot Moses.
[time=2837] He says, you know, I love this.
[time=2839] You know the people.
[time=2842] You know these knuckleheads.
[time=2844] You know the people that they are set on evil.
[time=2848] There's a couple of things that will happen when you get caught up in the gaps of your life and you're consumed by them.
[time=2853] You'll blame other people.
[time=2854] You shift it to whoever you can.
[time=2856] That's what Aaron's doing.
[time=2857] And then you also become, you not just blame other people.
[time=2859] You become irrational.
[time=2861] Look at verse 24, skip down.
[time=2863] So I said to them, he was telling the story.
[time=2864] This is what they did.
[time=2865] They came to me.
[time=2866] It's their fault.
[time=2867] They're just dumb people.
[time=2868] You know how these dumb people could be, Moses.
[time=2870] So here's what I did.
[time=2871] So I said to them, "Let any of you who have gold take it off so they gave it to me.
[time=2875] I threw it in the fire and out came this calf."
[time=2882] That's literally what he's saying.
[time=2883] You remember what I said, "Fashion with tools." You remember that?
[time=2886] I said, "Underline that." Something in it.
[time=2888] Something ain't right.
[time=2890] It makes you become irrational.
[time=2891] It makes you do dumb things like tell a lie like, "Boom, here comes the calf." Right out of the fire, we threw it in.
[time=2897] And you say, "Well, maybe it really doesn't say all that in the original language." I checked the original language.
[time=2902] You know what it says?
[time=2903] It says that the calf came out of the fire.
[time=2905] That's what Aaron said.
[time=2907] That's not really what happened.
[time=2909] That's what Aaron said.
[time=2910] Those are some of the things that happen when we get consumed by our weakness, by our gaps, by how we don't measure up.
[time=2916] Let me tell you something today, folks.
[time=2918] You might as well put your weakness to work because it's not going anywhere.
[time=2925] You're going to be a human as long as you live on this earth.
[time=2929] The most profound thing you'll hear from Pastor at Black Hawk Ministries today.
[time=2933] You're going to be a human as long as you live on this earth.
[time=2938] And with you will come, guess who?
[time=2942] You.
[time=2943] All of your mistakes.
[time=2945] All of your past.
[time=2948] All of your weakness.
[time=2949] You might as well put it to work because I believe that many times as you read Moses' stories, as you read the story of the Israelites, as you read anyone's story in Scripture, it's my deficiency where I fall short, my gap, my weakness.
[time=2961] My deficiency that eventually God uses to bring me to the destiny that He has for my life.
[time=2967] He works through, Paul says it this way.
[time=2969] For when I am weak, then I am.
[time=2971] Let's do that again.
[time=2972] When I am weak, then I am.
[time=2974] But you've got to start by being weak.
[time=2978] God wants to take your weakness and put it to work because He's not done with you.
[time=2982] And if you'll listen to Him, He'll speak to you where you are, His wrath burned.
[time=2987] But He's still the same God that sent Jesus.
[time=2991] He hates our sin, but He loves us so much as a sinner so much that He moves our title from
[time=2997] sinner to saint.
[time=2999] How many of you know that if you know Jesus, you're not a sinner?
[time=3003] You're a sinner that saved by grace.
[time=3005] Your title's different now.
[time=3007] You've taken on a new name.
[time=3008] You're a saint.
[time=3010] My husband's not a saint.
[time=3012] You should have seen Him yesterday.
[time=3014] You should have seen me.
[time=3015] I don't act like a saint.
[time=3016] You're right.
[time=3017] You don't act like a saint, but you are one, not because of anything you could do, but because of everything He already did.
[time=3023] It's done.
[time=3025] His grace is bigger than your gaps.
[time=3028] And we see that even in this story because He's working to bring Jesus onto the scene so that He can then sit on the throne of your heart and lead you to places, to do things.
[time=3039] To do things that you don't think make sense.
[time=3043] How many of you has God showing you to do something that makes no sense to you today?
[time=3048] And you've been holding off on it.
[time=3050] Or maybe you're just entering into it because you've been hearing this crazy series about this crazy pastor at Black Hawk talking about how God has a purpose.
[time=3057] And He's already walked the path.
[time=3059] And that path will lead you to His plans.
[time=3061] If you walk in God's path, what He's already shown you.
[time=3064] Walk in His ways that are seen in His Word.
[time=3066] He'll lead you in His will.
[time=3067] If you walk in His path, He'll lead you to the plans He has for your life.
[time=3072] You've been hearing that and you're ready to take a step, but you've been holding back.
[time=3076] It's time to take that leap.
[time=3078] It's time to trust Him with that leap.
[time=3080] It's time to put His grace above your gaps.
[time=3083] It's time to follow the faithfulness of God instead of the familiar things in your life.
[time=3088] And for some of you, it could be staying right where you're at.
[time=3090] For some of you, it could be sticking out a relationship that you've been wanting to get out of.
[time=3094] God says to hang in there because I'm not done.
[time=3097] I've got healing.
[time=3098] I've got restoration.
[time=3099] I've got redemption.
[time=3100] I don't know what that means for you today, but He does.
[time=3102] And I want you to know that God speaks to people who listen to Him.
[time=3107] So listen to Him this week.
[time=3109] And what can you do when God seems silent?
[time=3111] Starts with this one thing.
[time=3112] It's in your notes.
[time=3113] Reach for the one who already reached down to you.
[time=3121] You can't reach Him, but He did this.
[time=3125] He put His hand on the ground in the mud, in the dirt.
[time=3133] To say, "I'm going to meet you where you are." So reach for Him.
[time=3136] And you know what you're going to find as you reach for Jesus?
[time=3139] You don't have to reach very far because He's already there.
[time=3144] What else can I do when God seems silent?
[time=3147] A couple of weeks ago, I talked about Joseph and I said, "You need to learn to submit in the pit." You remember that?
[time=3153] I'm going to use that word again.
[time=3154] I think we should also submit in the silence.
[time=3158] We should submit in the silence.
[time=3161] When God seems silent, submit.
[time=3164] That submission is going to lead you to a place of waiting.
[time=3167] Oof.
[time=3169] The P-word patience.
[time=3173] I don't like that word.
[time=3176] It leads you to a place where you can wait.
[time=3182] And it will lead you to a place of surrender and submission.
[time=3187] And God will break that silence in due time.
[time=3191] And He'll meet you right where you are.
[time=3194] Moses delayed coming down the mountain.
[time=3198] The Word of the Lord didn't come in time.
[time=3201] Moses delayed verse 1 of Exodus 32, and for some of you felt for a long time like God's delays
[time=3207] are just a denial that He rejected you.
[time=3211] Hear me.
[time=3212] This is not in your notes, but write this down and wrestle with this this week.
[time=3215] I believe from everything within me that God's delays are not God's denials.
[time=3221] God's delays are not God's denials.
[time=3225] God's refusals.
[time=3226] You ever refused to do something you wanted?
[time=3229] God's refusals are not God's rejections.
[time=3232] His delays are not His denials.
[time=3234] He will still meet you there.
[time=3236] He still has the same grace that brought Jesus to this earth to die on the cross for sin that you and I committed, that sin that separates us from God.
[time=3245] And Scripture reminds us so clearly that if we just will lay our life down before Him turning away,
[time=3252] believing that Jesus died, believing that He rose from the dead, that we shall be saved.
[time=3258] Turn away from trying to save me, that old me, and turn to the Jesus that God sent because His grace is bigger than my gaps.
[time=3267] His faithfulness is better than my familiarity.
[time=3271] I want to ask you to bow your heads for a minute.
[time=3274] Close your eyes and just think about what God's trying to teach you.
[time=3277] In a moment we're going to have a time of communion and just remembering what God is up to.
[time=3282] But somebody's here and you would say that today's the day of my salvation.
[time=3288] I want it to be, I just don't know if it can be, but today God is speaking to you.
[time=3292] Today God is showing you what He has for you.
[time=3295] Today you see salvation in a new light.
[time=3297] Today God is pulling something inside your heart.
[time=3300] Christians, if you know Jesus, pray for such people.
[time=3303] Pray that you too would walk that path that God has for your life, whatever He's challenged you with.
[time=3310] But some of you would say, I don't know that if I were to die today that I have a personal relationship with Jesus
[time=3316] that assures me a spot in heaven, a home beside my Savior.
[time=3320] I would like to think that if I died today I would go there but I don't know.
[time=3324] You can know in this place the Bible says, and why do we say the Bible says?
[time=3329] It's because God says.
[time=3331] God wrote it for you and for me.
[time=3333] It says revelation to us and what He revealed is that He paid a price for your sin and mind that we couldn't pay.
[time=3339] Because Jesus lived the sinless life that you and I could never live.
[time=3343] He died on that cross and He said, Father forgive them because they don't know what they are doing.
[time=3349] And He thought of you.
[time=3351] He went to that tomb that we just sang about in Easter fashion today.
[time=3356] And it was just a borrowed tomb.
[time=3358] He wasn't staying.
[time=3359] Because three days later He walked out of that grave.
[time=3363] The stone was rolled away.
[time=3365] And when He came out of that grave He brought with Him a victory.
[time=3370] A victory that you desperately need.
[time=3373] And I desperately need a victory over our sin, a victory over our separation from God.
[time=3379] And all we have to do is open-handedly receive the gift that He gives so freely.
[time=3387] Will you do that?
[time=3389] Nobody's looking around.
[time=3390] It's just you and Jesus.
[time=3391] If that's you, will you cry out to Him?
[time=3392] You say, I don't have those kind of words.
[time=3394] I can't say it eloquently.
[time=3395] Neither the good Moses.
[time=3398] God doesn't want your eloquence.
[time=3399] He wants your availability.
[time=3402] God wants you to cry out to Him from your heart and ask Him to save you and He will do it today.
[time=3407] Will you reach out to Him right now?
[time=3415] How's the throne of your heart today?
[time=3418] Do you recognize and identify with what we've talked about?
[time=3421] Maybe scooting Jesus over to the side.
[time=3423] Maybe you've been sitting on that throne.
[time=3426] And today God's spoken to you for the first time.
[time=3428] And you feel Him drawing you.
[time=3430] You are part of this extended family we talk about.
[time=3432] And God's been pulling and stretching and convicting and doing something inside.
[time=3436] But today's that day for you.
[time=3438] Just like I talked about.
[time=3439] Here's what I want you to know.
[time=3440] It really is as simple as I've just outlined it to be.
[time=3444] The gospel is so simple.
[time=3445] Even a child can understand it.
[time=3447] Jesus even said, "Unless you become like one of these little children, you can't enter the kingdom of God." So approach Him as a child.
[time=3454] That's how He looks at you.
[time=3455] You're one of His children, one of His family.
[time=3458] And in the throne room of your heart.
[time=3460] If you will just give that throne.
[time=3462] Give that seat to Jesus today.
[time=3464] If you believe He died for you.
[time=3465] You believe He rose again.
[time=3467] That He's alive.
[time=3468] He came out of that grave with you on His mind.
[time=3471] You believe in that.
[time=3472] And then you push yourself off that throne saying, "Jesus, the throne is yours.
[time=3476] I give you me." Not some of me, but all of me.
[time=3479] That's what salvation is all about.
[time=3481] Turning away from you saving you.
[time=3483] Turning to the Jesus who already paid that price and asked Him to do it.
[time=3487] If that's you today, take that step.
[time=3489] Take that leap of faith.
[time=3490] And we here at Blackhawk want to walk alongside you on that journey.
[time=3494] If you need to pause and walk away, go do that now.
[time=3496] If you've taken that step, there's going to be information on your screen.
[time=3499] It's going to be an email address and a phone number where you can reach out to us because we want to hear your story.
[time=3504] We want to get some resources in your hand.
[time=3506] We want to connect you with other people in what we call life groups where you can walk alongside other people who are doing the same journey.
[time=3513] Just like you are.
[time=3514] But there is a resource I want to get into your hands.
[time=3516] And it's called Beginning Steps, a growth guide for new believers.
[time=3519] It looks like this.
[time=3520] It's just a booklet that's going to walk you through what's next.
[time=3523] We believe salvation is not an end.
[time=3525] It's just the beginning.
[time=3527] And so if that's you, if you've taken that step, use the information on your screen.
[time=3531] Let us know what God's doing in your life.
[time=3533] And we will send you one of these in the mail.
[time=3535] You can pick one up here at our church, but we want to hear from you and walk with you.
[time=3539] I also want to invite you to come back next week because we're going to continue this series on recalculating.
[time=3545] I've been hearing story after story about how God has been working in people's lives even through dead ends for us finding God's will.
[time=3553] No matter what recalculating means for you, look at that throne room in your heart.
[time=3557] Make sure Jesus is there and I just assure you that he's going to walk with you and life is going to look totally different when Jesus is on the throne.
[time=3564] See you next week.
