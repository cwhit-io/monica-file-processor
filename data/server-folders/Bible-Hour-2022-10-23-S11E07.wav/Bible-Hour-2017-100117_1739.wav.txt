[time=180] For the spirit of the Lord is here, the evidence is all around, that the spirit of the Lord is here.
[time=201] And God, we just thank you, we thank you, Lord God, because on earth, we can experience a piece of heaven, you say it in your word.
[time=217] So we beg you, we pray to you, Lord God, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[time=226] We just thank you for this time, this beautiful time of worship.
[time=231] We praise you, we love you in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=234] [MUSIC]
[time=261] You're restoring me piece by piece, there's nothing to dirty, that you can make worthy, you wash me in mercy, I am clean.
[time=289] There's nothing to dirty, that you can make worthy, you wash me in mercy, I am clean.
[time=307] What was dead now, lives again, my heart's beating, beating inside my chest.
[time=330] Oh, I'm coming alive with joy and destiny, oh, 'cause you're restoring me piece by piece, there's nothing to dirty, that you can make worthy, you wash me in mercy.
[time=358] I am clean, there's nothing to dirty, that you can make worthy, you wash me in mercy, I am clean.
[time=382] [MUSIC]
[time=387] Washed in the blood of your sacrifice, your blood flow red and made me white, my dirty wrecks are purified, I am clean.
[time=404] Washed in the blood of your sacrifice, your blood flow red and made me white, my dirty wrecks are purified, I am clean, I am clean, oh, washed in the blood of your sacrifice, your blood flow red and made me white, my dirty wrecks are purified.
[time=434] I am clean. I am clean. I am clean. Oh, you wash me. You made me clean.
[time=454] [MUSIC]
[time=460] There's nothing to dirty, that you can make worthy, you wash me in mercy, I am clean.
[time=477] [MUSIC]
[time=488] God, thank you, that we can be clean, there's nothing to dirty, there's nothing to messy, there's no, there's nothing about me, God, that isn't pure in your side, and I just, I just thank you for that, I thank you, that there's nothing that we can ever do,
[time=505] that there's no thing that can ever separate us from you, God, that you reach out to us, that you call us beautiful, that you make us new, and just so grateful for your love, God, we love you, Jesus name.
[time=525] It's been a great morning so far, hasn't it? Getting to look to the future, here at Blackhawk.
[time=535] Part of the reason that we can be so excited about the future is because of what God has already done, and we want to take a few minutes to chat with Kevin and Jessica today because you may remember, a couple of weeks ago, we mentioned that it was the year anniversary of Kevin coming and preaching and us voting him in as our senior pastor.
[time=554] Well, it was one year ago this week that these two escaped the South, packed up, Jessica didn't like that, packed up and moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana, a year ago, and so we wanted to just chat with you guys for a few minutes.
[time=571] What has this last year been like, what has this transition been like for you two?
[time=577] It's been full of stories, full of fun, we upgraded, upgraded is how I like to say it, we went upgraded from the South here to the North, God stretched us, he's grown us, and there's been a lot of stories too, a lot of funny components that we've seen happen too.
[time=594] I know a lot of times people, the second people hear you guys speak, they ask you where you're from. I don't understand that at all.
[time=603] Yeah, I would say like the first minute that you're standing up about to order your food, well me, about to order my food, that's the first question, where are you from, where are you from?
[time=615] And so for a long time I would say Georgia and explain the whole situation, and then Kevin came up with a good, y'all know how he is, he's kind of witty, and so now when they ask we say Fort Wayne, we're from Fort Wayne, Indiana, and then you know eventually get to Georgia, but
[time=632] we'll give it a good pause and they just look at you like, but we did move from Georgia a year ago. Speaking of not looking like you're from Fort Wayne, there's a great story about the snow last year, what happened?
[time=646] Okay, so we knew the day would come last year, last winter, and we had a decent snow as you would say it, but for us Georgia people are big snow, and so we left early, we came together as a family, I can't remember what month exactly when that was, but we drove and we were determined,
[time=661] I knew I would never hear the end of it because of you, if I got stuck on the side of the road or something like that, we left early, got here, determined to find our parking spot, I came in, I found out, have you know we got here and beat almost all of you here too, when we got here, but came in and a church member met me at the door and said, do you drive, is it like a dark blue, you know, Florida freestyle, I said, yes, and I'm thinking, oh man, I missed the parking spot, I couldn't see it, what happened, and he said, I knew it had to be you guys, only people from the south would drive that slow.
[time=690] But we got here, I love it, you can pick them out by the way they drive in the snow, on a serious note, I know that as you guys have made this move to Fort Wayne and to Blackhawk, and over the last year God has been teaching you, God has been growing you, Jessica, what is God showing you through this process, last year through today?
[time=715] The probably number one thing is that God can make family anywhere, we had a year prior to even coming to interview with you guys, I had, I was leading a life group and we were talking about David, which is kind of funny because Kevin's talking about David today, but we were discussing David and she asked us to list out our top fears, and one of my top fears was moving away from family,
[time=744] and what you may not know is we've lived there our whole lives, we had actually just built a house within ten minutes of both sets of grandparents, so that was our life, that's what we thought was going to happen, we were going to raise our babies near their grands, and that was the plan, that was our plan, so for us, it's really taught us since being here, and that's where I want to take a minute to tell you guys, thank you
[time=773] for embracing us and helping us to feel like family, I know we've had many times where we've needed to go out for a dinner or for a meeting and you've taken care of our kids and we've needed to visit Georgia and we've had, you know, people come and take care of our horses and our animals,
[time=790] and so it just really means a lot to us that you would step in and be our family, taking in my kids, the first day we started school, I was terrified, Caleb had already started school, so it was first kindergarten again, and he was sitting beside the only little boy he had known, we had met, you know, a month before, a little Byron Opeliger, and that was like his safety, and I remember just feeling like overwhelmed,
[time=818] like thank you God, that you were just, you know, that was my worry, it was for them, so.
[time=823] And Kevin, you've been taught more about submission, you thought you were already pretty submissive to God, but he has showed you more about submission over the last year.
[time=832] Yeah, you know, one of the things that I've learned through this really is that when we, a little tidbit, I can't help but preach a little bit in that, and I will preach on submission in just a few minutes as a matter of fact, but as if we really look to God and what he wants to show us,
[time=845] he'll reveal areas where we need to fully more engage, open our hands, open our hearts, and that's what God's done in me through this move.
[time=853] I didn't realize, but I have been really good at creating and really driving the environment for my family.
[time=859] We built that house, you know, near our grandparents, but God said, "I want to take you out of that comfort zone where you don't get to control everything that might affect your kids."
[time=868] And so it was tough taking our little babies away from their grandparents and watching them struggle with that, but it's through that that God has taught me, lean on me.
[time=878] So watch me build a family wherever I take you, lean on me and trust and submit to me, and I've got your kids' best interests at heart, and so through that I've gotten to see my little boys start to pray for people because they'll say, "Why did we move?"
[time=890] And I've been able to share with them well because God's calling, because God's asked us to go to this place and tell people about Jesus and be a part of leading his church.
[time=897] And since we've moved here, I've watched God stretch his little heart as an example, and every night he prays and says, "God, help people that don't know Jesus know who he is."
[time=906] And I'm not sure that we'd be praying that prayer had we not taken God up on his offer to move.
[time=912] And I think as a family, we learned a lot about submission. I've shared my thoughts with some of you before on this.
[time=919] During those two years when we were looking for a pastor, like a lot of you, I was getting frustrated wondering what was taking so long, and I remember that first Sunday that Kevin came and preached.
[time=931] He said, "A year ago, I wasn't ready for this. God had to grow me. God had to make me ready for his plan."
[time=941] And I remember sitting right out here in the congregation thinking, "Man, how ridiculous and selfish of me to be caught up in my two years of where's our pastor?"
[time=951] And not realize God had a plan for this place, and God had a man for us, and he had to prepare him, and had to get him right and ready for the right time and the right place.
[time=962] It's exciting that God has done so much here at Blackhawk over the last year. It's just been incredible, and Kevin, I know the future is bright.
[time=971] What do you envision happening? I know we took a big step today with Chip, and what do you think the future looks like here at Blackhawk?
[time=978] Thanks for asking. It excites me to no end. God is just getting started. A lot of times when we go through seasons of waiting, we think that we get to the end of a waiting season, and that's the end, but I'll have you know, it's the beginning Blackhawk family.
[time=993] We're working right now. You're going to be hearing more about even just reaching our area. You heard that even from the stage already today, just our 1-5 zip code. What does it mean to branch out here, but then to build on our mission partners and keep moving forward?
[time=1006] And there's a lot on the horizon, Blackhawk, but here's what I want to ask of you. Continue with open hearts and open hands.
[time=1012] God's humbled. God's brought us to this spot through it. Many ups and many downs, but I want to challenge you with the same humility, the same hunger, the same unity to join me in looking to the future, because God is just getting started.
[time=1029] I'm going to pray for these two, but first, can we thank them for having the guts to follow God's plan to leave their home a year ago and to come join our family?
[time=1046] Will you join me as I pray for Kevin and Jessica in our whole body?
[time=1051] Dear Heavenly Father, you have a plan. We don't always get to know what it is, what it looks like, but I thank you that Kevin and Jessica were true to your calling in their lives, that they listened to you, that they followed your plan.
[time=1075] And as we move forward as a Blackhawk family, I just pray the exact same thing. Lord, that we would keep our eyes fixed upon Jesus, that we would follow your call in our lives, that we would make the name of Jesus known more and more throughout Fort Wayne, throughout Indiana, throughout the United States, and throughout the whole world.
[time=1098] Lord, thank you for blessing this place. Thank you for bringing us, Kevin, as our senior pastor. Thank you for the word that he's about to share with us. Thank you for blessing us so richly.
[time=1112] We ask all of this, and we thank you for all of this in the perfect name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[time=1122] Curtis, thank you to my Blackhawk family. It's humbling to be a part of the plan of God, and I've got news for you. You too are a part of the plan of God.
[time=1133] He has a plan for your life, and that's what we've been looking at, so a very fitting day as we've looked at a lot of recalculation moments from beginning to end today. You no doubt have some of your own.
[time=1145] And that is what I want to talk to you, continue to talk to you about today, and that is recalculating. We're in our seventh week of this series.
[time=1152] If you've missed any of these messages, then I encourage you, go back, check out the messages we've looked at how God has a purpose, a path, and a plan.
[time=1160] We don't get to decide the purpose part. God's already done it. We can't throw it away or harm the purpose of God, but God came and he mapped out a path for us.
[time=1171] His name was Jesus. He walked ahead of us, and then within that is a plan that God has for your life, and we've been looking at people in Scripture, people in the Bible who've learned to recalculate, and so let's continue that discussion.
[time=1183] I can't think of a better character person. We said we're not going to call them characters, though. Why? Because they're real people.
[time=1190] They're historical figures that walk through journeys of recalculating just like us, and today's is David. We're going to look at David. David's played a big role in the recalculations that God's brought about in my life and my family's life, and I believe he's going to in yours as well today.
[time=1206] So look at 1 Samuel. First Samuel, we're going to start in chapter 16, and I want to share from a few different chapters a little bit of the journey of David today about recalculating.
[time=1218] I love David's story because we see the two primary principles I gave to you on day one. If you remember that's been a few weeks since I've shared them with you, so I'll share them with you again.
[time=1228] There are two things we're going to see in every person's story. Number one is that God's will is more about, say it with me if you know it, God's will is more about now than later, and God's will is more about who than what?
[time=1241] Let's say those together. God's will is more about now than later, and more about who than what? And we're going to see that in David's life because there was a big who driving the story of David.
[time=1255] And so let's look there together today, and so we'll see how we can recalculate and find God's will as well.
[time=1262] Let me ask you this, don't you just wish sometimes that God's will was more like Google?
[time=1267] You start typing it in the search engine, and it finishes my sentences. I'm convinced that Google knows my blood type, how many hairs I've got that fell out yesterday, and everything else about my life, and it would just be simple if God's will was more like Google, wouldn't it be?
[time=1281] But it feels more complicated and no doubt some of you came here today wondering, what is my recalculating moment?
[time=1288] How is God going to meet me in the middle of my story, my season, and we've been talking about in this whole series about submission.
[time=1296] A few weeks ago when we talked about Joseph, I said submit in the pit, he ended up in a pit, and Joseph had to learn how to submit from the pit, and then last week we talked about God feeling silent and how we've got to submit even in the silence.
[time=1309] But today I want to talk to you about submitting even when it doesn't make sense, recalculating when it doesn't make sense.
[time=1316] You ever been in those moments, or God poured something into your heart, you knew it was there, but it didn't make sense, you couldn't put all the pieces together?
[time=1324] Well, that's what I want to talk to you about because David's whole life was that very thing.
[time=1329] And so let's look at two things, there's really just two big characteristics that I want to dive into when it comes to David.
[time=1335] And the first is service, and the second is submission.
[time=1339] Service and submission, you can take notes there with me.
[time=1342] I want to say hello to everybody beyond this family, our extended family online.
[time=1346] I also know that our Kenya team, yes, they are still in Kenya serving Jesus, they are eating dinner.
[time=1351] Yes, I said dinner, and they're eating in the evening, no matter whether you call that dinner or supper or whatever you call it.
[time=1358] So Kenya team, I want to say hello to you guys, thank you for serving Jesus, don't lose heart, continue on.
[time=1363] Know that your family is behind you here today, so church family ended a privilege, it would be a part of a going church.
[time=1369] And so today we're going to go through the word together.
[time=1372] First Samuel 16, look there with me, we see service in the life of David.
[time=1377] I want to talk about how he served through a few key areas.
[time=1381] First of all, he served in his waiting, somebody say wait a minute.
[time=1384] Look at somebody say wait a minute.
[time=1386] How many of you don't like the, I call it the P word, patience?
[time=1392] It's a weakness of your pastor for sure.
[time=1395] I don't like being patient, I like knowing, what's ahead, and I like getting there as quickly as possible, but David didn't worship himself, he worshiped God.
[time=1403] And so in 1 Samuel 16, verse 7, some of you came just to hear what I'm about to tell you, you ready for this?
[time=1409] It's just a little side note, it's not even what we're going to read about David and his service, but verse 7 of 1 Samuel 16,
[time=1416] it says the Lord sees not as man sees, man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.
[time=1423] Some of you today feel like you have nothing to offer Jesus, and so it makes no sense to recalculate
[time=1429] and do anything that he asks you to do, but God doesn't look at your ability, he looks at your heart,
[time=1435] he looks at your availability, and that's what we see in David's life.
[time=1439] Samuel is selecting a king, the next king of Israel, and he goes to Jesse's house, and he goes through all of Jesse's sons,
[time=1446] and says don't you have any more sons, and he says yes, there's one more, but it's just David.
[time=1451] It's just David, the little runt of the family out there with the sheep, the outcast,
[time=1458] the one who wouldn't have anything to bring to the table, but God says, you know, I look at the heart, and so he said go and bring him here, and so if you look there in verse 11 of chapter 16 of 1 Samuel,
[time=1470] Samuel says, send and go get him for we will not sit down till he comes here.
[time=1475] I want you to know I don't care what you bring to the table today, and I want you to hear me when I tell you that God has a purpose for your life, and it does not matter how much you don't bring to the table,
[time=1486] put your weaknesses to work, God doesn't need what you bring to the table to begin with, he'll take whatever you have, and people won't even be able to sit down until you step forward into your purpose.
[time=1500] That's the God that we serve. Yes, it applies even to you. Yes, it applies even to King David.
[time=1505] We know him as King David, but he didn't start there, he started as a humble servant, and he ends up being anointed king, does David.
[time=1512] So he's anointed king, but go to verse 19 of 1 Samuel 16. He's anointed king, but he's with the sheet poop.
[time=1521] He's anointed king. I want you to hear me, hear me. If I was anointed king, you better look out.
[time=1531] Not David. I'd be strutting my stuff, saying, hey, go, go, bring him an anointed king, right?
[time=1539] That's what you're thinking, man, I wish I was anointed king. I could call the shots.
[time=1543] Well, David just goes back out to the sheet poop. He just goes back out, and he serves with all of his heart, and you'll see this as a theme, not just in verse 19. Look there with me in verse 19.
[time=1553] This is even later on. Saul is the king currently, and he calls for David.
[time=1557] So no doubt he's heard from Samuel, and Saul's heart would turn against the Lord, but verse 19, Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, send me David your son, who is where? Who is with the sheep?
[time=1569] He's with the sheep, anointed king, but in the field with the sheep. And in verse 22, and Saul said to Jesse, saying, let David remain in my service. There's something special about this guy, David.
[time=1581] He served even while he waited. And you know, a lot of you are like David.
[time=1585] Imagine he was excited about God's promise. Wouldn't you think anointed king? Pretty excited about the promises of God,
[time=1591] but maybe frustrated with his present. Do you think he ever got there? If he's human, I would assume so.
[time=1597] How many of you today would say, I am excited about God's promises, but I'm frustrated with my present situation
[time=1603] and my present season? Some of you are there, and you came in dragging that present situation,
[time=1609] and I want you to know today God's with you in the present situation so much so that you can still sing.
[time=1615] You can still sing, bless the Lord. That song that we sung today came from Psalm 103
[time=1621] written by David, where he says, bless the Lord, oh my soul, forget not all his benefits.
[time=1627] It's my favorite line in that passage. We looked at it just the last couple of weeks.
[time=1631] Forget not all his benefits. So some of you are frustrated with your present today, but God's calling you in your season of waiting to serve him and say, bless the Lord, oh my soul, oh my soul.
[time=1645] Even when it doesn't make sense and life is crumbling, I'll worship his holy name.
[time=1652] Even when my relationships are falling apart, and I don't know where God is at, and he feels a million miles away.
[time=1660] I'll sing like never before, oh my soul, I'll worship his holy name.
[time=1670] How many of you in this place today need to say, bless the Lord, oh my soul?
[time=1677] Even though it doesn't make sense, God, I will worship your holy name.
[time=1682] God, even though everything is crumbling, I'll still sing like never before.
[time=1688] I'll still serve you like never before, even though it makes no sense and I can't seem to find you, I'll still bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[time=1697] I'll still worship your holy name, even when it doesn't make sense.
[time=1701] Even when I can't put the pieces of life together, I'll still sing like never before.
[time=1708] That's what David had to learn to do in his life. I dare you this week not to allow your circumstances to define your praise.
[time=1717] I dare you this week to praise God in the middle of what doesn't make sense in your life and see what he has for you.
[time=1726] Say, bless the Lord, oh my soul. I won't forget your benefits. I won't forget where I've come from and I'll keep moving towards what you have for me.
[time=1734] You know, there's a difference between God showing you something and God owing you something.
[time=1739] God had shown David. He'd anointed him king. But just because God puts a promise, puts an idea, puts a dream on your heart doesn't mean he owes you anything.
[time=1749] Can I get a name, man? We like to thank God owes us sometimes, if we're honest, but I want you to know God doesn't owe me a thing.
[time=1756] I don't bring anything to the table of righteousness.
[time=1759] Scripture says my righteousness is as filthy rags, yet God sent a son who loves us so much to serve us. Jesus got down on his knees.
[time=1770] With a group of people whose righteousness is as filthy rags and he washed their feet, he said I didn't come to be served but to serve.
[time=1782] I'm not entitled to anything. God doesn't owe me anything but he's given me everything.
[time=1790] And I want you to know that if you walk around with a sense of entitlement, as David could have done, entitlement becomes a cancer in the kingdom of God.
[time=1799] Did you know that? Entitlement is a cancer to the kingdom.
[time=1803] He wants a group of worshipers walking around with open hands and hearts saying God you owe me nothing. You've given me everything. So in return I say bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[time=1814] I give you everything that I have and I lay it at your feet.
[time=1819] Serve God through your waiting. Serve God even when it doesn't make sense.
[time=1825] His selflessness, go to verse 17 of chapter 17. Go over one chapter, verse Samuel 17. This is leading up to big Goliath. How many of you've heard that story, right? Some of you may be new but you've probably heard even if you don't know the Bible real well.
[time=1839] You know the story of David and Goliath, the big giant over 9 feet tall who taunted the armies of God and so David is going to enter this picture and that's where life changes for him.
[time=1848] But before that happens, verse 17 of 1st Samuel 17, Jesse, his father said to David his son, take your brothers and e-path of this parched grain and these 10 loaves and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers.
[time=1861] Also take these 10 cheeses to the commander of their thousand. See if your brothers are well and bring some token from them. Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah fighting the Philistines.
[time=1875] The Philistines is the army in which Goliath was kind of the linchpin. He was the man. You didn't mess with Goliath and he had been taunting the armies of Israel, taunting the living God.
[time=1888] So in David, verse 20, rose early in the morning and left the sheet. He was there serving. He was there waiting. He was there being faithful. He still stayed in his role serving the sheep in the midst of sheep poop while still anointed king. But now he's an errand boy.
[time=1906] He left the sheep with a keeper and took the provisions and went just as Jesse had commanded him.
[time=1911] And I want you to know this. We learned this from David. He was faithful in his service and he was an anointed king serving cheese sandwiches.
[time=1921] I want you to know today that no matter what you're anointed to do, you are always anointed to serve.
[time=1931] David got that and he went and he served his brothers and a lot of times as we go through this, we want God to do something new and we think if I can just get to that new thing, maybe that's what God's will looks like for you today.
[time=1945] If I can just get to that new thing, then everything would be new and different. But most of the time you know what I've learned, we won't see a new thing happen when we're not doing that new thing in our old place.
[time=1956] In the new place, the new stuff you want to see happen, if it's not already happening, if you're not already serving in that capacity and pouring your heart into it in the old place, just going to a new place is not going to change anything because it comes right back to our heart of faithfulness and servanthood.
[time=1971] David unknowingly was walking that journey at the time. He was serving God in his old place, waiting for God to do the new thing.
[time=1979] I believe God wants to do a new thing in that old place in your heart today.
[time=1985] What's the old thing that maybe you're trying to get rid of but God keeps pushing you back into it and here you sit and today God wants to do something new in that old place.
[time=1995] Maybe you need to open it up to him, that part that maybe you've closed the door to, that part that you've neglected, the part that maybe it's been hard to trust him and he wants to do something there.
[time=2005] You know, serving a lot of times we think of as a humble thing, we just bend down to one knee, but sometimes serving means fighting.
[time=2012] That's the other thing in David's service. It meant fighting. How many of you know that faith leads you into a fight?
[time=2019] You notice that lately? Has your faith felt like a fight?
[time=2024] Well, David understood how much of a fight his faith would be. David knew what it meant to fight for his faith and that leads us to the story of Goliath just before that happens.
[time=2034] He had been talking to all the people who had listened about, well, who's going to do something about this Philistine, this Goliath who's taunting the living God?
[time=2041] Who's going to shut him up? Who's going to do something about that?
[time=2044] You know God's big enough to take care of that, right? And then everybody shut him down and I love in verse number 30 of 1 Samuel 17 and he turned away from him toward another and spoke in the same way and the people answered him again as before.
[time=2060] They kept saying, "You just go take your cheese sandwiches somewhere, David. We got this. Let the big boys handle Goliath."
[time=2067] But he kept going from one to the next. He wouldn't leave it alone because God had put something inside of him and it's time for that fight to come out, I think, in your life because faith leads you into a fight.
[time=2078] Faith is not defensive. Faith is offensive. Faith is not passive. Faith is aggressive. It takes over. It consumes who you are.
[time=2088] It moves into your home, into your workplace and into your life in ways that you just can't stop if you follow Jesus Christ.
[time=2097] And that's what God had put inside of David. Look at verse 34. David goes to Saul saying, "We got to do something about this Goliath."
[time=2105] And he says, "This is one of my favorite parts of this passage. Love the story of David and Goliath." But David said to Saul, "Your servant used to keep sheep for his father." He used to, right? He's looking to the future, but he's still doing it.
[time=2118] He's still serving. I love that that's there. Keep sheep for his father. "And when there came a lion or a bear and took a lamb from the flock, I went after him and struck him and delivered it out of his mouth."
[time=2130] You thought David was a wimp, didn't you? "And if he arose against me, I caught him by his beard and struck him and killed him."
[time=2139] "Your servant has struck down both lions and bears, and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them."
[time=2148] This will preach folks. Get ready because it's coming. "For he has defied the armies of the living God."
[time=2155] And David said, "The Lord who delivered me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine."
[time=2165] Hear me folks, when I tell you, there's some lions and bears in your life that are trying to seek you out and devour you.
[time=2171] You've got an enemy who's trying to tear down the promises that God is building and putting into your life and into your destiny
[time=2179] and into the plans that he has for you that are in accordance to his purpose and his path.
[time=2184] You've got an enemy who wants to do nothing more than to rip to shreds what God is building today.
[time=2190] You have some lions. You have some bears. Maybe it's pornography that sneaks in.
[time=2196] It sneaks in when you think nobody's looking. Maybe it's greed that's causing you to work all those extra hours saying it's just for your family.
[time=2204] Maybe it's that person you're talking too much to online and you know you need to scale back because it's going to tear your marriage apart.
[time=2210] Maybe it's that sin that you just can't quite get rid of. Today is the day for killing some lions and bears.
[time=2217] Today is the day where we like David can know in the middle of our trials, in the middle of things that don't make sense, that God's preparing me.
[time=2226] How many of you know that God was preparing David for Goliath? If you keep reading, do you know the end of the story?
[time=2232] Does Goliath squash David with one small stone, this giant falls to the ground at the hands of this one little wimpy David,
[time=2242] who's an anointed king but can't even be king is in the sheep field with the sheep poop.
[time=2248] That's the God that we serve. But what I love about this part of the story is that David looked at Goliath and he didn't see Goliath.
[time=2255] You with me? He didn't see Goliath. He saw an opportunity for his past victories over the lions and the bears of his life to translate into something even bigger.
[time=2265] He saw how God was preparing him through his trials, through his service, through his waiting, through his fighting with the lions and bears of his life and instead of seeing a Goliath that felt like a giant he could never take down.
[time=2278] He saw all of his past victories and said, "Bless the Lord, O my soul, forget not his benefits, the same God who delivered me from the lions and bears will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine."
[time=2291] He's nothing compared to my God. You know what you need to know though? David's God is also your God.
[time=2304] And I know you're in a season where you wish you had more, you wish you understood more, maybe it doesn't make any sense, but God is preparing you in your trials for the triumphs that he wants to bring about later in your life.
[time=2320] God is preparing you, walking you through, standing beside you to give you victories in this season so that he can have you ready for the victories in the next season.
[time=2331] But sometimes the victories in the next season may mean some downward steps, some downward trends, some losses, things you don't see as victories.
[time=2339] That's the beauty of our God. Even the things we think are failures and losses God can turn around just like Joseph said, "You meant it for evil, but my God meant it for good, the things that feel like failures, God can take them and make them victories that prepare you for what's next."
[time=2356] How many of you've got a lion or a bear in your life right now? And it's time to take it down.
[time=2361] It's time for a fight. Faith has led you into a fight, and you know what, I want to challenge you, don't go into the fight by yourself.
[time=2369] David didn't go into the fight with Goliath with a few rocks.
[time=2374] He knew that there was a God who was going to propel that rock in ways that he could never do on his own.
[time=2380] He knew that there was a God who could make sure that rock he could flick it over with the thought of his mind right into the temple, right into the head of this Goliath
[time=2389] that was taunting the armies of the living God and take him down, and that's exactly what happened.
[time=2394] Maybe your lion and bear is self-doubt, self-condemnation.
[time=2400] Somebody's here today, and you've been condemning yourself. You don't even need other people to condemn you because you do a plenty good enough job of that on your own.
[time=2409] I want you to know in this place today there's a Jesus who loves you, and in him there's no condemnation.
[time=2418] You're clean.
[time=2420] There's nothing. There's nothing that my God can't make clean.
[time=2427] He can take your worse and do his best.
[time=2432] He can take your broken pieces and make you whole.
[time=2436] I have a heart for somebody in this place today that came in carrying self-condemnation and doubt you have a David in you too.
[time=2445] God sees you and he sees nothing different in you than he saw in David.
[time=2450] Maybe it's time to serve. Why you wait?
[time=2454] Maybe it's time to serve through selfless sacrifice.
[time=2457] Maybe it's time to serve through a fight.
[time=2460] It's time to kill some lions and bears because your Goliath is waiting.
[time=2464] How many of you have ever seen this when we put it on the screen?
[time=2466] A little gray box that came out depending on your generation. It will mean different things to you.
[time=2471] I'll never forget when that bad boy came out called the Nintendo.
[time=2475] A little gray box that changed the world.
[time=2477] I love Mario. Mario was my favorite.
[time=2480] I became a Mario master.
[time=2482] Far from it now.
[time=2484] What would happen is you go into this game and you see this little universe that's right here and you see a little mushroom coming to you.
[time=2491] He's waddling to you and you can tell he doesn't look real nice but you don't really know what to do when you start the process.
[time=2497] And so you walk up to him to say hi and then there you go.
[time=2501] You have to start over and you say well I got to do something different this time.
[time=2504] So you back up and there comes the same little mushroom and you say well I'm just going to push a button and you get over here and then you.
[time=2511] He's gone.
[time=2513] Then you hit this little box and another mushroom pops out of the box and you go to that mushroom a little skeptical because the other one just killed you but then you go to that mushroom and it makes you bigger and you grow.
[time=2523] And you learn what to do you can slide under stuff.
[time=2527] You know when you're too tall to fit under it you can run and slide and duck and you can slide under barriers in your life and you learn all these things but Mario will tell you that each level gets harder.
[time=2536] Can I get a name in?
[time=2539] Every level gets harder. The boss of one level is nothing compared to the boss of the next level.
[time=2544] One level might have a lion or a bear but the next level may have goliath.
[time=2549] But God just like Mario will tell you just like David will tell you God will meet you in whatever season you are in and he will take those things that don't make sense.
[time=2559] The little victories that you win in this level to take you to the next level.
[time=2563] He's preparing you now in this season for the victories he wants to bring about in the next season.
[time=2569] Mario will tell you it gets harder and harder just like David new levels new devils you with me.
[time=2577] Every time you follow Jesus in your faith a little deeper things seem to get a little harder sometimes it's time to pick a fight.
[time=2584] It's time to serve in the midst of what doesn't make sense in your life.
[time=2588] The second thing is submission flip over to 1 Samuel 24 1 Samuel 24.
[time=2594] This is a little ways later David's defeated goliath okay he's dead life changed for David.
[time=2602] It took a big turn things really took off for the kingship of David and Saul has grown jealous of David who was the king of Israel at the time and has set out to kill David.
[time=2612] First it was lions then it was bears then it was giants and now it's kings and they were coming after David's life and he's running and he's in a cave and so let's pick it up there where he's in this cave.
[time=2623] Verse number one a first Samuel 24 who's ready for some more of the word.
[time=2628] You guys with me that was a week who's ready for some more.
[time=2631] When Saul returned from following the Philistines he was told behold David is in the wilderness of in Getty and Saul took 3,000 chosen men out of all Israel and went to seek David he wasn't going to give him a hug either.
[time=2645] He's coming trying to kill him he's pursuing David and his men in front of the wild goats rocks this is important we'll come back to where this is in a minute.
[time=2654] And he came to the sheep fold somebody say sheep folds that represents something big in David's life we'll come back there by the way when there was a cave and Saul went in to relieve himself.
[time=2665] Scholars are split you know you say is this in the Bible I think it makes for much more of a fun story if it's like it sounds that he went into the cave to use the potty.
[time=2675] Is that a good G-rated version some would say the word actually means cover his feet which could mean that or it could mean he took a nap but I kind of prefer to say he went in to use the potty but either way scholars are split on that you can decide for yourself because it doesn't really matter the point is that Saul is vulnerable.
[time=2692] Right verse 4 now David and his men were sitting in the innermost parts of the cave and the men of David said to him here's the day of which the Lord said to you behold I will give your enemy into your hand and make note of this next part we're coming back to it too and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.
[time=2710] Then David arose stealthily and stealthily I love that word stealthily what does that look like.
[time=2718] Stealthily cut off this is so huge cut off a corner of Saul's robe and afterward David's heart struck him as he knew something was wrong.
[time=2728] He stealthily cut a corner off of his robe and his heart struck him because he cut a corner of Saul's robe and he said to his man the Lord forbid that I should do this thing to my Lord little El meaning King Saul the Lord's anointed.
[time=2739] To put out my hand against him seeing he is the Lord's anointed so David persuaded his men with these words and did not permit them to attack Saul and Saul rose up and left the cave and went on his way and what you'll see in the next verse it says
[time=2755] after where David also arose and went out of the cave and called after Saul my Lord the king he said well that be what you do if somebody was trying to kill you and you just spared his life and Saul looked behind him David bowed with his face to the earth and paid homage
[time=2774] and God began to do something there in that moment but I want to talk about how we got to that moment for a few minutes because it's all about submission to what God was up to in this moment inside the cave was Saul get this track with me for a minute
[time=2787] inside the cave was Saul that represented what David was called to he's the king David's anointed king so inside the cave is Saul represents what David's called to outside the cave you notice it was the sheep folds
[time=2800] David came from taking care of those sheep outside the cave was sheep which represented where David had come from inside the cave what I'm called to outside the cave where I'm coming from did you know that what you're called to is so much more important than where you've come from?
[time=2816] and David got that but let me tell you that sounds good and we like that but there's something even more important than that more important than where you've come from more important than what you are called to and that's how you get there
[time=2829] and that's what David pauses and says you know what it matters how I get to the place you know you can get the right thing the wrong way
[time=2837] David says I'm not going to cut corners his heart struck him he could have stabbed him and done away with Saul his nemesis his giant his problem he'd seen God deliver giants into his hand but he said you know what I'm not here to cut corners
[time=2851] I'm not here he cut a corner of the robe and then so doing cut a corner that God wasn't ready for him to cut he took a shortcut did you know that submission eliminates shortcuts
[time=2865] I figured it'd be quiet when I said that one when you're submitted to Jesus it eliminates the shortcuts that we often like to take in our life
[time=2875] submission eliminates shortcuts you can go about the right thing the wrong way did you know that how you get there matters you can get into a fight on Facebook because you're right and they're wrong
[time=2887] and you might very well be right but you can't fight hate with hate or ignorance with ignorance we're called as the church to do things the right way to get there to go for the right things not the wrong ways but the right ways
[time=2901] the godly ways to take steps that are ordered by God as David writes about and you know sometimes even as a parent I'll try to correct behavior but I'll find that I'll have a tendency to correct behavior by demonstrating the very behavior that I'm trying to correct
[time=2918] can I get a name and don't act like that's just me come on now it's like we don't want you to raise your voice but it's like please just be quiet right I don't do that you probably do I would never do that you ever notice that about us
[time=2933] because it's quicker why would we just raise our voice because it's faster it's a shortcut but God says I don't want you to cut corners I want you to follow after me with service and submission because it eliminates shortcuts David wasn't known or characterized
[time=2947] by his supremacy as king he was known and characterized by his service and his submission he said the answer is yes Lord now what's the question I want God's will God's way what's the mantra of David somebody needs to hear that today I don't want just God's will
[time=2964] I want God's will God's way that means he's going to order my steps establish my steps David wrote later in his life Psalm 37 verses 23 and 24 that the Lord establishes
[time=2976] or orders my steps now a lot of times we think well God was in that step because it was an upward one like this we're like well God was in that step
[time=2984] yeah things are really looking up but sometimes steps look like this don't they
[time=2992] and sometimes we cut corners and get things out of order and when we do that we fall flat on our face if you ever fell down on your face going up steps
[time=3003] but I want you to know that sometimes God is in these steps yes but sometimes God's in these two when you feel like life's going down when you feel like your relationship is crumbling when it doesn't make sense
[time=3018] God's in those steps just as much as he's in the ones when things come together when it starts to make some sense when our relationship starts to mend and healing and restoration takes place
[time=3031] but then in the middle of that you lose somebody you get a bad diagnosis he orders establishes the steps of those who follow him and submit to him so whether you're going up
[time=3045] whether you're going down your steps are ordered your steps are established the same God of David walks with you doesn't matter what those steps look like when we say God I submit to you I want your will your way
[time=3059] I don't just want your will I want your will your way God my confidence is not in the ability of my feet but in the stability of your hand
[time=3069] somebody needs to pray that to God this week God my confidence is not in the ability of my feet but in the stability of your hand today just like David prayed and like David went after God
[time=3080] you know what I've learned about God he will always honor his promises and because God will honor his promises my plea my charge my anthem for all of us is that because God will honor his promises I will honor the process
[time=3094] some of you want to honor God and his promises but the process has been a little bit challenging it's time to honor the process that God has you in and follow him no matter what write this down if you're taking notes a lot of times we don't like serving our purpose
[time=3111] because the promises just don't seem to be readily available to us and it's in your notes when I serve my purpose and submit to God's path I'll be surrounded by God's plan
[time=3125] that's my challenge to you this week is that we could do just that but a lot of times we ask God for confirmation before we take steps of obedience can I get an amen
[time=3134] we say God show me what I'll get out of this if I take this step of obedience but I want you to know in this moment in this season that doesn't make sense in your life today that your confirmation awaits your obedience
[time=3147] we serve and submit to a Jesus who already laid everything down for you a lot of times we'll say God I'll forgive them if you'll give me the grace to do it and they ask me to
[time=3158] but God says no forgive them and I'll give you the grace and it won't matter whether or not they ask that's the God we serve that's the serving of our purpose and the submission to
[time=3171] his plan his path that he's walked out that will leave us surrounded no matter what season you're in surrounded by his plans that he wants to bring about in your life
[time=3180] you know what I've learned about submission submission gives me permission to sing in any season
[time=3189] submission gives me permission to sing in any season, bless the Lord oh my soul oh my soul sing it with me worship his holy name
[time=3205] I'll sing like never before oh my soul I'll worship your holy name
[time=3219] we bow your heads close your eyes for a minute in this place are you ready to sing in your season today God wants to meet you right where you are if you know Jesus today even though you have a hundred reasons not to sing
[time=3232] you have ten thousand reasons to let it fly because God's with you because the same God of David who delivered him from the paw of the lion the paw of the bear
[time=3241] Goliath's king Saul all those things that were after him to tear him down the same God is in your life the most important thing that will happen is right now in this room
[time=3251] all heads bowed all eyes closed will you pause right now if you don't know Jesus most important thing Christians if you know Jesus ask God to deliver you from those lions and bears
[time=3262] take those steps of faith the steps of service the steps of submission that we see in David's life but somebody's here most important thing that's going to happen is that you're here and you don't know about your eternity
[time=3273] you would say if I were to die today pastor I hope that I would be in heaven with God because I have a personal relationship with Jesus but if you were to ask me if I know that
[time=3282] I want you to know in this place in this moment guys ready to meet you if you want to know that you've been playing around with that it's time to stop playing it's time to take that leap of faith in this place today I want you to know that Jesus is ready to meet you where you are how
[time=3297] it's the beauty of the gospel gospel just means good news because it's already happened Jesus already died on the cross he lived a sinless life you could never live
[time=3306] you know your sin separates you from God we all have that we say well I'm not David well David had sin he's a murderer
[time=3316] no matter where you're at Jesus is ready to meet you there he lived that sinless life you couldn't live he died that death paying the price you couldn't pay on that cross and while you're on his mind you're on his mind think about that you're on his mind
[time=3333] while he hung on that cross then he went into a grave and he came out of that grave with a victory so many times in this life we feel like we're fighting for a victory but I want you to today fight from the victory
[time=3344] that's been won and if that's you if you would say I don't know that I know Jesus you say well leave me in that prayer I'm not going to lead you in a prayer because I believe your heart screaming at crowd to Jesus ask him to save you ask him to forgive you
[time=3359] and that gap that's between you and God because of your sin will be bridged by the cross of Jesus you'll be made clean because of his sacrifice we crowd him right now no matter where you're at if you're online if you're in this building stop with him
[time=3373] in this building stop what you're doing and cry out to Jesus we do it right now maybe that's you maybe life doesn't make sense maybe recalculating doesn't make sense maybe you're in that season much like David where service and submission really starts to mean something different maybe it looks like change in your life
[time=3397] maybe you're uncomfortable with but perhaps you're in that boat that we've been talking about where the gospel is that change where the good news about Jesus Christ is what you need to embrace what you need to serve what you need to submit to as we've looked at
[time=3412] even today if that's you my heart for you is that you would not hold back that you would not let fear that you would not let circumstances that you would not let even the things that don't make sense hold you back any longer don't feel like you've got to get things straight get things
[time=3427] figured out before you take a leap of faith with Jesus because I want you to know if you wait on that that day will never come as people we're just a mess as people we struggle we need Jesus in the middle of our mess and that's the beauty of the gospel
[time=3441] is Jesus entered the middle of the mess entered the fray and came in and through our faith he will save your soul he will save you give you an eternal home with him in heaven when you die but it's so much bigger than that it's not just a fire insurance for eternity
[time=3456] it meets you in the middle of the mess in the middle of life today Jesus said that he came so that we could have life but to have it more abundantly that abundant life can start for you in this place in this moment in this season even if it doesn't make sense logically
[time=3472] and rationally in your mind today that's what God wants to do in your heart take that leap of faith and if you have taken it if you're contemplating taking that step let us know reach out to us you're going to see some information some of our information
[time=3484] and phone number email address on your screen here in just a moment and we want to hear from you want to hear your story what's God shown you what does he taught you what step have you taken maybe it's to be baptized
[time=3495] maybe you need to take that step we'd love to host you and your family and your friends here at Blackhawk and baptize you how great would that be as a part of our extended family you could come and join our family together and take that next step in your faith
[time=3508] but no matter what that step has looked like for you today and we want to get a resource in your hand it looks like this beginning steps a growth guide for new believers just a small little book was seven steps that will walk you through what's next
[time=3519] and in this book you're going to find how you can be sure of salvation what is baptism how do I engage in my faith through prayer and Bible study and those kinds of things but this is just a beginning point for you it's not an end it's the beginning of a brand new life
[time=3535] we're excited to walk along that journey walk beside you with you and be around you and every way you'll allow us in the days ahead so thank you for tuning in today pray that you've been blessed I pray that God has spoken some new life breathe some new faith into your journey
[time=3550] and we're looking forward to all that he has ahead we're going to continue recalculating next week so be back let's keep recalculating finding God's will even when it doesn't make sense even when there are dead ends
[time=3562] let's serve let's submit just like David see you next week
[time=3592] you
