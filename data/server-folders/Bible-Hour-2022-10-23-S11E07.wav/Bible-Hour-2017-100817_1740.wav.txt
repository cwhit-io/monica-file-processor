[time=292] There's a place where mercy reigns and never dies.
[time=303] [MUSIC]
[time=307] There's a place where streams of grace low deep and wide.
[time=317] [MUSIC]
[time=320] Where all the love I've ever found comes like your flood,
[time=329] comes flowing down.
[time=336] At the cross, at the cross, just to render my life.
[time=343] I mean all you.
[time=350] Where your love ran red, and my sin washed white.
[time=356] I walk to you.
[time=359] I walk to you, please.
[time=365] [MUSIC]
[time=373] There's a place where sin and shame are powerless.
[time=383] [MUSIC]
[time=386] There's my heart that speaks with God and forgiveness.

[time=413] At the cross, at the cross, just to render my life.
[time=419] I mean all you.
[time=425] Where your love ran red, and my sin washed white.
[time=432] I walk to you.
[time=439] I hear my hope is found here, unholy ground.
[time=446] Here I go down.
[time=452] Here I'm hoping white here.
[time=457] You say my life.
[time=459] Here I go down.
[time=465] At the cross, at the cross, just to render my life.
[time=472] I mean all you.

[time=536] You say my life.
[time=539] Here I go down.
[time=541] Here I go.
[time=544] At the cross, at the cross.
[time=547] I surrender my life.
[time=550] I mean all you.
[time=557] Where your love ran red, and my sin washed white.
[time=563] I walk to you.
[time=589] And I can see the disciples right now.
[time=593] Jesus had just passed away.
[time=599] And then they're sad, they're hiding away.
[time=601] But the story goes is Mary get to the grave.
[time=607] And there's an angel there that says, look, he's no longer here.
[time=611] And she goes and tells her the disciples.
[time=614] She's excited.
[time=616] Maybe a little bit worried like where's he at?
[time=620] Goes against the disciple.
[time=621] And the Bible says that John and Peter went on a mad dash.
[time=626] And Peter, though, was a little bit slow.
[time=628] But he gets there.
[time=630] And it confirms this thing that they had heard, Jesus said, maybe a little bit of doubt.
[time=635] But they heard him say, I will be back.
[time=640] So they get to the tomb, his garment is folded neatly.
[time=647] And in their mind, they knew he lives.
[time=651] There was a little bit of fear there.
[time=652] And I think what they were really said is because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[time=659] Because he lives, all my fears are gone.
[time=664] Because I know, I know, he holds my future.
[time=670] And my life is worth a living just because he lives.
[time=681] Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[time=693] Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[time=706] Because I know, I know, he holds the future.
[time=719] And my life is worth a living just because he lives.
[time=729] Sing it with me.
[time=731] Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[time=744] Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[time=757] Because I know, I know, he holds the future.
[time=770] And my life is worth a living just because he lives.
[time=787] Here I am, down on my knees again, surrendering law, surrendering law.
[time=807] Find me here, Lord, as you draw me.
[time=817] Find me here, just before you, I'm desperate for you.
[time=827] I surrender, I surrender, I want to know you, Lord.
[time=842] I want to know you, Lord.
[time=847] Change my soul as mercy and grace on both the hunger and those, the hunger and those.
[time=870] With arms straight wide, I know you hear my cry, speak to me now, speak to me now, I surrender.
[time=893] I surrender, I want to know you, Lord, I want to know you, Lord.
[time=937] Like a rushing wind, Jesus breathing, Lord, have your way, Lord, have your way in me.
[time=964] Like a mighty soul, sir, within my soul, Lord, have your way, Lord, have your way in me.
[time=980] Like a rushing wind, Jesus breathing, Lord, have your way, Lord, have your way in me.
[time=999] Like a mighty stormy soul, sir, within my soul, Lord, have your way in me.
[time=1018] Lord, have your way, Lord, have your way, Lord, have your way in me, Lord, I surrender, I surrender, I want to know you, Lord.
[time=1044] I want to know you, Lord, I surrender, I surrender, I want to know you, Lord.
[time=1064] I want to know you, Lord, we thank you, we thank you, Lord God, that we have a God that we wake up to each and every morning with new grace, new mercy.
[time=1083] Because we've surrendered our lives to you, we understand we won't get this thing all the way right, but we have a God that we can surrender to, a God who will take control.
[time=1094] A God who will recalculate, a God who will show us the way, a God who will never leave us alone, and we thank you for that, Lord, Jesus.
[time=1103] As we can turn on our spiritual GPS, we ask that you just continue to recalculate in our lives as we surrender to you.
[time=1111] In Jesus' name we pray, thank God, amen.
[time=1117] You can be seated today, thank you for worshiping with us, we're blessed, aren't we? We're a blessed people and it's a relevant topic for us to be discussing right now this thing we're calling recalculating.
[time=1130] And so if you're a guest with us, thanks for tuning in, thanks for coming, thanks for allowing us to have a little time in your week, for those of you watching us online as well, our extended family, we see you.
[time=1141] You see us, but we see you too, we have a big family here at Black Hawk and it's an honor to be a part of all the stuff that God is up to and doing in our midst.
[time=1149] So if you've got your Bibles, look at the book of Esther.
[time=1152] Now it's a book that may be hard to find, it's the 17th book of your Old Testament, you can go to your table of contents, we want to give you some extra time to find that.
[time=1161] We're going to be looking at the story of Esther, we're going to talk about her journey and how she had to, as we do, recalculate.
[time=1170] And so today's topic is really all about recalculating when I face big decisions, can I get a name in?
[time=1179] How many of you would be honest and say right now there's a decision that's rolling around your head that you need to make, would you raise your hand and be honest?
[time=1187] Wow, all over the building and those of you who didn't raise your hands, can I tell you a little secret?
[time=1192] One's coming, you've got one that's right around the corner, maybe you just got out of one and you're saying God leave me alone for just a little while.
[time=1202] You ever done that before? Just give me that quiet little season, but they don't last very long because life is full of decisions and you know what I'm finding as I look around and I watch the news today?
[time=1213] I believe that this is an extremely relevant time and season in the state of our nation, in the state of our world for the church to make godly decisions.
[time=1228] And if you didn't raise your hand, I'm guessing you may have a social media account.
[time=1233] Have you noticed that those posed decisions every day?
[time=1236] You ever gotten those emails or seen the comment on social media and you talk...
[time=1242] Don't act like you don't do that too. You know what I'm talking about. You type the mean comment and then you hit backspace and you type it again and you go, man, that's just as mean as the first one and you hit backspace.
[time=1252] Sometimes you click send though, don't you? Sometimes you go, you try to pull it back in, but it is too late.
[time=1260] I want you to know, I believe no matter where you stand on all of the divisive topics and boy, they are many today, aren't they?
[time=1268] No matter where you fit into all of those discussions on your social media feeds or how you feel about this on the news or that on the news, you know one thing that I know is true.
[time=1277] God wants his church to stand out and be Jesus and be a light in the darkness because we're making godly decisions.
[time=1287] I know that to be a fact and I know that we serve a god who can help us do that and sometimes it means you'll have to recalculate.
[time=1295] Esther gives us a great picture of that. I want to give you a little of the background of the story.
[time=1299] Certainly can't cover all of these chapters in the book of Esther today, but I want to give you a glimpse of the overall story.
[time=1306] So this setting is in modern day Iran in about 483 BC. At that time it was called Persia, the Jewish people, the people of God about whom we've been learning in this series, every character, every person.
[time=1319] We said that we're going through the people of scripture, the men and the women of the Bible to look at principles about how they recalculated, how they found God's will in the midst of life's dead ends.
[time=1331] And so within that story we've learned about the people of Israel. If you notice something about them that I see in them and I see in me, they make a lot of mistakes.
[time=1342] Can I get a name in? It's okay, we're a real church. We acknowledge mistakes. People often say I don't go to church because it's full of hypocrites.
[time=1351] You know what I say, right? Come on, one more won't hurt.
[time=1357] Because we're all that. We all struggle. We all make poor decisions. The Israelites were no exception to that rule. They're in exile. They've left their homeland, in part because of a lot of these decisions that they make, but they're in exile.
[time=1370] They're away from their homeland, and so they've been captured. They're refugees, if you will. They've been in refugees. They've been exiled for around 100 years at this point.
[time=1379] And in your Bibles you'll see the name King Lazarus or Xerxes, same person. That's who the king is at this time. Now he is following King Darius.
[time=1391] He was his predecessor and he had defeated Nebuchadnezzar. Now you say, well that means nothing to me. It means a lot to the Jews and to their history.
[time=1399] And so King Nebuchadnezzar is the one who had captured all of these people.
[time=1403] You may remember the story of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego being thrown in the fiery furnace.
[time=1407] Daniel refusing not to pray and praying and being thrown into the lions den. That's the era that we're looking at now.
[time=1414] But this king got drunk one night. And here's the setting to the story.
[time=1419] And he wanted to parade his wife, the queen, Queen Vashti in front of all of his buddies.
[time=1424] And he wondered if scholars debate on what he was asking of her, but whatever it was, she didn't like it.
[time=1429] And she told the king, no. And so following that he became sober and all of his buddies said, you need to put your foot down
[time=1436] or everybody else is going to think it's okay to tell the king, no.
[time=1440] And so he banishes Vashti. She's no longer the queen. He sends her away. Now enter Esther.
[time=1447] You'll see her name as well, same person. She enters the story when the king is looking for his new queen.
[time=1454] Now that process was kind of a scandalous start to this story.
[time=1458] A lot of times we try to paint it as something pretty, but it was not.
[time=1462] Esther came from the Jews. She was of the nation of God.
[time=1468] Now she entered this equation, scholars debate on whether or not she was forced to enter the contest, if you will,
[time=1474] for who will become the next queen, but they scoured the nation, brought in candidates, if you will, for this new position.
[time=1481] And they paraded them in front of the king and ended up going in and sleeping with the king.
[time=1486] That's what this process would have looked like. A lot of times we miss it.
[time=1489] This is scandalous start to the story, but that's how Esther enters this equation.
[time=1494] She's an orphan. She had no mother or father, and she was raised by her uncle named Mordecai.
[time=1500] He's in this story, we're going to read some of his comments in a little bit, but she eventually is made known by her uncle Mordecai,
[time=1509] that Haman, the right-hand man to the king, is planning to exterminate the people of God.
[time=1516] And she is used by God to save her people, this lowly little orphan girl.
[time=1523] She had to make some big decisions to get there, some life or death decisions.
[time=1527] And so that's what we're going to look at today, but before we do, I want to tell you really the heart of this story is that a single, courageous decision can be the turning point of something extraordinary.
[time=1541] That's in your notes. We have a lot of ways for you to take notes.
[time=1543] You can just pretend like you are, no one will know the difference.
[time=1546] You've got something. When you came in, you can use our app, we have the blanks in there, or you can use whatever you'd like, but that's your first point that really is the driving thought. And here's what I know about you.
[time=1556] You say, man, that's so true. A single, courageous decision in the Bible can change everything, right?
[time=1561] You look at Moses, he faced Pharaoh. You look at Abraham, he left everything he knew to follow what God had for him, and a nation was born.
[time=1570] You look at Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. They decided I'm not going to bow to the king, and therefore were thrown into the fiery furnace, but there weren't three in the furnace.
[time=1579] There were four in the furnace because God was there with them, and they didn't get consumed by the fire.
[time=1585] You look at a Daniel who refused not to pray to his God and gets thrown in a lion's den, and God shut the mouths of the lions because that's the God we serve.
[time=1596] And here's the thing, we say amen, and that feels good, and it pumps us up a little bit, but there's something deep on the inside of us when it comes to those little courageous decisions that makes us go, yeah, but.
[time=1608] Right? Yeah, but I'm not going to go face Pharaoh. Yeah, but I'm not going to be a king, I'm not going to lead the, face the Midianites in battle in the middle of the night with a lamp.
[time=1622] I just don't think you're going to do that, right?
[time=1625] Then, you know, we say there's this gap that's there, and you know, by the way, if your fiancee terms up pregnant like Mary, it's probably a different story for you than it was for Joseph and Mary, huh?
[time=1637] And we feel like there's a gap between me and them.
[time=1644] The them are those people in the Bible, and me is the little old me that I couldn't do the things that they all did.
[time=1652] But I know something else about you, and that's that God's working in your life just like he was working in theirs.
[time=1659] That they are just normal, ordinary people just like you, and that God wants to, in the middle of your decisions, leverage you for his kingdom and for his glory.
[time=1670] The same God of Esther is the same God who's your God in this place today.
[time=1677] And he's just getting started with you, he's not done with you yet, and so we're going to look at what that looks like.
[time=1682] Proverbs 16, 9 reminds us that the heart of man plans his way, but the Lord establishes his steps.
[time=1689] Your decisions matter, people.
[time=1691] Your decisions, they matter.
[time=1693] Big, small, everything in the middle.
[time=1695] Every little decision informs your destiny, takes you where God is leading you in your life.
[time=1701] And my goal today is to help you see that all your life, you ready for this?
[time=1705] All of your life has led you to such a time as this.
[time=1711] Such a time as this, a great phrase in the book of Esther.
[time=1714] God's led you to such a time as this, so let's leverage our situations for the kingdom of God now, not later.
[time=1722] Because of who, not because of what.
[time=1725] That's what we've been looking at as the heart of this whole series.
[time=1728] And so today, I want us to look at a few verses in the story of Esther that give us three big promises that we can hold onto when we face decisions.
[time=1738] Because most of us are, and those of us who aren't, is coming.
[time=1741] So the first one, and here's what they're going to do.
[time=1743] I gave you in the first week of this series for you of us, there's three driving parts to this equation of following God's will.
[time=1750] It's God's purpose, it's God's path, and it's God's plan.
[time=1754] We get consumed by the plan part.
[time=1757] God, what's your plan for my life?
[time=1759] And we've said that if I'll just walk the path that God has already outlined for us, I walk in God's ways.
[time=1765] I do God's will. I live in accordance to God's word.
[time=1769] Jesus already did that.
[time=1770] That's the path.
[time=1771] He's already beaten that path down.
[time=1773] Then we will remain in the purpose of God.
[time=1775] That's the outside of the circle.
[time=1778] But what I love about these three promises today is they take us through all three of those things in reverse order.
[time=1784] We see God's plan, God's path, and God's purpose in Esther's life, starting with God's plan.
[time=1790] The first thing, first promise is that God's plan for your present is not prevented by your past.
[time=1799] God's plan for your present is not prevented by your past.
[time=1805] Look at Esther chapter 4 with me.
[time=1807] I'll be reading from the English Standard Version today, verse 11.
[time=1810] What's happening now is Mordecai has just shared with Queen Esther.
[time=1814] She's the queen at this point.
[time=1816] She had gone through that whole scandalous process and God had her in the palace.
[time=1820] Who would have thought?
[time=1821] This little orphan girl would be the queen alongside this big, bad king.
[time=1826] But here she sits, and Mordecai knows her uncle knows that she hasn't revealed.
[time=1831] She hasn't revealed who she is.
[time=1832] She doesn't say Mordecai's my uncle.
[time=1834] I'm a Jew.
[time=1835] I'm a part of the people of God.
[time=1836] She's just the queen at this point.
[time=1838] And so that's an interesting part of this story.
[time=1840] But Mordecai shared with her that Haman, the right hand man to the king, has this plan to exterminate, to kill all of the Jews, which is their people.
[time=1848] And so here we sit, and this is her response to Mordecai.
[time=1852] Her uncle is saying you should probably do something about this, Miss Queen.
[time=1856] Here we are in verse 11, and I can't imagine what's flooding her mind.
[time=1859] Verse 11, who's ready for the word today?
[time=1862] Verse 11, "All the king's servants," this is what she said.
[time=1866] "All the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces know that if any man or woman goes to the king inside the inner court
[time=1874] without being called, there is but one law to be put to death.
[time=1879] Except the one to whom the king holds out the golden scepter so that he may live,
[time=1886] underline these next few words, but as for me." What do you think's going through Esther's mind right now?
[time=1892] But as for me, I'm an orphan.
[time=1895] I'm not even supposed to be a queen.
[time=1897] I didn't even get here in a very godly way.
[time=1902] What can I do?
[time=1904] Do I risk my life? Because literally that was the law.
[time=1907] If you go in to see the king and he didn't want you there, he didn't raise his scepter to you, you're immediately put to death.
[time=1913] And she knew that, and that's what she's saying here.
[time=1915] But as for me, I've not been called to come into the king these 30 days.
[time=1921] She's forgotten by the king, and no doubt her past is creeping into her mind.
[time=1925] Have you ever noticed there's an enemy that seems to do that?
[time=1927] Every time God's going to do something in your present, He brings something from your past into your present that keeps you from your future?
[time=1934] Do you think that was happening?
[time=1936] It doesn't spell it out in scripture, but I want to play around for a moment with what was possibly going through Esther's mind.
[time=1942] Now we see her as this picture of virtue, and that she is because God used her to save a nation, but the whole scandalous story of how this started really was not so pretty.
[time=1953] She had watched the people of her past, the people that came from the same group, the same nation that she came from, stand up to kings.
[time=1963] Be willing to die for their fate, but she hid her identity, and in so doing remains silent about the fate, about this God that her and her people had been serving.
[time=1975] Now she didn't make all of the best decisions, no doubt would God, the most godly thing, have been to speak up for God's people immediately.
[time=1984] Even when she went through that process, it was basically a sex contest.
[time=1988] These people would come into the king and parade around, be paraded where they're forced or not.
[time=1994] She had to go through all that as an orphan.
[time=1996] Can you imagine how she felt?
[time=1998] Can you imagine the shame?
[time=2000] Can you imagine how her past was entering her present in these moments?
[time=2005] You can probably relate, can't you?
[time=2007] God's doing something in your life, but your past starts to creep in, and this enemy starts to whisper these little things in your ear.
[time=2015] But here's the thing, this little orphan girl who maybe hadn't done everything so well, God was still going to use to save a nation.
[time=2023] God had chosen her for something special, his purpose would not be thwarted, his path was already marked out.
[time=2031] He had a plan for this young girl named Esther.
[time=2035] And a lot of people I want you to know today, a lot of people are going to tell you that because of your past, certain things about your future are prohibited.
[time=2043] I want you to hear me when I share this with you, something a mentor told me a long time ago.
[time=2049] As I felt inadequate to be in ministry, I felt inadequate as a person to be honest with you.
[time=2054] One of the most insecure people you'd ever meet wouldn't look you in the eye.
[time=2058] Scared, ashamed of myself, thinking of what I don't have, that's the Kevin that has always been.
[time=2067] That's the past that God said I'm going to reach into and pluck this little guy out who thinks he can do nothing for the kingdom and make him a pastor.
[time=2074] The one thing he always said he would never do and be for God. Be careful with that, by the way.
[time=2080] If you're trying to find God's plans, don't tell him what it will never be. It'll probably be that.
[time=2086] That's my story.
[time=2088] But some of you have been told by people that your present, your future is prohibited by your past, but I want you to know that we serve a God.
[time=2097] And this is what my mentor told me. Look me in the eye and he said, Kevin, God is the kind of God who will leapfrog you over, around, and through anyone or anything to put you wherever he wants you to be, whenever he wants you to be there.
[time=2114] Somebody needs to hear that in this place today.
[time=2117] It's time to not be consumed by your past and feel like it prevents and prohibits your future than in the present.
[time=2126] Know that God's plan for you stands and he doesn't care who wants to tear it down. He doesn't care how many valid reasons there are that is illogical and irrational.
[time=2136] He can do whatever he wants to do with whoever he wants to do and do it whenever he wants to do it.
[time=2143] Don't let your past be the ball and chain you drag around. Esther was faced with that decision.
[time=2151] Today I want you to hear the words of our Father from Romans 5 and Romans 8. You don't have to turn there. I just want to quote a couple of little words for you.
[time=2160] Romans 5 tells us there's therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[time=2168] If he doesn't condemn you because you're in Christ Jesus, why should you keep condemning yourself?
[time=2176] Is it time to break free from condemnation? Romans 8 reminds you that nothing, nothing can separate you from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus. Nothing.
[time=2190] Not that thing from your past. Not those poor decisions that you've made. Not the current decision that you're facing. Even if you get it totally wrong. Nothing can separate you from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus.
[time=2203] You're not fighting for a victory. You're fighting. If you know Jesus today, you're fighting from a victory that has already been won.
[time=2212] Stop fighting for victory. Just take part in the victory that has already taken place.
[time=2219] Second thing leads us from the plan to the path. And it's this, the promise you can all into when you face decisions, God's path is constant.
[time=2227] God's path is constant even when His plan fills uncertain.
[time=2232] Esther chapter 4 continuing there in verse 12 from where we picked up. This is Mordecai's response. Some powerful words here. We're going to dig into this for a little bit.
[time=2241] And they told Mordecai what Esther had said, verse 13, then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, "Do not think to yourself that in the king's palace you will escape any more than all the other Jews."
[time=2254] She's in that people group too. Verse 14, "For if you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another place."
[time=2264] Sounds like some belief in Mr. Mordecai, doesn't it? Sounds like he'd been watching God work and knew he wasn't done. It sounds like he knew it looked hopeless, but he knew the hope of the world.
[time=2273] He knew this God of his people would not let them fall. He didn't know what it would look like and we see that next.
[time=2280] It will rise from another place continuing on. But you and your father's house will perish.
[time=2285] I love this next part. And say it with me. Who knows? Say it with me again. And who knows? Can I get an amen? Is that your life or what? Who knows?
[time=2297] I'm about to make this big decision, but who knows how it's going to turn out? Who knows how those kids of mine are really going to turn out?
[time=2304] I'm trying my best, but they're all over the place. Who knows? If this relationship, if this marriage is going to make it, it certainly doesn't feel like it sometimes. Who knows? Who knows?
[time=2314] Who knows? And who knows? They didn't. And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom. Here's that phrase.
[time=2322] For such a time as this. You're in this season here. Look at my eyes when I tell you this. I want you to know this from the bottom of my heart to yours, from the bottom of Jesus' heart to yours.
[time=2333] You're in this season, in this moment right now, for such a time as this.
[time=2340] You are here for a reason because we serve the God of all reason. He can take bad and turn it around for good.
[time=2347] He doesn't need your permission or anybody else's permission. He's the God of Joseph who said, "My brothers, you sold me into slavery and wanted to kill me.
[time=2355] You meant it for evil, but my God, he meant it for good. Therefore I can irrationally forgive you with a forgiveness I don't even have inside myself."
[time=2364] That's the God that we serve. Who knows? Maybe you're here for such a time as this.
[time=2369] Verse 15, "Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai, 'Go gather all the Jews, be found in sousa and hold a fast on my behalf and do not eat or drink for three days, night or day, I and my young women will also fast as you do.
[time=2383] And then I will go to the king, though it against the law. And if I perish, I perish boldness."
[time=2394] Mordecai then went away and did everything as Esther had ordered him to do. God's path is constant even when his plan feels uncertain.
[time=2404] Can I give you four discernment steps that I see that I use in my own life, that I also see in Esther's life?
[time=2410] I'm going to give those two. You just jot them down. They're not in your notes, but three words, four words that you can remember.
[time=2415] The first is commitment to his will. Jesus prayed when he was in the garden before he died on that cross.
[time=2421] God, thy will not my will. It's time for some thy will prayers to be lifted up in your life. Not my will, God, but thy will commitment to his will.
[time=2430] Number two, consistency in his word. I see these two things in Esther's story. Commitment to his will, thy will not my will.
[time=2438] God, if I perish, I perish and in the prayer and fasting element that we just read about, I see a commitment to God's word.
[time=2445] Some of you need to hear this today. I believe this with all my heart. This is why I said the second part of those four things that I always walk through when I have to discern or make decisions is that the will of God will never contradict the word of God.
[time=2461] If you feel like, well, God may want me to do this. I know it goes contrary to his word and it's not right, but I think God's in this. No, he's not.
[time=2468] The will of God will never contradict the word of God. We have got to be consistently standing on truth, the truth of the word, on prayer and on fasting those elements of our faith that we see Esther exhibit, commitment to his will, thy will not my will, consistency in the word and then counsel from the wise.
[time=2490] She had a wise uncle and she was choosing to listen to Mr. Mordecai. She was ready to take steps that could cost her life.
[time=2499] Proverbs 15, 22 plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisors, they succeed. Commitment to his will, consistency in his word, counsel from the wise, and that leads us to the fourth thing.
[time=2513] This is where you're trying to get to with that decision you need to make, and that is conviction from within, conviction, or you're convicted, you know what's next.
[time=2523] And I think of Proverbs three, five, and six, trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[time=2528] Lean not on your own understanding, but in all your ways, there's the path and all your ways, acknowledge him, walk his path, and then it says, and he will direct your paths.
[time=2539] That's the plan that God has for you, the plan that you're searching for in your life.
[time=2545] I see all those things in Esther's journey in her story, and a lot of times we make decisions, though, on feelings-based faith.
[time=2552] You know what I mean? Feelings, they're up and they're down. I don't feel like it today, so I'm going to decide to go this way.
[time=2557] I don't feel like this is going to be a good idea. I want to challenge you to get away from feelings-based faith and go to fact-based faith, and then you will be able to stand firm.
[time=2567] It means I've got to choose to stand firm in my faith, let my faith dictate my decisions, even when I don't feel like it, even when it doesn't make sense, even when I face big decisions, and you will stand firm.
[time=2583] That's what God's calling you to do in this place today. That's what God has for your life.
[time=2588] They knew a few things. Mordecai verse 14 says, you know, who knows if you're here for this season? Such a time is this, but I know a few things.
[time=2598] They knew a few things. They knew that God wanted to deliver His people because they had been watching Him do it time and time again.
[time=2604] They knew that God cared about His people, and He would walk with them.
[time=2607] They knew there was a plan for destruction. They knew that that plan for destruction was coming.
[time=2612] They knew that Esther was in a unique position to do something about it. They knew she could get before the king, but what they didn't know was even more heavy.
[time=2621] They didn't know who knows, who knows. You might die, but who knows? You might be here for such a time as if they didn't know how it was going to turn out.
[time=2632] That's your season right now, most likely. You don't know how it's going to turn out. Who knows?
[time=2637] They didn't know whether Esther would be killed on the spot because she broke a law.
[time=2642] We'd already seen the same king just because the queen wouldn't come in and dance and do what he wanted to do. He banished her.
[time=2647] This was an actual law. That was to make a statement. This was a law that she would be killed.
[time=2654] This was a life or death decision. You thought you had a life or death decision.
[time=2658] This Esther certainly had that decision. Charles Stanley, pastor from Atlanta, Georgia, went to seminary in his church there for many years, said this a long time ago, and I hope it's an encouragement to you.
[time=2669] It's on my board and my office right back there right now because I want to be reminded of this every day, and it's to obey God and leave all the consequences to him.
[time=2679] You don't know why, because I've seen time and time again that God takes full responsibility for a life that's wholly devoted to him.
[time=2691] That means he'll take responsibility for your consequences. It doesn't mean there are going to be consequences that you welcome, but it means he's in the middle of whatever consequences, whatever results, whatever it is that you don't want to happen that still does happen.
[time=2703] He's in the middle of that. It's the same God who can take evil and turn it into something good can take mistakes and redeem them and use them for his kingdom.
[time=2712] He's not the author of confusion and mistakes. We do that just fine, don't we? Without his help. But he can take our authorship, our penmanship of mistakes and problems and big blow up, ruin our life type decisions that we never saw coming.
[time=2728] And he can twist that script and rewrite it and redeem it for his glory.
[time=2733] He's doing that in this little orphan girl's life, and that leaves us before I do that.
[time=2739] I want to talk about the belief in boldness. There's a statement I want to give you, "Belief leads to boldness." Did you know that belief leads to boldness?
[time=2746] Belief was Mordecai in verse 14. Who knows? You might be here for this season, but I know if it's not you, it'll be someone else.
[time=2753] God's going to finish what he started. That belief led to boldness where in verse 16 Esther said, "If I perish, I perish."
[time=2760] If you follow Jesus today, I want you to hear me when I say this, "Prepare to get moving."
[time=2766] Because Jesus meets you where you are. Yes, he does. Can I get a name in?
[time=2770] Jesus meets you where we are. That's the easy part. You ready for the next part? But he never leaves you that way.
[time=2777] And so, Jesus, I think following Jesus is a lot like a train track. You can be on the right train track.
[time=2784] You with me? You can be on the right train track, but if you just sit there, you're still going to get run over.
[time=2790] You can be on the right track, but you will still get run over if you sit there on the right track.
[time=2795] Jesus puts you on a track to move you somewhere and do something with your life, not just to sit and wait for it to end.
[time=2802] Are you with me today? He's got something for you. Yes, you.
[time=2807] Your past cannot prevent in the present what God has for your future.
[time=2812] And even though his plan feels uncertain, his path is certain and it's constant and it's consistent.
[time=2819] My favorite part about this passage is that afterwards, when God's people are saved,
[time=2825] you will find that three people, scholars will give three people credit for the exiled Jews.
[time=2832] You know, they've been exiled. They're out of their homeland. They go home. They get to go back home.
[time=2836] Three people in the Bible get credit for that for most scholars. Ezra and Nehemiah are two.
[time=2842] And you'll read about them right around these same books here.
[time=2845] They were men of God, teachers, pastors, ministers, religious leaders, whatever you want to call them.
[time=2851] They were in ministry. But you know who the third one was? It was Esther.
[time=2857] And you know what I love about her story?
[time=2860] She was not called to the temple like Ezra and Nehemiah. She was called to the palace.
[time=2867] Our church's heart, though we've seen this happen over and over and over again.
[time=2873] And we can't wait to continue to see it happen. Our heart at this church is not just to see people get called to quit their jobs.
[time=2880] And go become a pastor or to go overseas to be a missionary, though that happens.
[time=2886] And if God's stirring that in you, I'd happen to know three or four of you that God's doing it right now, then you follow it. If that's his path, don't you dare look back and let the enemies tell you otherwise.
[time=2895] But our heart is not just to see that happen. Our biggest heart is to equip disciple makers who become ministers in their workplaces,
[time=2904] in their palaces, in their homes, in the places that feel unlikely, in the places that feel impossible
[time=2911] to be a minister, a pastor, a shepherd, a leader for Jesus, a disciple maker.
[time=2916] Our heart is to equip and release and send out people who go charge into the workplaces in the homes of Fort Wayne
[time=2923] and around the world and make a difference for Jesus in your palace.
[time=2928] That's what I love about this story of Esther. She was called to the palace.
[time=2934] I want to give you a question. Maybe it's time for a bold decision to do what I'm about to ask you.
[time=2939] And the question is in your notes is, how do I leverage my palace? My palace.
[time=2945] Your palace is different than mine. And look at me. Your palace matters.
[time=2950] I know it may not feel like it matters as much as getting a stand on a stage.
[time=2956] This stage means nothing if what happens from this stage doesn't go out there.
[time=2962] We might as well close the doors and go home.
[time=2965] What matters is when we become disciple makers out there.
[time=2970] It's easy to sit in here. It's easy to preach to all you guys, even though some of you go to sleep sometimes.
[time=2976] It's easy to talk about all this stuff that Jesus said in this room. It's hard to live it out there.
[time=2982] But that's what we're all about here at Blackhawk. And that is what the kingdom of God needs in this divided,
[time=2988] hate-filled world that we live in today, folks.
[time=2992] Let's go do what Esther did because you are a royal priesthood. You're a pastor.
[time=3000] Did you hear me? You don't hear that in church every day. You are a pastor.
[time=3006] You are a shepherd. You are a royal priesthood and a holy nation that God has set apart
[time=3014] with a purpose to impact his world for his glory, for his kingdom, for his honor,
[time=3020] and the devil himself can't hold you back when you do what God's called you to do.
[time=3026] Last thing I want to share with you goes to chapter 6, and it's just one verse before you get too nervous.
[time=3032] It's this, that it's the purpose part. We talk about the plan and the path part, but the purpose part is that God is working even when you can't see it.
[time=3042] What's interesting is Esther asked the king to come to a...he raises his scepter, by the way.
[time=3048] She pleads that you wouldn't want to know. If you didn't read ahead, then there you go.
[time=3051] You can get off your pins and needles now. She was okay.
[time=3054] And he says, "Up to half the kingdom, Queen Esther, I'll give you whatever you want. What's your wish?" She said, "I just want you and Haman." Interesting choice, right?
[time=3062] "I just want you and Haman to come to a banquet that I'll prepare for you." So they do that.
[time=3066] Instead of making her request known, she says, "What I'd really like to do, I'll tell you what I want
[time=3072] at the next banquet where you come to one more." And it's interesting how that delay happened because God uses a restless night in the king's life in Esther chapter 6
[time=3082] to make an interesting twist of events because Haman hated Mordecai, Esther's uncle.
[time=3087] In fact, he had built gallows to hang him on because he would tremble in his sight.
[time=3092] Scripture says he wouldn't bow before him. He wasn't threatened by him because he served the one and only God. And Haman wanted to hang Mordecai, so he had built these gallows.
[time=3103] And so here we pick up this third promise, God's working, even when you can't see it, even when you're restless, I might add, anybody had a restless night lately?
[time=3111] Well, this is for you. Verse number one of Esther chapter 6.
[time=3114] So after the first banquet, before the next banquet, when she would say save me, which he does and reverses and promotes Mordecai, you know the end of the story perhaps, but it ends well. But before it gets there, in between those two banquets, on that night, verse 1 of Esther 6, the king could not sleep.
[time=3130] Some of you had a sleepless night last night, you're restless.
[time=3134] Like the king, God works in the middle of that, even when you can't see it.
[time=3137] And he gave orders to bring the book of memorable deeds, the chronicles, and they were read before the king. And it was found, written how Mordecai, and he goes on to talk about how he had thwarted a plan to take the king's life.
[time=3149] And then he thought, well, what do we ever do for that guy? You know, after all, I saved my life. Maybe I should give him a hug or something, right? What did we ever do?
[time=3157] And so he brings in Haman and says, hey, what should we do for a person that the king really wants to honor? And Haman goes, well, that would be me, wouldn't it? Let me give you an ice long outline, my king. And he gives this great outline of parading him through the town and celebrating thinking him, thinking that it was him that he wanted to honor.
[time=3177] Instead, it ends up being Mordecai and this guy that he planned to kill, to hang on his gallows, on his property.
[time=3185] He has to drive around and parade around the city in between these bankers. It's already been a bad day for Mr. Haman. And to make things worse, he goes to the next banquet and says, the king says to Esther, what do you want? Up to half the kingdom, as sure as she says, I want you to spare my life.
[time=3201] Haman has come up with this plan to destroy and kill my people. And I don't want to die. And I don't want them to either.
[time=3209] That was the gist of the story. And Haman leaves and he comes back and gets where he's hung.
[time=3213] Because he is hung. He's hung on the very gallows that he had built for Esther's uncle. Is that a story or what?
[time=3221] God's working. He did a lot of that. Yes, they're a big courageous decision.
[time=3225] But also through a restless night. I want to challenge you this week to find a reason in the middle of your restlessness. Perhaps God's ready to speak to you in the middle of the night. Perhaps you're worrying about things God's already taken care of. Perhaps it's time to stop talking and just listen. Because God's got a word for you. Even in the middle of your restlessness.
[time=3249] Did you know that just because things aren't going the way you had planned does not mean they're not going the way they should. God's ready to work in the middle of your restlessness. In your notes it says trust God's purpose.
[time=3261] Walk in his path and he'll direct you in his plan.
[time=3265] I believe that with all my heart.
[time=3269] There's a story I want to share with you in closing today that is about a Christian journal.
[time=3273] An editor brought in a photographer in this journal and said I want you to go out for our next journal article. And I want you to capture a picture Mr. photographer that just truly captures the destitute awful state that our world is in today. Can you do that?
[time=3289] Just something that truly shows the world how terrible our world is in this place today. So he went out and scoured the community with his camera and he finally found the moment that he wanted to capture. And it was this moment of a beggar a homeless person who was at a grocery store. And in the window of this grocery store was a big display of hot freshly baked bread. And it was just steaming out. You could smell it. But this beggar had run out of energy. He was completely done when it came to his physical being. He had nothing in his system. He was out of energy. He was exhausted and he was stretched out not even quite on the curb because he couldn't quite drag himself up there.
[time=3325] And he was stretched out towards the bakery, towards the grocery store.
[time=3329] And he said I knew it. This is perfect. This is the place.
[time=3333] He gets his camera out. He even gets down on his knees. He lays down gets the light. Gets the angle properly.
[time=3341] Bends down. Make sure the bread's in the back. You can see the steam coming back up.
[time=3345] This guy looks as pitiful as he could possibly look and he snaps the photo.
[time=3349] And he goes right back to his editor and says look what I got.
[time=3353] This is exactly what you asked for. Is it not? And he says yes.
[time=3357] That's exactly what I sent you out to do. I definitely sent you out to capture the destitute state of the world around us.
[time=3365] And you did that with excellence.
[time=3369] But let me ask you one more question. What did you do for the beggar after you took the picture?
[time=3377] Photographers head just dropped.
[time=3381] He was heartbroken because he realized I didn't do anything.
[time=3385] He admitted that to his editor.
[time=3389] The editor said something to this photographer that I want to say to you today. In a world that's broken and hurting he looked at him and he said you know you got the picture.
[time=3401] But you missed the point.
[time=3405] In a world that's full of brokenness.
[time=3413] I don't want to be a follower of Jesus who gets the picture.
[time=3417] Can talk about all the things that Jesus says.
[time=3421] Can quote scripture. Have all the head knowledge.
[time=3425] But missed the point of what he's doing in and through his church in the world that needs him so desperately.
[time=3433] I refuse to get the picture.
[time=3437] But missed the point. In those decisions that you're making today. There's a big picture in place.
[time=3445] You may get the full scope of the picture. But don't miss the point of what God's trying to do in you and through you because of the decisions that you're making today.
[time=3457] Don't get the picture but miss the point.
[time=3461] Bow your heads with me for a moment. Reflect on what the point may be for you today. I know what it is for those of you who would say you don't know Jesus today.
[time=3469] If you don't know Jesus today then today the point is to get to that spot where you see the picture of the gospel.
[time=3477] You see the picture of how broken you are.
[time=3481] You see the picture of what your sin does in your life and that it separates you from God. But your point today if you don't know that if you were to die today you would spend eternity with Jesus in heaven because you have a personal relationship with him. If you would say I'd like to know pastor but I just don't know that I have it 100% nailed down then today that's the point.
[time=3501] That's the point. That's the point of the gospel.
[time=3505] You're the point of the gospel. Will you cry out to him you say well tell me how I don't know how I think your heart screaming it out.
[time=3513] The Bible reminds us and tells us over and over throughout scripture that anyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. It's saying Jesus I need you to save me. I know you died for me. You lived a sinless life I couldn't live. That path that we talked about. You paid a price I couldn't pay and you rose again. You defeated hell and death of a grave on my behalf. Jesus forgive me and save me. In your words from your heart you don't have to say it right. God knows your heart and he wants to hear from your heart in this moment. And scripture promises but even more than that you have a God who looks at you in your situation with all the decisions and all the mess who says I want to save you right here and right now. Will you cry out to him right now in this moment in your own words with your own mind in this room will you just scream out to Jesus he will meet you right there. Do that right now.
[time=3591] you
