[time=30] [MUSIC - 552 seconds]
[time=592] We are so excited about all that God has in store for you today. Thank you for tuning in, giving us a little bit of the time of your week so that we could just speak into your life. We're excited here at Black Hawk to continue recalculating. That's the series we've been in for quite some time and we're excited to see what God has in store for you. You're in for a treat because today you get to hear from one of my dear friends who's also the Bible department.
[time=621] The Bible department chair at Black Hawk Christian School here at Black Hawk Ministries, Steve Webster is going to be walking us through what it means to recalculate even when I don't want to. And for that topic, we're going to be looking at the Word of God, looking at the Bible at the story of a man named Jonah, one of the prophets of God who was told to go to one place but wanted to go in a different direction, didn't want to recalculate as God had in store for him.
[time=648] I think there's a lot of relevant topics that's going to come out of that for you and for me today. And so thanks for tuning in. We want to hear from you. We want to hear your story. Connect with us through all of our social media channels on our website at BlackhawkMinistries.org at Be Hawk Ministries, Twitter or Instagram, or you can find us by looking for Black Hawk Ministries on Facebook. So thanks again for watching today. Sit back. Know you that you're amongst friends. You're a part of our family here at Black Hawk.
[time=676] I know God's got a special word just for you today.
[time=706] Oh, it leads me on for His name, for His great name, Shirley Goodness, Shirley Mercy, right beside me all.
[time=729] My day and day was well in your house forever.
[time=740] And bless your holy man.
[time=752] You've ever taken a life for me, and the presence of my enemy.
[time=766] Though the arrows fly, in the terror of night is at my door. I trust you love.
[time=780] Shirley Goodness, Shirley Mercy, right beside me all.
[time=793] My day and day was well in your house forever.
[time=804] And bless your holy man.
[time=815] Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of day, I will feel no evil.
[time=830] Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of day, you are on my side.
[time=845] Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of day, I will feel no evil.
[time=860] Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of day, you are on my side.
[time=875] Shirley Goodness, Shirley Mercy, right beside me all.
[time=887] My day and day was well in your house forever.
[time=899] And bless your holy man.
[time=925] The Lord gave this message to Jonah, son of Amatthai.
[time=931] Get up and go to the great city of Nineveh.
[time=935] Announce my judgment against it because I have seen how wicked its people are.
[time=940] But Jonah got up and went in the opposite direction.
[time=944] To get away from the Lord, he went down to the port of Japa, where he found a ship leaving for Tarshish.
[time=951] He bought a ticket and went on board, hoping to escape from the Lord by sailing to Tarshish.
[time=958] But the Lord hurled a powerful wind over the sea, causing a violent storm that threatened to break the ship apart.
[time=967] Fearing for their lives, the desperate sailors shouted to their gods for help and threw the cargo overboard to lighten the ship.
[time=975] But all this time Jonah was sound asleep, down in the hold.
[time=980] So the captain went down after him, "How can you sleep at a time like this?" he shouted, "Get up and pray to your God.
[time=987] Maybe he will pay attention to us and spare our lives." Then the crew cast lots to see which of them had offended the gods and caused a terrible storm.
[time=998] When they did this, the lots identified Jonah as the culprit.
[time=1003] "Why has this awful storm come down on us?" they demanded.
[time=1006] "Who are you? What is your line of work? What country are you from? What is your nationality?"
[time=1012] Jonah answered, "I am a Hebrew, and I worship the Lord, the God of heaven who made the sea and the land."
[time=1020] The sailors were terrified when they heard this, for he had already told them he was running away from the Lord.
[time=1026] "Why did you do it?" they groaned. "Since the storm was getting worse all the time they asked him, what should we do to you to stop the storm?"
[time=1036] "Throw me into the sea," Jonah said. "It will become calm again. I know this terrible storm is all my fault."
[time=1044] Instead, the sailors rode even harder to get the ship to the land, but the stormy sea was too violent for them, and they couldn't make it.
[time=1052] Then they cried out to the Lord, Jonah's God, "O Lord!" they pleaded, "Don't make us die for this man's sin, and don't let us responsible for his death, O Lord."
[time=1062] You have sent this storm upon him for your own good reasons.
[time=1066] Then the sailors picked Jonah up and threw him into the raging sea, and the storm stopped at once.
[time=1073] The sailors were awestruck by the Lord's great power, and they offered him a sacrifice, and vowed to serve him.
[time=1080] The Lord had arranged for a great fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was inside the fish for three days in three nights.
[time=1090] Then Jonah prayed to the Lord, his God, from inside the fish, and said, "I cried out to the Lord in my great trouble, and he answered me. I called to you from the land of the dead, and Lord, you heard me.
[time=1103] You threw me into the ocean depths, and I sank down to the heart of the sea. The mighty waters engulfed me.
[time=1109] I was buried beneath your wild and stormy waves. Then I said, "O Lord, you have driven me from your presence.
[time=1117] Yet I will look once more toward your holy temple. I sank beneath the waves, and the waters closed over me.
[time=1123] Sea weed wrapped itself around my head. I sank down to the very roots of the mountains. I was imprisoned in the earth, whose gates locked shut forever.
[time=1134] But you, O Lord, my God, snatched me from the jaws of death. As my life was slipping away, I remembered the Lord.
[time=1143] And my earnest prayer went out to you in your holy temple. Those who worship false gods turned their backs on all God's mercies.
[time=1153] But I will offer sacrifices to you with songs of praise, and I will fulfill all my vows for my salvation comes from the Lord alone.
[time=1163] Then the Lord ordered the fish to spit Jonah out onto the beach. Then the Lord spoke to Jonah a second time.
[time=1171] Get up and go to the great city of Nineveh and deliver the message I have given you.
[time=1176] This time Jonah obeyed the Lord's command and went to Nineveh, a city so large it took three days to see it all.
[time=1184] On the day Jonah entered the city, he shouted to the crowds, "40 days from now, Nineveh will be destroyed."
[time=1192] People of Nineveh believed God's message. And from the greatest to the least, they declared a fast and put on burlap to show their sorrow.
[time=1202] When the king of Nineveh heard what Jonah was saying, he stepped down from his throne and took off his royal robes.
[time=1207] He dressed himself in burlap and sat in a heap of ashes. Then the king and his nobles sent this decree throughout the city.
[time=1213] No one, not even the animals from your herds and flocks, may eat or drink anything at all.
[time=1219] People and animals alike must wear garments of mourning, and everyone must pray earnestly to God.
[time=1225] They must turn from their evil ways and stop all their violence. Who can tell?
[time=1232] Perhaps even yet God will change his mind and hold back his fierce anger from destroying us.
[time=1240] When God saw what they had done, and how they had put a stop to their evil ways, he changed his mind and did not carry out the destruction he had threatened.
[time=1252] This change of plans greatly upset Jonah, and he became very angry, so he complained to the Lord about it.
[time=1260] Didn't I say before I left home that you would do this Lord? That's why I ran away to Tarshish.
[time=1266] I knew that you were gracious and compassionate God, slow to get angry, filled with unfailing love.
[time=1273] You are eager to turn back from destroying people. Just kill me now Lord.
[time=1278] I'd rather be dead than alive if what I predicted will not happen.
[time=1284] The Lord replied, "Is it right for you to be angry about this?" Then Jonah went out to the east side of the city and made a shelter to sit under it, as he waited to see what had happened to the city.
[time=1295] The Lord got arranged for a leafy plant to grow there, and as soon as spread broad leaves over Jonah's head, shading him from the sun, this eased his discomfort, and Jonah was very grateful for the plant.
[time=1307] But God also arranged for a worm. The next morning at dawn the worm ate through the stem of the plant so that it withered away, as the sun grew hot, got arranged for a scorching east wind to blow on Jonah.
[time=1321] The sun beat down in his head until he grew faint and wished to die. "Death is certainly better than living like this," he exclaimed.
[time=1331] Then God said to Jonah, "Is it right for you to be angry because the plant died?" "Yes!" Jonah retorted, "Even angry enough to die!" Then the Lord said, "You feel sorry about the plant.
[time=1346] Though you did nothing to put it there, it came quickly, died quickly, but none of that has more than 120,000 persons living in spiritual darkness." Not to mention all the animals.
[time=1360] Shouldn't I feel sorry for such a great city?" This is the word of the Lord.
[time=1372] Major recalculations had to happen in Jonah's life almost all of his own making. Jonah is the only comedy in the entire Old Testament that I can tell.
[time=1382] I tried to read it that way. Jonah's troubles, again, are of his own making, and I was talking earlier to someone today, praising God, that God uses people in spite of themselves.
[time=1397] That God even uses people like Jonah, poor, miserable, pathetic Jonah, and God even uses people like me to bring his word to my dear friends in this room.
[time=1408] I'm so grateful that I have the chance to do it this morning. My name is Steve Webster. I've been teaching at the school here for 14 years.
[time=1415] I'm so grateful to do so. Speaking of the school, I want to give a shout out to the Girl Soccer Team and Quinn Doden, who won their first-sectional championship last night.
[time=1423] Way to go, girls. Guys lost in the championship to the Canterbury Tough-Fought Game, so well done soccer program at Blockout Christian School. Well done. We're very proud of you.
[time=1434] Finding God's will through life's dead ends. Would you turn your Bibles to the Book of Jonah, please?
[time=1441] Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obediah, Jonah, Micah. If you get the Micah, turn left. If you find Obediah, turn right. The Book of Jonah.
[time=1454] This is a fascinating story. I'm going to talk about the whole book with you today. It's very aggressive. I'll try to do it.
[time=1462] In your bulletins, there are some notes, which I'll just make some observations with you as we follow along this morning.
[time=1469] Look at verse 1 of Jonah again. I'm reading now from the English Standard Version.
[time=1474] It says, "The Word of the Lord came to Jonah, the Son of Amethai, saying, 'Arise, verse 2, go to Nineveh, that great city, and call out against it, for their evil has come up before me.'"
[time=1487] The first two words of verse 3 are, "But Jonah. But Jonah rose to flee." The first point in your notes, friends, is this. There's no escape.
[time=1498] There's no escape. Let me unpack that with you this morning for a bit.
[time=1503] If you are in a position, a posture, this morning, of righteousness, owing all to Jesus Christ, of course, but if you're in right relationship with God this morning, seeking Him in obedience, then God's presence is a great comfort to you.
[time=1518] And a great reassurance that He'll be with you through all of life's troubles. But if you're not, if you're in a posture's morning of disobedience, if you're in a posture of, I'm glad you're here, but if you're in a posture of, I really don't want to do any of these things that God says, then God's presence is terrifying to you.
[time=1538] But this morning, the story of Jonah is a crystal clear reminder that you can't get away from the presence of the Lord, even if you try.
[time=1547] The links that God goes in this book to get Jonah's attention is remarkable. It's absolutely remarkable. And everything in the book is miraculous from getting to end.
[time=1556] If you don't believe in miracles, the Bible makes no sense. And every miracle in the Bible is easy to believe is the next one.
[time=1563] It's a miracle, by the way, that people of Nineveh respond in repentance. It's a miracle.
[time=1569] Everybody as much as a big fish swallowing Jonah. That's a miracle.
[time=1574] It's a miracle that a great city like Nineveh would respond in faith to Jonah's message. This is Jonah's whole sermon. It's eight words, yet 40 days, and Nineveh will be destroyed.
[time=1586] That's the sermon he preached. And the whole city responds. It's a remarkable story. Every time I read it, I'm absolutely amazed by it.
[time=1594] I hoped that this morning, as I read it with you, that you had the same impression. This is a remarkable, remarkable story.
[time=1601] Maybe you're this morning and you're wondering why Jonah ran away. Why is his instant reaction to going to the people of Nineveh?
[time=1608] Nineveh is the capital city of Assyria. There'll be a map on the screens in front of you. Nineveh is the capital city of Assyria.
[time=1615] And Jonah's instant reaction to being called to go minister to these people is to go the opposite direction.
[time=1621] Maybe you're wondering why. I'm glad you asked.
[time=1625] I will only read a portion of this because it's not appropriate to read even in front of the children who are still in the room.
[time=1633] The Assyrian kings were proud of their cruel and terrible reputation and went to great trouble and expense to record their exploits for future generations.
[time=1645] Archaeologists have uncovered many large stone wall panels with carved depictions of grisly post-battle scenes, which were put up in palaces to be seen daily.
[time=1658] In addition, written descriptions of post-battle tortures of prisoners were preserved on cylindrical pillars.
[time=1665] Discovered in these pictorial and written displays are gruesome details and horrific boasting.
[time=1670] It is as gory and blood-curdling a history as we know.
[time=1676] Assyrians boasted of their cruelty to captured peoples following the siege of their own town or city, and their victims were not limited to combatants.
[time=1685] Records brag of live dismemberment often leaving one hand attached so they would shake it before the person died.
[time=1694] There's a lot more where that came from that I will spare you from.
[time=1698] The Assyrians were a merciless people, and they had been so for over a century when Jonah got to Nineveh.
[time=1706] And Jonah hears this reputation of them. He knows who the Assyrians are. They had bulldozed the ancient world.
[time=1712] And he goes, "I don't want to go to Nineveh. I want you, God, to destroy them right down to the ground."
[time=1719] That's what they deserve.
[time=1722] And the whole story of Jonah unfolds. That's why Jonah didn't want to go.
[time=1729] He didn't want to go because God was asking him to do something that was very, very difficult.
[time=1734] There's a quote that will be up on the screens here in a minute about what God was asking Jonah to do.
[time=1739] God is asking the impossible from Jonah.
[time=1742] And we have to realize that what God asks is always impossible from the human standpoint.
[time=1750] And according to man's judgment, "I don't want to go to these people." God.
[time=1756] And he gets in the boat and sails away.
[time=1759] He gets in the boat and goes on the sea to get away from God, the very sea that God made.
[time=1764] Remarkable stuff.
[time=1767] Look at verse 3 of Jonah 1, if you would, real quick. I just noticed this.
[time=1771] It's a remarkable thing.
[time=1773] Look at all these verbs in verse 3 that apply to Jonah.
[time=1777] But Jonah rose to flee to Tarsus from the presence of the Lord. He went down to Japa.
[time=1782] He found a ship going to Tarsus. He paid the fare. He went down into it away from the presence of the Lord to go.
[time=1789] All those verbs stacked. What's the point? He was determined to get away.
[time=1794] He didn't wander on the boat. "Oh, how to find myself here?" He was deliberate in his actions.
[time=1801] God is a merciful God, not only to the Ninevites, but also to Jonah.
[time=1808] But also to Jonah.
[time=1811] Look at verse 4.
[time=1813] I love the language here. I don't know what your translation reads.
[time=1816] And ESV says, "The Lord hurled a great wind." He hurled a wind. God, if that's how powerful God is, he can hurl a great wind on the sea.
[time=1826] And there was a mighty tempest, verse 4.
[time=1829] Verse 5, "The sailors, the mariners were afraid, and each cried out to his God, and they hurled," there's that word again, "the cargo in the ship in the sea to lighten it for them."
[time=1840] What's Jonah do in this whole time?
[time=1843] He is asleep.
[time=1846] Jonah, what a pathetic character Jonah is.
[time=1849] They're fighting for their lives, and Jonah's dumbed down below, sawing logs.
[time=1855] What do you mean, verse 6? The captain comes down.
[time=1858] What do you mean, oh, sleeper? What are you doing?
[time=1862] Arise, call out to your God.
[time=1866] Perhaps the God will give a thought to us that we may not perish.
[time=1871] There's no presumption on this captain's.
[time=1874] Maybe he will. Maybe he won't. But maybe he will.
[time=1878] There's humility there. It's a beautiful thing.
[time=1882] Verse 7, they cast lots. Proverbs 16 says that people cast lots, but the result belongs to the Lord.
[time=1890] So everything else that happens in the book of Jonah is because God is responsible for that casting of the lots.
[time=1895] Nothing is up to random chance.
[time=1897] Jonah is a beautiful testament to God's sovereignty.
[time=1900] His absolute complete total power over all things.
[time=1904] More on that in a minute.
[time=1906] He said to him, verse 8, tell us on whose account this evil has come upon us.
[time=1911] The sailors knew the storm was supernatural.
[time=1915] Somehow they just knew it, and they attached it to a divine being instantly.
[time=1921] And people say these days, well, these poor, primitive, ancient people.
[time=1925] You know, they have all these wild superstitions.
[time=1929] And friends, I tell my apologetics classes all the time that science has its place, but science has its limits.
[time=1938] And science needs to know what it can do and what it cannot do, and science can't answer all of our questions.
[time=1943] I can't scientifically explain to you why I love my wife, but I do.
[time=1949] My whole earthly framework is based on a non-scientific thing.
[time=1955] And there are no songs on the radio about my physiological response to my wife because of my brain synapses.
[time=1962] That's very boring at a song on the radio.
[time=1965] But it's real, isn't it?
[time=1967] And we take things in our whole lives that are outside the scope of science.
[time=1971] If you're going to college next year, you're in the room, or in the sound of my voice, and you're going into a non-science discipline, I celebrate that.
[time=1981] It's a worthwhile use of your time and your parents' tuition money.
[time=1986] There are all kinds of things that we're involved in along those lines.
[time=1990] It's personal for the sailors.
[time=1992] Verse 9, Jonah gets up, he rouses himself from his sleep.
[time=1996] What's going on?
[time=1997] Who are you?
[time=1998] Well, I'm a Hebrew.
[time=1999] I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea in the dry land, the very sea on which he is now sailing away from the Lord.
[time=2006] Jonah has a terrible lack of self-awareness.
[time=2009] He just doesn't have to be.
[time=2011] This is a remarkable thing.
[time=2013] Why is he leaving in the first place to go to...
[time=2016] You see on that map again, can the map get back up on the screen real quick?
[time=2019] Tarshish.
[time=2020] The map in the Bible, we don't really know where Tarshish is.
[time=2023] We just have to guess.
[time=2024] It just says Tarshish, it says Tarshish, question mark.
[time=2029] It's as far away as he can get.
[time=2033] He's running away because he knows what God is like.
[time=2038] Can I repeat that to you?
[time=2040] How messed up that is?
[time=2042] Jonah is running away from the Lord because he knows what God is like.
[time=2046] And if he goes to Nineveh and makes this sermon, things will be different.
[time=2051] His confidence in God's character is the reason why this obeys him.
[time=2054] This is a very messed up individual, ladies and gentlemen.
[time=2057] Look at Psalm 139 with me this morning, Psalm 139.
[time=2061] You know these verses, these are familiar to you, even if you don't know they are.
[time=2065] Psalm 139, verses 7 through 10, these will come, came to your mind, perhaps as I read this with you.
[time=2073] Psalm 139 starting in verse 7, where shall I go from your spirit?
[time=2078] Where shall I flee from your presence?
[time=2080] If I ascend to heaven, you're there.
[time=2082] If I make my bed in shol, you're there.
[time=2085] If I take the wings of the morning and dwell on the uttermost parts of the sea, even there your hand will lead me and your right hand will hold me.
[time=2093] There's no getting away. There's no escape.
[time=2095] That's a good thing if you trust him.
[time=2097] And if you don't, it can be reassuring that God will pursue you like he is pursuing Jonah.
[time=2105] Verse 11, chapter 1, back to Jonah, chapter 1.
[time=2110] Jonah wants to die.
[time=2112] Pick me up and throw me in the water, he says, and things will be different.
[time=2116] But Jonah wants to die. He would rather die than do what God says.
[time=2121] That's a pretty scary prospect.
[time=2123] This is the kind of person that God's using as a prophet.
[time=2126] The kind of people that he uses to serve him are deeply flawed people.
[time=2132] Pick me up and throw me into the sea, verse 12.
[time=2135] Then it will quiet down for you.
[time=2137] I know it's because of me that this great tempest has come upon you.
[time=2140] And the men are like, I don't want to do that.
[time=2142] The men row hard to get away, but they can't make it work.
[time=2145] They call it to the Lord.
[time=2147] Look at verse 5 of chapter 1. I miss this with you.
[time=2150] Verse 5, they're very afraid.
[time=2152] Verse 10, they're exceedingly afraid.
[time=2155] Verse 16, they're really, really, really afraid.
[time=2163] They throw Jonah in the water.
[time=2164] Verse 15, the sea ceased from its raging.
[time=2167] And the men are really, really, really afraid.
[time=2171] And they worship God, even in Jonah's disobedience.
[time=2175] God is using him to reach these people.
[time=2178] Did you notice that?
[time=2180] He's running away from his responsibilities.
[time=2182] And on this boat, God uses him to reach these poor and fortunate sailors.
[time=2188] God has that kind of ability in reach, ladies and gentlemen.
[time=2191] He can use this even in the worst moments of our lives.
[time=2194] Like he's using Jonah right here.
[time=2196] And I encourage you with that this morning.
[time=2199] Verse 17 of chapter 1 ends with the Lord appointed.
[time=2203] The Hebrew there reads, the Lord had appointed.
[time=2207] A great fish to swallow Jonah up.
[time=2211] So God knows he'll be in the boat.
[time=2213] He'll know he'll throw him overboard.
[time=2215] And then here comes the fish to grab Jonah.
[time=2218] It's a remarkable story.
[time=2219] The Lord had already appointed that to happen.
[time=2221] It's how far his God's playing three-dimensional chess with us all the time.
[time=2226] He's four, five, six, eight, 400 moves ahead of us.
[time=2230] What's the first word, ladies and gentlemen, of chapter 2 of Jonah?
[time=2235] This is the second point in your outline.
[time=2238] What's the first word, ladies and gentlemen?
[time=2240] Then he's in there for three days and three nights like this.
[time=2248] And then he prays.
[time=2251] Can you see yourself in this poor unfortunate gentleman?
[time=2254] I can.
[time=2257] Listen to this.
[time=2258] This is one of my favorite quotes from C.S. Lewis about prayer.
[time=2264] It will be on the streets.
[time=2266] It is a poor thing said C.S. Lewis to strike our colors to God to run our flag up before him when the ship is going down under us.
[time=2275] A poor thing to come to him is a last resort to offer up our own when it's no longer worth keeping.
[time=2282] If God were proud, he would hardly have us on such terms.
[time=2288] But he is not proud.
[time=2290] He stoops to conquer and he will have us even though we have shown like Jonah that we prefer everything else to him.
[time=2300] That's the kind of God that we just sang about.
[time=2303] The kind of God who is all over the pages of his word.
[time=2306] That's the kind of God that we serve.
[time=2308] That great God who will have us even in our worst moments.
[time=2313] Please help me, I'm in the water because I ran away from you and the sailors threw me overboard and they trust you more than I do.
[time=2320] Here comes the fish.
[time=2323] I don't know about this prayer.
[time=2325] I don't know what to do with it.
[time=2327] I tried to read it like I was giving Jonah a break, but I think it's very selfish.
[time=2332] Look at the prayer.
[time=2334] I called to you my distress.
[time=2337] I cried.
[time=2338] My voice.
[time=2339] Me.
[time=2340] Passed over me.
[time=2342] I said I will look.
[time=2343] It's a lot of first person.
[time=2344] It's a very selfish prayer from Jonah.
[time=2346] He's in a bad way.
[time=2347] I give him a break.
[time=2349] But he's very selfish.
[time=2351] He thinks nothing of the sailors that are in the storm.
[time=2356] In fact, he calls them out in verse 8.
[time=2359] "Those who peer guard to make idols will forsake your steadfast love." He thinks he's better than them.
[time=2367] Even in Jonah's sarcasm, God is using him.
[time=2371] It's remarkable stuff.
[time=2373] Jonah is mentioned in 2 Kings as a prophet.
[time=2376] Maybe the message is to the people that are reading this book, like don't trust in idols.
[time=2382] Even in Jonah's sarcastic self-serving fish guts prayer, he's reaching people.
[time=2388] If God can do that with Jonah, you're not in the belly of a fish.
[time=2393] It might feel like you are, but you're not.
[time=2398] So whatever circumstance in which you find yourself this morning, I encourage you with this, dear friends, if you're within the sound of my voice, God can use you wherever
[time=2407] you are.
[time=2410] In the heart of the sea, in the belly of a fish, Jonah cries out to God and God hears him.
[time=2416] Salvation, verse 9, salvation belongs to the Lord.
[time=2422] You are not, his arm is not so short that he can't save.
[time=2425] And wherever you think you're too far gone for God to save you, I offer you Jonah.
[time=2430] In the belly of a fish in the middle of the sea, running away from God.
[time=2435] There's more though, chapter 3.
[time=2440] The word of the Lord came to Jonah the second time.
[time=2445] God isn't just like, this guy, Jonah, I'm done with him.
[time=2451] I'm fine.
[time=2452] Somebody else.
[time=2453] Aren't you glad that God's Word comes to you a second time, third time, the 987th time?
[time=2462] Be grateful for God's persistence in using you, pursuing you.
[time=2467] He will do it.
[time=2468] He's that kind of a God.
[time=2471] Verse 2, "Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and call out against it the message that I tell you." Friends, I just want to say something to you this morning.
[time=2480] I know that when you hold a grudge, when we hold grudges against people, we feel like this is what they deserve to be judged, destroyed.
[time=2487] And I want to make it happen.
[time=2489] We want to manipulate God's actions.
[time=2492] But God has all of these things in mind.
[time=2494] He has the whole picture in mind.
[time=2497] God has taken Nineveh's evil seriously, and if they don't change, they will be destroyed.
[time=2503] So please hear that.
[time=2504] God is a God of justice, as well as love, and they're never mingling in an unhelpful way.
[time=2511] Verse 3, "Jona arose and went to Nineveh." Nineveh is 500 miles or so, northeast of Israel.
[time=2518] It's a long way.
[time=2523] According to the Word of the Lord, Nineveh was an exceedingly great city.
[time=2527] It says in the original language, "It was a great city to God." One of the things that's great, God matters to him is how I would read that.
[time=2535] None of them matters to God.
[time=2537] It doesn't matter to Jonah.
[time=2539] Three days' journey in breadth, verse 3, the ENLTS I read earlier said, "It takes three
[time=2547] days to see it all." That's probably what that means.
[time=2551] Three days to see the whole city.
[time=2552] "Jona began to go in the city, going a days' journey.
[time=2555] He only got that far." Three days to see the whole thing, he got one day, and he's like, "That's enough." And it's actually five words in Hebrew, not even eight.
[time=2564] It's eight in English.
[time=2565] He gives a five-word sermon, fine God, I'll do it.
[time=2568] And he goes, five words, five words, one third of the way in, I'm done.
[time=2573] He walks out.
[time=2574] What happens?
[time=2575] They put burlap sacks on their animals.
[time=2580] That's how far the repentance goes.
[time=2583] That's how deep the change is in these people.
[time=2588] Verse 6, "The word reached the king of Nineveh, and he looked at the king of Nineveh's verbs.
[time=2593] He arose from his throne, removed his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, satin ashes."
[time=2599] His verbs are going the other way.
[time=2600] "Jona's go this way, his goes that way toward God." He issued a proclamation and published it throughout the city.
[time=2610] Number three in your notes, friends, everything changes.
[time=2614] Everything changes when you respond in the right way to what God has said, everything changes.
[time=2620] Salvation in the deep belongs to the Lord.
[time=2623] That's the last words of Jonah's prayer.
[time=2625] I doubt he wanted it to reach the king of Nineveh, but there he did, despite him.
[time=2630] This is a remarkable story.
[time=2635] Man and beast, verse 8, be covered with sackcloth, let him call mightily to God, let everyone turn verse 8 from his evil way and from the violence that is in his hands.
[time=2645] That's the only clue in the book is to why Jonah hated Assyria, but they knew they were a violent people.
[time=2652] And the king says, "Turn away.
[time=2655] Who knows?" Verse 9.
[time=2657] Who knows?
[time=2659] Humility in that.
[time=2660] He doesn't say, "God's going to forgive us because it doesn't say who knows.
[time=2665] Maybe he will.
[time=2667] We're in his hands." God, they turn and relent and turn from his fierce anger that we may not perish.
[time=2676] Jonah doesn't care in the whole book if people perish.
[time=2680] The sailors do.
[time=2681] The king of Nineveh does, but he doesn't.
[time=2686] Remarkable stuff.
[time=2688] The king of Nineveh has an honest appraisal of who they are and says, "I know who we are.
[time=2693] We have to change and we're going to do it." And they do.
[time=2696] A five-word, one-third-effort sermon.
[time=2700] The least, I think he mumbled it to you.
[time=2703] 40 days and that was going to be destroyed and he walked out of the city.
[time=2708] They heard it.
[time=2709] Somehow they heard it and everything changed.
[time=2711] Everything changed.
[time=2714] How does Jonah respond to the great repentance?
[time=2717] Any preacher who got that response should be super happy.
[time=2723] How does he respond?
[time=2729] He's real upset.
[time=2732] The Hebrews says verse one, but to Jonah, it was a disaster.
[time=2740] Verse 10 says of chapter three, "God relented of the disaster he was going to do to them." He didn't do it.
[time=2746] How does Jonah respond?
[time=2747] That's a disaster.
[time=2748] The lack of a disaster is a disaster.
[time=2751] Poor and fortunate, Jonah, he was angry.
[time=2757] He prayed to the Lord.
[time=2759] This is remarkable.
[time=2760] Oh, Lord, is not this what I said when I was yet in my country?
[time=2765] That's why I made haste.
[time=2767] He wasn't like shuffling his feet to Tarshish.
[time=2769] He was running for Tarshish.
[time=2771] Tarshish question mark, remember that it is, the opposite direction.
[time=2775] Or I knew that you are a gracious God, merciful, slow to anger, abounding in steadfast love.
[time=2786] We're lensing from disaster.
[time=2787] I knew you would do it.
[time=2789] So I left.
[time=2793] That's funny.
[time=2796] It's tragic, but it's funny.
[time=2798] Do you see yourself, friends?
[time=2801] We are such a jumble of contradictions.
[time=2804] We had this remarkable confidence in God and we don't trust Him with the day to day things of our lives.
[time=2809] We sit in church and sing praises to Him and go home in the afternoon and keep all our problems to ourself and hold on tightly and white knuckle things.
[time=2817] This is what kind of God that He is.
[time=2821] Slow to anger, gracious, merciful, abounding in steadfast love.
[time=2826] The closest connection that I could find, commentators connect every major dictatorship
[time=2832] of the 20th century to the Assyrians, you name them, bloodthirsty, bloodthirsty, murderous
[time=2838] regimes, every one of them.
[time=2841] ISIS operates now in the same part of the world that the Ninevites occupied.
[time=2849] And they did the kind of things that the Assyrians are doing in this passage.
[time=2853] And our mindset is, destroy them, Lord.
[time=2860] And God is a slow, a God who's slow to anger and gracious.
[time=2864] I'm making a social political statement.
[time=2865] I'm saying, this is the kind of God that He is.
[time=2868] This is disposition and I think we should share it.
[time=2873] Verse three, it gets worse for Jonah, unfortunately.
[time=2876] Therefore now, O Lord, please take my life.
[time=2880] He wants to die because they're not going to die.
[time=2885] I want them to die and they're not so I want to die.
[time=2889] And the Lord said, is this right?
[time=2892] Do you do well to be angry?
[time=2895] Is that a good use of your time, Jonah?
[time=2898] God is assessing Jonah's ministry and it's not a super great assessment.
[time=2907] Verse five, I don't know what Jonah was looking to do, says that Jonah went out of the city and he sat on the hill to watch the fireworks.
[time=2916] Maybe he thought, I don't know what he was waiting to see.
[time=2919] What would happen?
[time=2922] By the way, if it troubles you that God changes his mind in this book, okay.
[time=2929] But know this, in the Bible, every time that God changes his mind, it's never from mercy to judgment.
[time=2936] It's always from judgment to mercy.
[time=2941] Think about how troubling that would be if it was the other way around.
[time=2944] If God was that fickle, if God was that prone to fits of anger, what he's not.
[time=2952] I won't theologically solve for you how God can change his mind, but he does a lot.
[time=2956] And it's always in the direction of mercy.
[time=2959] It's always in the direction of grace.
[time=2962] And that comforts me.
[time=2966] Jonah goes out of the city, sits to the east of the city, made a booth for himself.
[time=2969] It's a tent.
[time=2970] He builds a tent.
[time=2971] He goes camping.
[time=2972] He sat under it in the shade till he should see what would become of the city.
[time=2977] Now the Lord got appointed.
[time=2979] Lots of appointments in this book.
[time=2980] He appoints a fish in chapter 1 verse 17.
[time=2984] Now he appoints a plant and made the plant grow.
[time=2987] It's a very fast growing plant.
[time=2989] There it is.
[time=2990] That it might be a shade over his head to save him from his discomfort.
[time=2994] All this teach Jonah a lesson.
[time=2997] I think God was messing with Jonah, but he maybe kind of was messing with him a little bit.
[time=3002] So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the plant.
[time=3005] But when Don came up the next day, God appointed a worm, a fish, a plant, a worm.
[time=3012] All under God's.
[time=3013] God is directing all of them, every single one.
[time=3017] That attacked the plant so it withered.
[time=3019] And the sun rose, got appointed a scorching east wind.
[time=3022] He can do that.
[time=3024] And the sun beat down in the head of Jonah so that he was faint.
[time=3028] And he asks that he might die third time.
[time=3031] He wants to die.
[time=3032] And says, "Better for me to die than to live." And God says to Jonah, "God keeps pursuing Jonah.
[time=3038] I have to admit to you, if I was God I'd be like, fine.
[time=3042] You poor miserable fellow, I'll put you out of your misery." He says, " Jonah, do you do well to be angry about this plant?
[time=3050] I mean, only had a one day shelf life.
[time=3054] How bad can it be?" He said, "Yes." He's arguing with God.
[time=3061] Don't do that.
[time=3061] It's a pro tip this morning.
[time=3063] Don't argue with God.
[time=3064] You will going to lose.
[time=3067] Yes!
[time=3068] It's a good idea to be angry.
[time=3072] Angry enough to die fourth time.
[time=3075] The Lord said, "You pity the plant for which you did not labor.
[time=3080] Nor did you make it grow, which came into being in a night and perished in a night.
[time=3084] Should I not pity Nineveh?
[time=3090] Should I not have compassion on Nineveh?
[time=3093] That great city in which there are more than 120,000 persons
[time=3099] who don't know their right hand from their left." That's an expression friends in the Hebrew that they live in spiritual darkness.
[time=3107] They are totally separated from God.
[time=3112] And God's response is compassion.
[time=3116] And our response should be compassion.
[time=3118] Compassion in the sutu.
[time=3120] Compassion everywhere.
[time=3122] Compassion in Fort Wayne.
[time=3127] They live in spiritual darkness.
[time=3130] Friends, I want to end with an excerpt from a book by Tim Keller
[time=3136] about Jesus called King's Cross, recommended in the highest possible terms.
[time=3141] And I want you to listen to the way that Tim draws this comparison between the two.
[time=3147] And by the way, he sure seems like Jesus believes that Jonah was a real person.
[time=3152] Because he says in Matthew chapter 12, "As Jonah was in the belly of the fish for three days, I will be in the heart of the earth for three days." So Jonah is believed by him to be real.
[time=3161] And I believe Jesus.
[time=3163] I believe he was a real person.
[time=3164] And he was really in that fish somehow for three days.
[time=3170] I leave this with you, friends, by way of application.
[time=3173] And then we'll pray.
[time=3176] Would you listen?
[time=3178] We have a resource that can enable us to stay calm inside no matter what the storms or how the storms rage outside.
[time=3186] The gospel of Mark has deliberately laid out the accounts of the storm using language exactly parallels Jonah.
[time=3194] Both Jesus and Jonah in Mark chapter 4 are in a boat.
[time=3197] And both boats are overtaken by a storm.
[time=3199] The descriptions are identical.
[time=3201] Both Jesus and Jonah are both asleep.
[time=3205] In both stories, the sailors woke up the sleeper and said, "We're going to die." In both cases, there was a miraculous divine intervention, and the sea was calmed.
[time=3215] In both stories, the sailors then become even more terrified than they were before the storm was calmed.
[time=3222] Two identical stories, but one very big difference.
[time=3225] In the midst of the storm, Jonah said to the sailors, "In effect, there's only one thing to do.
[time=3229] If I perish, you survive.
[time=3233] If I die, you will live." May I throw him into the sea?
[time=3238] That doesn't happen in Mark's story.
[time=3241] Or does it?
[time=3243] I think Mark is showing that stories aren't actually different when he's staying back from it a bit and look at it with the rest of the story of Jesus in view.
[time=3250] In Matthew's gospel, Jesus says, "One greater than Jonah is here." He's referring to himself.
[time=3256] I'm the true Jonah.
[time=3259] Some day, I'm going to calm all storms, still all waves.
[time=3266] I'm going to destroy destruction, break brokenness, kill death.
[time=3272] How can he do that?
[time=3274] He could only do it because when he was on the cross, he was thrown willingly, like Jonah, into the ultimate storm.
[time=3281] Under the ultimate waves, the waves of sin and death, Jesus was thrown into the only storm that can actually sink us, the storm of eternal justice, of what we owe for our wrongdoing.
[time=3294] That storm was not calmed, not until it swept him away.
[time=3299] If the sight of Jesus bowing his head in that ultimate storm is burned into the core of who we are, we will never say, "God, don't you care?" If you know, he didn't abandon you in that ultimate storm,
[time=3313] what makes you think he would abandon you in much smaller storms that you're experiencing right now?
[time=3317] And someday, of course, he will return and still all storms forever.
[time=3323] Let that penetrate to the very center of who you are, and you will know that he loves you.
[time=3329] You will know that he cares, and you will have the power to handle anything in life with poise.
[time=3333] When through the deep waters, I call you to go.
[time=3337] The rivers of well shall not overflow, for I will be with you, your troubles to bless, and sanctify to you, your deepest distress.
[time=3345] The soul that on Jesus has leaned for repose.
[time=3350] I will not.
[time=3352] I will not desert to its foes.
[time=3356] That soul, though all hell, should endeavor to shake.
[time=3360] I'll never know never.
[time=3361] No never, forsake.
[time=3368] Do you have some Jonah in your life perhaps?
[time=3371] I think if you're like me, you can probably identify with this person, this historical figure, this prophet of God who didn't always look like much of a prophet, didn't look like much of a godly guy through so much of his life.
[time=3384] And maybe through today's message, as Pastor Steve has walked us through what it looks like to recalculate, even if I don't want to, even when it doesn't make sense, even when I mess up like Jonah, I hope you found something that you can not only identify with, but maybe there's something that God is really stirring inside of you as a response to what you've identified with.
[time=3405] I pray that maybe you're one of those people that Steve has talked about, that maybe the gospel means something new to you today.
[time=3411] Maybe you felt unworthy like a Jonah.
[time=3414] You felt like there's no way God could redeem or care about somebody like me, but for the first time, the gospel makes more sense to you.
[time=3422] For the first time, you see that Jesus is ready to meet you in the middle of your mess.
[time=3427] You see that today is that day of salvation, not because of what you can bring to the table, but because of what Jesus already brought to the table.
[time=3436] Jesus was the true Jonah.
[time=3438] He was thrown overboard, he was killed, he was slain for you and for me, he paid a price.
[time=3443] You couldn't pay, and I couldn't pay because of the sin that he never committed, the sin that you and I bring to the table, that Jesus lived that sinless life we could never live.
[time=3453] And because of that, because of his sacrifice, because he was that true Jonah, as we've looked at today, you can have hope, you can have salvation, and it can start for you in this moment.
[time=3464] Don't wait until you think you've got it all together.
[time=3466] Don't wait until you get your ducks in a row.
[time=3469] Don't wait until you've got everything lined up and ready to receive Jesus, because that day, if you keep waiting on it, may never come.
[time=3476] I believe that day is today.
[time=3478] And if that's the case for you, pause, step away, do what you got to do to meet Jesus because he's right there ready to meet you where you sit.
[time=3485] Yes, in this season of your life.
[time=3488] And if that's you, you step away and do that.
[time=3490] We want to hear from you, we want to know your story.
[time=3492] We want to walk alongside of you here at Black Hawk and show you what's next, because meeting Jesus isn't an end, it's the beginning.
[time=3500] Meeting Jesus changes everything about your life.
[time=3503] And we've got a booklet called Beginning Steps that's going to show you what's next in that journey after you meet Jesus, how you can keep moving forward into all that he has for your life.
[time=3513] We'd love to get one of those booklets into your hands.
[time=3515] We'll mail it to you.
[time=3516] You can pick one up here at the church office.
[time=3518] There's going to be some information on your screen, an email address, a phone number you can use to reach out to us.
[time=3523] Tell us your story and let us know how God is working in your life.
[time=3527] Maybe you need to be baptized.
[time=3528] There are several people that have taken that step recently here at Black Hawk and more to come, and maybe you need to take that step.
[time=3535] This command of Jesus that doesn't save you but is a response outwardly of something that happened to you inwardly as you received Jesus.
[time=3542] We'd love to show you the next steps in that process and just hear your story as we keep moving forward together here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=3550] Thanks again for tuning in, trusting us with your time this week, and I pray it's been a blessing, and next week we're going to continue recalculating.
[time=3558] We're going to look at what it means to recalculate even when it feels hopeless. I look forward to seeing you next week. God bless.
