[time=913] Praise God for that hope, amen?
[time=915] I hope you're excited to be here today and look at recalculating We are in our last installment of this series.
[time=922] I want to thank Steve Webster for doing a great job.
[time=924] Can we just thank him for talking about Joan last week?
[time=927] (Applause) So today we are going to wrap things up by looking at this concept of recalculating when it feels hopeless.
[time=938] We have been singing about hope all day but no doubt some of you, probably some of you who came up to the tables looking for the recalculating cards that we have in front of you and you picked up one and then you saw the next phrase and when I think that one applies just as much and you picked up two and then you went to the next one and you picked up all four cards because maybe you feel hopeless and if you're watching us online I want you to know you're a part of our extended family our online family you matter to us we're here and you can download those same cards at blackhawkministries.org/ recalculating you can also revisit that to have those moving forward but today we're going to look at a story in Luke 24 so look there with me in Luke chapter 24 so here's what we've been doing.
[time=982] We've been looking at people in Scripture.
[time=985] We decided we're not going to call them characters because that sounds like a fairy tale.
[time=989] It's not a fairy tale of this book that we call the Bible it's a historical factual record of people just like you and just like me who had to recalculate in their life and so here's what we've been doing.
[time=1001] We've been walking through the Old Testament thus far looking at people in Scripture who had to recalculate they had their recalculation roads just like we have and today I want to take us for this last installment though you're going to continue recalculating in your life can I get a name in?
[time=1018] We're going to look in the New Testament at Luke 24 because this is the day that Jesus has risen from the grave and can I encourage you for a minute this morning?
[time=1027] How about this side?
[time=1028] You seem kind of quiet I want to wake you up.
[time=1030] Can I encourage you this morning?
[time=1032] How about you guys in the balcony?
[time=1034] Can I encourage you this morning?
[time=1036] Alright and this side too can I encourage you?
[time=1039] How many of you know that Jesus went into a tomb but he didn't stay there?
[time=1045] He is risen!
[time=1049] He is alive and we can celebrate that today and some of you I know you say it's one thing to shout it from the rooftops it's one thing for those words to roll off of our lips but I still feel hopeless.
[time=1066] God's got a word for you today and I believe somebody is here it's going to leave here with a recalculation moment so we're going to go on a journey today a journey side by side all of us together are you ready to walk with me?
[time=1079] I've got some new shoes since we're going on a journey and wearing them today you may not have gotten new shoes but your shoes will do just fine for this journey and so you know Psalm 119 verse 105 says something about a light for our path we've been talking about this path that leads us to the plans of God because his purpose is bigger than all the stuff that we run into in our life and so Psalm 119 105 says Lord your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path and so I went out and found the most godly shoes I could possibly find you want to see them?
[time=1122] Now those are some godly shoes you're ready for this there we go let your cameras get a good look you're ready for a light for your paths today
[time=1132] some of you the rest of you are just like man I got to know where he bought those shoes here's what I'm going to do though isn't that cool?
[time=1140] I'm going to cut them off because you won't hear a word I say if I leave those on we're going on a journey from Jerusalem to Emmaus
[time=1150] Luke chapter 24 Jerusalem to Emmaus a seven mile journey and this journey is one that I think you can identify with this Emmaus road journey and so my question is this will you walk with me can we go on a journey together today because he has risen and you know the thing is this story happens the day Jesus defeated death and the people in this story felt very hopeless and you may feel very hopeless today but here's what I want you to know I think a lot of times we feel so hopeless in our recalculating journey because we look for hope in hopeless areas we look for the living among the dead Luke 24 verse 5 we're not going to read it that's when the angels met the people at the tomb and they said where's Jesus and he said he's not here he's risen why are you here looking for the living among the dead you may wonder why did they say that I think it was because they knew they felt hopeless and wanted to say why do you look for someone who's alive didn't he tell you he's just borrowing this tomb he wasn't here to stay he got a borrowed tomb because he wasn't going to be there very long didn't he tell you he was going to rise so why are you here looking for life among death why are you looking for hope in a place of hopelessness because he's not here he is risen but we do that don't we we look for hope in hopeless areas we look for life in areas that are dead we look for life in a dead Facebook comment section and we end up saying we're going to spend one minute make one comment but we end up spending half of our week caught up in this dead Facebook thread that's going to take you nowhere what about a text message thread that was dead a long time ago but you're still there looking for hope in a hopeless place maybe it's a dead relationship maybe it's a dead pursuit that you keep running after maybe it's you pursuing the things that God wants for your life but you run at it with your own strength and that's a dead pursuit here's a better one for all of us in this place we're in church today maybe you're looking for life in dead religion some of you thought I could go to church today and it would check off that box for me that's dead religion it won't get you anywhere I believe in church I believe we should be here scripture mandates that we should not forsake the gathering together the celebration but it all points to us going out there and being the church religion is not going to get you anywhere that's why Jesus came he came and paid that price so there could be a relationship that would trump religion any day of the week because he is risen he's not in a tomb he's alive today so let's talk about today what does Jesus do on the day he defeated death here's the thing he's got 40 days at this point he's going to be on earth for 40 days before he goes and is seated at the right hand of the Father he's got 40 days to convince the world here I am maybe pull up his sleeves and show the scars on his wrist he's got 40 days to make a difference and so here's the thing what does he do he goes for a walk he straps on his shoes his sandals and he goes for a walk he goes towards this place that we don't even know where it's out on the map scholars sometimes will pinpoint where they think a mayis would have been or where it is currently but we really don't know where it is he goes to this place that we don't know with people that are barely named in scripture we're going to look at kleopus somebody say kleopus that's a hard name to say isn't it and so here's what I'm going to do I think kleopus's friends see what I'm saying kleopus and his friends I think they called him kleo and so that's what we're going to do today can we call him kleo is that heretical alright we're going to do that we're going to call him kleo and so we'll talk about where he gets his name verse 18 in a minute but Jesus takes a walk and he reminds them those people these two travelers on the road to a mayis and he wants to remind you and me today that he's lured in some big areas of life and I want to give you three of those areas that'll help you recalculate even when it feels hopeless so if you're feeling hopeless today this is for you guys got a word for you in this place if you don't feel very hopeless today it's coming you'll feel hopeless tomorrow or the next day there's hopelessness that gets attached to this life and so I've got a word for you that comes straight from Jesus himself that's a pretty good source wouldn't you say so let's look number one verses 13 through 20 we see some promises some things about Jesus how he's lured in certain areas number one Jesus is Lord in my detours can I preach to you for just a minute about your detour I preach way better by the way when you talk back I also preach way shorter because if you don't talk back to me I think you're not hearing me and I'll just say it again and then maybe even again and then before long we miss lunch nobody wants to miss lunch right can I preach to you for a minute about your detour let's do it let's talk about Jesus being Lord in my detour verse 13 let's read that together and we see this idea of detours we're going to go through this one verse at a time one verse at a time so much in this passage verse 13 Luke 24 I'm going to read from the English standard version just the same version as the Bibles around your seat so you can follow along that very day what day was it the day that Jesus defeated death he's risen he's come out of the grave he's not found there anymore that very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus about seven miles from Jerusalem let's stop there for just a minute and I want you to realize what's happening here Jesus went to a place that's not known on a map today and he went there with two people that are not named in the Bible except for here one of them is not even named in this passage most scholars will believe that Cleopus had his wife with him you don't really know though it doesn't say it's just two people we're going to talk about that in just a second but he's going to an unknown place with some unknown people when he only has 40 days now if I'm Jesus PR representative I'm saying Jesus that's probably not the best road to be on if you want to make the most of these 40 days you need to be in Jerusalem because get this in Jerusalem is the place where the Passover was just celebrated Jerusalem is the place where all of this stuff had just happened where Jesus had just died Jerusalem is the place get this where the promised Holy Spirit was to come that's where it was happening yet these people felt hopeless Jerusalem is here and they go this way they put on their walking shoes they walk away in a fit of hopelessness not knowing where to turn that's where Jesus decided to go spend the first of his 40 days he goes and meets them in this very place and you know I want to ask you what kind of God is this that would speak to Cleo that would speak to you it would speak to me in crowds of hundreds and thousands in this place in this time what kind of God is this it's the kind of God that died on the cross for you it's the kind of God that wants to speak into your life in this moment in this season yes in the hopelessness that you walk in right now that's the kind of God that we serve I love that picture of this and two big things are happening right here in this place so God has just defeated death hell and the grave when Jesus came out of the tomb came the keys to life death hell and the grave he had conquered all he had won all God is changing the course of not just history but eternity that's number one thing that's happening here and I'm pretty glad it happened are you glad it happened but then the second thing's happening in this story in Luke 24 with these two travelers not only did Jesus just win that victory but he's walking with people who were going nowhere he's walking with unnamed unnoticed hopeless people
[time=1630] that's what's happening here and we know Cleo because he's named in verse 18 but we don't know maybe it's his spouse maybe it's a companion we don't really know but we don't know who's with him and if it was his spouse as many would believe you know it's probably that she's not named in scripture because women weren't always treated with the utmost respect in this time in history they're often unnoticed
[time=1654] unnamed marginalized did you know that we serve a God what kind of
[time=1660] God is it that would speak to those kind of people we serve a God who speaks to the marginalized and cares about the unnoticed people in the world did you know that maybe you feel like you're not noticed or you don't matter I want you to know in this place today that Jesus died for you you matter just like Cleo matters just like his travel companion matters and just like the kids you know when I look at scripture I love the story where Jesus took a little kids lunch and did one of his greatest miracles of feeding thousands of people with the lunch of a little child now what you got to know about this season is not just did women often go unnamed and unnoticed and marginalized in this society and culture but kids would often go uncounted when they would count the multitudes the kids and the women would often not even get uncounted in the number of things yet Jesus took the lunch of a little kid a marginalized unnoticed get them away from me kind of little little heathens can I get an amen right you've been that person you might have been that disciple saying Lord let me get them out of here for you but Jesus says no let them come to me they may not count in your math but in kingdom math that's where the multiplication happens some of you came in today feeling like you don't count in the numbers of heaven you feel marginalized feel isolated alienated like you don't matter but you're the person that Jesus wants to walk with on the road you're a recalculation road and you know I was reminded of this even this weekend here in this very room I got to stand on stage and I'll show you this picture this is some of our BCS kids look at this picture let's get us a picture though there they are this is grandparent's day for our school it's been a while since I've been able to tell you how proud of all of our ministries that I am here at Black Hawk and I think this gives us a good picture this is just first through sixth grade folks they're in our hallways in this place all week long and I got to stand do you see the little hole in the front and middle right at the end because here's the thing we got to ask at the end of this program how do we follow all those kids singing amazing grace my chains are gone and so this year we said let's just give the pastor the mic that was a bad choice so I got up and I got to stand in that little black hole that you see there with all those kids and I couldn't help but think how Jesus counts and numbers and cares about those little lives that we get to invest in every single day not only are those little ones the people that Jesus cares about but you are that person you matter to the kingdom of God some of you came today just to hear that not from me because my word means nothing it's his word that counts and you matter to him we're going to go on this recalculation road today and somebody's leaving this place with a detour but a good one Jesus is Lord in my detours and hey I know I'm still on verse 13 I saw the look especially over in this section I saw it I know I'm still on verse 13 I'm going to get moving a little faster look at verse 14 with me no before we do I got one more thing to say you know a lot of times we look for God in the destination don't we the dreams where we want to end up but I want to submit to you today that we often look for God in the destination but he wants to meet us in the detours you don't want to look for God on that road that you ended up on the season of life of hopelessness that you're in now you'd rather think about Jesus meeting you at the place that you've been praying for when he brings you out of the mess that you find yourself in can I get an amen in your notes it says Jesus is the destination he said I'm the way the truth and the life and no one comes with the Father except through me Jesus is the destination but he meets us in our detours just like he does in this passage God is not the God of arrival he's the God of the next step remember that when we talked about Abraham and uncertainty God's the God of the next step just take another step just take one more step he's not just the God of arrival he's not just the God of destination he's the God of the detours he's the God of the details that get you to where you're going and he's the God when I'm strong he's the God when I'm weak he's the God when I'm right he's the God when I'm wrong he walks with me and he talks with me that is the God that we serve
[time=1930] you should be excited about that because we don't deserve to go on a road with a savior yet he walks with me and he talks with me and you know I want to tell you something that I believe is going to happen today that Jesus followed them to the wrong place again amass why amass everything was going to happen in Jerusalem Jesus followed them to the wrong place you ready for this because grace will chase you down and meet you in your detour it was a seven mile journey verse 13 tells us and in the Bible seven is the number of completion so might say completion guess what your journey is not quite completed yet but this idea of completion in the Bible you see it a good example is in creation it's six days God created the earth pretty impressive right but this seventh day was pretty important because what did God do on the seventh day he rested he didn't rest though because he was tired he rested because he was done in one of these days he's going to look at you and say well done my good and faithful servant I'm done let's rest in eternity but here we are today and it still feels hopeless because we're not done yet look at somebody say I'm not done tell them mean it you got to mean it more than that I'm not done because he's not done with you he's not finished with you yet he's still getting to that place of completion let's look at verse 14 together right now verses 14 and 15 and they were talking with each other about all the things these things that had happened and while they were talking and discussing together Jesus drew near and went with them some of you are like Cleo and his companion and your discussions have been centered around hopelessness you feel hopeless in a relationship you feel hopeless in that job you've lost a loved one you're battling a divorce you're walking talking relationships or conversations have been pretty hopeless lately I love what Jesus does then there's Jesus I just love my Jesus then there was Jesus in hopelessness how do we calculate well we walk with Jesus and he just meets us right where we are even when we're going off course anybody go out of that today verses 16 and 17 I love this next verse because it's real and it's raw and it's where we are verse 16 but their eyes were kept from recognizing him and he said to them this is the words of Jesus what is this conversation you're holding with each other as you walk and they stood still looking sad what is it that's keeping you today from recognizing the presence of God in your life you know the scripture says they were kept from recognizing they didn't know it was Jesus they were kept some people would say that God kept them from recognizing that that he didn't want them to know yet you could get there but I'm of a different opinion when I read this I think that it was their blindness their hopelessness that they were caught in the middle of that kept them from recognizing some would disagree and say God had a lesson here that's not the point the point is I believe that we like Cleo like his companion we get kept from seeing where God is at work so many times in our life I've asked myself this week how many times have I missed a miracle because I'm consumed by my mess how many times do I miss the miracles of God because all I can see is the mess of my life maybe today it's not about what's happening to me as much as I've been making it maybe today it's not as much about the to me as it is the what he wants to do through me maybe that's where you find yourself today I love this passage too by the way you think the Bible's boring if you think the Bible's boring do not raise your hand I promise you will get some mean looks if you do that but some of you have heard people say the Bible's just boring I would challenge you and say you ready for this can I be bold today if you think the Bible's boring I think maybe it's not the Bible that's boring it's you that's boring because when I read my Bible I get excited when I read my Bible I see real raw humorous amazing life changing stuff in every twist and in every turn because I want you to get the picture right here Jesus is walking and talking with these two and he is Jesus is the author and finisher of our faith by whom through whom and for whom everything was made was made the author finisher of my faith the name at which every knee will bow every tongue will confess that he is Lord to the glory of God the Father the one who has an explicit direct unique purpose for Cleo for his companion for you for me and for all of us in the world today is walking and talking with them and he walks up and sends beside them and says hey what you guys talking about that's some funny stuff I don't care who you are that's just he doesn't and then later they go on we're going to read this in a second and they tell him about Jesus so they're telling Jesus about Jesus and about how other people couldn't find Jesus to Jesus and he lets them talk he lets them talk has God ever let you talk oh man there's so many times where I should have just but God has grace doesn't he? He walks with us and he talks with us even when we don't make sense and Jesus you know what I love about this picture too Jesus entered their sadness he walked with them in their deepest darkest moments of sadness and they were explaining to the one who created life the way life was supposed to turn out you ever done that you feel like Cleo now don't you? I know I have as I've looked at this story and you know a lot of times we think that the God who knows that the birds of the air have fallen from the sky doesn't know about our hopelessness or we feel like our brokenness and sadness would chase God away but the Bible says to us that a broken and contrite heart the Lord will not despise it's in our brokenness that our eyes are open to the blessings that God has for our lives. We'll get verse 18, we'll read verses 18 through 20. Then one of them named Cleopus there he is hey Cleo, everybody say hey Cleo answered him are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened in these days? I just love it you'll get it one day. Verse 19 and he said to them I love this part what things I don't know tell me I won't show you my wrist yet I love Jesus in his compassion and grace in this moment and they said to him concerning Jesus of Nazareth a man who was underline that a man who was a prophet and mighty indeed in word before God and all the people verse 20 and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death and crucified him. They're telling Jesus about Jesus yet Jesus listens and he walks with them and sometimes we do that too don't we? We want to tell Jesus what he needs to do with my life. What he needs to do with my church what he needs to do with my kids but what we need to realize is what Cleo is walking on a road to realize in this season of his life is that it's not your church it's not your kids it's not your life it's not mine Jesus Jesus says I will build my church and guess what the best part about that you may feel like you got released from that equation no who is his church? You and me we are his church so when Jesus says I'll build my church it's not him snatching it away from us though he could because it is his it's him saying I'm going to build you I'm going to build the people like Peter the knuckleheads that can't do anything right at times I'm going to take them and I'm going to flip the script I'm going to do things that don't make sense and I'm going to help them recalculate and I will build my church and even the gates of hell can't prevail against it.
[time=2438] That's the God that we serve but sometimes we miss what is because we're stuck in what was. Can I ask you are you missing what is or what God will do because you're stuck in what was think of Cleo in this situation he's standing beside the great I am but he starts with he was he was a prophet but he's gone you do that sometimes like me we stand next to and in the presence of the great I am but tell him what was I pray we don't miss what God has for us look at the second thing here that's the detour we see they're on this detour now Jesus meets them in the detour but starting in verse 21 let's look together one of the most powerful verses I think for us if you're feeling hopeless today helps us see the second promise Jesus is Lord in my detours but Jesus is Lord in my disappointments. Verse 21 says this but we had hope say we had hoped underline that but we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel yes and besides all this it's now the third day since these things happen it's the third day but evidently he didn't do what he said we had hoped he was the one some of you in this place and I want you to know that you feel hopeless sometimes because real hope maybe we're grasping onto things that aren't real hope real hope can hold on on Friday knowing that Resurrection Sunday is on the way Jesus died on a Friday real hope is tested on the Fridays of your life when everything seems hopeless and you know you're on the road to nowhere you're on the road to Emmaus you've got your shoes on you're walking as best as you can but you've gone off on this detour and you feel disappointed like Cleopus and his companion that's where God meets you some of you here and you would say I had hoped the medicine would work you would say I had hoped I would be married by now I had hoped that this struggle wouldn't still be a part of my life and I prayed and I had hoped that God would answer me but he must not care he's so silent he must be this distant million miles away God because he hasn't changed my situation I had hoped that he would show up I had hoped in this season of my life I wouldn't be where I am that I wouldn't be here but I would be there I had hoped they had hoped that Jesus was going to be the one that they had talked about that they had discussed that's where we end up so many times and you know could it be that we look for God in our dreams what we hope for our expectations we look for God often in our dreams but he wants to stop and meet us in our disappointments maybe that's where he's at work today is in your disappointment you've just been looking to the dream not that he didn't put it there he may have or he may not have the point is this though maybe we get so fixated on what we wish was that we miss the right now even the stuff we don't like that God desires to work in the most if you trust his promise
[time=2632] his purpose our charge is just to walk in his path that's my challenge to you today and also don't judge a journey before it's over you notice they're still on I don't know the middle of the journey they're not at mile 7 yet don't judge your journey or the journey of somebody elses based on where they're supposed to be at mile 7 when they may still be at mile 1.5
[time=2654] you may still be at mile 1.5 don't judge the end of the journey by mile 1.5 just take another step just walk in his path even when he seems silent still take another step still trust his purpose trust in his path that he has marked out for you and he'll lead you to his plan if you take another step so let's keep walking together on this journey verse 22 through 24 I love where Jesus comes in right after they continue here they continue more over some of the women of our company amazed us they were at the tomb early in the morning and when they did not find his body first of all they went to the wrong place he's not in the tomb he's on the road aren't you glad he was on the road the tomb was vacant they didn't see him there and they had even seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive verse 24 some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said but him they did not see and then he talks to them but before that remember not to judge they were Cleo's judging these people who couldn't see Jesus when he couldn't even see the gaps in his own walk with Jesus don't do that don't be that person he's thinking about caught up in that tying it to his own hopelessness they went to the wrong place and a lot of times we like them when we can't find the reason we just decide let's just get off the road but maybe God is reminding you just to take another step in your notes it says that God is just as willing to get this write this down keep this with you this week God is just as willing to meet you in the mundane as he is in the miraculous a lot of times we look for God to show up in the dramatic moments of our life but he wants to show up in the details in the disappointments in those things that don't seem to make a lot of sense he's willing to meet you in the mundane the monotonous those painstaking steps in your life just like he is willing to do miraculous healings just like he's willing to miraculously pull you from the clutches of sin and death and hell in the grave he's willing to walk with you in the everyday life that you face verses 25 to 27 Jesus responds verse 25 he said to them O foolish ones after he'd listened and had all this patience and slow of heart to believe what all the prophets have spoken was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory and beginning with Moses and all the prophets he interpreted to them all the scriptures the things concerning himself in the middle of their disappointments Jesus wanted to speak and I want to challenge you today if you feel hopeless let Jesus remind you who he is in this place today because he is
[time=2820] speaking give Jesus a chance to show you what he can do in your life just show you who he is in your life even if you can't there's an old song if I can't trace his hand trust his heart if you can't trace his hand trust his heart today in this place keep walking keep stepping hold on to hope the last thing we see I'll end with this last thought about promises and how we can walk with God not just in the detours he's Lord in the detours he's Lord in the disappointments but he's Lord in the dead ends they get to the end of the journey what should be a dead end in their life some of you don't tell me but how many of you would say I feel like I've already run into the dead end and I feel like I've run into this ending of this season and I don't know where to turn and I may just give up well don't give up yet look at verse 28 with me verse 28-29 so they drew near to a village where they were going and he acted Jesus did acted as if he were going further but they urged him strongly join them in this moment they urged him strongly they still don't know who he is stay with us for his toward evening and the day is now far spent so he went in to stay with them some of you just cry out to Jesus and say stay with me one more step I don't know what you're doing you may say I don't know Jesus you may say I'm not even sure I fully trust Jesus with my life yet this is a place you can belong before you believe you with me you can belong at this place before you believe because that's the people Jesus ran after so ask him to stay with you one more step ask him to stay with you one more day ask him to show you who he is and he will patiently listen and walk alongside you your life just like he did in Cleos he's the lord of my dead ends verse 30 and 31 when he was at the table I love this part one of the best communion passages in the Bible we don't often use it though we're going to do the Lord's supper together in a few minutes verse 30 when he was at the table with him he took the bread and blessed it and broke it and gave it to them have you ever noticed that Jesus has always taken over he went in to be a visitor but he took the bread he blessed it and he broke it and he directed where it was going he goes in to this house and to our lives where we think he's coming in as a visitor but he ends up being the host I think that's a pretty good place for us to get to in our journey on our road of recalculating are you with me you thought he was just going to be a visitor but today he's going to be the host verse 31 after he gave it to him their eyes were opened and they recognized him and he vanished from their site I would guess now you don't know why they recognize what opened their eyes I can just picture this he blessed it and broke it he took it first of all he took it he took it and blessed it and broke it and gave it to him I can just picture this is just my opinion it's just a word picture that I've made ahead of what could have happened in this moment but I can imagine that it was the risk that were torn to shreds that had scars from dying on a cross as he gave it to them they saw something that was a lot more than bread they saw something that represented a lot more than the hopelessness of their life they saw the wrists or the nails pierced the hands of Jesus and they remembered and recognized that he was still Lord that he's still alive today's going to be that day in somebody's life today as we remember as we do the Lord's supper as we look at this scripture it's going to be a time where you remember what he's done for you how he's been there for you how he's revealed himself to you let you touch his wrist and it's going to lead you to a place of recognizing how he's at work in your life it's time to remember in a way that will help you recognize that he is still Lord that he's still working on you the brokenness the broken bread the broken Savior the brokenness that came from the hopelessness that they walked in that their eyes of belief were opened it's in their hopelessness that their eyes of their hope were opened up guys going to do that in your life I believe today look at verses 32 through 34 with me they said to each other he left he's vanished he's gone can you imagine this conversation oh man I'll be honest can you give me some grace for a minute I would probably go you idiot what are you doing you didn't recognize him oh we're crazy what he oh what's going on how did we not know how did you not know it's your fault right that's what you would have done your fault you should have told me you knew it was him how did you not know right but here we are their eyes were open life has changed verse 32 they said each other did not our hearts burn within us no kidding while we while he taught with us on the road and when he opened us the scriptures and get this verse 33 they rose they rose when you recognize when you remember you have to rise up and do something with it some of you are recognizing some stuff today but it's not enough to see it you got to go and believe it and walk it out and rise up and go somewhere with it that's what they did and they rose up same hour and returned to Jerusalem and they found the 11 and those that were gathered them together saying the Lord has risen indeed and has appeared to Simon stop there for a minute and just think about what God is helping you recognize what God is trying to show you I got a word for somebody in this place today and it's about resurrection do you know that resurrection does not just mean that Jesus got up resurrection means that you can get up to resurrection doesn't just mean that he got up but that I can too maybe it's time to stand up to recognize what God is up to that he's Lord in your detours he's Lord in your disappointments and he is Lord even in your dead ends we bow with me just close your eyes for a minute reflect on what that may mean for you in a few moments we're going to take a time of communion together but before we do I just think it's important for us to realize that sometimes we get stuck on the crucifixion when we're sitting next to resurrection you've been stuck on crucifixion perhaps but the resurrection has already happened and faith is going to do something in your life today faith is going to keep your hopes up even though your situation may be going down nobody looking around for a moment if you're a believer if you're a follower of Jesus I want to challenge you to ask how God wants to do something new in your life today maybe it's in a detour discouragement a disappointment or a dead end and talk to him about that in this place and if you're here today nobody's looking around because this is just you in Jesus and you would say I feel hopeless today but I realize that today is the day where I need to give my life to Jesus today is the day where I need to reach salvation I would love to tell you pastor that I know that I'm going to go to heaven when I die that I have a personal relationship with Jesus and I'm a hundred percent confident that I'm going to spend eternity with God in heaven because of a relationship with his son Jesus Christ that he died for me and he rose again and I believe that and I know I've walked into that trusted in that to save me but I can't maybe that's you you would say I just can't say that I'm a hundred percent there and the gospel is for you you're those people that Jesus ran after his grace is chasing you down on your road your recalculation road today in this place and I'm not going to lead you in a prayer because I think your heart's already screaming it but I want you to know what the gospel is the gospel is simple it's not something that I could do it's not something that anybody in this world could do something that Jesus already did the gospel is good news because it's already happened Jesus already did it he's already paid the price he died on that cross after living the sinless life that you couldn't live and that I couldn't live he paid the price the penalty for our sins our sins separate us from God we don't like to use that word a lot and we don't want to offend but you're sinful and I'm sinful and it separates us from God all of us but he paid that price for you and for me that penalty we could never pay but it didn't end there he went to a borrowed tomb because he didn't plan to stay he rose from the grave and he defeated your sin and he gave you a spot in the family of God where you come in as you must believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that he's Lord that's what scripture tells us and it says you shall be saved not you might be if God's in a good mood that day no you will be saved no if ands or buts about it it can happen today what the enemies whispering in your ear I don't care who may have told you you could never get to that place Jesus doesn't care he's meeting you on your recalculating road and today is the day of your salvation would you cry out to him I'm just gonna give you a moment right now in this place just say to him Jesus I need you ask him to save you it doesn't have to say it you don't have to say it like I just said it he doesn't want you to say it like I said he wants you to say it from your heart to his so we cry out to him in the silence of this moment right now no matter where you may be in your life no matter how hopeless no matter
[time=3402] what this season of life is bringing your way I just pray that today you found some ways to recalculate even when life seems hopeless what road have you been on?
[time=3411] maybe you put on some shoes today and went for a journey and went for a walk and you found that Jesus met you on that road and on that road today you know that your next step is salvation and you know that perhaps you've been putting that step off and holding off on taking that leap because maybe you want to get some things squared away you want to get some things right before you took a step but maybe today you've realized what I've come to find is that I can't get anything right without Jesus being a part of my life and so the first step on this road whatever your road entails is to let Jesus meet you there I believe his grace perhaps has chased you down as we've looked at today on that road that hopeless road that maybe you found yourself on and today's your day of salvation take that leap know that the gospel really is as simple as we've outlined today that it's all about believing Jesus paid a price you could never pay by living a sinless life you could never live dying on a cross paying that penalty for your sins for my sins and then he rose from the dead Luke 24 that we've looked at today was that same day Jesus on the same day he defeated death went and met hopeless people on the road to nowhere maybe he's doing the same thing in your life right now believe he died for you believe he paid that price you couldn't pay believe that he rose from the dead and just offer him all of your life say Jesus I'm not going to try to save me anymore because I can't do it I trust you to save me I turn from me and turn to you and that's really what salvation that's what the gospel is all about and yes it really is that simple and so I challenge you to take that step today and if you are taking that step if you're looking at moving forward in your fate even if you are not ready but you still have questions about that or perhaps it's time for you to take the step of baptism and to follow Jesus in those next steps let us know we've got a group of people that would love to hear from you I would love to hear from you know your story we've got resources we'd like to put into your hands there's going to be information on your screen that is an email address and a phone number you can use to reach out to us let us know how we can walk alongside you we've got a book as well that I'd love to put into your hands it's called beginning steps a growth guide for new believers that will just give you some next steps and show you some easy next steps to take knowing that entering into faith is not an end it's a beginning and so let us walk with you in your new beginning in your new chapter as you recalculate even when life seems hopeless thanks again for giving us some time this week and know that we are in your corner that God is just getting started with you and we're excited to see what he has in store
[time=3586] you
