[time=249] to work and we consider you here at Black Hawk Ministries just a part of our big family.
[time=254] So thanks for giving of your time this week to hear from God, to hear what he has in store for you.

[time=275] So I encourage you just to be ready for God to work, to be open-handed, to receive what he has for you, but even more than that, to be open to moving forward, not just gazing but also going as we look at that today.

[time=735] (gentle music) (audience applauds) - Well, those are some big words that we just sang.
[time=748] We're gonna talk today about how we can live out what we sing about here at Black Hawk.
[time=753] We're gonna talk about gazing or going today.
[time=755] And so I'm ready now, I will follow you.
[time=758] That's really the anthem of who we strive to be as a church, you've heard from missionaries, you've heard from life that were changed in baptism today.
[time=767] What a privilege it is just to be a part of what he's up to, can I get a name, man?
[time=771] It's great to have city life here on our front row.
[time=774] There's just one thing you need to know though.
[time=775] If you're gonna be on the front row, you gotta help me preach.
[time=778] Can you do that?
[time=779] We're gonna have some fun today.
[time=780] If you're a guest with us, thank you for joining us, being a part of our family.
[time=784] If you're watching us online as well, you're a part of our family also.
[time=788] We've got a big family that goes far beyond this room, and it's exciting to be a part of it today.
[time=793] We wanna talk to you about gazing or going.
[time=795] Acts chapter one, the book of Acts in your New Testament, chapter number one, Acts chapter one, verses six through 11 is where it will be in just a moment.
[time=805] And so we're coming off here at Black Hawk, if you're new with us or if you're not, as you well know, we're coming off of a series of messages 10 weeks focusing on God's will, recalculating we've called it.
[time=816] God's will, finding his will in the midst of life's dead ends.
[time=820] And so a good fitting transitional week for us now is going to be what I will just simply call going back to the basics, because if we're gonna follow God's will for our lives, we cannot lose sight of what drives us as a church.
[time=835] We cannot lose sight of our mission.
[time=837] We have to stay hydrated, if you will.
[time=840] There are a lot of dehydrated ministries and churches around the world.
[time=844] Churches close their doors on a daily basis, even in the United States and throughout the world.
[time=849] Why?
[time=850] I'm often a believer that it just simply goes back to losing grip on the mission.
[time=855] So we've got to stay hydrated with what matters here at the church.
[time=859] And as years grow by, what I've seen happen is what I'll call mission creep.
[time=864] Somebody say mission creep.
[time=865] What does that mean?
[time=867] It means it creeps off to something that's not the mission anymore, where our focus gets deterred from what God has intended for it to be.
[time=875] So we've got to stay hydrated.
[time=876] Anybody thirsty this morning ready for some living water?
[time=880] Speaking of that, I was talking to my kids.
[time=883] I've got a funny story with my two.
[time=885] I've got a boy and a girl.
[time=886] We're adding to our family through adoption after the first of the year.
[time=889] But Caleb is almost seven.
[time=891] Callie just turned five.
[time=892] And so they were in the car with Jessica and myself.
[time=894] And we were talking about staying hydrated at school, particularly.
[time=898] And we said, you know, when you go to the water fountain, when you have an opportunity to go to the water fountain, you should drink some water.
[time=903] You should stay hydrated at school 'cause they get tired and they forget.
[time=906] Sometimes we're talking about the importance of staying hydrated.
[time=909] And without missing a beat, my little almost seven-year-old Caleb looks at his sister and says, yeah, Callie, if you go to the water fountain and you drink that water, that water is living water and you will live forever.
[time=920] (congregation laughing) I said, thank you Lord, he's getting something.
[time=926] Even though he may think it comes from the water fountain, at least he's getting it from the right source, right?
[time=930] He knows the real source too.
[time=932] And it's that living water that we're here to talk about today and how we can stay hydrated.
[time=936] Look at Acts chapter number one.
[time=939] And we're gonna look today continuing that theme of finding God's will because I'll tell you this, individually and corporately, we will never find the will of God if we forget our mission.
[time=949] And so today I wanna talk about two passages that really define that mission straight from the words of Jesus.
[time=955] So in Acts chapter one, let's read that together today.
[time=958] Acts chapter one, verses six through 11.
[time=960] Last week I talked to you about Luke 24 and how Jesus, the day of his resurrection, what he did, he went on the road to Emmaus.
[time=967] He met these weary travelers who felt hopeless and he had 40 days from the day he was raised from death, raised from the grave where he walked out, defeated death hell in the grave on our behalf.
[time=978] He had 40 days to make himself known.
[time=980] We now find ourselves, Acts chapter one, where he's going to ascend and go back to be seated at the right hand of the Father where, by the way, he's still there.
[time=989] He's still on the throne.
[time=991] It may not feel like it some days, but he is still there.
[time=995] But there's some things we can learn from how he got there is what I'd like to look at today.
[time=999] Who's ready for the word?
[time=1000] Acts chapter one, verse number six.
[time=1003] So when they had come together, being the disciples, they asked him, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom of Israel?
[time=1009] They thought that this would be a political resolution that would be coming about that Jesus would overthrow Rome and he would make everything right right now, but Jesus had a little bit of a different plan.
[time=1018] There was a time gap that we now find ourselves in and he's going to explain that to them.
[time=1023] That's why they asked the question, now to verse seven.
[time=1025] He said to them, is it not for you, it is not for you to know the times or the seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority, but here's a very familiar verse, perhaps to some of us, verse eight, Acts one, eight.
[time=1038] But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the end of the earth, verse nine.
[time=1050] And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, he was lifted up and a cloud took him out of their sight.
[time=1057] And while they were gazing into heaven, now in their defense, I'd probably be gazing too.
[time=1064] If Jesus was just taken from my sight, but something happens here that I think is so meaningful for us today, verse 10 there.
[time=1070] While they were gazing into heaven, as he went, behold two men stood by them in white robes, verse 11 and said, men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven?
[time=1082] This Jesus who has taken up from you into heaven will come, somebody say will come, because he's coming again, can I get an amen?
[time=1091] This Jesus that was taken up from you into heaven will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven and that is the word from God for us today.
[time=1102] And let's dig into that, I wanna give you two principles from that passage, two principles that I believe will help us as a church, but also help you as the church, because by the way, we're not called to go to church, just so you know, we're called to be the church.
[time=1116] And we're a be the church kind of church.
[time=1118] We get our hands dirty, we get our shoes muddy, going out and presenting the gospel and making a difference in our community.
[time=1124] That's what we're all about.
[time=1125] That's what the mission of Jesus is all about.
[time=1127] But two ways, two principles that I believe will help you answer that question, am I gazing or am I going?
[time=1133] Number one, we see it in the first few, versus people above preferences.
[time=1139] Let me go in and get that collective groan out of the way, go, mmm, that was a week groan.
[time=1143] Go ahead, get it out of the way, mmm, mmm.
[time=1146] You got any preferences in your life?
[time=1150] You like to eat at certain places, you like for certain songs to be a part of the worship service, you like for your kids to dress a certain way, you like to present, we have preferences, but a lot of times in life, the tendency is that we can turn inward and our preferences can start to override the call that Jesus has given us to be all about people.
[time=1168] Have you ever noticed that Jesus was all about people?
[time=1171] Every command, every directive that he gives was about relationship.
[time=1175] We have a relational God.
[time=1177] Our God is a relational God.
[time=1179] Go back to Genesis, don't do this now, but sometime in your studies, go back to Genesis 2.
[time=1184] Genesis chapter two, when God's creating the world, he creates man and he has Adam here.
[time=1189] And then he says, you know, it's not good for man to be alone.
[time=1193] You remember that?
[time=1194] It's not good for man to be alone.
[time=1196] And a lot of times for me, I don't know, subconsciously, it's like I thought, well, that was probably because of the fall, because sin entered the world, and so God knew we were gonna need some help.
[time=1205] That would make some sense, but you know what?
[time=1207] You'll see in Genesis two, God said it's not good for man to be alone before sin entered the world.
[time=1213] So think about that for a moment.
[time=1215] God looked at perfect creation that he had made.
[time=1218] Everything was perfect, exactly like he wanted it, and still looked at it and said it's still not good for man to be alone, it's perfect.
[time=1225] If it's gonna be perfect, it's gotta have relationship.
[time=1227] We have a relational God who values you above everything else.
[time=1235] That's a pretty powerful statement.
[time=1236] Somebody came today just to know that you're valuable to God because you are.
[time=1241] People above preferences, I wanna give you a picture of the church.
[time=1243] I believe Jesus is building as we see it in this passage, and then we'll go back and look at even Matthew 28, where we find the great commission in just a little bit as well.
[time=1252] Two things about the church.
[time=1253] What kind of church is Jesus building?
[time=1255] He said, I will build my church, and even the gates of hell can't prevail against it.
[time=1260] First of all, a church that looks like heaven on earth.
[time=1264] I just believe that's the church that Jesus is building, a church that looks like heaven on earth.
[time=1270] And my favorite verse that gives me a picture of what heaven should look like on earth, I believe from the Bible is Revelation chapter seven and verse nine.
[time=1278] Well, we're reminded this vision of heaven, it's this vision of where we're going, it's this vision of our ultimate goal, and John is writing about what he saw, and he says that he sees this multitude that no one could even number.
[time=1290] People from every nation, from every tribe, from all peoples were gathered together at the throne of God, at the foot of the Lamb, in white robes and palm branches, and they said salvation comes from the Lord, and they worship with one unified, beautiful, powerful voice.
[time=1311] But I love that verse because it says, heaven's going to be diverse.
[time=1315] A lot of times we want our preferences and we just want to surround ourselves, can I preach a minute this morning?
[time=1321] Can I preach a minute?
[time=1322] I got two people that gave me permission, that's enough.
[time=1324] Or two or three are gathered in the Lord's name, they will be also, amen.
[time=1327] A lot of times we let our preferences get us to the spot where we just want to wall things off and make things comfortable, and I believe there could be a lot of people, it's going to be perfect in heaven, so this won't happen, but in our earthly state, there would be a lot of people disappointed today with what heaven will be one day.
[time=1344] Because we're going to be around people that don't look like us, talk like us, think like us, dress like us, vote like us.
[time=1351] But I want you to know that we should strive today
[time=1358] for what will be that day.
[time=1360] We should strive to be a church that looks like heaven on earth today, if heaven's going to be diverse and look different than perhaps we should practice for it today, who's with me.
[time=1371] I want to be a church that looks like heaven on earth.
[time=1374] I want to be a church that values people above preferences,
[time=1382] that values people above my comforts, and you know when I look at life, I see that we workshop and live around people who don't look like us, act like us.
[time=1393] I just think that church should look the same way.
[time=1396] Why? Because Kevin thinks so, no, because Jesus said so.
[time=1401] Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth, is there a reason he did Samaria?
[time=1405] You know, we talk about how that's local, it's our state, it's our nation, and it's here, there, and everywhere, and that is true, but I'll tell you, Samaria was a little bit of a unique statement from Jesus because people didn't really get much respect in Samaria.
[time=1420] Their skin colors were different, they were half-breed, people that nobody would pay any attention to, but Jesus said to his disciples, we must needs go through Samaria earlier in his life because Jesus wants us to be about all people.
[time=1433] He wants us to put people above preferences and above all of our comforts, and in a world that's full of racism and division.
[time=1442] Hear me, we are called, you are called, say I am called, say I am called, I am called to be a minister of reconciliation and a giver-outer.
[time=1452] That's a theological word for you, a giver-outer of unity.
[time=1456] We're called to be unifying factor that people should look at this church and say something's different about that church and the statement that Martin Luther King made so many years ago where he said in America, in Christian America, the most segregated hour is 11 a.m. on Sunday mornings, even though it's still true in so many cases should not be true today if we're a church that looks like heaven on earth, because when we value what God values, we see things happen now that will happen later.
[time=1486] How do we do that?
[time=1489] What does that look like?
[time=1490] That's what's going through your mind.
[time=1492] And I want to give you a challenge that God's been challenging me with.
[time=1495] And the challenge is this, that our church won't be diverse or look like heaven on earth until our calendars look that way.
[time=1503] Our church won't be diverse until our calendars are.
[time=1507] How can we fill our calendars with things that will stretch us?
[time=1511] Things that will move us out of our comfort zone, things that will take me to places to be around people that maybe I'm not accustomed to being around.
[time=1520] We won't transform Sunday morning until we transform Saturday night.
[time=1526] In your notes, as Christians, we're called to build bridges, not walls.
[time=1532] Can I get a name in?
[time=1533] We're called to build bridges.
[time=1536] But so many times our tendency is to build a wall around what we want, what we hope for, what we're comfortable with.
[time=1542] I knew this was going to be an uncomfortable ceremony.
[time=1544] Just shake that uncomfortableness off for a minute.
[time=1546] It's okay, we've got to be uncomfortable if we're going to follow Jesus.
[time=1550] I think it was David Platt and his book, Radical, that said to anyone wanting a safe, trouble-free life that's free from danger, stay away from Jesus.
[time=1559] Because he wants to stretch us and take us to places we have never even been before.
[time=1565] I want us to do life with people who don't look like, act like, think like, or even vote like we do.
[time=1572] When I look around today and look on my news feeds, I see politics, I see government, I see all these things that Christians should be a voice in.
[time=1581] Don't hear me say that I'm not saying that.
[time=1584] But I see a lot of people who get so consumed by what's the president going to do?
[time=1591] What's our government going to do?
[time=1593] What's that nation going to do?
[time=1595] Can I get a name in?
[time=1596] You see it everywhere, it's just all in front of us all the time.
[time=1600] And I want to challenge you that we get consumed so many times by these earthly thrones in our life.
[time=1608] But today I want you to hear me when I say that Jesus who ascended to the right hand of the Father is still there today.
[time=1614] And so today I want you to hear me when I say, Jesus is not coming back on the backs of elephants or doggies.
[time=1620] And so let's not be consumed with the elephant or the donkey, but be consumed by the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world.
[time=1628] That's what the world needs from us.
[time=1632] That's when a church starts to look like a church that is heaven on earth.
[time=1636] And that's what God's called us to.
[time=1638] We're taking intentional steps for that to make, here's what I'm saying, to make what will matter then matter right now.
[time=1645] And to make what will not matter then, not matter right now.
[time=1651] That's a hard challenge.
[time=1652] But that's what we want to do here at Black Hawk.
[time=1655] We're taking some big steps for that to reach the nations.
[time=1658] The nations have come to Fort Wayne in so many ways.
[time=1660] We're blessed in that that we can go around the world by being in our backyards.
[time=1664] And so Chris and Bailey Beta, where are they at?
[time=1666] I think over here somewhere.
[time=1667] They are.
[time=1668] There they are.
[time=1669] They wanted to hide.
[time=1670] They're over here.
[time=1671] And our global missions team, they've worked very hard to put together a plan for us to do two key things on Wednesday nights.
[time=1677] This is just one such example.
[time=1678] You heard some more earlier.
[time=1680] We have English as a second language going on on Wednesday nights and a study called Bridges.
[time=1684] And that is primarily to equip Christians to be able to speak into and reach this world of Muslim faith.
[time=1692] That so often we get turned away from us and afraid of.
[time=1696] How do we step into the things that we're often afraid of?
[time=1699] And so we're equipping a group of people.
[time=1701] And there have been more than 50 people who've been involved in that.
[time=1704] And for that, I commend you because praise God.
[time=1706] Praise God, you've stepped forward and accepted that challenge to be Jesus to our world.
[time=1711] And so over 50 people have been involved there.
[time=1713] And I want to tell you how you can get involved.
[time=1715] There's a few key ways that I want you to know about that you can get involved with our Bridges.
[time=1720] If that struck a chord with you, we're partnering with another church, Manuel Christian, here in Fort Wayne.
[time=1725] And we're partnering with International House to really spread our horizons.
[time=1731] Broaden our borders is what we're attempting to do.
[time=1734] So this coming Wednesday is the last night of that study.
[time=1736] But we're partnering with that other church for you to hear some more about some tours with International House.
[time=1741] And so if you want to be a part of that, then there's a card like this.
[time=1744] It's in your seat, the easiest way.
[time=1745] Fill that out, check volunteering.
[time=1747] And you could do it right now.
[time=1749] How many times does the preacher say write down, do something different while he talks?
[time=1752] I want you to do that.
[time=1753] It'd be a great step for you.
[time=1754] And then with ESL, we have-- this is probably my favorite most easy way to get involved.
[time=1759] You ready for this?
[time=1760] We have all of these people from other nations, people who are learning English, who are coming onto our campus.
[time=1767] God's brought them to our doorstep.
[time=1768] And so we want to challenge people, just like you, to step out and have a conversation over dinner.
[time=1773] We have simple suppers every Wednesday night from 5 to 6 o'clock.
[time=1776] And so for that hour, we need people just to sign up.
[time=1779] We've had a couple of people, but we need a lot more, because we have a lot of people coming onto our campus to volunteer and say, you know what?
[time=1785] I'll sit across the table and eat my dinner with these people from other nations, these people from different backgrounds, and just have a conversation and tell them my story, hear their story, and eat some food together.
[time=1796] Who would be willing to do that?
[time=1798] And so if you are, then fill out that card.
[time=1800] We've got a need for that.
[time=1801] Even this Wednesday, you can jump on board.
[time=1803] Another way you can get on board with us, we have so many people that are bringing their kids on Wednesday nights for this class.
[time=1808] We need people to step up and help love on those babies.
[time=1811] These kids that often come in afraid, because it's a new culture for them.
[time=1814] It's a new place for them.
[time=1816] Could you come and just play some games with them so while their parents maybe learn English?
[time=1821] Pretty simple, pretty easy, isn't it?
[time=1823] God's given us some amazing tools to be able to make a difference right where we sit here in Fort Wayne, a way that we can put people above preferences, and a way we can be a church that looks like heaven on earth where all nations and all tribes and all people from all languages come together for the gospel of Jesus.
[time=1841] Can we celebrate and think our global mission team, the Bailey's for all they're doing there, and so many more things are happening.
[time=1847] (audience applauding) And so maybe God has stirred in you that you need to jump on board, so fill this out and let us know that.
[time=1855] Let's continue on.
[time=1856] A second thing about this people over preferences ideas, a church that looks like heaven on earth, but a church that is a hospital for sinners, not a hotel for saints.
[time=1867] That's what we strive to be here at Black Talk.
[time=1870] We wanna be a place that you can come even before you believe like we believe.
[time=1874] You maybe have come in today and have felt skeptical.
[time=1877] You don't know how you feel about this whole Jesus idea, this faith idea, Christianity.
[time=1882] We wanna be a place where you can belong even before you believe.
[time=1885] Because we believe when we show you what we found, this hope in Jesus, we believe that the belief's gonna follow.
[time=1891] We want you to belong.
[time=1892] We want you to know you're welcome.
[time=1893] We want you to know that just as Jesus did on all of his walks, you're welcome to walk on this road with us.
[time=1900] We're a church that's a hospital for sinners.
[time=1902] By the way, who is that?
[time=1904] Who would fit that category of hospital for sinners?
[time=1906] Anybody need a hospital?
[time=1907] Okay, just check it.
[time=1908] I think that's everybody.
[time=1910] So that would mean it's a church for everybody, but what we're not gonna be is a hotel where you check in, relax, and just chill out.
[time=1916] We wanna be a church where we go and do something.
[time=1919] If you're a believer, a follower of Jesus, we're going somewhere.
[time=1923] And so we want you to come with us.
[time=1924] Let's go together.
[time=1926] A church that's a hospital for sinners, not a hotel for saints.
[time=1930] Heard this statement a while back and I wanna share it with you because you may feel, hear me, this is for somebody today.
[time=1936] You may feel unworthy.
[time=1938] You may feel like you couldn't be that sinner that the church would be for you.
[time=1941] There's no hospital good enough for you, perhaps.
[time=1944] There's a statement I heard.
[time=1945] I wanna share it with you and it's simply this, that you know what?
[time=1949] God doesn't love you because you're valuable.
[time=1952] You are valuable because God loves you.
[time=1957] God doesn't love you because you're valuable because of what you bring to the table.
[time=1965] You're valuable because God loves you.
[time=1969] The love of God in your life is your worth.
[time=1972] You can't bring about the worth that gets you into the doorway of heaven.
[time=1976] But Jesus already paid that price to give you a worth that you could never attain on your own or that no one else could ever give you.
[time=1985] You are valuable.
[time=1987] You matter to Jesus.
[time=1993] Somebody came in this place not believing that today.
[time=1997] Or maybe you used to believe it, but now you just don't.
[time=2000] You've kind of lost sight of that.
[time=2002] Please hear me.
[time=2003] If you miss everything else, know that you matter to Jesus.
[time=2009] You matter to him.
[time=2013] A couple of weeks ago, you know when you realize how you're loved, it changes how you see the world around you.
[time=2019] A couple of weeks ago, we were in Georgia visiting our families.
[time=2022] And so my dad was sitting, my dad and my mom were sitting on this toolbox right beside the lake, right beside a little tree.
[time=2028] He was baiting a hook for my son.
[time=2031] All right, so it was great, grandparent time.
[time=2032] I was there, our kids were there.
[time=2034] And so he was baiting a hook.
[time=2036] And they were sitting on this toolbox.
[time=2037] My mom was sitting on one end, my dad on the other.
[time=2039] He was on kind of the lake end.
[time=2041] This is a little lake out of this place there.
[time=2043] And so he's sitting there if you can imagine.
[time=2044] The lake's down here, dad's over here.
[time=2046] And it's kind of this little seesaw anyway, but my mom decides to get up.
[time=2053] See saw goes down.
[time=2054] My dad goes tumbling rolling down to the lake.
[time=2057] This is probably the highlight of my trip.
[time=2059] I hope he's not watching today.
[time=2060] (audience laughs) And he rolls in, I was pretty impressed.
[time=2063] The old man still got moves.
[time=2065] He spun around, made sure he got his wallet and his phone out and held it up, but he was drenched in mud all the way up his leg.
[time=2072] And so what do you think we're doing?
[time=2074] Well, after, after I checked on him, we laughed.
[time=2079] After I said, "Are you okay?" He said, "Okay, here's the truth.
[time=2082] I can't lie from the pulpit." As I was laughing, I said, "Are you okay?" He said, "Yes, everybody was laughing, except for one person." And it wasn't dad, he was laughing too.
[time=2093] My son, Caleb was not laughing at all.
[time=2097] In fact, he was really worried about his poo-pah, as he calls him.
[time=2101] He came up with that phrase when he was two, I think.
[time=2104] So yeah, so we had our grandparents there and he was worried about his granddad.
[time=2109] And he looked at him and he was serious now.
[time=2111] And I'm standing over here with my son, with his pole and I was casting it out for him so he could fish.
[time=2117] And he was just staring at me, asking me if he was okay.
[time=2118] And then like nothing, he turned, looked me right in the eye.
[time=2122] I kid you not as serious as he could be.
[time=2123] And he said, "You don't deserve to fish." (audience laughing) You can't make this stuff up, from the mouth of a six-year-old.
[time=2136] And so I dropped my head and walked away.
[time=2139] Yeah, but here's what I want you to know.
[time=2141] And of course, he eventually laughed.
[time=2143] We told him he's okay and the poo-pah came up, made everything better, all that stuff.
[time=2148] But here's what I want you to know.
[time=2149] And it's in your notes today.
[time=2151] When you know you are loved, you love differently.
[time=2156] My little boy knows that his grandparents love him.
[time=2160] And because he knows how much he is loved by them, he loves not only them differently, but he loves other people around him differently.
[time=2170] Hear me when I tell you today that when you know you're loved, when you know you're valuable, when you know you matter to a God who's so far above you, so unattainable by our standards, when you know he loves you, you can't help but love differently.
[time=2185] Just like I saw from the mouth of a six-year-old,
[time=2191] today I pray that we can love differently.
[time=2193] When you meet Jesus, he changes everything.
[time=2197] You can't love the same after you collide with Jesus.
[time=2200] Ephesians 5, 21 says submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
[time=2207] We skipped that verse a lot.
[time=2210] I don't want to submit to people in my life.
[time=2213] Jesus says submit to one another.
[time=2215] Put their values, put their well-being above your own.
[time=2222] Why? Because you're submitting to them, you're doing it in reverence to them, no, because in reverence to me, do what I did.
[time=2230] Walk the path that I've walked.
[time=2233] And a lot of times in church, we're like the older brother in the prodigal son's story.
[time=2237] There's a younger brother who went, he was the knucklehead of the story, went and squandered the inheritance.
[time=2241] The older brother was jealous of him because he did everything right, and then there's the father in the story.
[time=2245] A lot of times in the church, if you've grown up in the church, and I'm preaching to me this morning, you don't have a perfect pastor, sorry to break it to you.
[time=2253] I know I just ruined somebody's lunch today, but it's true.
[time=2256] I'm far from perfect.
[time=2257] We oftentimes get like that older brother in the church when we've grown up in church, and we ask questions internally.
[time=2265] We may not ever vocalize them, but we'll want to say things like, well, why does the church always cater to these people that don't believe like we believe?
[time=2271] Why does the church always cater to the seekers in the world around us?
[time=2275] And then tell me just to put my preferences aside, it's just not fair.
[time=2280] If we're honest, we would say we've all said that to one degree if we've been in the church, and I want to tell you why.
[time=2285] First of all, it's because if I look at the life of Jesus, I look at Luke 15, his parable of the lost coin, the lost sheep and the lost son, which is the prodigal son's story.
[time=2296] He said, I didn't come to call the righteous, but sinners.
[time=2301] It's not the healthy who needed doctor, but the sick.
[time=2303] He said, I came to seek and save that which was lost, but here's what I'll tell you on a practical level to that question.
[time=2309] Why would we ever think we can expect people who have not collided with Jesus to have a spiritual maturity and humility that we preach?
[time=2319] Why would we hold them to the standards of a Jesus that they have yet to surrender to?
[time=2325] But here's what I'll tell you.
[time=2326] When you say I'm in, I'm all in, I'm on the team, I'm going somewhere, when you join Black Hawk, membership does not have its privileges at Black Hawk.
[time=2335] Membership is not about privileges, it's about going somewhere, it's about partnering to make a difference in our community.
[time=2341] We are held to a standard of maturity and humility.
[time=2346] Enough to say, I wanna make it about the people in my life, not about me, I've found Jesus, I'm saved, and I'm gonna grow and you know the beauty of this whole story, a big challenge within this is there's this debate.
[time=2357] People will spend hours debating this.
[time=2359] Can you tell it bothers me a little?
[time=2362] But maybe it helps somebody like it's helped me.
[time=2363] We debate, well, you gotta choose discipleship or evangelism.
[time=2368] This is the theological terms that we often use.
[time=2371] Can I teach you a minute?
[time=2373] You can't have one without the other.
[time=2378] You don't, they're two sides of the same coin.
[time=2381] We say, well, we're all about reaching the loss.
[time=2383] Well, we're all about discipling the save.
[time=2386] We're all about both, because if you're gonna do one, you're gonna do the other.
[time=2389] You can't go make disciples, by the way, Matthew 28.
[time=2392] Look there with me, we'll flip there together.
[time=2394] Matthew 28, Jesus says, go therefore and make.
[time=2397] He doesn't just say make, he doesn't just say go.
[time=2399] You can't make without going and you can't go without making.
[time=2404] They go together when we, and we see it every week.
[time=2407] Let me give you the best example I could offer you.
[time=2410] Maybe you've wrestled with this question, as have I.
[time=2412] I don't mean to make light of it at all, but maybe you've wrestled with this idea within the church.
[time=2418] What I would tell you, the best example would be is right in this room, every week, as we open the powerful word of God.
[time=2427] We open the word of God.
[time=2428] It speaks to Christians of 50 plus years.
[time=2431] I've heard your stories.
[time=2434] It's not because Kevin's up here, it's because the word of God is alive and active, sharper than any two-edged sword.
[time=2439] It challenges and equips the saints for the work of minister.
[time=2443] We see that every week, but every week we see people coming to know Jesus.
[time=2447] Because the same word that equipped you in your 50th year of walking with Jesus can also convict a center of their sin and help them see their need for a savior.
[time=2457] We see it in this room every week.
[time=2459] Discipleship, evangelism coming together as we go and make disciples.
[time=2464] You see it in Matthew 28, it's the great commission.
[time=2467] This happened earlier in this story during those 40 days.
[time=2470] So it says this, Jesus said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[time=2474] "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations." You see all nations there again too, don't you?
[time=2482] Mabtizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and of the Holy Spirit as we just got to experience in this place today, teaching them to observe all I've commanded you and behold, I'm with you always even to the end of the age.
[time=2497] People above preferences, it's a hard message, but it's a key part of our vision and a good example of that.
[time=2504] I think I've shared before is my pastor's father.
[time=2506] He's going to be with the Lord, a Navy veteran, would come to our church in Georgia where I served for many years and he would sit down front every single week and he'd drive 20, 25 minutes every single week, grew up in a very much a background in church like I did, very much a Baptist background, very traditional background in church.
[time=2526] And so his friends would often ask him, "Do you like the Midway, the Midway music, "the music at Midway that you go listen to?" And he'd say, "No." And they'd say, "Well, you go there every week." Why?
[time=2539] And he'd say, "You know what I've learned?
[time=2541] "I just want to be a part of a church "that is seeing people saved and baptized every week." And it really doesn't matter how much I like this song or that song because I drive 20 minutes to church and 20 minutes from church and that's way more time than we listen to music from the stage anyway.
[time=2557] And so if I don't like the song, I can play the one I like on the way home.
[time=2560] I just like seeing people saved.
[time=2564] Whatever it takes, whatever works, I want to do that.
[time=2569] I love that man.
[time=2571] I love his mentality and his mindset because it was all about people over preferences.
[time=2576] And I believe God's called us to just such a mindset and I commend you, Black Hawk Ministries, and when I look back at this last year, a lot of things have changed at this place.
[time=2585] A lot of stuff has happened at this place.
[time=2589] But you know what I look at?
[time=2590] I hope when you hear me preach today, you're not hearing a pastor up here pointing down at the members.
[time=2594] First of all, I hope you hear a pastor who says, "Gosh, I struggle with this." So many times as a pastor, I want to do what I want to do more than maybe what's best for everybody else.
[time=2604] It's a struggle, we all have that struggle.
[time=2605] So I hope you hear that.
[time=2606] But then I hope you hear an encouragement from your pastor to say, keep moving forward.
[time=2611] Keep putting aside the gazing and keep going as we keep moving forward as a church.
[time=2617] I thank you for following our leadership and moving forward as you have.
[time=2621] And you know what happens is we move from a church that gets caught up in the distractions to a church that deploys.
[time=2627] So many churches live in a distraction era.
[time=2630] They're distracted by all of these things.
[time=2632] The mission creep or it creeps off to all these things that don't matter anymore and they're distracted and therefore it becomes divisive.
[time=2638] And that's why church is split.
[time=2640] And that's why denominations are all around us.
[time=2642] And that's why the man-made portions of our faith become such a divisive thing in this world of faith.
[time=2648] I believe because we get distracted from the mission.
[time=2651] Instead, let's be a deploying church.
[time=2653] Let's deploy people and send them out and then in turn, we won't be divisive.
[time=2658] We'll just make a difference.
[time=2660] That's what God has called us to be a part of today.
[time=2665] Second thing, it's the shortest one, is this.
[time=2669] Potential overpassed, potential overpassed.
[time=2673] People above preferences, but potential overpass versus nine through 10, Jesus has lifted up.
[time=2677] I'd probably be gazing too, but I imagine they're gazing probably involved some reminiscing.
[time=2683] Wouldn't you, man, it was nice to have Jesus here.
[time=2687] Man, it was nice that time when Jesus encouraged me in my low moment.
[time=2691] I would be doing that too.
[time=2693] It's not a bad thing to do that, is it?
[time=2695] The them, it gets interrupted by an angel saying, "Why are you gazing?
[time=2699] It's time to start going." In verse 11, in your notes, you'll find it's easy to miss what is because I'm stuck on what was.
[time=2707] What's the church anthem for that?
[time=2710] You know it.
[time=2711] We've never done it.
[time=2713] That's because you guys don't say it.
[time=2715] That's a good thing.
[time=2716] We've never done it that way before.
[time=2718] Let's don't start saying that, because when I look at Jesus, here's what I see.
[time=2721] He distinguished between theology and ministry.
[time=2725] Go with me on this.
[time=2726] Theology is what we believe.
[time=2728] Ministry is what we do with what we believe.
[time=2731] A lot of times we think that they're one and the same, but Jesus learned and taught us, rather, that they're distinguished, they're different.
[time=2738] Theology is the never-changing truth of the gospel.
[time=2741] Jesus was that never-changing truth of the gospel.
[time=2744] He was the word-made flesh that dwelt among us.
[time=2748] Theology is what we believe.
[time=2749] Ministry is what we do with what we believe.
[time=2751] There's a difference between the two, because what we're called to do is take the never-changing truth of Jesus and the gospel to an ever-changing world that's full of ever-changing needs.
[time=2763] And that means our message never changes, but how we go about it will always change.
[time=2768] The greatest example of that is Jesus himself, as he went out and said, you know what?
[time=2772] I'm going to do something different in this city than I did in the last city.
[time=2775] In the last city, I had a conversation, and I just asked some questions.
[time=2779] In this city, I'm going to do a teaching moment where I'm going to use a fig tree as my prop in my illustration.
[time=2784] The next city, he preaches a full-blown sermon.
[time=2787] The next city, he lets one of the disciples do it.
[time=2789] The next city, he heals someone, because he's taking the never-changing truth of the gospel to a world that has ever-changing needs.
[time=2797] That's what the church is called to do.
[time=2799] We value where we're going, our potential, what God has ahead of us, more than we value what was behind.
[time=2806] That's not that we released that.
[time=2807] I wrote a statement, maybe it'll challenge and encourage you today.
[time=2809] It's this, that it's great to remember and reference the past, but never good to remain there.
[time=2815] I believe in that.
[time=2817] We wouldn't be where we are as a church without the amazing men and women of God who have gone before us here at Black Hawk.
[time=2823] Almost 50 years, this church has been in place, and I praise God for those who have paved the way.
[time=2829] The fact that we're sitting here in this moment is a testimony to those who have gone before.
[time=2835] They've paid a price that we don't have to pay, but here's where we come in.
[time=2838] We can't get stuck there, because if we don't pay a price that the people in the next generation can't pay, then the next generation will suffer because we're not willing to pay the price that the people before us already paid.
[time=2849] Are you with me?
[time=2850] Let's pay the price.
[time=2851] Let's be a church that moves forward together.
[time=2855] Anybody know what this is?
[time=2857] The best of the beach boys.
[time=2863] How many of you actually have played one of these before in your life?
[time=2869] All right, put your hands on.
[time=2871] How many of you have no idea what this is?
[time=2873] Okay, all right.
[time=2876] I love, isn't that great?
[time=2878] Look at that.
[time=2879] Yet we're here together, and we're on the same track.
[time=2882] No pun intended.
[time=2885] That was bad.
[time=2885] Just should've left that one in the notes.
[time=2888] We're here together though, because people have taken what was, moved it forward to what's next, to meet this generation and this world.
[time=2897] I refuse, I refuse in an ever changing needs society with the never changing gospel.
[time=2903] These songs sound the same, don't they?
[time=2906] The beach boys still sound just as good today as they did back then, but how we play them looks a whole lot different.
[time=2911] The same has gotta be true of the church.
[time=2913] We've gotta be willing to sacrifice, put preferences aside for the sake of people and move forward to our potential and not just get hung up in our past.
[time=2921] That's why we don't play eight tracks anymore at the church, but they're still pretty cool.
[time=2927] Verse 11 was a question from the angels.
[time=2931] Do you think the angels didn't know why they were gazing?
[time=2933] (chuckles) It wasn't a question centered around information.
[time=2937] It was a question centered around initiation.
[time=2939] And I wanna ask you a similar question today as we wrap things up.
[time=2943] How do we move from our past to our potential?
[time=2946] How do we move from our problems to the potential that God has, put preferences aside for the sake of people?
[time=2952] And there's a question, I want you to jot it down and think on it this week, is what is my step of service this week?
[time=2957] What is my step of service this week?
[time=2963] Have you ever heard anybody say, "I love Jesus, "I just don't like people." In the church world, people will often say, "Well, church would be easy "if it wasn't for all the people, right?" Have you ever noticed that about the church?
[time=2978] As soon as people get introduced, things start to get messy.
[time=2981] You hire a new pastor and it gets even more messy because he's pretty messy too.
[time=2985] But I want you to know today that the biblical approach to how we be the church is that when we serve Jesus, we always serve others.
[time=2995] You can't serve Jesus without serving others.
[time=2997] Jesus said, "I didn't come to be served, but to serve." And so let's serve, let's find that step of service.
[time=3004] Today, spirituality so many times is equated with book studies and Bible studies and we have all those happening all throughout because it equips us and helps us move forward.
[time=3013] But what good does it do if we gain a lot of knowledge yet serve no one with the knowledge that we've gained?
[time=3018] So let's go out and make a difference.
[time=3021] That's the challenge of Jesus.
[time=3022] Spirituality so many times gets equated with isolation.
[time=3026] You know, we do it in the name of not looking like the world, but Jesus never stayed isolated.
[time=3032] He went and had isolation moments, but just to prepare him to go out and not be isolated to be among people.
[time=3039] When we serve Jesus, we serve people.
[time=3041] A godly life is a people centered life.
[time=3045] So what's my step of service this week?
[time=3050] And as we close things down today, before I dismiss you, before I give you the most important moment of this entire week for you in this service, I wanna tell you a story.
[time=3059] 1985, the New Orleans Rec Department.
[time=3062] You can look this up online.
[time=3063] A 31 year old man named Jerome Moody, passed away at the New Orleans Sea Drowne in the New Orleans Rec Department pool.
[time=3070] It was at a celebration.
[time=3072] So we talk about past and potential and wrestle with the tensions that exist there.
[time=3078] These life guards at the New Orleans Rec Department had gotten together because they had, I don't know if it was their first, but they were celebrating a one year period with no drownings under their care.
[time=3088] And so at this celebration for the past year,
[time=3095] celebrating the fact that no one had drowned under their care with over 100 life guards present, a man drowned in their pool.
[time=3105] Folks, I don't wanna be that kind of church where we equip so many life guards.
[time=3114] We have something that's better than the cure to cancer.
[time=3117] We have the hope of Jesus.
[time=3119] May we never get so stuck on what was that we miss the opportunities that are today.
[time=3126] May we never be a group of life guards that are so inward focused, consumed on what happened, on what good things were in place that we miss what God's trying to do and must make it personal.
[time=3137] I challenge you to this week.
[time=3139] I dare you.
[time=3140] I double dog dare you to ask God what step of service He has for you and then to be willing to take that step, not getting consumed with what was, not getting consumed with your inadequacies, not getting consumed with your shortcomings, but saying God, I'm just gonna trust you with this step, even if it's a crazy, crazy step that makes no sense in my logic and my rationale, God, I will take that step of service for you this week because no one's gonna pass through my wash, not on my wash as a life guard.
[time=3170] I'm gonna do whatever you ask me to do, no matter how much faith it takes, no matter how much fear you have to overcome God, I'll take that step because I won't be a life guard that lets someone drown on my wash.
[time=3181] That's the army that God's building.
[time=3185] That's what we get to be a part of, church.
[time=3188] Do you feel challenged today by God's word?
[time=3191] I feel challenged today by God's word, but I also feel encouraged because of Jesus made all of this possible.
[time=3196] I wanna ask you just to bow your heads and reflect for a minute.
[time=3198] If you know Jesus today, what is that step?
[time=3201] Go on and start committing or asking God to give you the faith to take that step in this place today.
[time=3207] But somebody's here and would say to me, Kevin, I just don't know that I know Jesus.
[time=3213] I'm not sure that today if I were to die, this gospel that you've talked about, that it would get me into heaven.
[time=3220] I'm not even sure what would get me into heaven.
[time=3223] Maybe you have a million questions surrounding that.
[time=3225] I want you to hear me, hear me, hear me really well.
[time=3227] Jesus already paid the price.
[time=3229] He paid that admission fee for you.
[time=3232] It's a penalty for sin.
[time=3234] We don't like saying that word a lot of times because it makes us so uncomfortable.
[time=3239] But just you and Jesus today, I wanna challenge you to be willing to take a step to follow after Him, to know that your sin separates you from God, but that Jesus already paid that price for your sin, that you could never pay.
[time=3255] He lived a sinless life.
[time=3258] You could never live just so that He could go to that cross and die for you while He was on the cross.
[time=3263] You were on His mind.
[time=3264] You, yes, you, yes, He knew all your sins.
[time=3269] Think about this, all of your sins at that moment were future and He knew all of them, yet He still finished the purpose that He came to fulfill, which is to die on that cross, but it didn't stop there.
[time=3281] He died, but then He rose again.
[time=3283] He went into that borrowed tomb and it was borrowed 'cause He didn't need it, but just for three days because three days later, He walked out with the victory over your sin, over what separates us from God, and that's the gospel.
[time=3296] It already happened.
[time=3297] That price has already been paid.
[time=3299] That victory has already been won, and it was won with you in mind.
[time=3304] And today's the day of salvation for somebody in this place today.
[time=3308] You feel it on the inside right now, and you were saying, well, how do I receive it?
[time=3312] I'm not gonna lead you in a prayer because I believe your heart is screaming that prayer.
[time=3315] You're likely saying, I can't pray that prayer because I can't say it right.
[time=3319] God doesn't want you to say it right.
[time=3320] He wants you to ask Him to save you, and He'll meet you there.
[time=3323] If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, believe in your heart that He has risen from the dead.
[time=3329] You shall be saved.
[time=3332] So in your own words, will you cry out to Jesus if you would say, I don't know that I have that relationship.
[time=3337] Will you do it and do it right now in this moment from your heart to His?
[time=3345] (gentle music) - Is it time to get going and stop gazing?
[time=3353] Maybe you are among the many who have taken that step in this time, in this place, in this moment today, and it's time for you to take that leap.
[time=3361] It's time for you to join that movement of people who've decided today is the day of salvation.
[time=3367] I'm gonna follow Jesus.
[time=3369] Maybe that day has been a long time coming for you.
[time=3372] Maybe God's been stirring, or maybe He just started stirring today.
[time=3376] No matter where you're at, no matter what this message, what we've looked at today may mean to you.
[time=3382] My challenge is don't wait until you get that thing figured out.
[time=3386] Don't wait until you get things straightened out, or until you get some things in line or ready, because I just believe if we wait on that moment, it may never come.
[time=3395] Today is that moment.
[time=3396] And so whatever you've got to do, if that's stepping away, pressing pause, just taking a moment to just talk with Jesus, I believe today you will not regret taking that step.
[time=3406] Salvation, knowing that you have a personal relationship with God through His Son, Jesus Christ, really is as simple as we've outlined today.
[time=3415] I love the word gospel, because it just simply means good news, and good news has already taken place, and that means that Jesus has already died.
[time=3424] He's already won that victory that maybe you've been searching for, and it's time to just embrace that and ask Jesus to save you instead of maybe trying to think I can save myself by being good enough, by getting there, by being better than other people, by measuring up, we can't do that.
[time=3441] We're so far from God's perfect standard that we need some help, we need Jesus, we need the gospel, we need the good news.
[time=3450] And so embrace that, cry out to Jesus from your heart to His, knowing that He will respond, knowing that He will answer you, and we want to hear about that step of faith that you're taking, maybe it's not even salvation, maybe it's that you need to be baptized, maybe it's that you need to find a life group, or you need to come join us here on our campus at Black Hawk and find out more about how you can get plugged into the local church.
[time=3474] I believe in the local church, I love the local church, because Jesus is building it, it's His idea, we just get to join in and be a part of it.
[time=3483] Whatever your next step may be, we want to hear from you.
[time=3486] We'd love to have you reach out to us, there's going to be some information on your screen, an email address, a phone number that you can use to reach out to us, in addition to all the other platforms we've discussed, so that we can hear your story.
[time=3497] And if you have taken a step today, we've got a booklet called Beginning Steps, a growth guide for new believers that just walks through seven steps, seven next steps.
[time=3506] That's what we've looked at today, are we going to be gazing, or are we going to be going?
[time=3511] If you're ready to start moving, to start going, then let us get this book into your hands, we will be glad to mail it to you, you can pick one up here at the office, use the information on your screen, let us know how we can serve you, and we will do everything we can to just walk alongside you, because Jesus is just getting started in your life.
[time=3529] Thanks again for tuning in today.
[time=3531] I want to invite you back next week as we start a brand new series, a brand new focus, on what it means to be open.
[time=3538] In a world that feels so closed, in a world that feels so closed-minded, how can we, particularly with our possessions, our things, our money, our stuff, make sure that we own those things, that we steward those things with an open heart, and open hands, and not let that stuff on us.
[time=3557] And so join us next week as we dive into that new topic, and I believe it's going to be a blessing to you.
[time=3562] We'll see you then.
[time=3578] (upbeat music)
