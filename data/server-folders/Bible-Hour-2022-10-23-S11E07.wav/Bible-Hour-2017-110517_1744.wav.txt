[time=30] [MUSIC - 277 seconds]
[time=317] I just want you to think for a moment.
[time=320] We're saying we shout your name from the rooftops, and I want to draw your attention to a lady that's in the Bible that they talk about.
[time=332] It's the woman at the well.
[time=334] Jesus comes and meets this woman who's full of sin, and he points that out, and I won't go through all of that, but he points that out to her.
[time=343] And so much to the point that she looks at Jesus, and Jesus looks at her like, yeah.
[time=351] She goes back to where she came from.
[time=354] Instead, it was 10 towns that she was a part of, and she told about this man.
[time=360] She was yelling. I think they thought she may have lost her mind, and they'd said, like, if God changed her, I need to meet this man.
[time=371] I need to meet this man, and the Bible says that they came back with her to meet Jesus, and many were saved because of him.
[time=381] Grace that God showed on this lady. She could have been left in her sins. Hey, you've had five husbands.
[time=392] You've had five. You're done. He could have did that, right?
[time=397] But our God, full of grace, full of mercy, steps in and says, you're forgiven.
[time=406] No more sin, no more shame. And she leaves, excited, and tells of the goodness of Jesus.
[time=414] And they knew something in her had to have changed, and they had to see it. They had to know.
[time=422] So my encouragement to you is the life that we live, that it would be something that we would stand on a rooftop, on a mountain, on our Facebook post, in the grocery store, in the restaurant that we would proclaim this name of Jesus
[time=443] until others about us get so much to the point that they say, I need to know about this Jesus God. I need to hear about it.
[time=452] As we sing these next few songs, they're grace-filled songs that it takes us back to the amazing grace that Jesus bestows upon us.
[time=464] We wake up each and every morning to new mercies, and I just want us to soak in that like, man, I think about my BC days, and I know I shouldn't be on this stage.
[time=472] If I was just left there.
[time=476] But we get to rehearse that in our minds as we sing through these next few songs. This is Amazing Grace.
[time=502] Who breaks the power of sin and darkness whose love is body and so much stronger, the King of glory, the King of our King?
[time=523] Who shakes the water with holy thunder in Jesus' breathless and knowing wonder, the King of Glory?
[time=538] This is Amazing Grace. This is Amazing Grace.
[time=545] This is a fairly love that you will take my place, that you will bear my cross.
[time=559] You will make out your love, that I will be set free.
[time=570] Oh, oh, oh, Jesus, I sing for all that you've done for me.
[time=586] Who brings our chaos back into order, who makes the orphan a son and daughter, the King of Glory?
[time=598] The King of Glory, who rules the nations with truth and justice, shines like the sun in all of its brilliance.
[time=610] This is Amazing Grace. This is a fairly love that you will take my place, that you will bear my cross.
[time=636] You will make out your love, that I will be set free.
[time=646] Oh, oh, oh, oh, Jesus, I sing for all that you've done for me.
[time=659] Come on, we serve a worthy, worthy God. And right here we get to declare that, so I want you to sing at the top of your lungs as we do it.
[time=672] Worthy is the level of the slave. Worthy is the king of conquer the brave. Worthy is the level of the slave. Worthy is the king who conquer the brave. Worthy is the level of the slave. Worthy is the king who conquer the brave.
[time=701] Worthy is the level of the slave. Worthy, worthy, worthy. This is Amazing Grace. This is a fairly love that you will take my place, that you will bear my cross.
[time=727] You lay down your life, that I will be set free.
[time=738] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Jesus, I sing for all that you've done for me.
[time=766] (Applause)
[time=796] Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[time=819] I once was lost, but now I'm found, was blind, but now I see.
[time=838] It was grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved.
[time=857] How precious did that grace be, the hour I thirst believe, my chains are long, I've been set free.
[time=883] My God, my say, oh, has read some me, and let the love, his mercy reigns, unend you love.
[time=906] Amazing Grace.
[time=917] God has come, his spirit to me, his word, my hope, save us.
[time=935] He will bless you, and worship me, as long as life and grace.
[time=954] The earth shall soon dissolve like sun, the sun forbade to shine.
[time=972] But God who calls me here below will be forever mine.
[time=990] You are forever mine.
[time=1001] My chains, my chains are gone, I've been set free.
[time=1012] My God, my say, oh, has read some me, and let the love, his mercy reigns, unend you love.
[time=1037] Amazing Grace.
[time=1043] Unend you love, amazing Grace.
[time=1057] Praise God from whom all blessings flow.
[time=1068] Praise him, all creatures, hear me love.
[time=1079] Praise him, my love, heavenly hosts.
[time=1089] Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, amen.
[time=1106] So as we go on to the series called open, I'm super excited about it, because I believe
[time=1114] it calls us to do something more with our lives, more than just live, more than just, you know,
[time=1122] converse with each other, but to be open, hands open, hearts open, minds, ears open to what God would have us do.
[time=1129] So we're about to sing a song that we're going to sing for the next four weeks.
[time=1133] It is something that we are introducing today, but there's reason why I'm telling you this,
[time=1139] because I'm going to need your help.
[time=1142] And it's just a simple calisthenics anybody, you know, before you, you know, this kind of stuff.
[time=1149] So can you do this?
[time=1151] Everyone go like this.
[time=1153] Okay.
[time=1154] So there's a part of the song that says with open hands, with open, so I got you started right here.
[time=1161] You warmed up, but I'm going to actually have you going like this.
[time=1164] Open hands.
[time=1165] Can you try that?
[time=1166] Open hands.
[time=1167] All right.
[time=1168] So you guys look really good doing that, but you're going to take one more step.
[time=1171] One more step.
[time=1172] So it's open hands and you look good sitting down, you look so comfortable, peaceful, but sometimes when you call to be open, it has nothing to do with being comfortable at all.
[time=1181] It's like, I got to stand again.
[time=1183] Yes.
[time=1184] And so if you wouldn't mind standing with us as we sing this song, open hands, and I'll let you know, when you see me going like this, join me as we open hands.
[time=1192] No clench fist.
[time=1194] I'll never catch you like living with knuckles while you're keeping my fists held tight.
[time=1216] I'll never touch your heart or take it all you are trying to hide my scars.
[time=1225] I'm letting go of holding on.
[time=1230] Here I am, with open hands.
[time=1235] I have nothing left to do, that I give it all to you.
[time=1241] Empty me of everything to let's not be left with you.
[time=1247] I just want to live for you in open hands, open hands, open hands, open hands.
[time=1260] I'm finally giving up, I'm placing all my trust into a higher love.
[time=1269] You're dreaming, bigger dreams, you have a plan for me, and though I cannot see.
[time=1280] Here I am, with open hands.
[time=1286] I have nothing left to prove, that I give it all to you.
[time=1291] Empty me of everything to let's not be left with you.
[time=1298] I just want to live for you in open hands, open hands, open hands, open hands.
[time=1312] It's for your glory, my hands for your glory, lifted high, lifted high to you.
[time=1321] My life for your glory, my life for your glory.
[time=1327] Follow me, follow me for you.
[time=1332] My hands for your glory, my hands for your glory, lifted high, lifted high to you.
[time=1342] My life for your glory, my life for your glory.
[time=1347] Follow me, follow me for you.
[time=1352] Here I am, with open hands.
[time=1356] I have nothing left to prove, that I give it all to you.
[time=1362] Empty me of everything to let's not be left with you.
[time=1369] I just want to live for you with open hands, open hands, open hands, open hands, open hands.
[time=1395] Let's pray together before we open God's Word this morning.
[time=1408] God, I want to pause and say thank you for your Word, for how open you were to us when
[time=1415] you sent your Son, for how open you've been to pour into our hearts and into our lives here at Blackhawk God to give us the privilege of being a part of not just building construction
[time=1425] wise, but building the kingdom of God, building towards eternal goals that will forever make
[time=1431] a difference, not in this life, but in the life that is to come.
[time=1435] So God, thank you for that.
[time=1436] Today as we dig into that, I pray you would bless this time together, bless the reading, the opening, the stirring of your Word.
[time=1444] Let your Word have the last Word.
[time=1446] That is our prayer.
[time=1447] God, I pray that through my vocal cords you would speak, that there would be none of me, but all of you as we look at your Word today, and that's our prayer collectively, is that we here at Blackhawk would not be seen or heard, but that Jesus and Jesus alone would be made famous in our community of Fort Wayne and all around the world.
[time=1466] We thank you for Jesus and ask it all in his name, and everybody said, "Hey, man, we're starting a new series today called Open, and so I want to ask you to open your Bibles with me to Matthew chapter six.
[time=1477] Matthew chapter six, we're going to start in verse 19.
[time=1480] A couple of verses earlier than even your notes tell you.
[time=1482] I want to look at a few things as we look at being open.
[time=1487] Jesus had a lot, and here's what I know some of you are thinking, "Is he going to talk about money?
[time=1491] Yes, I am." You want to know why?
[time=1495] Because Jesus talked a lot about money in our stuff.
[time=1498] In fact, he has some 40-ish parables that Jesus told, and a little less than half of those had something to do with stewardship or with us managing stuff, or whether we're going to manage the stuff or stuff is going to manage us.
[time=1511] And when I look at the early church, the church that exploded onto the scene, the church Jesus was building, what I see is a church that had a lot of defining characteristics, but none more so than its open-handed generosity, than its open-handed approach to ministry,
[time=1528] than its radical love that they so freely and openly gave out, and I'm here to tell you, in a world today, you with me, in a world today that feels so closed.
[time=1539] You know what I'm talking about?
[time=1541] Close-minded, divided, there's nothing that will speak more loudly than a church that
[time=1549] is open.
[time=1550] And who am I talking about when I talk about the church?
[time=1553] Am I talking about the pews and the seats that you sit in, the walls around us?
[time=1556] Who's the church?
[time=1558] You're the church.
[time=1559] We're the church together, and so let's be open.
[time=1562] In Jesus, when I look at His ministry, I see a Jesus that went around looking for openness.
[time=1567] God, let their ears be opened to what I want to say to them.
[time=1571] God, let their hearts be open to what I want to do inside of them, to what I want to shift and change inside of them.
[time=1578] Jesus wanted a place, a group of people that was open, and I'm determined to be that kind of follower of Jesus, and I know you are too in one way or another.
[time=1586] I want to thank you for being here.
[time=1588] Thank you for being a part of that.
[time=1589] You're here because you've got some kind of investment in mind today, some kind of need in mind perhaps today, and maybe you're here and you're just checking this Black Hawk thing out because maybe you're just checking this whole Jesus thing out.
[time=1602] I don't know what to think about Jesus.
[time=1604] I've seen the church do me wrong.
[time=1606] I've seen Christians be the most unchristian people in my whole life, and you're here just to give it another shot today.
[time=1613] First of all, I want to tell you, you're loved.
[time=1616] You're in a place where you can belong even before you believe what we believe, because we believe what we believe about Jesus is life-changing, radical, eternal, and I believe
[time=1626] He's going to meet you right where you are in this room, or if you're watching us online today.
[time=1632] We have a big family here at Black Hawk, and we love every single one of you watching us online.
[time=1636] We see you.
[time=1637] You may feel anonymous, but we want you to know that you're loved.
[time=1640] So let's dig into being open today, Matthew chapter 6.
[time=1643] Here's the thing, in our pursuit of making the most of our life, so many times we lose control of our life.
[time=1650] You with me?
[time=1652] None of that is more true than in our finances, than in our stuff, how we manage what God
[time=1658] has given to us in our life, what we manage.
[time=1660] Our healthy financial life is one that's balanced, is one that is open.
[time=1665] But there's the thing about finances.
[time=1667] A lot of times, I talk about the church smile quite often around here, and you know, there are a lot of times with finances and how we manage our things that we can conceal the
[time=1677] consequences.
[time=1678] We can be making terrible decisions, but cover them up because finances is really none of your business for me, right?
[time=1684] It's really none of my business for you, right?
[time=1686] We can conceal that.
[time=1687] It doesn't have a Pinocchio type effect when we mis-manage stuff, does it?
[time=1692] You tell a lie if you're Pinocchio and your nose grows.
[time=1696] When you miss spend your money, your hands don't grow.
[time=1700] Can you imagine what some of us would look like if we had a consequence like that?
[time=1704] Our hands grew every time we mis-manage something, well, we couldn't even get our hands into our cars.
[time=1709] But instead, we have a sewing and reaping effect when it comes to how we manage our stuff.
[time=1714] We sew now and then reap later and greater.
[time=1716] Even though it's easy to cover up to conceal what feels like closed consequences, closed
[time=1722] results in our life, particularly with how we manage the things, the money, the time, the resources that God puts in our life, I want to ask you to do something with me as we go on this openness journey together, and that's this.
[time=1734] Even though you may be able to cover up and hide and conceal and maybe even try to just forget some of the bad decisions that you've been making, let's open ourselves up and say, "God, here's the open-handed mess that I bring to the table." So can you do this with me?
[time=1750] Even if you don't mean it, just do it with me for just a minute.
[time=1753] God, this is our open-handed mess.
[time=1756] We want to give you the stuff we think we can hide today.
[time=1760] We want to ask you, God, to take our mess and turn it into a message.
[time=1765] To take our tests and make it a testimony.
[time=1768] To help us live open, as you called us to do, and everybody said, "Even if you didn't mean it, I believe you will," as we dig through Matthew chapter 6.
[time=1777] And so no matter where you're at today, I want us to look at a few evidences of health.
[time=1781] Today, we're going to talk about being open to be healthy, open to be healthy.
[time=1785] This is a foundation for open, because if we're not open to being healthy from a heart standpoint, we'll never be open from an open hands standpoint.
[time=1793] So that's what I want us to look at.
[time=1795] Matthew 6, the words of Jesus, he says it best.
[time=1798] Let's look number one at some external evidence of a healthy heart.
[time=1802] External evidence of a healthy heart.
[time=1804] What do we see outside of us?
[time=1806] The things that are visible for a healthy heart.
[time=1808] Starting Matthew 6, beginning there in verse 19, let's go back before verse 21, which is
[time=1814] the key verse for this thought.
[time=1816] Ready for the word this morning?
[time=1818] Matthew 6, starting in verse 19, Jesus is speaking here, and he says, "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in
[time=1828] and still, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither must or rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and still, verse 21, our anthem for this week is for
[time=1840] where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
[time=1846] So when I look at that, let's start by letting me give you some external evidences of an unhealthy heart.
[time=1853] As we look at this verse, this passage that Jesus is leading us through, I'll start with first of all, maybe you're one of those people or you know one of those people where people have to compete with their stuff.
[time=1865] Have you ever been around, don't answer this out loud, or maybe you've ever been the person where people have to compete with your stuff for you?
[time=1872] And you know what I'm talking about, it's the people who say, "You can do anything, but just don't mess up my car.
[time=1880] Don't you dare put a ding in that car or a collection perhaps that you just hold near and dear.
[time=1885] Are those things bad by the way?" No, of course not.
[time=1887] But everybody in your house knows, "Don't you dare don't even look at my collection." You're breathing too hard around it, right?
[time=1895] You know what my philosophy has been, this is not because I'm good at this, it's because like all of us, we all need help with this, my philosophy on buying stuff is that if I'm not willing to lend it out, I'm just not going to buy it.
[time=1909] Because if I'm not willing to lend it out, then maybe it's not whatever it is, it's not
[time=1915] going to be very good for me.
[time=1917] Maybe it's going to grab my heart a little too tight.
[time=1919] So the problem is maybe people compete with your stuff, but maybe the adjustment, you know, your kids need new clothes, but I'm not selling that gun, or I'm not selling that collection.
[time=1929] I'm not selling, you know, whatever it is for you that maybe takes a throne room seat in your heart, perhaps it's time to dethrone it today.
[time=1938] That would be some external evidences, and so for some of us when it comes to our stuff, you can save really well.
[time=1944] You can save great, but you have kind of sticky fingers.
[time=1948] And when God puts on your heart to pay for somebody's meal, it's like, "No, I don't know.
[time=1952] I'm going to put that in the savings account." Some of you have the opposite effect.
[time=1954] You can give out freely, you're generous, and you can sure swipe it and spend.
[time=1958] Can I get an amen?
[time=1960] Just on it, if it's you just on it.
[time=1962] You can swipe it, you can spend, you can even help other people, but you struggle with saving.
[time=1967] Some of you presume on the future, it's easy to presume on the future.
[time=1970] Well, I know this money's going to come in, or I know that a bonus is coming, or I know that my paycheck's coming, or whatever, and so you presume on the future, it's easy with our finances and our money to presume on the future without actually planning for the future, which is biblical.
[time=1985] So I don't know what your struggle is.
[time=1986] We all have different struggles, but they all come back to the heart.
[time=1990] Anytime Jesus talked about money, it always went back to a healthy heart.
[time=1994] And so I want us to talk about that very thing today.
[time=1997] The big takeaway principle, I was thinking about what is it that we would apply directly to our lives, that Jesus said when He said where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
[time=2007] What did He mean when He said that?
[time=2009] And so in your notes, you'll find this statement, what you spend on reveals what you depend
[time=2015] on.
[time=2016] I think that's what Jesus is trying to tell us.
[time=2018] Where your treasure goes, there your heart will be also.
[time=2023] It's an indicator.
[time=2024] If you want to know someone's heart, maybe get a glimpse of the checking account.
[time=2028] See what they spend on, and it'll reveal what they depend on.
[time=2031] So what you spend on reveals what you depend on as well.
[time=2036] And so as we talk about this, I want to talk about the tithing question too.
[time=2039] I get this as a pastor.
[time=2040] I get this a lot.
[time=2041] Even the past several weeks, I've had this, even from people who had no idea, we're talking about this series is well, isn't it just an Old Testament principle, a law principle for us to tithe?
[time=2051] And so the tithe is tenth.
[time=2053] That's what it means.
[time=2054] And it's a timeless principle.
[time=2055] And I'll tell you, we at Black Hawk believe in the tithe, mainly from the belief of a timeless
[time=2061] principle of first fruits.
[time=2063] First fruits.
[time=2064] If you go back into scripture and you look, the tithe is something that first of all is talked about pre-law, even with an Abraham, in the law with a Moses.
[time=2074] Post-exile with a Malachi, one of the prophets of God, and then Jesus even references and talks about it in Matthew 23.
[time=2081] So it's definitely something to that, but people will say, well, that's an Old Testament law-driven kind of legalistic principle.
[time=2088] I think we're the New Testament church.
[time=2090] You know what I say?
[time=2091] You're exactly right.
[time=2092] We're a New Testament, New Covenant gospel-driven church that Jesus is building.
[time=2097] But here's what I'll tell you.
[time=2098] We do believe in Black Hawk and this principle of first fruits, where we give our first and best to God.
[time=2103] Why?
[time=2104] Because it goes back to our heart.
[time=2105] And we're going to talk about all that Jesus had to say about money in just a few minutes too.
[time=2110] But I want to talk to you about that tithing thing.
[time=2111] If you're in that boat and you would say, that's an Old Testament type thing, I would say, I don't think it's this ironclad legalistic law-driven rule that you've got to give this
[time=2121] exact percent.
[time=2122] I think when I look at Jesus and what He came to do with our stuff, it's something totally different.
[time=2127] But I think it negates the whole question.
[time=2129] Hang with me.
[time=2130] You with me?
[time=2131] I think it takes away the whole question of percentage because Jesus came, flip back to Luke chapter 6, but hold your place there in Matthew chapter 6, or flip ahead rather, to Luke chapter 6, Luke chapter 6, I want to read something to you.
[time=2143] The New Testament church, the gospel, the new covenant, Jesus Himself, really only came
[time=2152] to intensify the timeless principles of Scripture.
[time=2158] Jesus said, I didn't come to abolish the law, I came to fulfill it.
[time=2162] And when He came to fulfill it, it takes it to a new level.
[time=2166] And so Jesus is speaking more red letters here, Luke chapter 6, we're going to start there in verse 32.
[time=2172] I just want to read just a short passage to you, Luke chapter 6 starting in verse 32.
[time=2176] Jesus said, if you love those who love you, what benefit is that to you, for even sinners love those who love them, and if you do good to those who do good to you, what benefit is that to you?
[time=2185] For even sinners do the same, verse 34.
[time=2188] And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive, what credit is that to you?
[time=2193] Even sinners lend to sinners and to get back the same amount, but you, but love, but love.
[time=2198] This is for us, verse 35 here, but love your enemies, do good, and lend, expecting nothing
[time=2204] in return, and your award will be great, and you will be sons of the most high, for He
[time=2210] is kind to the ungrateful and the evil.
[time=2213] Can I get an amen?
[time=2214] That's you and me, in case you didn't know.
[time=2216] But be merciful, verse 36, even as your father is merciful.
[time=2221] So Jesus came, and He was speaking into this season, He's teaching about the kingdom, He's
[time=2227] teaching about the freedom that He came to give, but He's speaking into a group of people who I would say are backscratchers.
[time=2238] So Jesus is speaking to the first century, and there's a Latin word liberallatos, and you say that means absolutely nothing to me.
[time=2245] What it really characterizes is the ideology, the thinking behind what generosity should
[time=2251] look like in the world.
[time=2253] Jesus is speaking to that group of people, and that idea of liberallatos means I'll be generous if you'll be generous.
[time=2260] I'll give if I'm going to get something in return, I'll scratch your back if you scratch
[time=2267] my back.
[time=2268] Sounds a lot like today, doesn't it, if you're honest.
[time=2271] But Jesus knew that, and as Jesus went through that, He was entering a backscratching mentality
[time=2277] when it came to generosity, but He's changing the mentality surrounding generosity.
[time=2281] He's changing the mentality surrounding life.
[time=2284] Verse 36, be merciful as our father's merciful.
[time=2287] That means give, even as I give to you, and so my challenge would be this, if you talk about the tithing question, is I would say don't get so caught up in the percentage, get caught up in the heart behind whatever percentage you're at, because if you want to start going down the road of, well, I don't want to give 10%, because that's just legalistic.
[time=2305] Well, if you do what Jesus commanded us to do, and what the early church did because of the impact of Jesus, 10% starts to grow really quickly.
[time=2314] Acts chapter 4, I want to read it to you, Acts chapter 4, the early church.
[time=2318] This is after Jesus was on the scene, and He changed everything.
[time=2321] Verse 32 of Acts 4, all the believers were one in heart and mind, no one claimed that any of their possessions were their own, but they shared everything they had.
[time=2334] And so if we're truly displaying the generosity of Jesus, we start going from a 10% to 100%.
[time=2345] You see what I'm saying?
[time=2346] That's what Jesus did.
[time=2348] Now, am I saying you should sell your house and give it all to black, or if God tells you to, absolutely.
[time=2352] You want to know what my heart is for you?
[time=2354] My heart for you today is not that I want something from you.
[time=2357] Hear me when I tell you that as a pastor?
[time=2359] Yes, we take up offerings.
[time=2361] Yes, we go through all these things.
[time=2362] We give as an act of worship here.
[time=2364] I don't want something from you.
[time=2366] I want something for you in this series.
[time=2368] That's your pastor's heart, because I want you to be freed up.
[time=2371] I want you to have the balance.
[time=2372] I want you to have the margin and the openness to be able to obey God.
[time=2377] He may tell you to sell your house and go overseas.
[time=2380] He may tell you to do something radical, but that's when we start talking about the heart
[time=2386] of a healthy giver, a healthy Jesus follower.
[time=2390] Do you see that if you do it that way and start with the heart?
[time=2394] That's a good phrase, by the way, you should write that down.
[time=2396] That'll preach.
[time=2398] Start with the heart.
[time=2399] If you start with the heart, do you see how percentages stop to matter quite as much?
[time=2403] Now, I'll tell you, my family, I was raised in a Christian home where we tied.
[time=2407] We had the banks where we set it apart, and we would put those pennies in and all those different things.
[time=2412] But, you know, I was blessed with that because our family, Jessica and I have always done 10% or more, and we've had the goal of increasing it.
[time=2419] I say that not for a pat on the back, but because I believe in that, I believe it's a good picture of my heart to be able to give the first fruits of what God gives to me.
[time=2429] But I would tell you all that came as it's continued, even through the lows and the highs, because there were times we didn't have it, some of you are in that spot, and we decided to do it anyway.
[time=2439] There are times that God just taught us that generosity, 90%, does go farther than 100%
[time=2445] sometimes, that God does meet us in our generosity when we emulate what He is doing.
[time=2450] Did you know that in the Bible there's far more about how to manage money than there is about being generous?
[time=2457] If you line up those verses, a lot of verses about generosity, but most of what Jesus talked about was managing the stuff that we have.
[time=2464] Why?
[time=2465] Because I think if you start with the heart, and Jesus taught us this, where your treasure is your heart will be also, if you start with the heart, then generosity is just a natural
[time=2474] outflow and overflow of what's happening on the inside.
[time=2477] That's what we want to see in all of our hearts as believers and followers of Jesus.
[time=2482] Going on to verses 22 and 23, I want to talk about some internal indicators of a healthy
[time=2488] heart.
[time=2489] You ever notice how Jesus does that?
[time=2491] He takes the external stuff and He just brings it to the inside.
[time=2494] He brings it to the heart.
[time=2495] He does that in all of our lives.
[time=2497] He does that with the people He meets where they are.
[time=2499] So I want us to look at verses 22 and 23 because He talks about the eye being the lamp of the body and it goes towards our heart.
[time=2506] Verse 22 of Matthew 6, Matthew 6, 22, if you're back there with me, the eye is the lamp of the body.
[time=2512] So if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light.
[time=2515] You see the external to the internal happening here, don't you?
[time=2519] Verse 32 or 22 rather.
[time=2521] But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness if then the light in you,
[time=2527] verse 23, is darkness, how great is that darkness?
[time=2532] Your eyes, the window to your heart is what Jesus is talking about here.
[time=2535] I preached on this passage in context of a previous temple when they were building the temple.
[time=2540] The external tent to the internal tent, we house the light in the darkness and the light within you is that heart element.
[time=2547] Write this down if you're taking notes.
[time=2548] I believe that health starts with heart habits.
[time=2552] Health starts with heart habits.
[time=2553] Now I want to read you two verses and just let me read these over you from Psalm 119,
[time=2560] Psalm 119, verses 112 and 113.
[time=2564] I love this because it gives us a way to fight for the internal health in our heart that we desperately need.
[time=2570] The psalmist writes, "I incline my heart." I'll stop there for a second.
[time=2575] I incline.
[time=2576] Notice he says incline.
[time=2577] He didn't say, "I recline," he never met a reclining Christian before.
[time=2583] He didn't say, "I recline and relax in this." I incline.
[time=2586] I'm walking up a hill.
[time=2587] It's hard work.
[time=2588] I incline my heart to perform your statutes forever to the end, verse 113.
[time=2594] I hate.
[time=2595] You don't think of seeing that a whole lot in Scripture, but we're going to see it again in a minute.
[time=2600] I hate the double-minded, but I love your law.
[time=2603] I hate and I love.
[time=2606] What God's called us to is loving good habits in our heart enough that we hate.
[time=2611] We can't stand but hate the bad habits that pull us away from our treasure being where it needs to be, from our hearts being where it needs to be.
[time=2620] We often hate the good ones, don't we?
[time=2621] Anybody ever said, "I just hate exercise." Most of the time, it's not that we actually hate exercise.
[time=2628] If we get down to it, we hate that we don't have a habit of exercising, if we're honest.
[time=2633] If you got in the habit and saw what it does for you, I'm going to talk, right?
[time=2638] Then we would love it.
[time=2640] And the same thing happens in our life.
[time=2642] Can I show you a picture of something that I just, man, you talk about habits.
[time=2645] Look at this picture.
[time=2646] It just speaks for itself.
[time=2650] I'm here to tell you, "Ooh, buddy, I can go through a whole bag of those bad boys."
[time=2658] Don't judge me.
[time=2660] If it was Easter, you probably would have to, right?
[time=2662] But here's the thing about those Reese's eggs.
[time=2664] I love me some Reese's eggs.
[time=2666] I love what Reese's eggs do for me.
[time=2674] And the same is true of our heart, isn't it?
[time=2676] Of our habits, inside our heart.
[time=2678] Even those habits that hear me, even those habits that you think nobody knows about.
[time=2681] You have any of those habits you think you've got concealed, that nobody, maybe even your spouse doesn't know about those.
[time=2688] It starts like this, "I love the moment, but I'll hate it in a minute.
[time=2692] I love the feeling, but I hate what it does to my future.
[time=2697] I love the now, but I hate what's next." Maybe it's time for some new internal heart habits, what you're focusing your attention
[time=2708] on today.
[time=2709] And so that leads me to this other, these daily decisions.
[time=2711] I want to give you some daily decisions of a healthy heart, daily decisions of a healthy heart.
[time=2716] You know, we just read that about loving and hating within our heart, hating the things that pull me away from what God's doing inside of me.
[time=2723] Let's look at that same mentality.
[time=2725] Let's look at verse 24 of Matthew 6 continuing on in our passage, Jesus says, "No one can serve two masters, for either he will," what, "hate." He will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise
[time=2740] the other.
[time=2741] You cannot serve God and, you cannot serve God and money.
[time=2748] What do you serve today?
[time=2748] It's a good internal heart question.
[time=2750] Now, I want us to look at some daily decisions, and I want to speak to somebody though before
[time=2756] I do, give you, I want to give you three decisions as we tie this, tie a bow on this topic and thought today.
[time=2762] More of a teaching mode today, more of something that you can take some teaching and apply to your life.
[time=2766] We've been preaching about these characters and we've been preaching up a storm on them, but there comes a time where we've got to let the rubber meet the road too and just go through some teaching in the nitty gritty details of our life, but I still know somebody's here and you would say, "You still resist the church because it's full of hypocrites," or, "Because all they do is ask for my money," and they just talk about my money.
[time=2786] You know, I was thinking about this, and if that's true, I'm not asking you to trust and follow me, but I do want to ask one thing of you, if that's you, don't discount Jesus.
[time=2796] Because I've been studying Jesus and money for a little while now, and you know what I found?
[time=2802] I can't find one place.
[time=2803] I did find one, and I'll give you the exception, but overall, really, I can't find one place where Jesus asked for money in Scripture.
[time=2812] There was one time where he asked for a coin, he said, "Who's got a coin?" And he held it up and he gave this lesson about giving to Caesar or what his Caesar's, but Scripture would really even indicate that he gave that back.
[time=2821] It was just an illustration.
[time=2822] He doesn't even ask for money.
[time=2825] When I look at Jesus, yet he talks about it all the time, and I know what some of you
[time=2834] are thinking right now, "Well, if Jesus don't ask for it, then why do you?" I got two answers for you.
[time=2840] Number one, I'm not Jesus.
[time=2845] Number two is that we believe so much in what Jesus talked about with our money, and I want
[time=2851] to give you a statement.
[time=2852] This is why we talk about it, because Jesus wanted something for you.
[time=2856] Like I said, "I don't want something from you, I want something for you." Write this down if you're taking notes.
[time=2860] Jesus doesn't want to get your money.
[time=2862] Jesus just doesn't want your money to get you.
[time=2866] He never asked for it.
[time=2869] He just knew the challenge that it would pose in all of our lives.
[time=2876] He doesn't want your money.
[time=2877] He already owns it all.
[time=2879] That's why here at Black Talk, we still do giving as an act of worship.
[time=2883] Why?
[time=2884] You say, "Well, why would we do that at the church?" Because here's what I found about giving, is I'll read the Bible and learn about Jesus and his approach to it.
[time=2890] Giving is not for him, it's for me.
[time=2899] It's for my heart.
[time=2900] It's for what Jesus is doing all around us.
[time=2902] I want to give you three daily decisions that will help you start making some good, healthy habits today as we look at this principle.
[time=2909] Jesus is 25 through 30, I want to read this to you.
[time=2911] The first one is this, know your loved.
[time=2914] Somebody say that with me.
[time=2915] Know your loved.
[time=2916] Look at somebody and say, "Know your love." Tell them.
[time=2920] Somebody needed just to hear that today, and I'm about to read that from the words of Jesus verses 25 through 30 of Matthew chapter 6.
[time=2926] Jesus says, "Therefore I tell you, don't be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on.
[time=2933] Is not life more than food." Some of us will say, "Oh, oh, hi, deep." And the body more than clothing.
[time=2942] Look at the birds of the air.
[time=2944] They neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them.
[time=2949] Are you not of more value than they?
[time=2953] And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to the span of life?
[time=2959] And why are you anxious about clothing?
[time=2961] Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow.
[time=2963] They need their toil nor spin, yet I tell you, I tell you, even Solomon, and all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
[time=2970] But if God so closed the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much?
[time=2977] Will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
[time=2983] God sent me here to this place today to tell somebody that you are loved.
[time=2990] Last week I gave you a statement, and the statement was simply, "When you know you're loved, you love differently.
[time=2998] When you know you're loved, you love differently.
[time=3003] When you have received, you give differently.
[time=3008] When you run into Jesus, you become more generous, you become more like Him, you become more
[time=3014] radical in your love for other people, in your notes, the tie together phrase for all of that is simply this.
[time=3020] Open hearts lead to open hands.
[time=3029] This week when you're tweeting, if you're going to tweet something, if you're going to put something on social media, hashtag something for me, hashtag no more white knuckles.
[time=3037] Because I just believe if the world looked and saw a church, and I'm not just talking about money, I'm talking about our love, I'm talking about our hearts, I'm talking about our openness to different people, I'm talking about our openness and radical love that knows no bounds like I see in Jesus, His amazing, amazing grace that met me in the middle of
[time=3056] my mess.
[time=3057] I'm talking about a church that would freely give that, but so many times the world looks at the church and all they see are white knuckles.
[time=3066] My plea to you today is to open your hands because God's doing something in your heart, but let your open heart lead to open hands, hashtag no more white knuckles.
[time=3078] And I believe the day that is the norm for the church.
[time=3082] People would go to the church instead of from the church.
[time=3086] That's the church that Jesus is building, and there are days it feels like it's losing, but hear me when I tell you, it's not losing, God is winning, He is not done, He is still building His church, and even the gates of hell will not prevail against it.
[time=3102] We're going to come out on top if we just open handedly, say Jesus, I'm yours, I've read the end.
[time=3107] Have you read the end of this amazing story?
[time=3111] Guess what?
[time=3112] I can sum it up for you.
[time=3113] I've read through it plenty of times, maybe you've never even read through 10 verses before, I sum it up.
[time=3119] Jesus wins.
[time=3122] And I like being on a winning team.
[time=3124] And I'm not following Jesus because I want to win in life.
[time=3127] And when Jesus said I want to give you life and give it to you more abundantly, it doesn't mean He's going to give you that million that you're looking for.
[time=3133] It doesn't mean He's going to give you that job that you're looking for.
[time=3135] It means that no matter what you get, no matter what life looks like in your life, money-wise, bank account-wise, relationship-wise, career-wise, that Jesus is giving you hope, He's giving you freedom.
[time=3146] And He's giving you that peace that passes understanding, that surpasses all the barriers of our life.
[time=3152] Open hands lead to open hearts.
[time=3154] Continue on with me, verse 31.
[time=3156] The second thing, not just know your love, number two is stop worrying.
[time=3160] Look at somebody and just say quit it.
[time=3163] Tell them, so just quit it.
[time=3165] How many self-professing worry warts do we have in the room?
[time=3168] Let's just own it.
[time=3170] Okay.
[time=3171] Well, this is for you.
[time=3172] You already heard some of it.
[time=3173] Verse 31, Jesus continues of Matthew chapter 6 verse 31, "Therefore, do not be anxious
[time=3180] saying what shall we eat?
[time=3182] What shall we drink?
[time=3183] What shall we wear?" Even the Gentiles, they seek after all these things, talking about the ungodly, talking about those who maybe we would condemn or they would condemn in that time.
[time=3192] And they seek after those things and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.
[time=3199] Some of us operate in life like God doesn't even see our need.
[time=3201] He knows.
[time=3203] It may be through your drying up, through your emptiness that God's going to lead you to the greatest openness that He could ever lead you into in your life.
[time=3212] So stop worrying.
[time=3214] Put worry aside, trust the one who's been open with you.
[time=3218] Verse 33 and 34 gives us the third daily decision, know your love, stop worrying.
[time=3222] The last thing is simply this, daily decide to be open.
[time=3226] You say, "Well, I don't know what that means.
[time=3227] Let me let Jesus help you with that." Verse 33 says a very popular verse here, "But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness
[time=3236] and all these things will be added to you." I mean, you get everything you want?
[time=3240] No, it means God's going to provide exactly what you need in the exact season that you need it, for Him to take you to whatever kingdom purposes that He's bringing forth in your
[time=3251] life.
[time=3252] Verse 34, "Do not be anxious again." So quit that worrying.
[time=3254] Quit it.
[time=3256] Just quit it.
[time=3256] "Therefore, do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself."
[time=3262] Can I tell you that the only way to tomorrow is through today?
[time=3267] Some of you are so hung up in what tomorrow may or may not be that you're just not even thinking about today.
[time=3273] The only way to tomorrow is through today.
[time=3275] Let Him carry you through today and tomorrow is going to come.
[time=3278] And then He ends with this, "Efficient for the day is on trouble." Can I get in, amen?
[time=3285] Some of you are in trouble.
[time=3286] But today is a day to decide to put kingdom things first, pursue Jesus, seek the kingdom,
[time=3292] the big K kingdom, the big sea church, seek what He's doing and His purposes, live in light of eternity.
[time=3298] You know what happens when you live in light of eternity?
[time=3301] You live confident in this life because of the next.
[time=3306] Somebody needs to take that step.
[time=3307] I want to give you one challenge as we tie things together today.
[time=3310] One last challenge is this.
[time=3312] When it comes to your money, maybe God's convicting you there.
[time=3315] Just for one week, track every dollar that you spend.
[time=3319] Write it down.
[time=3320] Have a notebook.
[time=3321] Use a spreadsheet.
[time=3322] Use quicken.
[time=3323] Use some software.
[time=3324] Use something to just track for one week.
[time=3326] Not talking about the rest of your life for one week and just look at every single dollar.
[time=3331] You ready for the phrase?
[time=3332] I want to give you.
[time=3333] This is why I need to be knowing where all my money is going.
[time=3341] You need to be knowing where all your money is going.
[time=3345] So that's a challenge for you.
[time=3346] Look at that and then come back, bring it back with you next week.
[time=3349] And I believe that just for you, just for you, that God's going to reveal some stuff to you about your heart within that, as you look at your treasure.
[time=3359] But let's live in a lot of eternity, be confident in this life because of the next.
[time=3363] Buy your heads with me, if you will, and close your eyes.
[time=3365] Nobody looking around.
[time=3367] Just you and me and Jesus for a minute, because somebody is here, and you would simply say
[time=3373] that when you talk about eternity, you've done a lot of teaching today.
[time=3378] Most of it was pointed directly at Christians, that followers of Jesus, and I hope it's been a good foundational moment for many of you in the room about being open.
[time=3386] But some of you would say, I just felt like God is stirring something in my soul pertaining to eternity.
[time=3393] And you would say that if I were to die today, I don't know that I've lived in a lot of eternity, because number one, I can't be good enough to make it to heaven.
[time=3402] But number two, you would say, I don't know that I've trusted Jesus to save me.
[time=3408] I believe in Jesus, and maybe he's stirring in your heart right now, but simply knowing of Jesus doesn't save anybody.
[time=3416] Satan himself knows all about Jesus.
[time=3419] It's about embracing Jesus, it's about trusting Jesus.
[time=3422] Salvation's about saying Jesus, I can't save me because of my sin.
[time=3426] So we don't use a whole lot, is it?
[time=3429] But we all have it.
[time=3431] We all sin, and that sin separates us from a God who loves us so very much, so much that
[time=3438] Jesus came to this earth, left his seat in the throne room of heaven beside his father,
[time=3444] became a human, who walked the same life.
[time=3447] We don't have a high priest who can't sympathize with us in our struggles.
[time=3451] He walked through those struggles, but there's a big difference in him and us.
[time=3454] He walked through those struggles, and he came out victorious.
[time=3458] Though we fell down, he got up, he didn't sin where we sin.
[time=3463] He lived the sinless life that we can't live.
[time=3467] Why?
[time=3468] So that he could be a perfect sacrifice, an atonement for our sins, and our shortcomings.
[time=3474] And he died of brutal death on that cross, and while he was on the cross, guess who was
[time=3480] on his mind?
[time=3483] You, you, Ron, his mind.
[time=3487] He paid that price we couldn't pay, and all the story didn't end there because he rose from that grave.
[time=3493] He went into a borrowed tomb, and it's borrowed because he didn't need it very long.
[time=3497] It's three days later, he walked out of that tomb, and with him came the keys, the victory
[time=3503] to death, hell, and the grave, a conquering of your sin and mine, a bridge that is now
[time=3509] made between us and the Father.
[time=3512] He met us where we are in our mess, so that this moment for somebody in this room could happen, where you could say, "Jesus, I'm yours, save me, forgive me today."
[time=3524] You confess with your mouth, and believe in your heart, Jesus's Lord, that he's alive in this place.
[time=3529] The Bible says, and it's not just the Bible speaking, or who wrote it, it's God himself saying to you, "You shall be saved." Yes, it's that simple.
[time=3540] Will you take a moment?
[time=3541] I'm not going to lead you in a prayer, because I believe your heart's screaming that prayer.
[time=3544] You don't have to say it eloquently, God wants your heart, all of it, the mess.
[time=3547] However, you would say that to him in this moment.
[time=3550] If you'll cry it out to him, no matter where you are, no matter what's going on inside of you in this moment, will you take just a minute?
[time=3555] Right now, cry out to Jesus, and I promise you, he will meet you right where you are.
[time=3561] Do that right now.
