[time=975] [MUSIC - 200 seconds]
[time=1188] - Good morning.
[time=1189] Please open your Bibles to first chronicles chapter 29.
[time=1194] Curtis stole all my jokes.
[time=1197] I got nothing left.
[time=1200] Actually, Darren was here earlier this morning.
[time=1203] He just stopped by to say hi, he did.
[time=1206] And then he had to go to his church.
[time=1207] Ah, he's right, ah, I miss Darren.
[time=1211] But he misses me more.
[time=1214] All right.
[time=1214] We're in a new series called Open.
[time=1217] I wanna thank Pastor Kevin for inviting me back.
[time=1220] It's really good to be back.
[time=1223] Thank you for the invitation.
[time=1226] Last time, he talked about Open to be healthy.
[time=1231] And today we're talking about Open to be owned.
[time=1234] But before we do that, I wanna share a joy, momentous occasion in our family's life.
[time=1240] One of the greatest joys in a parent's life is to lead their kids to the Lord, which I was able to do when my sons were nine and seven respectively.
[time=1250] But I only got to baptize them this last summer, about a week before school started.
[time=1256] So I just wanted to share that with you.
[time=1258] Timothy on the left, Nicholas.
[time=1260] On the right, Timothy is with us this morning.
[time=1262] He's a freshman at Grace now.
[time=1264] And then Nicholas is a freshman at the high school, but he's on a church retreat today.
[time=1269] So I just wanted to share that joy with you.
[time=1272] (audience applauds) Last Sunday, we learned that open hearts
[time=1282] lead to open hands.
[time=1285] And we come to the book of Chronicles, which is a very important book.
[time=1291] Those of you who love history, Chronicles, is a book of history.
[time=1295] The chronicler actually just means historians.
[time=1299] So Chronicles is a history book.
[time=1302] And whoever is the historian, in this case, is writing about the history of Israel and focuses on David.
[time=1312] David, King David, and the hope of the temple.
[time=1317] See, this historian is in a way very biased historian.
[time=1322] He wants to show David in a very positive light.
[time=1325] He doesn't talk about David Sinud Batchiba.
[time=1329] He doesn't mention any of the censuses that David does, and God is angry with him, because that's not the point of this book.
[time=1338] The point of this book is to show that David wanted to build a temple to the Lord.
[time=1343] And God says to David, "David, good thought.
[time=1349] "But because you're a man of war, "because there's blood on your hands, "you will not build that temple for me.
[time=1356] "But your son Solomon will build that temple for me." And while we see here at the end of the book, basically these are David's last days.
[time=1366] And he wants to get involved into the building project, and as you know, any building project requires funds and requires resources.
[time=1377] And we see that David leads by example, and that's the first lesson we learn.
[time=1382] First Chronicles, chapter 29, is the godly leaders lead by example.
[time=1388] Look with me, please, in chapter 29, a first chronicle starting in verse one.
[time=1392] And David, the king, said to all the assembly, "Solomon, my son, whom alone God has chosen "is young and inexperienced, and the work is great, "for the palace will not be for men, "but for the Lord God." So I have provided for the house of my God, so far as I was able, the gold for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver, and the bronze for the things of bronze, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood, besides great quantities of onyx and stones for setting antimony, collared stones, and all sorts of precious stones and marble.
[time=1426] Moreover, in addition to all these, I have provided for the holy house, I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, and because of my devotion to the house of my God, I will give it to the house of my God.
[time=1438] 3,000 talents of gold and gold of a fear, and 7,000 talents of refined silver for overlaying the walls of the house, and for all the work to be done in by craftsmen, gold for the things of gold and silver, for the things of silver.
[time=1450] So we see David says, look, we have a great project to do, now you guys give, right?
[time=1456] No, no, no, Godly leaders always lead by example.
[time=1461] Hey, we need this, and I am the first one to give so much.
[time=1466] That's what David does.
[time=1469] Not only does he do that, but he challenges others to be generous as well.
[time=1476] First David leads by example, but then he says, you, those of you who are leaders, especially, you need to consecrate yourselves to the Lord.
[time=1487] Who then, this is a question.
[time=1489] Who then will offer willingly, consecrating himself to the Lord?
[time=1494] Did you catch that?
[time=1497] He says, who then will offer willingly?
[time=1500] But then he ties in giving with consecration.
[time=1504] Consecration comes from the experience of the idea of being holy to the Lord.
[time=1511] Giving, in other words, is an act of worship.
[time=1514] Giving is an act of worship.
[time=1518] We're just, we're celebrating the 500 years of the Reformation, right?
[time=1523] Do you know what one thing that came out of the Reformation, one very important thing, was the priesthood of all believers, remember that?
[time=1530] In other words, we are all priests bringing sacrifices, that's everything that we do in life, preaching, teaching, singing, giving, whatever it is, it's an act of worship to the Lord.
[time=1543] And that's what David wants people to understand.
[time=1547] Sure, David leads by example, then he challenges everybody else, notice to consecrate themselves, to set a part, to be set apart for the Lord, who then will offer willingly, not be grudgingly, not I'm gonna twist your arm, but willingly, to consecrate, and then consecrating himself to the Lord.
[time=1570] My dear brothers and sisters, you cannot say, I'm consecrating myself to the Lord, but I do what I want with my possessions.
[time=1581] Open to be owned is about being owned by God first.
[time=1586] Again, we learned last week, open hearts lead to open hands.
[time=1590] If we indeed worship God with everything that we do, giving should be an act of worship.
[time=1599] And in this case, in this case, the faithful respond by being generous.
[time=1605] We have all these numbers here.
[time=1607] They gave for the service of God 5,000 talents and 10,000 derricks of gold, 10,000 talents of silver, 18 talents bronze, and 100,000 talents of iron.
[time=1619] When you do the math, in today's money, that would come to about 30 million dollars.
[time=1629] Would you say that was a successful campaign?
[time=1632] I would say so.
[time=1635] But notice, please, what happens?
[time=1637] First, David leads by example.
[time=1639] Then he challenges the people not just to be generous, but to be consecrating themselves to the Lord, to be holy to the Lord.
[time=1646] You've got to give yourself to God first, and then everything else that you do will follow, including what you do with your money.
[time=1653] But if you live with the idea, hey, what is mine is mine, and not is God's, then your giving will be off.
[time=1660] I've heard people like that.
[time=1663] And that's why I could never understand, how come we can pay more for cable TV than for what we give to church.
[time=1670] Think about that for a second.
[time=1672] Is it right in your mind?
[time=1676] I'm not, I don't know how much you make, I don't know how much you give, but ask yourself in your mind, is it okay for you to give more to cable TV or cell phone service than what you give to church?
[time=1689] Just ask yourself that question.
[time=1691] Ask it that way.
[time=1694] But the faithful in this case respond by being generous, and they give because they first consecrated themselves to the Lord, and we see that generosity gives way to joy.
[time=1707] Look at the end result, then the people rejoiced, because they had given willingly, for with a whole heart they had offered freely to the Lord, and David the king also rejoiced greatly.
[time=1720] Open hearts lead to open hands.
[time=1724] Pastor Kevin taught us last week.
[time=1726] One scholar puts it like this, "People are closest to God likeness in self-giving, "and the nearer they approach God likeness, "the more genuinely and rightly they become capable "of rejoicing." I like that.
[time=1744] People are closest to God likeness in self-giving.
[time=1747] God gave of himself, he gave his only son, then when we get closer to him, we will do the same in our self-giving.
[time=1756] And when that happens, not only do the leaders rejoice, but all the people rejoice.
[time=1761] Do you think they'll be joy next Sunday?
[time=1765] If Kevin will get up here and say, "We have met the challenge." Do you think he will rejoice?
[time=1773] He will.
[time=1774] But in order for you to rejoice, you need to step up and give yourself to God, and be generous, because what you have is really what God allows you to have.
[time=1785] Now God, God, God, the leaders praise God.
[time=1789] Notice, please, the result, not only produces joy in David's heart, but then now he addresses the Lord.
[time=1796] He's done addressing the people.
[time=1797] Now he's addressing the Lord, starting in verse 10.
[time=1800] Therefore David blessed the Lord in the presence of all the assembly.
[time=1804] And David said, "Blessed are you, O Lord, "the God of Israel and Father forever and ever.
[time=1810] "Yours, O Lord, is the greatness and the power "and the glory and the victory and the majesty, "for all that is in the heavens and all in earth is yours.
[time=1818] "Yours is the kingdom, O Lord, "and you are exalted as head above all." And then verse 12.
[time=1826] Again, David understands that everything that we have is from God.
[time=1830] He says, "Both riches and honor come from you, "and you rule over all.
[time=1835] "In your hand are power and might, "and in your hand is to make great "and to give strength to all." My dear brothers and sisters, if we have anything, any possessions that we have is because God allows us to have those possessions.
[time=1847] If we can't make monies because God gives us strength so we can get up and go to work and make those money.
[time=1854] Everything we should understand that everything is because of God's love, mercy, and grace for us.
[time=1862] And that's why God leaders will always praise God and God leaders will always give credit or credit is due.
[time=1870] And that's why David not only praises the Lord, but he also thanks the Lord.
[time=1876] And now we thank you, our God, and praise your glorious name.
[time=1883] We are approaching thanksgiving.
[time=1885] Are there things we can be thankful for?
[time=1888] There are, right?
[time=1890] There are many things we can be thankful for.
[time=1893] And when we thank God, that kind of becomes very contagious.
[time=1898] When you, isn't it better to have friends and people that are very encouraging and thankful?
[time=1907] It's contagious, isn't it?
[time=1909] Where's Curtis?
[time=1917] (congregation laughing) Is that rain?
[time=1922] Is that a storm?
[time=1923] Okay, I'm glad we're inside then.
[time=1927] We thank God for the rain.
[time=1933] Amen, amen.
[time=1936] God leaders, not only thank God, but God leaders recognize God's provision.
[time=1939] Again, verse 14, but who am I?
[time=1942] And what is my people that we should be able thus to offer wiggly for all things come from you and of your own have we given to you, David?
[time=1951] Again, it recognizes the source of his blessing.
[time=1955] All things come from you.
[time=1958] So, let's get down to the bottom line.
[time=1961] I know some of you are business people.
[time=1963] Okay, Tiberius, what's the bottom line?
[time=1966] How much should I give?
[time=1967] That's the question.
[time=1969] How much should I give?
[time=1971] Well, in order to answer that question, I think we already answered it, but we're gonna go again.
[time=1978] We're gonna cross the bridge into the New Testament.
[time=1980] If you have your Bibles, turn it with me please to Mark chapter 12.
[time=1984] I want us to cross the bridge into the New Testament and see what Jesus has to say about giving.
[time=1990] 'Cause people always ask me, Tiberius, how much should I give?
[time=1995] Is 10% still the minimum requirement or should I think about more?
[time=2002] I think we have an answer in Mark chapter 12.
[time=2011] In Mark chapter 12, first of all, we see Jesus at the temple, starting in verse 38.
[time=2019] Jesus is at the temple teaching, and the first thing he does, he condemns the predators, looking verses 38 and on.
[time=2030] Jesus, as he's teaching at the temple, says, "Beware of the scribes "who like to walk around in long robes "and like greetings in the market places "and have the best seats in the synagogues "and the places of honor at feasts, "who devour widows' houses "and for a pretense make long prayers, "they will receive the greater condemnation." And he sat down opposite the treasury and watched the people putting money into the offering box.
[time=2054] Mary reached people, put in large sums.
[time=2059] See, there was a place at the temple where you could give your donations.
[time=2064] They did not pass the plate around there because people would come different times of the day to the temple.
[time=2070] They would come from different places.
[time=2071] There was now one time to take the offering, so they would have certain places around the temple where they could come and put their money in.
[time=2079] These were large treasure chests and there were large treasure chests and there were some things that looked like trumpets, brass trumpets where you'd drop your coins in.
[time=2089] So imagine that the more money you had, the louder the sound when you dropped the money.
[time=2097] That's why I love online giving because nobody knows how much you give.
[time=2104] And nobody hears the how much you put in.
[time=2108] Right, I like that.
[time=2110] See, this is brilliant on the back of the bullet and it says, four ways to give.
[time=2116] Back in Jesus' time, there was only one way to give.
[time=2119] You guys have four ways to give.
[time=2122] In person online through text and automated or whatever the word is on.
[time=2129] (audience laughs) Something auto, I think by car, I think that's what I mean.
[time=2134] (audience laughs) It's not wrong to be rich, my dear brothers and sisters.
[time=2146] But when you give and you give so people can hear how much you give, then that's wrong.
[time=2155] Jesus condemns the predators here.
[time=2159] See, many rich people put in large sums, but Jesus is not commanding to reach people here.
[time=2167] Verse 41 says, and he said down opposite the treasury and watched the people putting money into the offering box.
[time=2174] Many rich people put in the sums.
[time=2176] And then in verse 42, we see that Jesus commands
[time=2182] the generous, but look who the generous are.
[time=2185] A poor widow came and put in two small copper coins,
[time=2191] which make a penny, and he called his disciples to him and said to them, truly I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all who are contributing to the offering box.
[time=2201] For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had.
[time=2210] All she had to live on.
[time=2213] So imagine the scene.
[time=2214] All these guys would come with their big donations and they would make a fuss about how much you would fall in.
[time=2221] And Jesus doesn't command them.
[time=2226] Jesus commands the poor widow who put in two copper coins.
[time=2232] They maybe didn't even make a sound.
[time=2237] Jesus commands the widow.
[time=2241] The widow makes it into biblical history, not because of how big her check was, but because her commitment was total.
[time=2249] She gave everything, and that's the lesson.
[time=2253] The lesson in giving is for us to give ourselves to God totally, and then the answer how much to give will come very easily.
[time=2264] But we try to nickel and dime God because we don't understand this concept of commitment.
[time=2273] Jesus commands the widow and says, truly I say to you, this poor widow has put more than all those who are contributing to the offering box.
[time=2286] For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had.
[time=2294] All she had to live on.
[time=2297] In God's economy, it doesn't matter the dollar amount, but how much you are given in relation to how much you have.
[time=2305] How much God has given to you.
[time=2308] That's why there's wisdom in you not knowing how much I give online and me not knowing how much you give online or in person or by car, however you wanna give it.
[time=2319] It really doesn't matter.
[time=2322] It's good for us not to know because some of us might be proud.
[time=2327] Some of us might not be.
[time=2331] But the widow demonstrated the trust.
[time=2335] She trusted that God can take care of her even if she gave all that she had.
[time=2341] I think I told you the story before about the pig and the chicken, you remember?
[time=2346] They wanted to go on business together.
[time=2349] They said, let's open a business.
[time=2352] We're gonna open a breakfast business.
[time=2355] And we will serve ham and eggs.
[time=2361] (audience laughing) And the chicken was ready to go into this.
[time=2367] The pig said, yeah, but if we do this,
[time=2376] what you give is an offering, what I give is sacrifice.
[time=2381] See, a lot of us are very good about businesses
[time=2387] when someone else sacrifices, not when I sacrifice.
[time=2394] So we're okay with offerings.
[time=2396] Oh yeah, we can give the nickels and the dimes.
[time=2401] But what about sacrificial giving?
[time=2406] The only time in scripture where God says, put me to the test is in Malachi.
[time=2410] Malachi, chapter three, God says, bring the full tides into the storehouse that there may be food in my house and thereby put me to the test as the Lord of hosts.
[time=2420] If I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down your blessing until there is no more need.
[time=2425] The concept of 10% my dear brothers and sisters was not devised by a group of pastors.
[time=2433] The concept of the 10% was not devised by Moses and his contemporaries.
[time=2439] This is the only place in the whole Bible where God says, test me, the only place.
[time=2446] The principle, again, is not that our money is ours,
[time=2454] but that God allows us to have it.
[time=2455] Because he says, if you don't give it, then you rob the Lord.
[time=2462] Do you catch that?
[time=2463] The concept there was, God gave you 100%,
[time=2469] and if you keep, well, everything for you, instead of giving it to God, you are a thief.
[time=2475] Everything that we have, my dear brothers and sisters, should be God's.
[time=2482] If you want to know how committed you are to God, check your checkbook.
[time=2487] Look at what you spend the money on this last month, and you will answer the question how much you are God's.
[time=2495] How much you want to serve God?
[time=2500] Can't Hughes write?
[time=2504] There is a disease which is particularly virulent in our century.
[time=2508] It is called cirrhosis of the giver.
[time=2510] It was actually discovered about 34 AD and it ran a terminal course in a couple named Anousence of Phyra in Acts 5.
[time=2521] It is an acute condition which renders the patient send immobile when it attempts to move from the willful to the offering plate.
[time=2528] The remedy is to remove the afflicted from the house of God.
[time=2534] Since it is clinically observable, the discontinue disappears in alternate environments such as golf courses, clubs or restaurants.
[time=2544] Actually, the disease is really not a motor problem.
[time=2548] It is a heart problem.
[time=2549] But the best remedy is to fall in love with God and with all your heart.
[time=2555] For where your heart is, there will also your treasure be.
[time=2558] There are three levels of giving.
[time=2566] My good friend Calvin Miller, who's now with the Lord, said there are three levels of giving.
[time=2572] The fame level, the game level and the shame level.
[time=2577] He writes this.
[time=2579] At the fame level, a strange bow to pride begins.
[time=2585] It is easy at the level to be proud and ostentatious.
[time=2589] This was the level in which the Pharisees gave and made a great show of their devotion.
[time=2593] When they gave, they held the coins high and dropped them with a brazen ring in the temple coffers.
[time=2600] At the game level, the giver tries to figure out what is the most blessing he can buy with the least down payment.
[time=2608] Such givers try to figure out how to give a little bit in such flamboyant ways that they purchase a generous reputation with their well publicized pitances.
[time=2619] Game givers try to figure out what would be reasonable in comparison to what others are giving.
[time=2626] They compare their offerings with the average and then they give just a little more.
[time=2632] That's the game level.
[time=2633] The last level, the shame level, is the level of those who can never give enough.
[time=2643] These givers always look at the price Jesus paid at Calvary.
[time=2647] Even when they give all, they wish he were more.
[time=2653] They even feel a little ashamed.
[time=2656] It is so little.
[time=2660] Someone said, when I write a check to the IRS, the IRS doesn't care if I give willingly or grudgingly.
[time=2668] I don't know about you, but I write that grudgingly.
[time=2672] I do.
[time=2674] But when it comes to God's work, that shouldn't be.
[time=2680] 1 Corinthians 13.3 says, "If I give all I possess to the poor "and surrender my body to the flames but have not love, "I mean nothing.
[time=2689] "But if I give a penny with the widow's heart, "it is gain to me and to God." God, my dear brothers and sisters, is blessing us.
[time=2700] And all that we have is from him and is his.
[time=2704] The question is, what level are we at when we give?
[time=2709] And how sacrificially do we give?
[time=2715] I read about two Christians who were visiting China.
[time=2720] They were both very wealthy.
[time=2722] One was a lawyer and the other one was a merchant.
[time=2725] And they visited, they were visiting someone, sorry,
[time=2732] not in China in Korea.
[time=2734] And they were in Korea and they were traveling and looking at different things in the countryside.
[time=2740] And as they were traveling, they saw an unusual sight.
[time=2744] It was a boy pooling a plow.
[time=2749] While an old man held his hands, the handles,
[time=2755] and he thought it was unusual that instead of an ox or a horse,
[time=2764] it was a boy pooling the plow.
[time=2768] The lawyer was amused so he took a picture.
[time=2772] Commenting to the guy, he said, "That is an unusual sight.
[time=2776] I suppose they are very poor." And the pastor said, "Yes, they are very poor.
[time=2782] That is the family of Chinui." When the church was built, was being built in this area, they were excited to give something to help it along, but they had no money, so they sold their only ox and gave the money to the church.
[time=2796] This spring, they are taking turns pooling the plow themselves.
[time=2803] The lawyer said, "That must have been a real sacrifice."
[time=2810] The guy said, "They did not call it that." When they reached home, the lawyer took the picture to the pastor.
[time=2817] As he sat down in the pastor study, he said forcefully, "I want to double my pledge to the church and please give me some plow work to do." I have never known what sacrifice for the church meant.
[time=2830] A converted Christian taught me, "I am ashamed to say, I have never yet given anything to my church that cost me anything."
[time=2841] My dear brothers and sisters, before you give, please understand God is interested in you.
[time=2849] God is interested that you totally commit yourself to him, and then give at whatever level you want.
[time=2859] For application this morning, I just have to.
[time=2863] First, surrender your all to God, and then be a cheerful giver.
[time=2869] When Paul writes to the church in Corinth in 2 Corinthians 9,
[time=2876] he makes it very clear about this concept, this principle, that first you need to give yourself to God before you give anything.
[time=2886] In 2 Corinthians 9, verse 8, please, 1 chapter 8, verses 3 to 5,
[time=2894] Paul is commanding the church in Macedonia and says, "For they gave according to their means, as I can testify and beyond their means of their own free will, begging us earnestly for the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints." And this, not as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord.
[time=2914] They gave themselves first to the Lord, and then by the will of God to us.
[time=2922] So it's not about how much you give, how much are you surrendered to God.
[time=2930] Second will be a cheerful giver.
[time=2933] Also in 2 Corinthians 9, Paul writes,
[time=2939] "The point is this, whoever so sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sos bountifully will also reap bountifully.
[time=2947] Each one must give as he had made up in his mind not reluctantly or under compulsion for God loves a cheerful giver."
[time=2958] My dear brothers and sisters, the title of the sermon is open to be owned
[time=2965] because the idea is to be owned by God.
[time=2969] Are you totally committed to God?
[time=2972] Does he own you?
[time=2975] Or do you always think about what do I own?
[time=2980] Or what do I own?
[time=2984] Open hearts lead to open hands, right?
[time=2990] But fully surrendered lives will lead to fully surrendered lives forever.
[time=2999] My prayer for you is that you will say, like Francis Habergam, who said, "Take my silver and my gold.
[time=3009] Not a might that I would hold.
[time=3012] Take my intellect and use.
[time=3014] Every power is thy, thou shall choose." Are you ready to do that?
[time=3022] I'm not asking you to calm down the aisle to make and see how much you give.
[time=3028] I want you to do that in your own heart.
[time=3031] But before you give or you decide what you're going to give, give yourself to the Lord.
[time=3037] If there are still areas in your life that you think, "Hey, I'm the boss of that," then you have a heart problem and you need to take care of that.
[time=3046] And then decide to be a cheerful giver, giving not under compulsion, but because you want to.
[time=3053] So let's stand together and sing the song called, "Take My Life and Let It Be." And in one of the verses, we will sing that.
[time=3063] Even that.
[time=3065] Take my silver and my gold.
[time=3069] But before we do that, it says, "Take My Life and Let It Be." So let's sing this together as an answer to God's word today.
[time=3083] [MUSIC] Take My Life and Let It Be [MUSIC] Go and separate the Lord to do thee [MUSIC] Take My moment and my days [MUSIC] Let them flow in, seek us as praise [MUSIC] Let them flow in, seek us as praise [MUSIC] Take My moment and let it be [MUSIC] Take My Life and Let It Be [MUSIC] Take My Life and Let It Be [MUSIC] Filled with less searches for thee [MUSIC] Filled with less searches for thee [MUSIC] Take My silver and my gold [MUSIC] That am I, give thy with gold [MUSIC] Take My unit and I can use [MUSIC]
[time=3173] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=3210] Let's pray.
[time=3214] Dear Father, we thank you for God the leaders who have led in the past.
[time=3219] Thank you for Godly.
[time=3221] Followers who answered the call to be generous.
[time=3226] To consecrate themselves to the Lord.
[time=3230] I pray that you will forgive us for the many times when we thought that what we have is ours.
[time=3237] And only 10% or more was yours.
[time=3240] Help us understand that everything that we have is from you.
[time=3244] Help us to understand, to receive it with gratitude and help us to then look and see how can we help those who are in need.
[time=3253] I pray that Blackhawk will continue to be a light in this dark world
[time=3259] and you will use them for their many ministries that they have through the school and the church and the outreach wherever they do.
[time=3267] May they be consecrated to you in such a way that many people will come to the saving knowledge of Christ as the result of their ministry.
[time=3277] And I do pray for this endeavor this week that you will touch the hearts of those who need to step up and surrender themselves to you along with their giving, along with their singing, along with their serving, whatever it is, may we give ourselves first to you and may you use us for your glory.
[time=3302] In Christ's name I pray. Amen.
[time=3305] Open to be oned.
[time=3311] I know that you've been blessed by today's message and you know what being oned is really all about.
[time=3317] It's not just about the stuff, the resources, the time, talent, treasure of our life.
[time=3322] It's really about our life as a whole.
[time=3324] That's the message of the gospel.
[time=3326] The good news of Jesus is good news because it took place a long time ago.
[time=3331] Way before your sin entered the picture, way before you were born, Jesus died on that cross with you and me in mind.
[time=3338] He knew that our sin was going to separate us from God.
[time=3342] And the gospel helps us to understand what it means to be on, to say Jesus, I surrender my life to you.
[time=3348] I surrender my life to that sacrifice that you brought to this earth when you came all those years ago.
[time=3354] Jesus died on that cross paying a price for your sin and mind that sin that separates us from God.
[time=3360] We can't be in His presence because He's so glorious.
[time=3363] He's so perfect and we are so well not.
[time=3367] Jesus came to pay that price we could never pay after He lived a sinless life that you and I could never live.
[time=3374] The Bible reminds us that we do not have a high priest who's unable to sympathize with us in our weaknesses and in our struggles.
[time=3381] That means Jesus walked the same path that we walk.
[time=3384] He faced the same struggles that we face.
[time=3387] Yet He was without sin.
[time=3389] He didn't stumble and fall like we did.
[time=3391] Yet He sacrificed Himself on that cross for you and for me.
[time=3396] The beautiful part of the gospel is that that story didn't stop there.
[time=3400] He didn't die.
[time=3401] He went into this borrowed tomb and it was a borrowed tomb because He didn't plan to stay.
[time=3405] Three days later He rose from the dead after paying that price for you and me, dying that death that we deserved.
[time=3412] He's alive.
[time=3413] He came out of that tomb and when He came out of that tomb, He brought with it the victory over life and death, over your sin, over my sin.
[time=3420] And He bridged the gap between us and God.
[time=3424] He is our bridge.
[time=3425] The cross is our bridge.
[time=3426] His blood is what gives us righteousness because He died.
[time=3430] We can have eternal life.
[time=3431] That's the gospel.
[time=3432] That's the good news that we are all about here at Black Hawk.
[time=3435] And being open to be owned really starts with that.
[time=3438] Maybe that's your step today.
[time=3440] Maybe you need to hit pause.
[time=3441] Maybe you need to step away and do some business with God.
[time=3444] Many times I hear as a pastor, "Well, I just can't say it like you just did." And the beautiful thing about Jesus is He doesn't want you to say it like I did.
[time=3452] He wants you to cry out from your heart to Him, from your heart to His, to let Him know that you're today, surrendering your life with open hands, saying, "God, my life is yours.
[time=3463] I surrender.
[time=3464] I trust you to save me.
[time=3466] I can't save me, so Jesus, I need you to do it.
[time=3468] I give you me." Cry out in your own words from your heart to Him.
[time=3471] He's going to meet you where you are, and He's going to save you today.
[time=3475] That's what we're all about at Black Hawk.
[time=3477] It's just this life-changing eternity transforming truth of the gospel of Jesus.
[time=3483] So maybe you've taken that step today if you have.
[time=3485] We want to hear from you.
[time=3486] We want to talk to you about next steps.
[time=3488] We want to talk to you about baptism.
[time=3490] We just had a lot of baptisms at Black Hawk.
[time=3492] We've got more coming up.
[time=3493] Maybe you need to join in and be a part of all of that.
[time=3496] But we've got a great resource that we would love to get into your hands called a Beginning Steps.
[time=3500] Beginning Steps, a growth guide for new believers.
[time=3503] It's just a booklet.
[time=3504] It's going to walk you through what's next as you're taking these next steps of faith.
[time=3507] We will mail one to you.
[time=3508] We'd love to have you come by the church and pick one of those up.
[time=3511] There's going to be some information on your screen, an email address and a phone number that you can use to reach out to us in addition to our social media platforms and our website so that we can hear from you.
[time=3521] Know your story and walk alongside you.
[time=3524] I also want to invite you to join one of our life groups.
[time=3526] Just one of our small groups.
[time=3528] That's all they are.
[time=3529] They're small groups of people.
[time=3530] We have a big gathering every week, but we have small groups of gatherings throughout our community in Fort Wayne every single day of the week.
[time=3536] Seven days a week.
[time=3537] So no matter what your schedule looks like, we've got one for you.
[time=3540] Or you can just do life with other people who are struggling just like you who are celebrating just like you.
[time=3547] They'll laugh with you.
[time=3548] They'll cry with you.
[time=3549] That's our goal at Black Hawk.
[time=3550] It's called community.
[time=3551] We want to do this life together.
[time=3553] So thank you so much for watching today.
[time=3555] Thanks for trusting Jesus.
[time=3557] And I want to invite you back next week as we continue this series open.
[time=3561] Let our open hearts lead to open hands.
[time=3564] I'll see you next week.
[time=3580] [BLANK_AUDIO]
