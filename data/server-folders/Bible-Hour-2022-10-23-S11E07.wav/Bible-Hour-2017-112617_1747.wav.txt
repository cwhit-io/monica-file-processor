[time=256] [MUSIC]
[time=274] [APPLAUSE]
[time=277] [MUSIC - 98 seconds]
[time=382] Come on, this is our prayer. Jesus be the center.
[time=384] [MUSIC - 73 seconds]
[time=460] Can you help me say that?
[time=461] [MUSIC - 48 seconds]
[time=514] This is His church.
[time=517] [MUSIC - 151 seconds]
[time=671] Well God that's our prayer.
[time=673] That He would be the center of our life.
[time=676] That God that you would be the center of our church.
[time=680] Father we're not even just talking about black home.
[time=685] We're talking about all over.
[time=689] That you would be the center of our life.
[time=692] The center of our church, Lord God.
[time=694] That we would give our life fully to you God.
[time=696] Fully surrender.
[time=698] â™ª We know that we can't lose because we have a God that fights on battles.
[time=707] We love you in Jesus' name.
[time=710] [AMEN] Thank you so much for tuning in today.
[time=716] We are excited about what God has in store for our church and for you.
[time=720] We just consider you a part of our church family.
[time=723] And so thank you for just giving us some of your time to plug into what God has for His church here at Black Hawk Ministries today.
[time=730] We're going to be talking about open.
[time=732] We've been in a series of messages just talking about how our open hearts lead to open hands.
[time=737] And today the focus is contentment, open to be content.
[time=741] Contentment can be a very hard thing to grab hold of in a world that just constantly shifts focus and moves us to be discontented in all the things that we do have.
[time=751] And so today I believe God's got something unique just for you.
[time=754] One of my favorite things about the Word of God, about knowing Jesus, is that it's timeless truth that we study.
[time=761] It's been here for centuries, yet it speaks and God speaks directly into the unique circumstances, the unique messes, the unique complications that you and I bring to the table.
[time=772] He's going to do just that today.
[time=774] So let me ask you, do you need a little bit of help for your journey?
[time=777] Are you struggling a little bit?
[time=779] Are you discontent in your life?
[time=781] Well, I believe today is going to help you on that journey discover some truth, some principles that are timeless that can help you learn to be open to be content.
[time=791] We want to hear your story as that happens.
[time=793] God's going to do new things in and through your life.
[time=795] And we want to know if you've been blessed by this ministry, please let us know that.
[time=799] Let us know what God's teaching you, how we can walk alongside of you.
[time=802] So many ways you can connect with us, including our website, blackcockministries.org.
[time=807] You can connect with us on social media, Twitter, or Instagram by looking for @BHawkMinistries or search for us on Facebook by looking for Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=815] And so we want to hear your story, know what God's up to.
[time=818] And I can't wait to see that story continue to be written as we study God's word together today.
[time=823] Sit back, relax, know that you're among some family and friends.
[time=826] We consider you a part of the Black Hawk family.
[time=828] And God's got something big in store for you today.
[time=831] Christ is my reward.
[time=838] It's all of my devotion.
[time=846] Now there's nothing in this world that could have a satisfied.
[time=854] Through every turn my soul will sing no turning light.
[time=865] All the means are free, and Christ is enough for me.
[time=876] Christ is enough for me.
[time=883] Everything I need is in you.
[time=889] Everything I need.
[time=894] Christ might on and on, enjoy my salvation.
[time=906] And this hope will never fail.
[time=911] Heaven is our home world.
[time=916] Through every stone my soul will sing.
[time=922] Jesus is here to guide me the glory.
[time=931] Christ is enough for me.
[time=944] Everything I need is in you.
[time=950] Everything I need.
[time=958] I'm going to make this proclamation a decision.
[time=963] Can you say it with me?
[time=966] I have decided to follow Jesus.
[time=972] No turning light.
[time=978] I have decided to follow Jesus.
[time=984] No turning light.
[time=990] You'll cross me for me.
[time=993] Go well behind me.
[time=996] No turning light.
[time=1002] Go cross me for me.
[time=1005] Go well behind me.
[time=1008] No turning light.
[time=1016] Oh, Christ is enough.
[time=1018] Christ is enough for me.
[time=1032] Everything I need is in you.
[time=1038] Everything I need.
[time=1043] Christ is enough for me.
[time=1056] Everything I need is in you.
[time=1062] Everything I need.
[time=1065] I have decided to follow Jesus.
[time=1072] No turning light.
[time=1078] I have decided to follow Jesus.
[time=1084] No turning light.
[time=1090] I have decided to follow Jesus.
[time=1096] No turning light.
[time=1102] I have decided to follow Jesus.
[time=1108] No turning light.
[time=1117] You may be seated.
[time=1129] Jesus is enough for you today.
[time=1134] Be careful how you answer, though, because we're talking about being open to be content today.
[time=1139] I'm excited about what God's doing in this place and just to reiterate what we've already seen.
[time=1145] Jesus gets the center.
[time=1148] He gets the credit for everything that happens in and through this place at Black Hawk.
[time=1152] He has the first and last word.
[time=1154] We always say the word has the final word here at Black Hawk.
[time=1158] So join me in starting there today.
[time=1160] We're going to be in First Timothy chapter number six.
[time=1164] Give you a second to turn there.
[time=1166] We're in a series called Open.
[time=1168] In this series we've looked at what it means to be open handed.
[time=1171] What it means to have an open heart.
[time=1173] We started with talking about how we can be open to be healthy.
[time=1176] We then talked about how we can be open to be owned.
[time=1179] Then we talked last week about how we can be open to be rich.
[time=1183] We redefined riches a little bit.
[time=1185] We want to take that a step further.
[time=1188] We're actually closing this series today, but our hope is that it stays open.
[time=1191] The series stays open because in your life you're still open.
[time=1194] I want to talk about being open to be content.
[time=1197] Content.
[time=1198] Contentment is where we're at today.
[time=1200] So in this passage as we look at this, I want to give you a little of the background.
[time=1203] The Apostle Paul is riding to young Timothy here and he's riding in chapter six of First Timothy.
[time=1209] The verses three through five I'm not going to read, but he's talking about false teaching that was rooted in discontentment.
[time=1217] False teaching that had taken over and some discontentment that was at the heart of that led to divisiveness in the church.
[time=1224] And you know I've seen discontentment do that in my life.
[time=1227] Anytime I veer off course, I probably found myself being closed to be content.
[time=1233] I was discontented and so discontentment was at the heart of what Paul was riding to Timothy about.
[time=1239] And as we read that today before I get there a couple of thoughts on contentment.
[time=1243] As I read through this and I reflect on what it means to be content in my life, I found that contentment takes courage.
[time=1252] Anybody with me?
[time=1253] It takes some boldness to be content.
[time=1255] You've got to make a bold decision, a courageous decision.
[time=1258] But on the flip side of that, discontentment is very dangerous.
[time=1263] Discontentment is very destructive.
[time=1266] Contentment takes courage, but discontentment can be very destructive.
[time=1270] Let me define discontentment for you.
[time=1272] Discontentment, a good definition, could be dissatisfaction that I have with what I have.
[time=1279] This satisfaction that I have with what I have.
[time=1284] And we can't be satisfied, but you know what I've learned is here, like I just talked about here at the church.
[time=1289] We're discontent to just coast though too.
[time=1292] Discontentment is not always a terrible thing.
[time=1295] If you notice that in your life, sometimes you've been motivated and became discontent enough with a current situation in your life
[time=1302] that it motivated you enough to change something.
[time=1304] Have you ever been there?
[time=1305] Some of you came into this place and I believe that's where you are today.
[time=1308] You may have come to church because you're discontented enough with something in your life.
[time=1313] That you're motivated to seek some change and to seek something a little bit deeper, something a little bit more real.
[time=1319] You may be here, I want you to know this is a place you can belong even before you believe.
[time=1323] We want you to be a part of the family even if you don't believe everything that we believe because we believe the gospel is going to meet you right where you are and you're going to find a contentment and a joy and a peace and a salvation and a hope in a hopeless world that maybe you've just been looking for.
[time=1338] So my prayer for you is that you could just be open enough to hear from a God who wants to meet you where you are
[time=1344] because he does want to do that. Can I get a name in?
[time=1347] I preach way better when you help me preach if you notice that.
[time=1350] So I need your help today.
[time=1352] I'm so pumped about what this principle, these principles about contentment can mean in your own life today.
[time=1359] I believe it can be transformative in your life.
[time=1362] And so I pray that all of us in one way or another, I'm going to give you my agenda before we even dig in,
[time=1368] is that we can all leave here discontent with discontentment in our life.
[time=1375] There were all discontent with something in our life that God wants to bring us to a new place of contentment,
[time=1381] of joy, of peace and of meaning that maybe we've been missing out of.
[time=1385] So who's ready for the word this morning?
[time=1387] 1 Timothy, chapter 6, I want to start there in verse 6, he's coming out of talking about how godliness sometimes
[time=1394] is the point of contentment, how we think the outward appearance matters, how we get discontented in our hearts and it leads to false teaching.
[time=1402] He says they're prior to that, it leads to envy, evil suspicions, all this friction among people who are depraved in mind and in truth.
[time=1409] We live in a world just like Paul is addressing, but here's how he addresses it.
[time=1413] Verse 6 of 1 Timothy 6 says, "Now there is great gain in godliness with contentment."
[time=1421] We're going to come back there, underline that.
[time=1423] There's great gain in godliness with contentment.
[time=1425] For we brought nothing into the world, we cannot take anything out of the world.
[time=1430] But if we have food and clothing with these, we will be, say it with me, content.
[time=1435] Somebody say content, we're going to try to get there in this place today.
[time=1440] Godliness with contentment is great gain.
[time=1443] What is great gain is where we must start.
[time=1446] What is great gain?
[time=1447] A lot of times for us, we think of stuff, we think of bank accounts, we think of things in life where we've gained a lot or sometimes in this context, as Paul is talking about this, to Timothy and writing about this, sometimes we even think it's godliness alone.
[time=1462] We think that I can be godly enough to gain my way into eternity.
[time=1466] Some of you may have grown up, been filled with that mindset that I've got to make it there.
[time=1471] If my good stuff outweighs my bad stuff just enough, then maybe I can make the cut.
[time=1476] Can I tell you something today?
[time=1478] You can't make the cut.
[time=1480] It's already been decided.
[time=1482] You probably had that decided on your way to church this morning with one of those thoughts that popped into your mind.
[time=1488] Probably had that decided this weekend with a fight that you had with somebody that you're in a relationship with.
[time=1493] You probably had that with some sin that took place in the last 24 hours.
[time=1497] That means you're not good enough.
[time=1499] You're not godly enough for the great gain of eternity.
[time=1503] Pretty depressing, isn't it?
[time=1505] But that's the point of the gospel.
[time=1507] Our righteousness is as filthy rags.
[time=1511] Our godliness is nothing compared to a god who is perfect, whose standard is perfection.
[time=1517] That is why Jesus came.
[time=1519] That's why in just a little bit we're going to celebrate the Lord's Supper, his body that was broken, his blood that was spilled out because he was that atonement.
[time=1527] He was that sacrifice.
[time=1528] That's what that's all about.
[time=1529] He atoned for our sins.
[time=1531] He paid the price that we couldn't pay because we can't be godly enough for the great gain, the eternal things that God has in mind for his children.
[time=1542] That's the gospel.
[time=1543] So it's not just godliness, this great gain, what is great gain?
[time=1548] Great gain, Paul says, is godliness with contentment.
[time=1551] It starts in the heart.
[time=1552] It starts with this contentment that drives some more godliness.
[time=1556] We're going to land there in just a few minutes.
[time=1558] You know, if great gain, I was thinking about this.
[time=1561] How many of you are here last week?
[time=1562] So I'm telling on some of you, right?
[time=1564] And I showed the picture of the U-Haul behind the hearse.
[time=1567] Did you see that?
[time=1568] We talked about how you can't take it with you.
[time=1570] Verse 7 says, you know, you brought nothing into the world.
[time=1573] You take nothing out of the world with you.
[time=1575] But I was thinking about what that means.
[time=1577] And in terms of great gain, if great gain is about stuff, then that means when we die, we have gained what?
[time=1586] Nothing.
[time=1587] So there must be more to this idea of great gain.
[time=1590] It must go deeper than our stuff.
[time=1592] It must go deeper than our own godliness.
[time=1595] It's got to be something to do with him and less to do with them.
[time=1598] It's got to be something to do with Jesus, a lot more to do with Jesus than it has to do with me.
[time=1603] So Paul's defining that and he says, you can't take anything with you.
[time=1607] You know, U-Haul's behind the hearse.
[time=1608] You can hook it up all you want, but nothing's going with you.
[time=1610] You brought nothing into the world with you.
[time=1612] You're going to bring nothing out of the world with you.
[time=1614] Verse 7, verse 8, food and clothing.
[time=1616] That's enough.
[time=1617] Shelter.
[time=1618] Nourishment.
[time=1619] That's enough.
[time=1620] With these, I will be content.
[time=1623] Some of you saying, man, I got a long way to go.
[time=1628] Or some of you are saying, you know, you're spiritual today and you would say, that's where I am at.
[time=1634] Food and clothing is enough.
[time=1636] But a lot of times, discontentment doesn't just hit you upside the head.
[time=1641] It doesn't just slam into you like a car running into a building.
[time=1644] It creeps in through the cracks of your life.
[time=1648] It starts small.
[time=1650] So what sin does, doesn't it?
[time=1652] It starts with a little tiny decision that doesn't even seem like that bad of a decision, but it creeps to the next thing, doesn't it?
[time=1659] Discontentment can become a noose around our necks.
[time=1662] Discontentment is something that grips our nation and unfortunately in the church in America,
[time=1668] it grips the church of Jesus Christ.
[time=1672] We can't feel content with what God has given to us.
[time=1675] Now, with that, I surveyed a lot of people this week.
[time=1678] Over a dozen people, I surveyed and asked them one question.
[time=1681] I heard my findings with you.
[time=1682] I asked over a dozen people, at what point of your life were you the most content?
[time=1689] I want you to think of your answer.
[time=1691] What would that be?
[time=1692] Don't shout it out.
[time=1694] Just for you.
[time=1696] What point of your life were you the most content?
[time=1699] I asked over a dozen people that and I got 12 plus different answers, but there was one common thread in every single answer that I got when I asked that question.
[time=1709] The common thread was that everybody went back to a time in their lives where they were the
[time=1715] most content, but it was a time in their lives where they had less stuff than they do now.
[time=1725] Every single answer.
[time=1727] It's almost like contentment doesn't have so much to do with our stuff.
[time=1731] Yet so many times we find ourselves living as though it does.
[time=1735] I've said this to you in this series, but I want to say it again in light of contentment and the statement is this.
[time=1739] That people who are the most content are not those that have the most, but those who need the least.
[time=1745] Those are the most content people in your life.
[time=1749] Those little faces you saw on the screen a few minutes ago.
[time=1752] They don't have anything compared to what you and I have in our backyards, sometimes in our storage shed, but they're content.
[time=1760] Why?
[time=1761] They found Jesus.
[time=1763] They know the Jesus of the gospel, the good news that saves us and that's enough.
[time=1770] But even for them and even for you and me, it can creep into this idea that maybe there is more and you know I have Jesus and that is enough.
[time=1777] Christ is enough like we've sung about, but it sure would be nice if you know what I'm
[time=1784] talking about.
[time=1785] So that's where we often find ourselves.
[time=1787] Look at verse nine.
[time=1788] Paul gives a warning about this very thing.
[time=1791] Verse number nine, he says, but those who desire to be rich fall in, that just means live
[time=1797] richly.
[time=1798] You look it up in the original language, it's like, well, that doesn't mean this or that, it means live richly.
[time=1804] Those who desire to be rich, desire points to the heart, by the way, is an open, not our series statement.
[time=1810] By the way, I think I skipped over it today, didn't I?
[time=1812] What is it?
[time=1813] Open hearts lead to open hands.
[time=1816] Say that with me.
[time=1818] Open hearts lead to open hands.
[time=1820] People talking about a heart here, Paul, is that is maybe closed to the things of God.
[time=1825] He says, but those who desire in the heart, desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge, that plunge people into
[time=1836] ruin and destruction.
[time=1838] I want to give you two principles that will help you.
[time=1841] Two contentment principles that I believe can help you straight from this passage, not fall into the trap of discontentment today.
[time=1848] The first one is this.
[time=1849] You ready for it?
[time=1850] The first one is that awareness creates appetite.
[time=1856] Awareness creates appetite.
[time=1857] Let me explain.
[time=1859] Awareness is really the heart of discontentment.
[time=1862] We can't be discontent with something we're not aware of.
[time=1865] Let me say it this way.
[time=1866] A lot of times we're fine with what we have until we realize there's another one.
[time=1874] I was fine with what I had, but then I saw that commercial.
[time=1876] "Man, I need to get me one of those." I was fine with what I had until somebody criticized it and pointed out how theirs was better.
[time=1886] We're often fine with what we have until we realize there's another one or a better one, and that awareness fuels the discontentment in our life, and it breeds an appetite.
[time=1895] I'm going to talk about the appetite in a moment, but when it comes to that I was thinking this, "When have I become discontent with something I used to be content with?" I go back to mine and Jessica's first home.
[time=1905] It was just a little double-wide trailer.
[time=1907] We bought it.
[time=1908] We were so excited, and we remodeled it.
[time=1910] I gutted the whole thing and remodeled it.
[time=1913] We owned it, and in our kitchen, I was so proud.
[time=1916] We had nothing.
[time=1917] We had no money, but we had saved up, and we had gotten married.
[time=1921] We were just two little young kids, and we got married, and we remodeled our kitchen, and I found these tile, these white tile that I wanted to do a backsplash for my wife, and these little border tile that were blue, and Jessica had picked out some wallpaper with butterflies on it, little blue butterflies.
[time=1936] Yeah.
[time=1937] What are you laughing?
[time=1938] I still like that.
[time=1940] We had this wallpaper that we had picked, so I even went out and found grout for the tile.
[time=1945] I did it all of it myself.
[time=1946] I grouted the tile, but I found blue grout that matched the blue butterflies.
[time=1950] Oh, buddy.
[time=1952] It was a good-looking kitchen.
[time=1956] We were proud of that kitchen, but you know what I've noticed happened?
[time=1958] We don't have blue butterflies on wallpaper in our kitchen or blue grout with that stuff,
[time=1965] the border that I thought matched that really didn't, now that we look back at it, now.
[time=1969] We don't have any of that anymore, or why?
[time=1971] Is it bad that we don't have that?
[time=1972] No, it's fine, but I look at that, and we were so content.
[time=1975] That was one of the times of my life I was so content.
[time=1978] I really was, and we had blue butterflies and blue grout in our trailer that I had remodeled,
[time=1984] but then you know what happened is we saw other kitchens, and we were like, man, those
[time=1991] butterflies were rough.
[time=1995] We got to get rid of that blue grout.
[time=1997] We got to get some different kind of tile, because did you see their house?
[time=2001] Man, we got to get us some of those, and so our kitchen looks a little different today, and we tried to balance that discontentment that we get with the blue butterflies and the blue grout in the kitchen, but it kind of keeps going, doesn't it?
[time=2013] Have you noticed that in your life?
[time=2014] You go back to those times, and you took a step and said, oh, that's going to be enough.
[time=2018] Plenty there.
[time=2019] We've taken a big step, but then you see another one, and another one, and another one.
[time=2024] And at what point does that end in our lives is where I'm at?
[time=2028] We see on Pinterest, we see it on our neighbors' yards, we see it in their homes, we see it on a TV or on a phone.
[time=2034] I love social media.
[time=2035] I have social media accounts that helps me stay connected with all you crazy people and all family and friends.
[time=2040] I love having access to the internet and social media, but then we also get on there and we
[time=2046] see the best of the best from those other people, don't we?
[time=2049] Their perfect little church smile and yours did not look that way, did it?
[time=2054] So you just don't post, and then you save up for that moment where everything looks perfect and we post that, because that's the world that we live in.
[time=2062] Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about.
[time=2065] We're all there.
[time=2066] Are we not?
[time=2068] How many of you had the old tube TV or had the big thing sticking out the back, right?
[time=2074] At that same house, I had the blue butterflies and the blue grout.
[time=2077] We had a big, I'm talking big, we took three guys to get it in the house, tube TV.
[time=2082] And I was proud of that TV.
[time=2084] I saved up some money and we could watch football on it.
[time=2087] And then they came out, they started looking at the sides of TV.
[time=2089] It used to be that you just look at the front of the TV and that's all that mattered.
[time=2093] Then they started looking at the side.
[time=2094] You wanted this little thin thing, these flat screen things, now they're curved and they're 4K and they go up to 70 inches and we want to knew another one, another one.
[time=2102] We're aware though, aren't we?
[time=2104] Awareness creates an appetite that keeps growing and in the old days, we would replace things.
[time=2110] My dad still has tools that I've said to him over and over, "Why do you still have that?" He said, "Because it still works." Good concept.
[time=2119] We used to just replace things when they broke.
[time=2121] Now what do we do?
[time=2122] We don't replace, we upgrade, upgrade.
[time=2126] We upgrade our stuff.
[time=2128] Now we're in the upgrade age and I'm not beating up on upgrades or having nice things because God blesses us with those things but it can become more than just a simple upgrade in our lives because we're at this now comparison, comparison kills contentment.
[time=2144] Comparison kills contentment.
[time=2147] I believe we live in an age today where we're often dying from our pressure, sometimes
[time=2154] self-imposed pressure, sometimes it's not but we're dying from pressure of our presentation
[time=2161] of pseudo-perfection.
[time=2162] Let me say that again.
[time=2164] We're dying from the pressure of our presentation of pseudo-perfection.
[time=2173] Pseudo being false because you're not perfect.
[time=2175] Look at somebody saying you're not perfect.
[time=2179] I'm sorry to burst your bubble.
[time=2180] You're far from it.
[time=2185] How many of you were here this last summer when I talked about Pinterest and show the Pinterest fails?
[time=2192] Good.
[time=2193] Some of you were, some of you weren't.
[time=2194] In case you don't know what Pinterest is, I've got some new ones.
[time=2200] It's fun.
[time=2201] I'm going to tell you what it is.
[time=2202] For those of you who don't know what Pinterest is, Wikipedia is not always your go-to definition but it had a pretty good one for Pinterest.
[time=2208] First of all, I don't like Pinterest that much.
[time=2211] I don't hate people who like Pinterest.
[time=2214] My wife's one of those people but it creates a lot of projects for me to do.
[time=2218] Just so you know.
[time=2219] Now that I've said that, I'll tell you what it is.
[time=2220] Pinterest is, Wikipedia definition, a visual discovery tool that people use to collect their ideas for their different projects and interests.
[time=2230] People create and share collections called boards or visual bookmarks called pens that they use to do things like plan trips and projects, organize events or save articles and recipes.
[time=2241] Pinterest junkies of the room.
[time=2242] Is that a good definition?
[time=2243] All right.
[time=2244] Decent.
[time=2245] It's good enough.
[time=2246] Now that you know what Pinterest is, I found a really cool website called pinterestfails.com.
[time=2253] You can spend hours on Pinterestfails.com and I highly recommend it.
[time=2261] So I want to revisit, there's a couple that you have seen before of these pictures.
[time=2264] If you're here with us this last summer, I want to show you those, but then I'll add a few new ones too.
[time=2268] Check this one out.
[time=2269] So what you have is a picture of something like this cake of an Elmo that you look out
[time=2276] on Pinterest and you say, "Oh," everybody say, "Oh," and you say, "I want to do that for a little Susie's birthday." And so you say, "Well, I'm going to do it," and it gives you step-by-step guides to be able to do it.
[time=2287] And I'm going to have me one of those cakes, but then this happens, "Pinterest fail."
[time=2300] You see it on there and it looks so good and you strive to be it and you do this and then
[time=2306] you don't post that one.
[time=2308] You just make sure nobody knows that you try to make an Elmo cake and you go pay somebody else to make you a good Elmo cake, don't you?
[time=2316] Another cake one.
[time=2317] Some of you like frozen.
[time=2318] I sang frozen a little while back.
[time=2321] Everybody say, "Aww." Who's that guy?
[time=2324] Olaf.
[time=2325] You know Olaf.
[time=2326] Yeah.
[time=2327] Olaf is on frozen.
[time=2328] And if you remember a while back, I sang, "Let it go," I'm not going to do that to you today.
[time=2331] Curtis sang enough for us this weekend.
[time=2335] But you want to make this cake and you go through the steps and then this happens.
[time=2342] Oh, but it gets worse because here's the thing.
[time=2349] There aren't just cakes and baked goods on Pinterest that you find.
[time=2355] There's people on there too, guys.
[time=2357] Real people like this one.
[time=2363] A beautiful little baby and you think, "I've got a beautiful little baby too and it's about to be Christmas time so I'm going to set up this same thing and I'm going to get a picture just like this and then reality, anybody who's ever had a baby knows exactly
[time=2385] how that goes.
[time=2387] It's just not going to work that way.
[time=2391] You want one more?
[time=2392] Can we do one more?
[time=2393] Just one more.
[time=2394] Okay.
[time=2395] One more.
[time=2396] I've showed you this one before.
[time=2397] That is...
[time=2398] Aww.
[time=2399] Go ahead.
[time=2400] Aww.
[time=2401] And you know, here's the thing, my wife reminded me this year, we showed this one earlier this year here when we looked at Pinterest fails.
[time=2408] That's reality.
[time=2409] Jessica said, "Don't you remember?
[time=2411] We have one like that too." And there it is.
[time=2416] This is little Caleb at one year old and so we saw a picture much like that and we said, "We're going to try that too," and that's what happened.
[time=2423] Same little crooked chin and everything.
[time=2426] Everybody happens.
[time=2430] Some of you are already on Pinterest fails.com on your phone, aren't you?
[time=2434] Come on.
[time=2435] At least wait until lunchtime.
[time=2436] Give me a few minutes.
[time=2438] Comparison kills contentment because if it's all about comparing to the Pinterest pictures
[time=2444] and the Instagram photos, if it's all about comparing this to the perfection, these false pictures of perception, of perfection, then you'll always end up finding yourself lacking
[time=2457] contentment because here's what'll happen, you'll find a way all the time.
[time=2460] Every time you mark it down, you'll always find a way to not measure up.
[time=2465] That's the beauty of Jesus, isn't it?
[time=2469] He knew that we would never measure up when we compare ourselves to him, but he measured up for us.
[time=2476] He paid the price we could never pay by dying that death, that it would have done no good for us to die, that we were destined to die anyway, wouldn't have paid for sin because we would have just taken our sin with us.
[time=2485] Instead, Jesus measured up, took that sin to the cross when we compare ourselves to him, we pale in comparison.
[time=2492] We fall so flat, we fall so short, but he measured up for us.
[time=2497] Proverbs 14.30, Proverbs 14.30 says, "A heart at peace gives life to the body, but envy
[time=2503] rots the bones."
[time=2509] Awareness will often create an appetite, and when it comes to an appetite, your desire for bigger and better grows, doesn't it?
[time=2515] Have you ever noticed what happens with an appetite?
[time=2518] You ever had an appetite for lunch and you went to lunch and you never wanted to eat ever again?
[time=2523] No, because dinnertime comes, and the appetite just grows again, and what I've learned about appetites is when we feed our appetites, the appetite just grows, and I don't know if you've ever done a fast, or you physically fasted from food, but you learn that pretty quickly, and I know I've seen that like the first two days, the appetite grows and grows and it's kind of overwhelming and overbearing in your life, but then you don't feed the appetite and it starts to shrink.
[time=2550] Now I didn't say it goes away, you're still ready for a cheeseburger at the end of that time, but it shrinks.
[time=2556] So if you want to shrink an appetite, you really have to starve it.
[time=2560] Now I'm not suggesting that you don't eat, it has nothing to do with food, I'm talking about contentment, I'm talking about the appetite for bigger and better and more.
[time=2568] Maybe it's time that you starve some of the appetites that you've been feeding, you've been pouring into over and over and you're open to saying, you know what, I'm going to starve that appetite and pour into building a different kind of appetite, an appetite of what Jesus may have for my life.
[time=2583] So verse 10, look there with me, awareness creates appetite, a couple more things about that and I'll give you your second one.
[time=2589] For the love of money, one of the most misquoted verses in scripture oftentimes, verse 10, for the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils.
[time=2599] It is through this craving that some have wondered away from the faith and pierced themselves
[time=2606] with many pains.
[time=2607] Have you ever had an appetite for something and it pulled you away from Jesus so far that you've pierced yourself with many pains, means you were your biggest problem?
[time=2618] I've learned about myself, I'm my biggest issue, everywhere I go, I'm there.
[time=2623] I can't get rid of me no matter how hard I try.
[time=2626] But I do that sometimes and we often say that the love of money is the root of all evil.
[time=2631] Money is not the root of all evil, it's the love of money.
[time=2633] So here's a dollar, does this look evil to you?
[time=2640] Is it good to you? Yes, because you would like to take it and do something with it.
[time=2643] But money is amoral, means it's neither good nor bad, it's just stuff.
[time=2648] It's not the root of all evil, it's when I love this money.
[time=2652] And I won't be open-handed and I do this.
[time=2656] It's when I won't do this that it becomes a root of evil in my life.
[time=2662] It's when it controls me and consumes me and my appetite for it grows to the point where it precedes everything else in my life.
[time=2669] And if I were to ask you, do you love money, what would you say?
[time=2674] No, I got one yes, one good honest guy, that's what I'm talking about.
[time=2678] Good transparency, we believe in that.
[time=2680] No church smiles around here.
[time=2681] Most of the time though, we would say, no, I like money.
[time=2686] We kind of date every now and then, but I don't love money.
[time=2691] But I want to give you a formula for how you can know if you love money and I'll go back to dating days.
[time=2695] If you ever dated somebody that you fell in love with and you found that you would do crazy, even stupid things because of that love, like drive 16 hours to go see them somewhere
[time=2706] for 20 minutes in the drive back home.
[time=2708] I've never done that, but I've heard stories.
[time=2712] Like spend an ungodly amount of money that you didn't have to buy the massive teddy bear for Valentine's Day and you know it was going to be a problem.
[time=2719] Have you ever done anything like that?
[time=2721] You know what yours are, you fill in your own blanks where you do these crazy things because of love, but let me ask you this question.
[time=2726] Have you ever, for the sake of something, for the sake of a dollar, for the sake of a thing made a really dumb financial decision to just get it, even though you knew deep down in your heart, you're a good rationalizer in the room.
[time=2739] It's like, well, but now I can use this for God's glory and you feel a little bit better.
[time=2745] You know it's going to lead you to financial ruin and you can't afford it and it's going to have to go on the credit card and you can't afford to pay it off and it's going to be a problem for you for the next six years, but you do it because, well, maybe God wants to bless me with it and maybe I can use it for his kingdom and you with me?
[time=2766] And we end up loving that thing more than we love the common sense and the love that
[time=2773] God has for us that leads us to make solid decisions, to make godly decisions, to put Jesus and Jesus alone before all of the stuff in our lives.
[time=2780] Have you ever done that?
[time=2782] Can we be honest?
[time=2783] Can you raise your hand and say if you've done that?
[time=2786] I've done that.
[time=2787] Anybody who's honest would say we've made decisions like that in our life.
[time=2789] It's an appetite that we often feed, but then verse 11 says this, somebody say flee, flee.
[time=2796] That's what Paul's about to tell us to do.
[time=2798] But as for you, oh man of God, flee these things, pursue righteousness and godliness
[time=2804] and faith and love, steadfastness, gentleness, and then verse 12 even says, fight the good fight of faith, take hold of the eternal life for which you were called, flee.
[time=2815] There's a difference though in scripture and flee and be careful.
[time=2819] A lot of times it's like, well I'll be careful, I'm going to be careful to make sure I can pay it off or whatever it is when it comes to money or other things in our lives and we'll say, I don't have to flee from that step, but I'll be careful.
[time=2831] But let me ask you, would you pick up a venomous snake and say it's okay, I'll be careful.
[time=2837] Would you jump in a cage with a crazy mad lion and say it's all good, I'll be careful.
[time=2844] But we do that sometimes with our contentment because discontentment leads to destruction.
[time=2850] Discontentment is dangerous when we feed that appetite that comes from awareness.
[time=2854] I'm good with what I have until I realize there's another one and we feed an appetite that starts growing and taking over in our lives.
[time=2862] Am I preaching to anybody in this place today?
[time=2865] Because it's real and it's true and it's honest things that we all deal with, but let's get to some good news.
[time=2871] How do we remedy this?
[time=2873] Maybe not feed that appetite and we're going to look at that, but before we get there, verses 17 through 19, I preached out of these verses last year when we went through a series called Intrusted, but I want to look back at them as it sheds light on this.
[time=2885] In the same chapter, 1 Timothy chapter 6, verses 17 through 19, there's another thought I want to give you.
[time=2891] And that is that thankfulness generates thoughtfulness.
[time=2897] Thankfulness generates thoughtfulness, gratitude generates generosity.
[time=2906] When we're thankful, we become thoughtful.
[time=2908] When we're grateful, we become generous.
[time=2910] It's just this amazing cycle that God instills in us.
[time=2912] Look at verse 17, it says, "As for the rich in this present age," and we've talked about this series that, yep, that's me and you, even though some of us have more than others,
[time=2923] we're pretty rich.
[time=2924] We're pretty blessed.
[time=2925] Charge them not to be haughty or set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches.
[time=2929] You ever noticed that riches are pretty uncertain?
[time=2932] But on God who richly provides us with everything to enjoy, be thankful for that provision and
[time=2938] that provider, set your hope on Him who provides not on the things of life.
[time=2945] It's the presence of Jesus in your notes, it's the presence of Jesus, not the absence of trouble that brings contentment.
[time=2950] It's the presence of Jesus, it's not the absence of trouble or the presence of those things
[time=2956] in your life that bring you to contentment.
[time=2959] Verse 18 tells us what we need to do.
[time=2961] How do we redirect this?
[time=2962] How do we change those appetites?
[time=2963] Verse 18, "They are to do good, be rich in good works, and to be generous and ready
[time=2969] to share, be rich toward God," is what we ended with last Sunday.
[time=2973] This is where that richness towards God starts to play in and play a factor.
[time=2977] What if, let me ask you a what if question, what if we used the time that we spend scrolling
[time=2985] on Pinterest or Instagram or Facebook, the time that we use, however you compare, whatever you use to feed the appetites that maybe you need to start getting rid of, what if we use that time to start becoming more aware of what other people don't have?
[time=3003] What would that do to that appetite that we're aware of, that we're fueling, that we're becoming
[time=3010] discontented by?
[time=3012] I think it would make us more thankful, and then I think when we're more thankful, we've become a whole lot more thoughtful in the right directions.
[time=3020] That's what Paul is talking about here, be rich in good works, be rich towards God, be generous, ready to share.
[time=3025] It takes me back to Acts, chapter 4 and verse 12, where they had everything in common.
[time=3029] That doesn't just mean they had a lot of hobbies in common.
[time=3032] They had their stuff in common.
[time=3033] They would bring their stuff to the church and give it freely to whoever needed it, and they didn't need for a thing because they were that generous.
[time=3040] They just gave all of their stuff open-handedly because they had open hearts.
[time=3046] Verse 19, I love, I want to read it to you, and it says, "Thus, when you do this, the storing up treasure for themselves as a good foundation for the future so that they may
[time=3055] take hold of that which is truly life."
[time=3061] Somebody say truly life.
[time=3064] We need that kind of life, not the kind that money can buy, but the kind of life that eternity
[time=3070] feeds into.
[time=3071] I want to take you back to verse 6, and we talk about thankfulness, generating thoughtfulness.
[time=3076] Verse 6 says that it is godliness plus contentment, this great game.
[time=3083] This is seen in our thoughtfulness, is it not?
[time=3086] When we're thoughtful, when we do things we're generous and ready to share, where we do things that Jesus would do, that's the godliness part, but it's the other part that Paul was adding to the equation because he was saying godliness alone is not great gain, it's godliness with contentment, and I would take it a step even beyond that, based on what scripture tells us about thankfulness is without thankfulness, without contentment, there's no way we're going to be very thoughtful, there's no way we're going to be very generous.
[time=3109] So godliness, thoughtfulness, plus contentment, thankfulness, is a great game.
[time=3116] That's a pretty good math equation for us to live by, isn't it?
[time=3120] That'll change how you view your stuff, that'll change how you view people in your life, and here's what I want to do as we wrap up, I want to give you four questions.
[time=3128] You don't even have to write them down, you're welcome to, but I really want you to answer these questions, maybe wrestle with them this week to help you put this into play in your life that awareness creates an appetite, how can I shrink those appetites, I'm going to
[time=3141] give you a few questions that will help you do that, how can I become more thankful so that I can be more thoughtful, question one, in your life what fuels the unhealthy appetite
[time=3151] or the discontentment, what fuels it, what fuels your discontentment, your unhealthy appetite?
[time=3161] What can I do to become less aware of that stuff and therefore not fuel that appetite?
[time=3170] What can I do to become less aware, that may mean, you know what, I don't need to look at so and so social media page because she's always posting this stuff and making me feel bad, whatever it is, I don't know what that looks like for you, it may mean not going to the car lot, it may mean turning the TV off more, it may mean spending time, you were
[time=3187] doing one thing, spending it with God, I don't know what that means for you, but what could you do to become less aware of that stuff that fuels discontentment in your life?
[time=3195] Third question, what can I do this week to be more aware of what somebody else doesn't
[time=3202] have, what can I do this week to be more aware of what others just don't have, it's a pretty
[time=3211] good step, it makes us thankful, last thing, what should you do this week to become more
[time=3220] discontent about the right things in your life?
[time=3224] Put it another way, what should I be more discontent about in my life?
[time=3229] Because again, discontentment can lead you to make some good decisions and that's what I want to challenge you with, let godly discontent lead you to godly decisions this week.
[time=3239] Who's with me?
[time=3240] Am I ready for some godly decisions because he's put some godly discontent in your heart?
[time=3244] I'm not pleased with where I've been, maybe you're discontent with discontentment and I'm going to start being content with what god has given me and I'm going to take that step and I'm going to make a big, bold decision this week because of what god has planted inside of me.
[time=3259] Let me ask you a question, so many times we do this, Christmas is coming, but there's a question I've been asked many times and many occasions in years past, I want to ask you, why would I ever trust in gifts when I know the giver?
[time=3271] Why would I ever trust in the gifts when I know the ultimate giver?
[time=3277] Just put our trust in the giver of all good things, the one who will supply everything
[time=3283] we need according to his righteousness, according to his power, that's how he supplies, he doesn't need our help.
[time=3289] Is anybody ready to just trust in the giver this week?
[time=3291] Can I get an amen?
[time=3292] I want to ask you to bow your heads with me, close your eyes for a moment, nobody looking around.
[time=3297] We're going to partake of communion in just a few minutes.
[time=3302] Before we do that, I want to invite some of you who maybe you don't know Jesus to take
[time=3308] a moment and assess.
[time=3310] Maybe if you know Jesus, God's been stirring something in you, some discontentment that you've got to deal with.
[time=3314] You've got to make a decision about will you commit that to him right now, spend some time praying.
[time=3319] But the most important thing that's going to happen today is I believe some people in this room came in and you would say, pastor, I just don't know that if I were to die today, I would spend eternity with Jesus in heaven because I have a personal relationship with him.
[time=3331] I ask you, do you know that if today was your last day, do you know that you would go to heaven?
[time=3336] Some of you would say, I would like to think so.
[time=3338] But after hearing this today, I don't know that I balanced out well enough.
[time=3341] But you know that God's stirring something in you, that discontentment in your heart is towards salvation, towards knowing that I can't save me so I must need somebody else to.
[time=3351] I've got good news for you.
[time=3353] Jesus already paid that price.
[time=3356] It's finished.
[time=3357] It's done.
[time=3358] And so today I want to challenge you to take that step, to trust in Jesus, to give your life to him.
[time=3364] Scripture reminds us that anyone, yes, that means you, anyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
[time=3371] You confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus is Lord.
[time=3375] That's all it's about.
[time=3376] You know what I'm not going to lead you in a prayer because a prayer doesn't save you.
[time=3378] I think in your heart, the gospel is screaming inside of you right now.
[time=3383] He wants to hear your words.
[time=3384] It's all about letting him know that you need him to save you, that you sin and followed sort of his glory.
[time=3389] You can't get there on your own, but you believe he died for you on that cross while he was on the cross.
[time=3394] You were on his mind.
[time=3396] And then he went to that borrowed tomb and came out three days later and conquered death and hell on the grave.
[time=3401] He won the victory.
[time=3402] The victory's won is finished.
[time=3405] And that included your sin.
[time=3407] But today you're understanding that for the first time and letting him know that you're going to trust that to save you and stop trying to save yourself and say, Jesus, I turn away from that old man.
[time=3416] I turn to you today.
[time=3417] I give you me.
[time=3418] If that's you, will you cry out in your own words from your heart to him in this moment, no matter what's going on in your heart and life, if you wait for things to get lined up, if you wait for things to fall in line, they never will because we live in an imperfect world and we're all imperfect people, but we need a perfect Savior.
[time=3433] And he is that and more.
[time=3437] Will you take a minute if that's you, cry out to him and ask him to save you and he'll meet you right here in this place.
[time=3446] Are you open to be content today?
[time=3449] What has that word meant to you in the past versus maybe what it means to you now?
[time=3454] Maybe contentment means taking a step of faith today.
[time=3457] The same step of faith perhaps that I've walked you through and maybe you need to join the many people who today have decided to take that step of faith to follow Jesus.
[time=3466] Step towards Jesus today and you know what you're going to find when you step towards Jesus, he always steps towards you because he's really always been there.
[time=3474] And so today as we've looked at what the gospel means, the good news of Jesus, the good news is that he's already paid that price.
[time=3480] The good news is that he is alive.
[time=3483] The good news is that he had your sin, your struggles in mind when he went to the cross.
[time=3488] And I want to challenge you as we've looked at today, how we can be content, true contentment will never come apart from a personal relationship with Jesus.
[time=3497] Maybe it's time for you to take that step and ask him to save you.
[time=3500] If that's the case, then step away, push pause, do what you've got to do to make sure you get that step right.
[time=3505] And then all of these principles that we've looked at of contentment, moving away from discontent or maybe having good discontentment towards how we're discontented in our lives.
[time=3515] Maybe those things will start to mean something new to you today.
