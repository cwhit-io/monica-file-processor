[time=749] thanks baby, thanks Tim good morning how are you today?
[time=757] Kevin's not with us he's with his family which is great you know that he can do that and have a time Pastor Chip is not with us either he's preaching somewhere else so we're it's just me and Christian, that's all you get today on a computer somewhere I guess so thank you for the worship Jared Numbers, where are you?
[time=779] I'm Batman I'm Batman junior high principal you have to be able to say those things and know those things for many years you have a good Thanksgiving?
[time=789] I did, well I ate a lot of food did you eat a lot of food?
[time=793] yeah, did you watch any football?
[time=795] no, none the Lions game was on but I don't think I watched any football so not really sure napping and all that kind of stuff goes on love Thanksgiving, it's one of my favorite holidays and you know I really do because of the nature of what Thanksgiving is about it's about being thankful and I like to try to live my life being thankful, are you that type of person too?
[time=819] hope you are, I thought I'd dig out just a few little interesting tidbits about Thanksgiving and just your knowledge and see if you know some of these things, did you know that the very first Thanksgiving that we consider the first Thanksgiving feast lasted for three days?
[time=834] three days, we only got one day didn't we?
[time=838] we got gypped out of two days, of course I guess if you count Black Friday it would be two but in the leftovers on Thanksgiving day that would be fun, right?
[time=846] in 1863 Thanksgiving became a holiday and we know that President Lincoln was the one that brought that, that made that decree, right?
[time=854] except that President, it wasn't his idea because a gal by the name of Sarah Josepha Hale convinced him by writing letter after letter after week after week after month after month after year until he finally gave in and declared Thanksgiving a holiday did you know that? Sarah Hale is also responsible for another piece of information that I'm guessing every one of you know and have used in the past wrote the words to a song, sing it if you know it, Mary had a little lamb, little, there you go, Mary Hale the one who convinced President Lincoln to make Thanksgiving a holiday also wrote the lyrics to that song. In 1939 Thanksgiving is always on the fourth Thursday of November kids if you don't know that it's always the fourth Thursday but in 1939 it went to the third Thursday and the reason that the President did that was he wanted to have more shopping days till Christmas, how about that huh?
[time=912] We don't have enough, right? But then in like 42 or something like that they put it back and they made it the fourth Thursday interesting tidbit Swanson, we all know Swanson, right?
[time=924] In 1953 they ordered an enormous amount of turkey for their to sell in the stores and whatnot 260 tons in fact, way more than they could ever use so one of the salesmen said what are we going to do with all this extra turkey?
[time=940] Well let's take a little aluminum pan and put some turkey in it and maybe some stuffing, some mashed potatoes and gravy, some of that kind of stuff and they sold the very first TV dinner.
[time=952] That was a result of a mistake made ordering turkeys.
[time=956] They sold it for 98 cents and within one year they had sold over a million of them, isn't that crazy? All because of a mistake made on Thanksgiving so anytime you make a mistake just realize you could be standing on a million dollar proposition right there, right?
[time=972] If that were the case man, I'd be so wealthy it'd be unbelievable.
[time=976] All right, how many turkeys are cooked every year do you know?
[time=980] 46 million turkeys.
[time=984] That's one turkey for every seven people in America. 46 million turkeys that's crazy. Only male turkeys gobble just let that sink in a minute Only male turkeys gobble, right?
[time=1000] Female turkeys don't gobble, they cackle. Let's move on That's a fact, I'm just reading the facts that's only right. Most Americans, almost 80% of Americans prefer leftovers to the actual meal.
[time=1016] Are you a turkey sandwich fan?
[time=1020] True story, I had one for breakfast this morning.
[time=1024] Honestly I had two, so there you go.
[time=1028] And then the butterball turkey line, 100,000 calls a season on how to cook that turkey.
[time=1036] Isn't that crazy? That's unbelievable. So a little bit of Thanksgiving trivia maybe you did some of that at your Thanksgiving dinner this year I don't know but just kind of some fun facts about Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday because it is an intentional mindset of the person.
[time=1056] You have to be the type of person that is going to be thankful.
[time=1060] You're going to say I am going to be a thankful person because no matter what's happening in our lives we can stop and take inventory by the end of the service today.
[time=1068] Hopefully we get to understand that of how just awesome it is to be a Christian.
[time=1072] Philippians 4, 6, and 7 cells just do not be anxious about anything but in everything with prayer and supplication Thanksgiving let your request be made known to God. That says everything.
[time=1084] You notice what it doesn't say? It doesn't say everything that has happened so far.
[time=1088] Every blessing that you've given me, every mercy that you've given me, it doesn't say that.
[time=1092] It says everything so that would automatically drive us to understand that as a mindset it's going to be a thankful person.
[time=1100] And in fact that's exactly how Thanksgiving started in our culture in America.
[time=1108] You realize I used to be a teacher so you've got when every time I'm up here I'm going to teach you something. That's the way it's going to be.
[time=1116] That's the way I think.
[time=1120] Edward Ross on the clerk for the governing council of Clarksville, Massachusetts wrote a declaration about Thanksgiving.
[time=1124] I want you to hear some of the words. Here's an excerpt of it.
[time=1128] The council is thought to me and appoint and set apart the 29th day of this instant June. They did this in June. As a day of solemn thanksgiving and praise to God.
[time=1140] Thanksgiving and praise to God. Well it wasn't just then President George Washington made a declaration of thanksgiving in 1789. Listen to his words. "Whereas it is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the providence of almighty God to obey his will, to be grateful for his benefits, and humbly to implore his protection and favor. Whereas both houses of congress have made by their joint committee a question to me to recommend to the people of the United States a day of public thanksgiving and prayer to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many and signal favors of the almighty God. That came from our very first president. And then of course as I said earlier in 1863 President Lincoln said he wrote a proclamation after being charged to do so set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next.
[time=1192] "A day of thanksgiving and praise to our beneficent father who dwelleth in the heavens, and I recommend to them that while offering up the descriptions justly do him for such singular deliverances and blessings, they do also with humble pendants for our national prayerlessness and disobedience commend to his tender care. All those who have become widows, orphans, mourners or softeners in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unburably engaged." We don't write like that anymore do we? We ought to because there's some really rich text there. But the whole premise is that even in our nation's founders thanksgiving was always about thanksgiving and prayer and praise to God. That's what it was for.
[time=1232] It wasn't just for us to sit down and get together with family and certainly that's the driving force today and that's not a bad thing but initially it was for thanksgiving and prayer and no one should be more thankful than the body of Christ amen? None of us should be more thankful. Nobody should be more thankful when we are. Because we understand the gifts that we've been given. So thanksgiving is an intentional mindset. When you look at your life we have to develop a posture of thanksgiving because no matter what's going on in some people, I know there's some very hurting people in this room today. I don't mean to minimize that at all.
[time=1272] But in the grand scheme of things, how good has God been to you?
[time=1276] Hopefully when we get done today we'll understand that there's even more behind that.
[time=1280] So thanksgiving is not only an intentional mindset but the second point genuine gratitude requires reflection. Now we're coming into the Christmas season and many of you are going to give gifts, right?
[time=1296] There are multiple ways that we say thank you.
[time=1300] There's the thank you, right? Somebody gives you, I call that the chocolate box, thank you.
[time=1312] Okay? And then there's the dirty sock, thank you.
[time=1316] Thank you, right?
[time=1320] But is there genuine gratitude? Genuine thanks there.
[time=1324] And that's what we want to explore right now. Genuine gratitude required reflection because if we stop and look back at things in our lives and we understand what Christ has done for us, we understand what he has shielded us from, we understand what he has taken the hit for, our gratitude becomes much more intense.
[time=1348] We're going to talk a little about about God's wrath, what Jesus took for us.
[time=1352] Jesus, over the next few minutes we're going to talk about what Jesus has done for you.
[time=1356] He died in the cross to save you from your sins, right? There's a lot more behind that.
[time=1360] We want you to understand what he's done for you.
[time=1364] God's wrath on the day of judgment is for sinners, anyone who does not declare his name, anyone who has not accepted him as our Lord and Savior. That's what God's wrath is for.
[time=1372] The Bible tells us in Romans 3, 23, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. All of us, every one of us, have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. And that means that falling short, that sin has created that gap between us and God.
[time=1388] We've seen those pictures, haven't we, those graphics? That has created a gap for us.
[time=1392] And as AF59, too, it says your iniquities or your sins have made a separation between you and your God. And listen to this phrase, your sins have hidden his face from you. Because God cannot look on sin and so he can't look on you when you're a sinful person.
[time=1412] Now imagine the one person in your life that you, on this earth that loves you one else and you go to them and they turn away from you.
[time=1420] You go to them in the time that they just turn away from you.
[time=1424] How would that make you feel? Right? Wow.
[time=1428] I made a mistake the other day, do it all the time.
[time=1432] You know, what would happen if I went to my wife and I said, man, I made this mistake and she just turned and walked away. That would empty your stomach, wouldn't it? Our sin has created that with the Lord, with God, the Father.
[time=1448] He cannot look on sin, so his face has turned away from us. That's what sin is done.
[time=1452] In Romans 6, 23, the gospel message is going on, we learn that the result of sin is death.
[time=1460] For the wages of sin is death. The wages of sin.
[time=1464] That gap that's created between us and God, that is created by sin. That has to be paid for. That has to be paid for. Something has to be done. In the Old Testament, we went through several months ago, the atonement sacrifices where the Israelites had to sacrifice lambs and the blood of the lamb then would wash them from their sins. Jesus Christ did that for us.
[time=1488] There had to be, that sin had to be paid for to close that gap between God and man.
[time=1496] And in Ephesians, Paul even says that we are children of wrath, God's wrath.
[time=1504] The death and wrath that is spoken of the earth without Christ includes hell.
[time=1512] Hell is part of God's wrath. We don't talk about hell in church a lot, but I want to just paint a little picture of what that is. Why? Because I want you to understand when you say that Jesus saved me from my sin, that Jesus has given me this eternal salvation, what he has saved you from.
[time=1532] At Black Hawk, we believe that the word gets the last word. Pastor Kevin says that frequently.
[time=1540] So let's let the Bible, the word, tell us what hell is.
[time=1544] In Matthew 25, 30 it says it's a place of weeping and gnashing of teeth. And ye, the unprofitable servant into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
[time=1556] Constant weeping, gnashing of teeth as would be like when you do something like you take a hammer and you hit your thumb, I mean, you don't go, wow, that was fun. You hit the hammer and then you squint right here like this right here, that would be gnashing of teeth.
[time=1572] Weeping and gnashing of teeth. Oh, by the way, forever.
[time=1576] It goes on. Matthew 22, 13 calls it a place of outer darkness, a place of outer darkness. If you wanted what that's like, have you ever been in a place when you're all by yourself and it is so dark you can't see your hand, right? You've been there?
[time=1592] That's outer darkness. You can't see anything.
[time=1596] It is just pitch black all the time. That's what Matthew tells us about it.
[time=1600] It's a place of continuous tormenting, Luke 16. Think about the worst tormenting you ever had multiplied by a thousand times.
[time=1608] That's going to continue. Overwhelming sorrow.
[time=1612] Overwhelming sorrow is a horrible thing, right? Hurts.
[time=1616] Overwhelming sorrow. A place of everlasting destruction in 2 Thessalonians.
[time=1620] Revelation 20 says it's ultimately a lake of fire.
[time=1624] And death and hell are cast into the lake of fire. This is a second death.
[time=1628] A lake of fire. Those who do not accept Jesus as their Savior.
[time=1632] Those who are not Christ followers will find themselves in a lake of fire.
[time=1636] Have you ever burned yourself? I burned myself. That hurts eternal lake of fire.
[time=1644] It's a place where men are tormented with fire and brimstone.
[time=1648] And listen to this, but the fearful and unbelieving.
[time=1652] That's those who do not have the Lord as their Savior. Unbelieving.
[time=1656] And they're grouped in with this group of people. The abominable.
[time=1660] The murderers. The Hormongers. The sorcerers and idolaters. And all liars.
[time=1664] They're all grouped into one. They're part in the lake of fire which burneth down. That's what you used to do.
[time=1672] Take care of that. A place where fire is not quenched in Mark 944.
[time=1676] Where the worm died and the fire is not quenched.
[time=1680] It's a bottomless pit. Revelation 9-2. A place of no rest.
[time=1684] Revelation 14-11. Take the worst pain that you could possibly imagine. And as human beings we don't really know of much pain worse than child bearing.
[time=1696] It's a child birth. And I'm never going to have to do that.
[time=1700] But ladies know what we're talking about, don't you?
[time=1704] Well here's the thing about child birth. When you go through child birth and you go through that excruciating pain you know two things. One, at the end of it the pain's going to be gone. And two, at the end of it you're going to have a reward for your efforts, right?
[time=1720] Now imagine that kind of pain with no end.
[time=1724] And there's no hope that it will ever end.
[time=1728] That'll start to give you a glimmer of what hell would be like.
[time=1732] If you are a Christian, if you are a Christ follower you have declared Jesus the Lord of your life, this is what you've been saved from. Instead of this horror God is preparing a perfect place for you in his heaven.
[time=1752] A place beyond compare of indescribable beauty, peace, love where there will be no pain, no sorrow, or no tears. So when we say that Jesus Christ died on the cross to save me from my sins He has cleansed me of all of my sin. That sin that was creating a gap between me and God. That sin that would ultimately lead to an existence of forever pain, a forever torment, forever fire. That's what Jesus fronted for you when he stepped into that gap because Jesus overcame hell didn't he?
[time=1788] Jesus defeated death. Jesus defeated Satan on your behalf.
[time=1796] So when you're thankful get a mental image of that and let your gratitude be genuine and deep because that's what our Savior saved us from. Who in the building is thankful that our Savior saved us from all of that?
[time=1816] Amen? Amen? That's what he did and see what happens when we get to the end and we're there when God the Father looks at me He is not going to see a life of sin. He is going to look to the veil of Christ and see perfection. Am I perfect? No.
[time=1836] Christ's blood makes me perfect. When He looks at you if you are, if you have given your life to Christ and asked for forgiveness from your sin He will not see you. He will look through the blood of Jesus Christ the veil of the blood of Christ and see righteousness. Because see God can look at perfection. God can look at righteousness. God cannot look at sin.
[time=1860] That's what we have to be thankful for. All the rest of this stuff it's really nothing. Right?
[time=1868] Yesterday my oldest son and I we went up to a football game in Ann Arbor, big house, Michigan House State game props to my house, state friends, mark-arms. Okay good job.
[time=1884] But here's the thing as I'm sitting there I'm honestly sitting there watching looking around my son will tell you I'm not a yeller I just sit and watch and when things would slide one way I had some Ohio State people on one side of me, had Michigan people on their side of me.
[time=1900] When things would slide for one team, one team was like yeah, yeah, yeah, woo!
[time=1904] The other team is like and then it would slip the other way. Back and forth.
[time=1908] And I'm just sitting there saying I am so thankful my salvation does not depend on that. I am so thankful that my salvation doesn't depend on something that is so voice you, wash you back and forth. Because you know what Jesus Christ drew a line in the sand and that's done. Right?
[time=1928] That's what we need to be thankful for.
[time=1932] Truly reflect on what Christ has done to you. Not just day-to-day provisions and we're certainly thankful for those, right?
[time=1940] We're certainly thankful for those but if you have given your heart and life to Christ remember what Christ has stepped in front of for you then you can experience genuine gratitude.
[time=1956] I gotta take a moment if you are without Christ.
[time=1960] If you have not submitted your life and heart to Jesus Christ please hear me.
[time=1964] You know what I mean? You don't realize how close you are to hell, the eternity of hell. Every one of us know, don't we, that we're not given tomorrow, right? We're not guaranteed tomorrow. We're not guaranteed for lunch. Sad to say but it's true.
[time=1980] And if you enter death and you have not given your life to Christ all that stuff we described earlier that's on your agenda for the rest of eternity.
[time=1996] Please, please consider Jesus Christ today.
[time=2000] Because the only way that you can be saved from the wrath of God is to be saved from it by faith in Christ.
[time=2008] We hear about that in Ephesians 2, 3, 2, 3, 8, 9.
[time=2012] For by grace you have been saved through faith.
[time=2016] It's not of your own doing. It's a gift of God.
[time=2020] Not a result of work so that no one can boast. It doesn't matter who you are.
[time=2024] It doesn't matter what you wear. It doesn't matter where you work, how much you earn.
[time=2028] How much you live and what car you drive.
[time=2032] You know what matters? What did you do with Jesus Christ?
[time=2036] That's what matters. It didn't matter who won yesterday's football game. My son and I had a great time.
[time=2044] We drove home, had fun, ate a Taco Bell, had a good time together. Why? Because that didn't matter.
[time=2052] What matters? What do you do with Jesus Christ?
[time=2062] You must trust in what Jesus has done on the cross to forgive you of your sins and not trust anything else. Nothing that you can do.
[time=2070] Not even your own sincerity or your works. It is by Jesus and only that you can turn away the righteous judgment of God on the sinner. And then that leads us to Psalm chapter 100. Because Psalm chapter 100 is a celebration. It's a rejoicing. So let us rejoice given to all that Christ has done for us. All that Christ has taken away from us.
[time=2094] All that he experienced on our behalf. Let's move away from that and let's celebrate in Psalm 100 because that's what Psalm 100 is. It is a celebration.
[time=2102] Amen? So let's celebrate. The very first joy says make a joyful noise unto the Lord. Other translations will say a joyful shout.
[time=2114] Brother John MacArthur says that it is a joyful shout. So it's not just singing. It's singing with all you got. It's singing with all your might to praise the Lord. That's what a joyful noise is.
[time=2130] Because see what Psalm 100 does for us is it teaches us, it pushes us to do something.
[time=2138] That's the title of the message today. To do something. Not just sit idly by and become active, but do something. If you were in surgery, if you were on your way to have a critical surgery, how many of you would like to have the smartest doctor in the entire world in that operating room?
[time=2154] And you just stand in there looking. You're not doing anything.
[time=2158] He doesn't say anything. He just stays. Got all the degrees that you want.
[time=2162] He's passed. He's done the surgery hundreds of times. And you just stand in there. Is that what you want? No. What do you want him to do?
[time=2170] You want him to do something. It's not enough for us to just know about Christ. It's not enough for us to know the Bible. It's not enough for us to serve here and serve there. We've got to do something with what we know.
[time=2182] Because I want that doctor to operate on me.
[time=2186] I don't want him to just to stand there. I want him to do something.
[time=2190] Make a joyful noise.
[time=2194] A joyful shout. Don't just whisper.
[time=2198] Or mumble. Or stir around.
[time=2202] You're a good, good father.
[time=2206] Two you are. Right? We don't want something like that.
[time=2210] Don't just, this is from J. Vernon McGee says don't just whisper and mumble or stir around. Afraid you're going to disturb the person next to you.
[time=2218] But with all your might. Let the whole world know that the sovereign God of all creation is with you. He loves you. And He is on your side.
[time=2226] When you are praising the Lord, get after it.
[time=2230] Amen? Man, I'll tell you what, yesterday there were some people that were getting after their joy.
[time=2238] And some people that were getting after their anger.
[time=2242] I was just getting popcorn.
[time=2246] We need to get after it.
[time=2250] It doesn't matter if you sing well or not. That's not the point. Because when God hears it, that is beautiful to Him. And when you don't, now I look like I'm making you sing in church, aren't I? I am.
[time=2262] Because we are to come together and worship the Lord. Get after it.
[time=2266] Enjoy it. That's what God is looking for.
[time=2270] Verse 2 says, "To serve the Lord with gladness." Oh, Richard is going to talk about serving.
[time=2278] Just another thing for my schedule. How am I going to fit that in?
[time=2282] Serving is a blessing. It's not a burden.
[time=2286] It's a personal joy. Absolutely.
[time=2290] This summer we went out to Idaho and went to conference on discipleship. And Jim Putman was the speaker there.
[time=2298] And we were in the room, but one time we had breakout sessions and we were in the main room.
[time=2302] We were in the main room. We were in the same time with the pastors.
[time=2306] And he allowed the pastors to ask questions. And they could write questions down on papers and send them to him.
[time=2310] Now Jim Putman was a NCAA champion wrestler.
[time=2314] And Jim Putman was an NCAA wrestling coach.
[time=2318] And he fit that persona. Man, he was intense.
[time=2322] An intense man, right? So he's there.
[time=2326] And one of the questions came up and somebody read it to him from the panel and said, "It was this. How can I fit this into my busy schedule?" Oh, I felt bad for that guy.
[time=2338] Because this is what Jim Putman said in a very nice voice.
[time=2342] I'm not asking you to fit this into your schedule.
[time=2346] I'm telling you to rearrange your schedule, but genius, first!
[time=2350] That's exactly how he did it. And then he went on and on. Because here's the thing. If I'm standing before the Lord but I had this, I had these things I had to do.
[time=2362] And that's not going to matter to him, is it? He's going to say, "What did you do with Jesus? What did you do with my son?" That's what he's going to say.
[time=2370] Wow. Serve the Lord with gladness. Here's what I wanted to tell you.
[time=2374] If you're not serving the Lord, you're missing out.
[time=2378] You're missing out. Can serving the Lord be hard, difficult?
[time=2382] Absolutely. A little love to my simple supper crew here.
[time=2386] From Monday until Thursday, they're working on simple seppers on Wednesday nights.
[time=2390] And they work hard. They work hard.
[time=2394] But that's a joy. Every Wednesday night, when I sit down towards the end of the time and I look across our cafeteria and I see all these brothers and sisters in crisis, fellowshipping and eating together and laughing and all of that is such a warm joy.
[time=2410] And I see some of my simple supper and people going like this. Yeah, that it really is.
[time=2414] Okay? I visit someone.
[time=2418] I visit someone. As a pastor, I feel like I should visit people when they're in the hospital and things.
[time=2422] I've been an individual once a week. And I'm going to be honest with you.
[time=2426] The reason I went to visit this person was because they're elderly, they're shut in, they can't get out, they can't come to church and I feel that responsibility as a pastor go to do that.
[time=2434] Okay? And I think most of you would say, "Yeah, Rich, that's, you ought to do that." I will tell you this. My wife, every time I come home from visiting, said, "Yeah," I said, "Yeah." She goes, "You were so different. You could just tell." Because visiting isn't a burden. It's a joy. And I walk out of there and I'm like, "I just want to stay there the rest of the day." When you serve the Lord with gladness, not only does it fill your cup, it doesn't even let your cup get empty a little bit. It just keeps filling and overflowing. So if you are not serving somewhere, and I don't know what that means for you, I'm up here saying, "We need people to work in children's ministry. We need people to do..." That's not the point. The point is, are you serving Christ in your life?
[time=2478] I don't know where that is. Maybe it's at Blackauk. Maybe it's downtown. Maybe it's across the street.
[time=2482] Maybe it's in your... I don't know what it is, how it looks. How are you serving the Lord with gladness in your life?
[time=2488] Because if you're not, one, God tells us to, so we should.
[time=2492] Secondly, you're missing. You're missing out.
[time=2496] Schedule is busy. Change your schedule.
[time=2500] Change your schedule. Think you're out of way that you can serve the Lord with gladness.
[time=2508] To serve the Lord, what does that mean? It means to give of your time, your talent, and your treasure. That's what it means to serve the Lord.
[time=2516] Some of you are talented. Are you using your talents to serve God?
[time=2520] Are you using your time? Have you altered your schedule so that you can use your time to serve the Lord? Does that mean you're out preaching the gospel everywhere?
[time=2528] No, it means that you're loving people. Are you out loving people?
[time=2532] Because what does Jesus say? You will know their mire disciples if they love one another. Are you loving on people?
[time=2540] And allowing the Lord to give you opportunities to have a good conversation with them?
[time=2544] What about your treasure? Are you giving your treasure to the Lord to further the gospel? Last week I think Pastor Kevin Starter up here and said, you know, make, decide what you're going to give.
[time=2556] And if you think I'm just up here raising money, don't give it here, give it somewhere else.
[time=2560] Because answer this question. Do you really think God needs your money?
[time=2564] I mean seriously. Do you think he needs you to bankroll him? No, he doesn't. So that's not the point.
[time=2572] The point is that you are giving joyfully.
[time=2576] You are serving with gladness because you are a Christian.
[time=2580] I'm going to tell you right now.
[time=2584] Our goal on the 17th of December, that's nothing for our God. That's nothing for our God.
[time=2592] A year ago we were almost half a million dollars in debt.
[time=2596] Right? How much debt do we have right now?
[time=2600] Zero.
[time=2604] Did you do that? Did I do that? God did that through us, didn't he?
[time=2608] Absolutely. So there's nothing God can't get done.
[time=2612] And here's the thing. If you choose not to give, if you choose not to serve, if you choose not to use your talent, here's the thing. You lose because he's not going to derail his plan just for you.
[time=2624] Right? Now that happened. So my admission to you is jump on board. Do something.
[time=2632] Whether it's serve, whether it's give, whatever it is, use your talents. Whatever that is, do something.
[time=2640] Because from cradle to grave you have an opportunity.
[time=2644] You have an opportunity to make a difference because the person that I visit every week, like 94 years old, do something.
[time=2656] To paraphrase the philosopher A. Tae Kinsman, that is, that's my son-in-law. He said last week at the men's retreat, he said, God will never be upset by what service you offer if it's done with a pure heart. I can't do this. I can't do that.
[time=2676] God's not going to be upset if you're giving from a pure heart.
[time=2680] Right? He's not going to be upset. He's not going to be disappointed because the act isn't the issue. It's the heart that's the issue because God is in the heart business. That's why we can stand up here confident and say he doesn't need your finances because he's not in the finance business.
[time=2696] He is in the heart business. And here's a rule for life for you right here.
[time=2700] God wants 100% of your heart 100% of the time.
[time=2704] I know people ask me because I used to teach finance classes, how much should I give?
[time=2708] And I said, I know the answer. He wants 100% of your heart 100% of the time.
[time=2712] And when he's got that, he will take care of everything else.
[time=2716] God wants 100% of who you are.
[time=2720] Serve the Lord with gladness.
[time=2724] Know that the Lord is God. He is God. Steve Longbreak used to be here.
[time=2728] I was sat in his son's class and he would always say, and I love this.
[time=2732] You are God and I am not. Right?
[time=2736] You are God. I am not. Now, I spent a long time in my life as a coach. In verse 3 it says, he is the Lord. He is He who made us and we are His. We belong to Him. We should act like it. Right? Okay?
[time=2752] So yesterday we're at the ball game and there you go blue, go blue.
[time=2756] Right? We should be more excited in church. So we're going to do this in church.
[time=2760] Pastor Kevin is not here so we can do whatever we want to do.
[time=2764] And so we're going to chant, we are gods.
[time=2768] Right? So this section here and up there you are. The we are's.
[time=2772] And you are the gods. You ready?
[time=2776] Here we go. We are gods.
[time=2780] We are gods.
[time=2784] All right, stop. Now, my brother Rick Rayburn would rather us do this.
[time=2788] So this time it's your turn. I am gods.
[time=2792] Got it? Here we go. Ready?
[time=2796] [AMEN] We belong to the king. We win.
[time=2804] We do.
[time=2808] And that should bring joy in you that is so this bubbles out in your life and your service.
[time=2816] We are gods.
[time=2819] Verse 4, enter his gates with Thanksgiving.
[time=2823] Going back to J. Vernon McGig and listen to this, God does not want you to come before him to worship with a long face.
[time=2831] There are many times we have long faces, problems we set us, temptations overcome us or we come to God in repentance and ask me forgiveness and those times are necessary.
[time=2839] We cast ourselves on him but that's not worship.
[time=2843] You worship God when you come to praise him.
[time=2847] When you come to intentionally praise him. That's why the scriptures say do not forsake the assembly together of the saints.
[time=2855] It's good for us to come together and to worship and praise God together and we ought to do it with everything we got. Amen?
[time=2863] Yeah. Man, I love to sing. We should do that more often.
[time=2867] And then verse 5 he tells us the Lord is good. His steadfast love endures forever.
[time=2875] That means God will always be with us throughout this whole thing called life.
[time=2879] Someone told me this. I don't know if it's scientifically proven or not.
[time=2885] I don't really trust science sometimes. But here's what I think.
[time=2889] I think it's physically impossible, physically impossible for you to be stressed out and thankful at the same time.
[time=2898] I think it's physically impossible for you to be genuinely thankful and stressed out at the same time. Try that.
[time=2906] If you're a stressed out person and you're starting to feel that stress, just sit down and just close your eyes for a minute and just be thankful.
[time=2914] Think about what Jesus did for me. All that stuff we talked about earlier.
[time=2918] That stuff that Jesus did. The stuff that Jesus took for us.
[time=2922] Think about that and say thank you Jesus. And see what happens to your stress level.
[time=2926] I don't know. The secret of living a stress-ly life is to live a life of gratitude. Amen.
[time=2934] Psalm 100 causes us Christians to do something. Not just bask in the grace and love of God but to do something and join people with us. So a little exercise for you.
[time=2942] How will you do something today? Here's an exercise for you.
[time=2946] Right now think in your mind someone in your life who is without Christ.
[time=2950] Get their picture right up there. Get their picture in your mind.
[time=2954] Someone who is without Christ. Okay, now picture because our minds are awesome. Picture right next to them is Jesus.
[time=2962] Now what would you say to Jesus?
[time=2966] How would you tell them why that person deserves to be in heaven?
[time=2970] Why Jesus deserves to love that person? Defend them.
[time=2974] I think they should be in heaven. I think you should love them. I think they should come to know you as your Lord and Savior. You got that?
[time=2982] Now explain to Jesus what you've done to help that.
[time=2986] What have you done to help that?
[time=2990] And if we're honest some of us, maybe many of us, haven't done a whole lot there.
[time=2998] Psalm 100 says do something. Get after it.
[time=3002] Get after it.
[time=3006] Maybe God is prompting in your heart something today about your time.
[time=3010] Maybe there's a way that you can rearrange your schedule, put Jesus first and have time that you can serve someone. Am I saying come serve at the church? I'm not.
[time=3018] That's between you and God. Serve Jesus somewhere.
[time=3022] Maybe you shut off the ballgame and you walk to the neighbor's house and sit down and have cookies with them or just visit with them. Or maybe maybe you're at the grocery store like I was with our son Jay the other day and we get out of the truck and it's raining and there's this lady and she's in one of those little buggy cars.
[time=3042] And she's got to get it back in the store. And Jay just said I'll take it for you.
[time=3046] And I drove right in the store for her. He served that lady that day, right?
[time=3050] I don't know what serving looks like in your life but I know that God wants you to do it and serve with a glad heart.
[time=3058] That's what I know. I don't know what giving looks like in your life.
[time=3062] Maybe God is prompting you that he wants you to give more, give to the Christmas Jesus gift offering. I don't know that's between you and Jesus not me. Maybe he wants you to give because somebody in your life of influence has a need and maybe it's a need you can meet. And it's totally unrelated to church. I don't know. That's between you and Jesus.
[time=3086] Figure that out with his help because if he gets 100% of your heart 100% of the time then he will be able to lead and guide you.
[time=3094] Maybe you have a talent that you're not using for Christ.
[time=3098] Consider that.
[time=3102] Questions to ponder. Is Christ enough for you?
[time=3106] Let me really, is he enough for you?
[time=3110] Can we just say Christ is enough for us? Is it true?
[time=3114] Is he really enough for you?
[time=3118] Christ is all I need.
[time=3122] How are you intentionally serving Christ with your life today?
[time=3126] A lot of us serve Christ organically, right?
[time=3130] Take care of it. How are we doing it intentionally?
[time=3134] How are we putting a game plan together to intentionally serve Jesus Christ? Tomorrow when you wake up ask yourself this question, how am I going to intentionally serve Christ today? What am I going to do to intentionally serve Christ?
[time=3150] Today.
[time=3154] How might God want you to do something?
[time=3158] What's your do something?
[time=3162] Right now, tonight, tomorrow. What's the do something you need to do?
[time=3168] And in Matthew 28, 19, this is not on your screen. Jesus gives us another action verb. Go and make disciples. Go.
[time=3176] A lot of action. Oh, in the next few weeks you're going to learn more because of the Christmas season. You're going to learn more about Christ and the people on Earth that influenced his life.
[time=3186] And then in January we're going to have a series on discipleship.
[time=3190] There's an opportunity for you to A, get to know Christ more and then B, jump on what Jesus' biggest action verb go and make disciples. We're going to talk about that after the first of the year. Go.
[time=3206] Do something. We have 33 missionaries that leave our church that we support. 33 missionaries and that's awesome, isn't it? That's fantastic. Love that. We have over 1,200 members of our church. So what are the other 1,100 of us doing?
[time=3218] We're missionaries. Okay, you are missionaries. So in your work place how are you being a missionary? Are you loving on people? Now that doesn't mean you have to go out and get a degree in Bible and hand tracks out. That's not the point. The point is are you a loving, caring person?
[time=3234] Are you loving your neighbors? And when God gives you an opportunity you share with them, right? Because a lot of times your neighbors, if you walk up and say you don't, you need no Jesus. They'll shut you right off.
[time=3246] But if you build that relationship with them, then you have authority to speak in their lives.
[time=3254] Would you please bow your heads with me? Close your eyes.
[time=3262] I want to talk to the Christians today.
[time=3266] If you're a Christian, you've already given your life to Christ.
[time=3270] Is there an area of your life that you need to do something?
[time=3274] Be honest with yourself. Be honest with Jesus. You can't fool Jesus anyways.
[time=3278] He already knows the answer to that question. Is there something that you need to do?
[time=3282] If God is speaking, maybe He's speaking about your time, your talent, your treasure asking you to do something with it. I don't know.
[time=3290] That's between you and Him. If you would like to meet a pray for you today would you just slip your hand up? I will pray for you today.
[time=3298] Thank you. All over. Thank you.
[time=3302] Yes?
[time=3306] Maybe you are without Christ already.
[time=3310] Maybe you do something. Maybe your do something is that you need to turn your life hard over to Jesus Christ. Maybe you have been known for a long time but never entered into a personal relationship with Him. I hope it's today that you'll make that decision this day.
[time=3326] If this is the case with you and your heart is yearning to do so, the Bible teaches whoever calls upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ will be saved.
[time=3334] I want you to do that right now.
[time=3338] Hand the keys over to Jesus of your life. Hand the keys over to Him.
[time=3342] Let Him take charge. Let Him be the boss.
[time=3346] What does do something mean to you today? Maybe it is that step
[time=3354] of salvation that you've heard about. That God's been stirring inside of you.
[time=3358] Maybe for quite some time and today perhaps is that day to take that leap of faith to trust Jesus as your Savior. You've seen that my sin, your sin, our sin, it separates us from God. It creates this gap between where we are and where we have to be to be in a relationship with God, to have eternal life. And you've seen that today is that day for you to close that gap. The good news of the gospel is that Jesus built the bridge for you. The bridge is the cross. The bridge is the fact that He died on that cross paying a penalty for your sin that you could never pay and I could never pay. After He lived that sinless life that we could never live so that we could know God, be in fellowship with God, that we could have eternal life. Why? Not because of what we can do but because of what Jesus already did. He paid that price and it didn't stop there. He rose again. He is resurrected from the grave and when he walked out of that grave, he carried out with him the keys to death and to hell and to eternal life. And so because of his sacrifice, because of his victory, we too can share in the victory of eternal life, have a relationship with God through Jesus Christ.
[time=3426] That's salvation. And you may be saying, well I can't say it that way and I don't have those words. God doesn't want you to have those words. He wants your heart to just be fully offered to him through prayer. Prayer is just our way of talking to God. So maybe you need to pull aside for just a few minutes and have a discussion, have a conversation with Jesus and let him know that today is the day of your salvation. It's time for me to turn over the keys of my life to you today. If that's you, then I encourage you. I celebrate with you. That is the best decision that anyone could ever make.
[time=3458] It's the best application of do something that any of us could ever participate in. And if that is you today, we want to hear from you.
[time=3466] We've even got some resources. We'd love to get into your hands. A booklet that's called Beginning Steps, a growth guide for you believers. And in this book, you're going to find seven simple steps that will help you know what's next. If you've taken this leap of faith, we often call salvation today. And so we'd love to get that into your hands. There's going to be information on your screen, email address, phone number that you can use to reach out to us. Be glad to mail you one of these books.
[time=3490] You can always stop by our office here. But we would love to walk alongside of you and show you what is next. And so no matter what God's doing in your heart, use that information. Tell us your story. What is your story? It's a unique story.
[time=3502] It's a story that God's still writing. And it's a story that we are interested in, invest it in, and we care about here at Black Hawk. Thank you for letting us know what God's up to in your life, for sharing some of your time with us today as we've looked at God's Word. I know and I believe and I trust that you've been blessed. And now it's time for us together to go out and do something. I want to invite you back for next week because we're going to be starting a new series, a new emphasis called "With Us." It's going to carry us through the Christmas season at Black Hawk Ministries. And we're going to be looking at Emmanuel, God with us. That's what Christmas is all about.
[time=3538] That God came here to be with us through the person of Jesus Christ. And we're going to be looking at the people of the Christmas story and what it means to know and understand what with us means.
[time=3550] Jesus is from their unique perspectives. And I believe that their unique perspective is going to change your perspective and mine as we look at the Christmas story and look at these people together. So join us next week and we're going to see God continue to do great things. Thanks again. See you then.
