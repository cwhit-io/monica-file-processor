[time=276] That saved a wretch like me.
[time=284] I once was lost, but now I'm found.
[time=295] I was blind, but now I sing.
[time=307] It was grace that taught my heart to fear.
[time=318] And grace my fears relieved.
[time=329] Our precious dear, that grace still appeared.
[time=340] The hour I first believed.
[time=348] Sing with us.
[time=350] When we've been there, ten thousand years.
[time=360] Right shining as no sun.
[time=370] With no last days to see God's grace.
[time=381] Then when we first begun.
[time=392] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound.
[time=402] That saved a wretch like me.
[time=409] I once was lost, but now I'm found.
[time=420] I was blind, but now I sing.
[time=435] Thanks for tuning in today.
[time=437] We are so excited at Black Hawk to start a new series, emphasis and focus on really what the real reason for the Christmas season is.
[time=445] And that is that Jesus is God with us.
[time=448] He is Emmanuel.
[time=450] God is with us.
[time=451] He's with you today.
[time=452] And that's really the focus of what we're going to be looking at over the course of this month.
[time=456] Looking at the people in the Christmas story, what their perspective, their experience of this Jesus,
[time=462] of this little baby boy that means God with us, what it means for their lives.
[time=467] And in turn, what I believe is that it's going to meet you in the middle of yours.
[time=471] And so that's what we're going to be digging into today.
[time=473] Thanks for giving of your time.
[time=474] We don't take that lightly that you choose to tune in and be a part of what God's doing at Black Hawk.
[time=478] We consider you a part of the family here.
[time=480] Even if you decided you want to watch and be anonymous today, we want you to know we see you.
[time=484] We care about you, and we love what God is up to in your life and want to be a part of it.
[time=489] So let us know what God's up to by sharing your story with us.
[time=493] We've got a lot of venues for you to be able to do that.
[time=495] Including social media.
[time=496] You can look for @BeHawkMinistries for Twitter or Instagram.
[time=499] Search for @Black HawkMinistries on Facebook.
[time=502] And as always, you can find us on the website, blackhawkMinistries.org.
[time=506] And you can also stream us live.
[time=508] Every Sunday at 1030, you can find us there.
[time=511] Today, I just want to challenge you to sit back, relax, know that God wants to meet you where you are.
[time=516] He is with you through whatever you're facing.
[time=519] He is with you through the challenges of your life.
[time=522] And I believe with all of my heart that His plan is to meet you right where you sit in this moment today.
[time=528] So thanks for tuning in.
[time=529] I think you're in for a blessing today.
[time=531] I guess I've made about a dozen or so of these.
[time=555] Carved the first one for my son.
[time=560] It's an angel.
[time=564] At least the way I remember an angel to look like anyhow.
[time=569] Oh, I've never told you about that.
[time=572] Well, it was a long time ago.
[time=577] When my son, Jesus, was born, I didn't know what he was going to look like.
[time=584] To think, I was worried about that.
[time=590] Well, let me start earlier.
[time=594] When I found out that Mary was pregnant,
[time=601] well, I didn't want to embarrass her.
[time=607] It sounds so strange.
[time=612] I didn't want to embarrass her because the baby wasn't mine.
[time=620] But then I had a dream.
[time=624] And in my dream, there was this angel as real as this stick of wood.
[time=635] And the angel told me that I was supposed to marry her.
[time=643] Told me not to be afraid.
[time=647] And that Mary was going to have God's baby.
[time=656] It's our custom, that when a child is born, the father lays the baby across his knees.
[time=665] It's symbolic.
[time=667] A way of telling the world that the child is our own legitimate descendant.
[time=676] Slowly, my heart got used to the idea that this boy was somehow on loan to me,
[time=687] that he was special.
[time=692] And I, well, I made room for him.
[time=702] The day he was born, I did what any other daddy would do.
[time=711] I held him in my arms.
[time=715] I gave him his name.
[time=721] And I called him mine.
[time=734] For some years, I couldn't quite fit all of the mystery of it all together.
[time=743] But nevertheless, he's grown into a fine man.
[time=750] Learning in the temple.
[time=753] And now teaching there.
[time=761] Every time I make one of these, I remember what that angel told me.
[time=772] That angel told me in that dream that my baby was going to be called God with us.
[time=784] God with us.
[time=791] Yeah.
[time=794] That's always been enough for me and all I've ever needed to know.
[time=801] So who does he look like?
[time=806] He looks like God, if you ask me.
[time=815] (Applause)
[time=829] Can you imagine, as we look at Christmas, Merry Christmas, by the way.
[time=834] It's not too early for that.
[time=836] Can you imagine what it would feel like to be the father of a king, the father of Jesus himself?
[time=844] That's really what we're going to do for the next few weeks is imagine.
[time=847] We're going to look at the Christmas story through the lens of people from the Christmas story like Joseph, like you just heard from.
[time=855] Today we're going to look at his story in Matthew chapter 1.
[time=858] If you've got your bibles, look there with me, Matthew chapter 1.
[time=861] We're starting a new focus for four weeks just simply called with us.
[time=864] Somebody say with us.
[time=867] Emmanuel means God with us, and so we're going to look at how these perspectives from the Bible, these perspectives from the people out of the Christmas story may just change our own perspective about how God is with us.
[time=884] Did you know that you have a God who doesn't just desire to be above you, but you have a God that desires to be with you?
[time=891] Somebody is going to leave this place today, I just believe it in my heart knowing what it means to have a God, a Savior who is with us in a new way today.
[time=901] That's what we're going to do for four weeks. Today we're going to talk about how God is with us through change.
[time=906] Somebody say change.
[time=908] We're going to talk about change.
[time=910] Joseph knew what it was like to go through some change.
[time=914] His plans changed, his marriage changed, his life changed because of Christmas, because of this little baby that he was to call Emmanuel God with us.
[time=925] And so in Matthew chapter 1, I'm going to read one of the verses to you in just a moment where we get this idea, this name, Emmanuel, that this series is going to come from.
[time=934] But in Matthew chapter 1, you should know the first part of Matthew chapter 1, if you're with us last Christmas, that's all I talked about was the genealogy of Jesus.
[time=943] And you say, well, that sounds very boring, I'm glad I missed last year.
[time=947] But we looked at how Jesus came, you're ready for this, think about it because it's us, it's you and me, the Christmas story is about you.
[time=955] That's what Jesus came to be about was you and me, but last year in Matthew 1, the first part is all about the genealogy of Jesus.
[time=963] He begats, he begat, and he just keeps going, but what you see is that Jesus came from sinners. His bloodline was full of crazy, lost, misguided, knucklehead people who didn't get it, who made blunder after blunder, who made mistake after mistake.
[time=982] Jesus came from sinners, but it reminds us in Matthew 1 of what he came for, he came from sinners, but he also came for sinners.
[time=992] God is with us. And so Matthew chapter 1 in verse number 23, let's look there together, Matthew chapter 1 verse 23.
[time=1001] This is the prophecy that's fulfilled, this is also the passage we'll look at Joseph's story, but verse 23 is that prophecy that says, "Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel," which means God with us.
[time=1019] That's going to be our focus for several weeks, but so I can know who I'm talking to because it is Christmas.
[time=1024] How many of you as we get into the Christmas season have already purchased all of your Christmas gifts?
[time=1029] You're ready for Christmas. Raise your hand. You people are crazy. How do you do it?
[time=1036] I actually call you crazy. I hope you're not insulted. I really say that because I envy you because I'm not in the same boat as you.
[time=1043] If you are in the opposite end of the spectrum and you would say, "I haven't even bought one gift yet."
[time=1050] All right. We just need to know who I'm talking to here. We've got a diverse group of people, so we're in the Christmas season.
[time=1056] And as we look at with us, I think it's going to change your perspective on how you buy gifts, on who you buy gifts for, on what gifts really mean, on what the meaning of Christmas really is.
[time=1066] We're going to spend several weeks talking about that. A lot of times it's about the packaging, isn't it?
[time=1071] You know, a lot of times anybody ever had somebody that would package gifts in a way that would be deceiving on purpose just to watch you squirm.
[time=1078] You know, there's like a tiny little gift that fits into palm of your hand, but they wrap it up in like a refrigerator box or something like that.
[time=1085] Sometimes Christmas is all about the packaging. It's about the appearance.
[time=1089] That's why a lot of times we go out and buy these big gifts that we don't have any money to buy.
[time=1093] And we just do it anyway because it's about the packaging.
[time=1096] I've got to look like I've got money I don't have, I've got to look like I've got it together here at Blackhawk.
[time=1100] We call this the church smile where it's about the packaging. It doesn't matter what's going on in your life.
[time=1105] You put on a church smile. Show me yours. You ready?
[time=1108] You've got to look like you've got the package together even though maybe on the inside you're falling apart and life is crumbling around you.
[time=1119] A lot of times our spiritual life is a lot like the Christmas season in that it becomes about the packaging.
[time=1125] Jesus had a lot to say about that. He taught to the Pharisees because they were all about packaging.
[time=1130] The Pharisees were good at looking the religious part, but Jesus called them white wash tombs because they look nice and clean and neat on the outside, but on the inside they really are just full of dead man's bones and religious rituals that get you nowhere in life.
[time=1145] They're full of decaying rotting corpses on the inside like a tomb, but on the outside it looks nice and pretty.
[time=1152] So here's what our goal is in this series, with us.
[time=1155] When we truly understand what it means to have a God who is with us this Christmas, our hope, my hope for you is that we can take off the packaging.
[time=1164] We can unwrap the boxes. We can take the bows away and get down to the heart of what Christmas is really all about by allowing God into the heart of who we are.
[time=1173] Anybody willing to take the bows and the packaging off and let God into your life these next four weeks, who's with me?
[time=1180] With us. That's what I want us to look at as we dig through this, getting beyond the packaging.
[time=1185] When I think of Christmas, I really think about how it's a whisper. It's just a quiet whisper.
[time=1192] Christmas is about how God decided He wanted to reveal Himself to us as humanity.
[time=1198] It's about how God wanted to show Himself to us, help us understand who He is in our life, yet instead of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords coming with trumpets,
[time=1208] with an escort of heavenly angels, do you think God could have done that? You better know it.
[time=1213] Instead of that, He whispered. It wasn't a loud shout. It was a whisper of an entrance because this little humble baby boy was born to a guy like Joseph,
[time=1223] to a gal like Mary, in a smelly, stinky barn full of animals.
[time=1229] So God's chosen methodology for revealing Himself to us, showing us who He is, what it means to have a God who is with us came in the most humble whisper-like of ways.
[time=1242] And so when I think about that in my life, let me ask you a question.
[time=1246] Did you know that the presence of God is the most powerful when it's the most personal?
[time=1258] And I think if we were to ask God, why God did you choose to reveal Christmas?
[time=1263] Show yourself to us through that first Christmas in the form of a whisper.
[time=1267] I think He would say, "I'm whispering to you because I'm close.
[time=1271] I'm whispering to you because I'm near." You don't shout at somebody that you're sitting next to.
[time=1278] You whisper.
[time=1280] And I think that's the message of Christmas that in a world that's so flooded with confusion, in a world that's so flooded with question marks,
[time=1289] the message of Christmas is that I'm near.
[time=1292] God looking at us and saying, "I'm near, I'm with you." God looking at us and saying, "I'm right beside you so close I can whisper." That's why I've chosen to speak in that still small voice.
[time=1303] That's why that first Christmas morning I came in the most humble of ways to deliver the most powerful of things that the world would ever know.
[time=1312] Christmas is just this whisper.
[time=1314] And when God decided to announce Himself to us, He did it with that message in mind.
[time=1319] I think the message of Christmas is not, "I found God," it's that God found me.
[time=1326] And He says, "I'm with you.
[time=1329] I'm here with you." That means He's with you in that fire.
[time=1335] That means He's with you in that divorce.
[time=1338] That means He's with you in that broken relationship.
[time=1342] That means He's with you in that relationship that you thought could never be mended, but now you're seeing a glimmer of hope, but then you saw the turn go the opposite direction.
[time=1350] It means He's with you through the health concerns that you never thought you would dream of having, but now you find yourself at doctor's appointments you never thought you would have.
[time=1358] He's with you through the losses and the grieving that Christmas time often brings up.
[time=1363] Supposed to be the joyful time of the year, but the truth is sometimes it brings up so many memories and so many tragedies and so many shortcomings and so many losses.
[time=1371] That it feels heavy and the message of Christmas is that God is so close to us that He can whisper because He's here beside you.
[time=1381] That's the message of Christmas.
[time=1383] Somebody, you could just about go home, don't do that yet.
[time=1386] I think there's more to the story, but you could go home because that's the message that you need to hear is that God has not given up on you this Christmas.
[time=1394] He's with you and He's not going anywhere.
[time=1397] The greatest presence of God, hear me when I tell you this today, the greatest presence of God is not around you.
[time=1404] It's inside of you.
[time=1406] If you know Jesus as your Savior, that's the greatest presence of God.
[time=1410] It's with you.
[time=1411] And you know when I think of Christmas, if there's one thing Christmas is about is change.
[time=1417] Change.
[time=1418] Today we're looking at with us through change as we look at Joseph's story.
[time=1422] If Christmas is not about change, I don't know what Christmas is about because when I see Christmas Jesus came onto the scene and He changed humanity.
[time=1431] He changed history.
[time=1433] Do you think Joseph's plans changed a little bit when he ran into that angel?
[time=1438] This Emmanuel, God with us, his plans were changed.
[time=1441] And you know, the thing about change is a lot of times we choose the change in our life.
[time=1447] We choose to make changes.
[time=1449] But a lot of times change is chosen for us, isn't it?
[time=1452] Some of you are walking through changes in your life that you didn't ask for.
[time=1456] You're walking through changes in your life that you just assume wouldn't have come.
[time=1460] And maybe Christmas reminds you of that.
[time=1463] The holiday season may remind you of that change.
[time=1466] And so today we're going to look at how Joseph dealt with the change in his life that maybe he didn't even ask for.
[time=1472] So, Allison said, by the way, in church, change can be a kind of tricky topic in churches.
[time=1476] Can I get an amen?
[time=1478] Because the anthem of churches that don't move forward many times and reaching people for Jesus is,
[time=1484] well, we've never done it that way before.
[time=1487] And I'll tell you, I want to commend you, black car.
[time=1491] Because this year has been a year of change.
[time=1493] We've shifted, we've seen a lot of shifting happen in our church and you've responded to that because we have the mission of making sure those little kids in Kenya, as the same as the little kids that just ran across our front stage that went back to the factory, went back to our children's ministry, to all the oldest adults, to the youngest of kids, to this color, this race, this background, this economic background.
[time=1515] We want to see people come together and know Jesus who is the only unifying factor in a world that feels so divided
[time=1522] and we'll do whatever it takes to make that happen and you have gotten behind that this year.
[time=1526] Can I get an amen?
[time=1528] And we're going to keep doing that, aren't we?
[time=1531] You know, I often say when it comes to change, the only person that likes change is a wet baby and they even scream at you while you do it.
[time=1540] But there's a lot of different types of change, aren't there?
[time=1543] There's hard change and easy change.
[time=1545] Some changes are quick and easy.
[time=1546] Some are really hard for us to get to.
[time=1548] Christmas is about a baby being born.
[time=1550] My family is bracing ourselves for a new baby.
[time=1554] I know a few others are ready to adopt a baby as is my family after the first of the year.
[time=1558] And we've been out of the diaper stage for a few years now with our other two kids.
[time=1562] And so that's going to be a hard change.
[time=1564] It's a messy change.
[time=1568] Smelly change, right?
[time=1570] But we're going to go through those changes.
[time=1572] There's big changes and little changes.
[time=1574] There's all these different shifts in our life.
[time=1577] There's good changes and bad changes.
[time=1579] Sometimes there's a good change that really is a good change, but it looks like a bad change.
[time=1584] There's changes that look like good changes that actually are bad changes, and you find that out after you make the change that felt like it was going to be good.
[time=1591] You know what I'm talking about?
[time=1593] How many of you, when I think of changes, there's been a lot of changes in the world around us, and this is one.
[time=1598] How many of you remember this sound?
[time=1600] You ready for it?
[time=1614] I'm glad we got that over with.
[time=1632] Some of the younger generation said, "What in the world is that?" If you didn't know what that was, that is how we used to have to get connected to the Internet.
[time=1642] That is called dial-up, and usually when you got all the way through that, you would go, "Yes, I'm connected," or you would hear it start again and go, "No, let's do it again."
[time=1652] I think we can all agree the change from dial-up to Wi-Fi is a praise God, good change.
[time=1658] Can I get an amen?
[time=1660] So there are good changes, and a lot of times they're disguised in ways that we don't necessarily see them as good changes, and so here's what I want you to know.
[time=1668] If God is with us, as we're looking at in this series, you ready for this?
[time=1671] Then he will always work on us.
[time=1674] If God is with us, then he will always work on us.
[time=1677] What I love about Jesus is he always meets us where we are, but he never, ever, ever, ever leaves us there.
[time=1685] His goal is to transform you by the renewing of your mind.
[time=1688] His goal is to take the old you and give you a new you.
[time=1691] That's why we call it this idea of salvation as a new birth in our life.
[time=1697] We're born again.
[time=1698] If you've ever heard that term that may seem like a churchy term, well, that's where it comes from.
[time=1703] It's because we were reborn.
[time=1704] We were born again.
[time=1705] The old us has passed away, and we've been given a new identity and a new self.
[time=1709] If you know Jesus, then that includes you.
[time=1712] If God is with us, he'll always work on us.
[time=1715] And a lot of times here's what I've found about my life and about us as we go through changes that we're often more interested in changing our situation than we are interested in changing our self.
[time=1728] Can I tell you today that God's way more interested in changing your self than he is interested
[time=1734] necessarily in changing your situation?
[time=1737] A lot of times God wants to use the situation that he's put you in, that he's allowed you to walk into and through so that he can change the you that's walking through the situation.
[time=1747] But the beauty about my God is that he doesn't just say, now go walk through that situation that I'm not going to change, he says, let's go walk through that situation together because I am Emmanuel.
[time=1757] I am with you through every step of the journey.
[time=1762] So our goal in this series, I hope you can see yourself in light of what it means to know a God who is with us.
[time=1769] Today I just want to give you two things that I see from Joseph's life.
[time=1772] We're going to look at Joseph's story with us through change.
[time=1775] We're going to look at how Joseph went through the changes of his life and Joseph had to embrace change, two action steps that were Joseph's action steps, but they can also become yours.
[time=1785] The first one is to accept God's change.
[time=1790] Accept God's change.
[time=1792] Verses 18 through 21 of Matthew chapter 1 is where we're going to find how Joseph did that.
[time=1798] We're going to back up before that verse I've already read to you.
[time=1800] Look there with me, Matthew chapter 1 verses 18 through 21.
[time=1804] He's ready for the word this morning.
[time=1807] Verses 18, now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way when his mother Mary had
[time=1813] been betrothed to Joseph.
[time=1815] By the way, there are some plans there.
[time=1817] If you're betrothed, they're planning, they're engaged.
[time=1820] Before they came together, she was found to be with child.
[time=1824] Uh oh, that'll change your plans.
[time=1828] But it says from the Holy Spirit, verse 19, and her husband Joseph being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame resolve to divorce her quietly, but as he considered these things behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream saying, "Joseph's son of David do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the
[time=1848] Holy Spirit.
[time=1849] She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from
[time=1857] their sins." Think his plans had to change a little bit?
[time=1863] You've thought you've had to change plans, alter the course of your life.
[time=1867] Well Joseph definitely had to understand what that looks like, had to embrace change, and Proverbs 16, verse 9 says that we plan our way, but it's God who determines our steps.
[time=1881] Can I tell you that sometimes God's greatest blessings come from God's greatest interruptions?
[time=1891] You got any of those in your life, interruptions?
[time=1895] I wouldn't expect in that surprise a twist and a turn in your story, but sometimes God's
[time=1902] greatest blessings come from his greatest interruptions.
[time=1907] I didn't plan to move away from Georgia a little over a year ago, but it's been one of the joys of my life to see how God has used our work together here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=1917] And you know what I've learned through that process is that God's plans are always better than my plans.
[time=1924] And guess what?
[time=1925] They're better than yours too.
[time=1927] His plans are always better than ours.
[time=1931] Yes, and it even applies to that thing that you wish wouldn't have come your way.
[time=1935] The change that you didn't ask for, Joseph didn't ask for this.
[time=1939] He had plans.
[time=1940] They were engaged to be married.
[time=1941] They were in the process of walking through all of their plans, but then God interrupted the plans and changed course.
[time=1948] And he was faced with the decision, was this Joseph as was Mary and everyone that knew them?
[time=1953] How do I accept God's changes in my life?
[time=1958] I've learned that for God to change my life, God's first got to change my mind a lot of
[time=1965] times.
[time=1967] God needed Joseph to change his mind, his perception, how he would initially see your
[time=1973] engaged spouse, just think about the story for a minute.
[time=1976] Your engaged spouse, you know that you've waited until marriage and she's pregnant.
[time=1983] But she said, "But it's okay because this is God's baby." Exactly, amen.
[time=1991] One honest person in the room.
[time=1992] We would all go, "Yeah, right.
[time=1995] Can you imagine if you were in those shoes, talk about a change in your plans?" And Joseph had to accept and then in a dream you hear from an angel that says, "Hey, it's
[time=2006] okay.
[time=2007] She's telling the truth.
[time=2008] This is God's child.
[time=2009] She's conceived by the Holy Spirit.
[time=2012] And this is God's son.
[time=2013] And here's what you're supposed to name him.
[time=2016] Put yourself in Joseph's shoes and Joseph's story.
[time=2019] God better be with me through that change, right?
[time=2023] Do you have something, can I ask you?
[time=2026] Do you have something in your life that maybe it's time to accept a change that came about,
[time=2034] maybe one you didn't ask for, maybe one you'd hoped that it would come about, but then you saw it and wished that it wouldn't have come about, whatever it might be.
[time=2041] But maybe there's a change in your life that you've been pushing away and being unwilling to accept in your life.
[time=2047] And let's look at Joseph's story and see how he walked through that.
[time=2050] And I just believe one of the hardest things in the world to do is to change our mind about
[time=2057] something that we cannot change.
[time=2063] I like to be in charge of my changes.
[time=2065] Do you?
[time=2067] I like to be in control of my changes, but it's so difficult to accept a change that
[time=2073] I cannot affect.
[time=2075] If I can't affect that change, it's hard to accept that change.
[time=2079] That's a reality of life, is it not?
[time=2082] But Joseph was in that same place.
[time=2084] He had to accept a change that he couldn't affect, and I just believe somebody's in this building today that maybe today's the day where you need to finally say, "God, I'm going to accept what you have allowed." God I will accept what you have allowed.
[time=2101] We can live as though we have accepted change, but never actually get there.
[time=2106] Sometimes we need to accept some things that God has allowed.
[time=2108] Maybe it's a challenge that doesn't seem fair.
[time=2110] God, I'm going to accept this challenge that I didn't ask for, and it doesn't seem fair,
[time=2116] but I'm going to accept it because obviously you've allowed it, and I believe you're still trustworthy and good, and you're going to walk with me through these changes in my life.
[time=2123] So God, I'll accept the challenge that isn't fair.
[time=2126] God, I will accept the limitation in my life that I just can't let go of.
[time=2132] I'll accept that it's a limitation.
[time=2133] Maybe nobody else knows about it in my life, but I deal with it every single day.
[time=2137] I'm going to accept the fact that maybe this is never going to go away, but I also know that even though that limitation may not go away, God, I trust that you're with us and that you also will never go away.
[time=2147] So God, I will accept that limitation.
[time=2149] Maybe you have to accept this Christmas, an empty seat at a dinner table because you've
[time=2155] lost a loved one, and you didn't ask for that.
[time=2158] But there's an empty spot that you just feel like shouldn't be empty.
[time=2162] I know there are grieving people in this room because I've talked to you.
[time=2166] But maybe today is the day where God can do something in your heart and in your life where you can say, "God, you've allowed things in my life that I wouldn't want to accept, but I accept you, and because I accept you, and because I know you are with me and you love me, I accept what you have allowed and trust you to take me into the action steps
[time=2185] of water ahead." I'm going to accept what you have allowed.
[time=2190] What seems like an end to me is really just the beginning with God.
[time=2196] Do you know that?
[time=2197] What seems like an end to you is really just the beginning when God gets involved and he's truly with us in that God, now that my dream has died, it's time for years to come alive.
[time=2209] Maybe this Christmas, you're reminded of dreams that have died.
[time=2212] They once were everything that drove you, but now they're whatever it was that drove you is gone.
[time=2217] It's time to say God with the death of that dream in my life, I want to give birth to
[time=2223] whatever you're trying to do inside of me and through me and in me and around me and to the people in my life that you still got around me for this day and this season.
[time=2231] Can I tell you that changes to our plans can become catalysts for God's promises?
[time=2239] Changes to our plans can become catalysts for God's promises.
[time=2243] I can't think of a better story than Joseph's to point to that very fact.
[time=2247] These plans were changed, but those changes in Joseph's plans became the very catalysts that God used to bring his own presence, his own son into the world to save us from
[time=2259] our sins, became a catalyst for the promises of God.
[time=2264] Like I talk about those gift boxes, have you ever seen just an ugly gift box?
[time=2268] How many of you are professional gift wrappers?
[time=2270] Let me see.
[time=2271] You're just really good at it.
[time=2272] Yes.
[time=2273] I like that confidence, Lindsey.
[time=2274] That's what I'm talking about.
[time=2275] Imagine if you're like me and you count and wrap a gift and make it look decent to save your life.
[time=2279] All right.
[time=2280] I knew I loved you guys and I'm so glad for the Lindsey's in the building because without you guys, all of our Christmas presents look terrible, obviously in a room like this.
[time=2289] But have you ever noticed that sometimes the wrapping kind of deters or it determines your thinking about what might or might not be on the inside?
[time=2297] I think the same's true in our life.
[time=2299] The changes of our life, the wrapping starts to determine it, but sometimes I've wrapped a really good gift, you guys.
[time=2305] I've given some pretty good gifts to my wife before, but there ain't been one of them that's been wrapped nicely.
[time=2311] Sometimes there's tape everywhere.
[time=2312] I don't do the bows.
[time=2313] The only ones that have been wrapped nicely is because somebody helped me out.
[time=2316] That's happened sometimes and Jessica will get the gift and she'll say, "Who wrapped this?" Can I give you a challenge for the boxes of your life?
[time=2327] A lot of times the most shiny boxes aren't the most significant boxes.
[time=2334] Just because it's shiny doesn't mean it's significant.
[time=2336] Just because it looks terrible doesn't mean that it is not substance.
[time=2340] Just because your life may feel like a beat-up present that Kevin wrapped because it's ugly and it looks like there's nothing good that could ever come from packaging like what you're facing in your life.
[time=2352] Sometimes God's challenge to us is to accept the changes and just say, "I'm going to open the box as ugly as it may be, as bruised and broken as my life may feel, because I know
[time=2362] God is with me and He's trustworthy and He's going to walk with me through the changes and through the ups and through the downs of my life, so I'm just going to open my box."
[time=2374] Maybe somebody, it's time to see those changes become catalysts for God's promises.
[time=2379] Time to open the box as ugly as it may be and say, "God, I accept what You've allowed in my life." Think it's fair to say, "Joseph did that." That's number one, but number two comes from verses 22 through 25 and it's to act.
[time=2392] Somebody say act.
[time=2394] It's time for some action in this place.
[time=2397] It's time for some action in your life.
[time=2399] It's time for some action in God's church.
[time=2401] If there's ever been a time in humanity where the church needs to step up and be the church,
[time=2409] it is today.
[time=2411] We're in a world that's broken.
[time=2413] We're in a world that's full of pain.
[time=2415] We're in a world that's full of division and divisiveness and hatred, and today is the
[time=2421] day that the church, that God has raised up, should step forward and say, "When a world is full of division, I'm going to be the unity.
[time=2429] In a world that's full of hate, I'm going to be the love.
[time=2431] I'm going to love so much that it hurts.
[time=2433] I'm going to be Jesus no matter what it costs me." I think it's time for somebody to act on God's call in this place today.
[time=2441] It starts with you doing that in your life, with you accepting whatever changes God may have brought about and letting God speak to you in those changes and through those changes
[time=2451] so that you can do what Joseph does in verses 22 through 25.
[time=2454] He acts on God's call for his life.
[time=2457] He didn't even know what his call was.
[time=2459] I identify with Joseph.
[time=2462] I knew what my call was it.
[time=2466] Some of you have heard me talk about it, I always said, "God, I'll do whatever you want me to do." You said a young age, but I always said, "God, I'll never," it's a bad way to start a conversation with God, you guys, but I always said, "God, I'll never be a pastor like my dad."
[time=2481] And then I had proof as to why I shouldn't, the aptitude test, they give you in high school you may have heard me talk about by now, they give you the top 10 things to do and the top 10 things to never do the top, the top one thing to never do on my aptitude test, what do you think it was?
[time=2495] Public speaking.
[time=2496] So God says, "I'm gonna take the guy who will never be a pastor like his dad, who's terrible at public speaking, who's sick on the days he has to do a class presentation, and I'm gonna make him a pastor." And God said, "I want you to accept that change in your life, Kevin, and I want you to act on my call." And I went, "Nope." I said, "God, you're crazy.
[time=2519] You ever told God he's crazy?" I have, and I live to tell the story, shows how much grace our God has, doesn't it?
[time=2526] Joseph had to do the same thing in his life, he had to act on God's call.
[time=2529] Look at verse 22 with me right after we see with us, or right before that, rather, we're gonna see the prophecy that's fulfilled, and this is my favorite part of this story, and I'll tell you why in just a minute.
[time=2540] After verse 21, he says, "The angel does, you'll bear a son, you'll cause name Jesus for his Savest People from his sins," verse 22, "All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the Prophet, years and years and years and years and years and years earlier.
[time=2554] Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which means God with us." Verse 24, "When Joseph woke from sleep, he said, 'God, you are crazy, and he ran away never to be seen again.'" Is that what your Bible says?
[time=2570] It's not what mine says either.
[time=2572] It's probably what Kevin might have done.
[time=2575] I don't know, maybe I could have been like Joseph, maybe I couldn't, I'm not sure.
[time=2578] But here's what it says, "When he awoke from sleep, he did," say he did.
[time=2583] He did as the angel of the Lord commanded him.
[time=2587] He took his wife, but knew or not until she had given birth to a son, and he called his
[time=2594] name Jesus.
[time=2595] That's the message of Christmas.
[time=2599] He accepted God's changes in his life, and then he acted on the call that God had given to him in his life.
[time=2606] Do you know that we serve a God who's above us, but he's also with us?
[time=2611] You serve a God who can be in two places at one time, and I see that in this Christmas story with Joseph's story.
[time=2618] God is above us reigning, but he's with us sustaining.
[time=2623] God is above you in your life, reigning over all the stuff that you can't understand, but yet he's in the same time, in the same moment, with you sustaining and walking with you through those things that you can't gather or grasp or understand in your life.
[time=2637] He's above us reigning, but with us sustaining.
[time=2641] God is behind us.
[time=2643] God is ahead of us, and he knows you, and he loves you.
[time=2647] He doesn't care about the skeletons in your closet.
[time=2650] He doesn't care about how you used to feel about Jesus or his church.
[time=2653] He cares about you, the you who sits in that seat right now.
[time=2657] No matter where you're watching us from in this room online, he cares about you today right now.
[time=2663] Yes, he knows you.
[time=2664] He knows you better than you know yourself, yet he's above you reigning.
[time=2668] He's still accomplishing his purposes in your life, just like he was in Joseph's.
[time=2673] God knew that he was bringing his son to this earth no matter what Joseph did or did not do.
[time=2678] He was above Joseph reigning, yet he was with him in the small steps.
[time=2682] He was accomplishing his big purposes, yet he was walking with him in the small steps that were going to lead to that purpose.
[time=2688] The same is true for you.
[time=2690] He's above you reigning.
[time=2691] He's still at work.
[time=2692] He is not finished.
[time=2694] He's going to accomplish his purposes, but in the meantime, he's still with you in the small steps.
[time=2699] Somebody say take a step.
[time=2700] It's time to take a step.
[time=2702] He's with you in the small step, the acting on obedience, the acting on God's call, the action step, the little bitty one that you've been putting off.
[time=2710] God is with you sustaining you as you take those little bitty steps, but at the same time he's above you reigning, accomplishing his purpose.
[time=2721] He's time to act on God's call.
[time=2724] Like Joseph did, he took that step.
[time=2728] Somebody needs to hear this today that what God is doing in you is more important than what's happening to you.
[time=2734] Today, what God is doing in you is more important than what's happening to you.
[time=2742] God is going to use the stuff that's happening to you to do something in you so that he can then do something through you.
[time=2747] That's kind of the point of Christmas.
[time=2749] That's with us.
[time=2750] What do God truly is?
[time=2751] So what is God's call on your life right now in this place is my question to you.
[time=2756] And as you ponder that, can I tell you what our call is collectively?
[time=2759] I'm asking you an individual question, but can I tell you one of our calls this Christmas season?
[time=2765] I love the Christmas season at church, you want to know why?
[time=2767] Because there are people who will come to church at Christmas and Easter that won't come any other time.
[time=2773] Maybe you're one of those people.
[time=2774] I want you to know I'm so glad that you're here.
[time=2776] I love, I love getting to speak the truth of Jesus and the people, particularly I have just such a heart for people who are far from God.
[time=2784] People who maybe have wrestled with questions about God so much that you've turned away from God.
[time=2788] Or maybe you've been what I call de-church, you used to go to church, but you realized that it was full of people, full of hypocrites, so you left it and you hadn't turned back since.
[time=2795] But for some reason, God brought you here in this moment.
[time=2797] If that's you today, can I tell you that I've learned something about the church that I believe can help you?
[time=2802] And that is this, that God doesn't want us to hinge our view of His church on the people that fill the seats of the church.
[time=2809] We're to hinge our view of the church on the one who initiated and started the church, the one who is perfect, the one who will never leave you or forsake you, the one who started it to begin with and His name is Jesus.
[time=2820] People are going to fail you and I want you to hear my heart as your pastor.
[time=2823] I will fail you.
[time=2825] Ask my wife, she's seen it over and over, but I want you to know our elders, our leaders, the pastors that we have on staff, the people who lead our life groups, the people that you look up to the most, they will let you down, but Jesus never will.
[time=2842] I love this time of year because I get to say things like that, but for those of you who are here, can I equip you with something?
[time=2848] I want, I know our calling that we've got to act on as a church is we've got to be the most welcoming place in Fort Wayne, and in Indiana, and in the world.
[time=2856] And I want to challenge you, if you're one of our family members at Black Hawk, look for people.
[time=2860] You know what a guest looks like.
[time=2862] If somebody's never been here, remember when you came the first time, you do something like this.
[time=2871] You look casual, you play it cool, you know, right?
[time=2874] But look for somebody that you don't know, and you know what our fear often is.
[time=2877] I'm going to give you something that's going to change your life today, you ready for it?
[time=2881] If you're like me and you've ever stuck your foot in your mouth, you ever do that?
[time=2885] Where maybe you say, oh, you must be new to Black Hawk, I've never seen you before, and they say, I've been here 20 years longer than you have.
[time=2894] Some of you are definitely afraid of that conversation, I'm ready to help you out.
[time=2897] You ready to receive it?
[time=2898] There's one question that's going to change your life, it's going to be your best friend.
[time=2902] You can ask it to somebody that's been at Black Hawk for 50 plus years, or somebody that just came in today, and the question is this, hello have you been coming to Black Hawk?
[time=2911] Some of you are going, he's asked me that a hundred times, I get it now.
[time=2915] But your say's there, because if somebody's new to Black Hawk, they say, well, I just came today.
[time=2920] You say, well, good, can I show you around?
[time=2922] Let me answer questions, I've been here a long time.
[time=2924] Oh, I've been here about 20 years, you say, that's great, I just been coming this last two years, or whatever it might be, and you have a conversation, but look for people who are coming in our doors.
[time=2933] If you're a guest, we're so glad you're here, we're so glad you're here, I'm using this time to train us and how to engage with you.
[time=2938] That's how much we care about having a wow experience.
[time=2941] People should come to the church and find that it's the most exciting, welcoming place on the planet.
[time=2946] That's why we want to do everything we do with excellence, that's why we're in the middle of campaigns.
[time=2950] Why do we ask for money at Christmas, why do we do this?
[time=2953] Because we won't settle, because we're always going to do everything we can with excellence, because God did everything that he did for us with excellence and above and beyond.
[time=2963] So ask somebody beside you, say, hello you've been coming to Black Hawk, try it out.
[time=2973] I didn't say give them your Christmas list, I said ask one person.
[time=2986] Hey, it works doesn't it?
[time=2989] It works.
[time=2990] It works so well that you're hijacking my sermon, this is awesome.
[time=2997] Joseph, are you ready to act on that call by the way as a church, can we be the most welcoming place in Fort Wayne and Indiana and around the world, because we care about other people more than we care about ourselves and we want them to hear how God's going to be with us.
[time=3010] Can we be that kind of church, if so let's celebrate and thank God for what he's going to do this year.
[time=3015] Thank you.
[time=3017] Thanks for being that kind of church.
[time=3020] How long have you been coming to Black Hawk and all I will say to that is you are welcome.
[time=3025] What is God's call in the midst of your life right now?
[time=3029] Maybe it's to let go of something that you just won't put down.
[time=3033] Maybe it's to pick something up that you've just refused to touch.
[time=3036] Maybe it's to make a phone call and to give an apology that you've refused to give.
[time=3041] Maybe it's to take a high road in a relationship and be like Jesus in a relationship, even though you haven't been like Jesus in the relationship and you feel like it's too late to be like Jesus in the relationship, it's time to take the high road and take that step and act on God's call for you to be Jesus in the midst of that relationship.
[time=3055] I don't know what it is.
[time=3057] Point you back to Joseph, do you think he understood fully what he was walking into?
[time=3064] Do you have to understand fully what God is up to in your life before you take a step of obedience?
[time=3069] I want you to know that I don't have to understand fully to obey immediately.
[time=3076] I don't have to understand fully to obey immediately.
[time=3082] It's time to obey, to accept God's change and just act on God's call as we walk into
[time=3088] this Christmas season.
[time=3089] Your body has women close your eyes for a moment.
[time=3091] I want to pray over you and give you a chance to respond to what God is up to in your life.
[time=3096] You know what I love about the rest of this story, as your eyes are closed, you're just thinking, God, if you're a believer, if you know Jesus today, then you probably already know what that change is, so act on it in this place today.
[time=3108] What I love in this story that Joseph, did you notice it said he desired not to bring shame to Mary?
[time=3115] He respected the law because laws were pretty brutal about those kinds of things.
[time=3119] He could have ruined Mary's life by law, but he decided not to because he cared about
[time=3126] the law, he cared about people, but he cared about God so much that his love for Mary covered the shame of the situation.
[time=3134] Did you know that's what God's love for you does?
[time=3137] Your situation is pretty shameful.
[time=3139] He said, you don't know me, but I know you're a person and I know we're all full of sin.
[time=3144] We all have sin, and that sin separates us from God.
[time=3149] Me as a pastor, you, no matter what you've done growing up in church, no matter how good we've been, it doesn't matter the best among us, fall short of God's glory because we all sin.
[time=3159] But just like Joseph's love for Mary covered the shame of the situation, God's love does that on a much grander scale.
[time=3166] His love for us, his grace that we don't deserve.
[time=3169] Mercy is not getting what you do deserve.
[time=3171] Grace is getting all the things you don't deserve.
[time=3173] We have both because of Jesus.
[time=3175] God loves you so much that it covers your sin, it covers your shame.
[time=3178] That's why he had to die on that cross because he was the perfect sacrifice that we couldn't be because he lived a sinless life.
[time=3186] We could never live.
[time=3187] He was our high priest who could sympathize with us in all of our struggles because he walked where we walk, yet he did it without sin.
[time=3194] He's the perfect sacrifice we could never be, and then he gave the perfect sacrifice we could never give because he died on the cross.
[time=3202] That's what God with us is all about.
[time=3204] That's why Christmas happened, is because he came to this earth because he knew you would be here in this moment.
[time=3212] He died that brutal death for you, and after three days he walked out of that borrowed tomb that was borrowed because he knew he wasn't going to stay, and out of that grave
[time=3223] not just came Jesus but came the victory over hell, over the grave, over death, and over
[time=3232] your sin.
[time=3233] That is the message of Christmas, that is the message of the gospel, and our call is
[time=3239] to confess with our mouth that Jesus is the Lord, believing that God has raised him from the dead, and Scripture simply reminds us that you shall be saved.
[time=3249] It really is that simple.
[time=3251] That is the gospel message, just about turning away from me trying to save me and turning to him and saying, "I need you to save me because I can't do it on my own."
[time=3261] Verse 24 says, "Joseph got up and did what he was commanded to do."
[time=3267] Maybe your step is to accept that.
[time=3268] You know what I'm not going to do?
[time=3269] I'm not going to lead you in a prayer because prayers don't save anybody.
[time=3273] There's no formula to salvation.
[time=3275] But if I were to ask you today, if you knew that if you were to die today, this was your last day on this earth that you would spend forever in heaven with God because of Jesus.
[time=3283] Could you say, "I know that that's the case in my life?" Maybe you say, "No." Maybe you say, "I've never taken that step and confessed with my mouth." Well today's a beautiful day to do that as we start December 2017.
[time=3294] What better way to start this Christmas season than understanding what the season is all about.
[time=3299] So I want to challenge you.
[time=3300] I'm not going to lead you in a prayer because I think your heart is screaming it.
[time=3302] You say, "I can't say it like you did pastor.
[time=3304] God doesn't want you to say it like I did.
[time=3305] He wants your heart to be poured out before him.
[time=3308] It can be silent.
[time=3309] It can be out loud.
[time=3310] You can walk out of the room.
[time=3311] Whatever you've got to do.
[time=3312] I want to challenge you not to wait.
[time=3314] And if you want to say, "Well, I've got to get a few things together in my life first.
[time=3317] I've got to get a few things lined up and then I'm going to take that step.
[time=3320] Can I tell you it'll never come?" Because we're just a mess.
[time=3325] As long as we're here, we're going to be a mess.
[time=3327] But Jesus came that first Christmas to meet us in the midst of our mess and turn that mess into the message of the gospel to turn your test into the testimony he wants to bring about in your life.
[time=3337] So, would you cry out to Jesus if you don't know him today, tell him that today is the day of salvation.
[time=3342] Ask him to save you from your sin, that you trust him to save you, no longer will I trust me.
[time=3348] And I promise he'll meet you right there.
[time=3349] Well, you do that right now in this place.
[time=3352] I'll head it's bowed.
[time=3356] So God is with you through change.
[time=3359] Especially as we've looked at the story of Joseph today, you have thought about maybe some changes in your life that it's time to accept.
[time=3367] Or maybe it's time to act on some callings that God's put in your life.
[time=3370] If you know Jesus today, I just believe there's a challenge in there for you that God has spoken to you right into the depths of your soul, into your heart, and into the practical day-to-day life that you're trying to live.
[time=3381] So my challenge is embrace the challenge, embrace the change, and act on God's call.
[time=3387] Maybe for you today, the acting on God's call looks something like this that I've been running from this decision to follow Jesus, to accept him as my Savior, to give my life
[time=3398] over to him for salvation.
[time=3400] Maybe you've been running from that and acting on his call today means I've got to take that step of accepting Jesus as my Savior, of saying, "Jesus, I've been trying to save me, but today I want to ask you to save me as we've looked at today." If that is you, my heartbeat, my passion for you, and I want you to know that I have no greater passion in my life and we have no greater passion here at Black Hawk than to see people just like you find Jesus.
[time=3424] I want you to know he was ready to meet you right where you sit.
[time=3427] No matter what you're facing, don't put it off.
[time=3430] Don't wait for things to line up because most likely, logistically, they never will.
[time=3434] But that's the beauty of salvation.
[time=3436] That's the beauty of the gospel.
[time=3438] That's the point of Jesus.
[time=3439] That's the point of Christmas is he's ready to meet you no matter what life looks like, no matter how many things aren't lined up, and so he's ready to do that today.
[time=3447] Push, pause, step away, do what you have to do to ask him to meet you right in the middle of your heart, right in the middle of your life, your circumstances, and I promise you, he will do just that.
[time=3458] If you have taken that step, even if you're just thinking about taking that step, we here at Black Hawk would love nothing more than to walk alongside you on that journey, to show you what's next, not because we're so good, but because Jesus is, and we have a prescription that he's given us for how we follow him and what next steps to take, and so we've even got resources we'd love to get into your hands.
[time=3479] One of those is called beginning steps.
[time=3480] It's a growth guide, a little booklet for new believers that'll just show you what's next.
[time=3485] It'll talk through assurance of salvation, baptism, connection with God's people, prayer, study of God's Word, all of those different elements that are so crucial and vital to our health as followers of Jesus.
[time=3496] We want to walk you through what that looks like.
[time=3498] We'd be glad to mail one of those to your home.
[time=3500] You can pick one up here at our physical location at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=3504] There's going to be some information on your screen, an email address, and a phone number that you can use to reach out to us, and my challenge to you that is this, that as you do reach out, don't just request resources.
[time=3515] Let us know why those resources are needed in your life.
[time=3518] Tell us your story.
[time=3520] We want to know your story.
[time=3521] You have a unique one, and we can't wait to hear it and come alongside you within that story as God continues to write it, even through the changes that life throws our way, and so
[time=3531] I love the story of Joseph.
[time=3532] I also love the story of Mary, and so next week when I invite you back, we're going to not just talk about how God is with us through changes, but also how God is with us through complexities.
[time=3542] Maybe your life feels pretty complex.
[time=3544] Your life feels pretty complicated.
[time=3546] Well, God has compassion for you in all of those complications, and I can't wait to study the story of Mary in the Christmas story so we can see just how God is going to meet you,
[time=3556] even in the complexities, even in the changes of your own life.
[time=3559] So we'll see you next week.
[time=3560] Thanks again for tuning in and allowing us just this time each week to pour into your life through God's Word.
[time=3565] See you then.
