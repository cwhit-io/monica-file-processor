My soul And if I can afford He has done great things for me My soul And if I can afford perspective of the Magi, those wise men that we see in our nativity scenes, and so we're going to be looking in Matthew, the book of Matthew, first book of your New Testament toward the back part of your Bible, Matthew chapter number two. And so I want to welcome you again if you're a part of our extended family watching us online today, maybe you've got your Christmas PJs on, whatever that looks like. We are glad that you're here and a part of our family. It extends far beyond this room. And so what a joy it is to talk about God with us. Matthew chapter
[time=969] two is the perspective that you just heard from just a little bit, but mainly I want to zoom in on the perspective of one of the people that we often overlook and skip over in the Christmas story. We're going to look at Herod's story. And as you find your place in Matthew chapter two, in Matthew chapter one, just after the genealogy of Jesus, we find verse 23, which is the key verse that led us to this focus, the emphasis, the series title of with us, because it goes like this, verse 23 of Matthew one, "Behold the virgin shall conceive and bear son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel." Somebody say Emmanuel, which means God with us. Did you know that God is
[time=1013] with you today? Did you know that he desires to work inside of you today? You may come from a background or you may have questions about God and who he is today. Christmas may mean something totally different to you than what you have heard about thus far in a service where we've sung about how he is with us, but this is the kind of place you can belong before you even believe like we believe. But I want to let you in on my agenda. I do have an agenda for you. Is that okay? You say I don't know. Let me hear it. My agenda for you is that you cannot help but leave this place today but to know that God loves you
[time=1052] but to know that Jesus really is the reason for this Christmas season and to know that he wants to meet you where you are in this Christmas season no matter what you bring to the table this Christmas. Fair enough. So today I want to talk about how God is with us through challenges. Anybody bring those with you today? Challenges. We've looked at how in Joseph's story God is with us through changes. We've looked at Mary's story last week and we've seen that God is with us through complexities but today it's all about the challenges and so in this Christmas story we're going to see the villain of the Christmas story and there are a lot of villains of Christmas aren't there in the movies that we look. I want to show you a few of those. Some of the villains that may be recognized how about this guy. Anybody know who he is? This Scrooge and I preach way better when you talk with me so need your help with these. Everybody's going to know this next guy. Villain of Christmas. Oh the Grinch. It's going to get a little harder though. I think most of you may know this guy too. Who's this guy? Mr. Potter from It's a Wonderful Life. Yes and my favorite villains of a Christmas story or a Christmas movie I think. I thought this week who would top the list and I think it's probably these guys. Oh Harry and Mar from Home
[time=1134] Alone. Who can forget those those people but here's the thing today we're moving from those villains to the real villains of the original Christmas story and so Herod, King Herod known as Herod the Great is at the top of that list. He's the one that we try to read through his story and if you Google him you'll find something like this you wouldn't have recognized that guy would you. But today you're going to be able to recognize him. We're going to look at his story and so as we dig into that he is the conflict of the Christmas story. Herod is the villain the challenge if you will of the Christmas story and here's what I know about all of us in the room as much of a celebration as Christmas is. So many times it's not characterized by the celebration as much as it's characterized by conflict or by challenges or by changes or
[time=1190] by complexities that you would just assume not have associated with your Christmas yet you find yourself in a place where those challenges changes complexities and conflicts are a part of your Christmas reality this year and so I believe today's message is going to be able to encourage you in the midst of your challenges this Christmas and so before we do that you need to get to know Herod with me.
[time=1214] If I want to walk you through a few of Herod's backgrounds his accomplishments his his challenges that he even had on his own and then kind of his significance in the Christmas story and so Herod really was the first stable ruler really and truly he was actually very effective even though we see him as the villain and that he is he was very effective as a king in terms of the job description of what a king should do the first stable ruler he was during the time of the Romans in Judea and so a little bit of his background he came from southern Israel was not Jewish a lot of us may forget that but it's very significant in this story he was not a Jewish person came from the tribe of Esar Edom is the is the way you can know where he came from and so he came into a world a politic world a political world and maneuvered his way to the top with a lot of good relationships and became in fact the governor of Galilee this is the same Galilee that we see that Jesus will one day do a lot of his ministry became the governor of Galilee around 47 BC he was around 25 years of age when that happened very young to be in a position like governing Galilee very successful had a lot of good relationships one of those was in Rome particularly with Caesar Augustus was a very close personal friend we learned from history of this man that we call Herod and why is all this matter we're going to see because all this comes together with a big conflict a big clash that we're going to be looking into some of his accomplishments he was successful effective mainly because he kept peace somehow in Judea in a time when it was very difficult for him to do that he was able to achieve peace one of the ways he did that is he rebuilt the temple for the Jews in Jerusalem and that kind of endeared him to the people of his day and age even though he was not Jewish which was a very interesting tie-in and it's going to come back in this story that you'll see around 40 here's where it kind of gets interesting around 40 BC so about seven years after he became the governor of Galilee he had been politically positioning and maneuvering his way to the top of the food chain if you will with all those relationships but the Roman senate kind of gave Herod the name the king of the Jews you heard that before well there's a new king who was about to come on the scene and I think if I've read right he ends up with the same title so there was a little bit of a threat that would come onto the scene and now you may understand a little bit more of why here's where you're start to maybe relate with Herod he has a lot of crazy family situations going on did you know that as history shows us Herod had at least 10 wives you thought you had some complicated family get togethers now as Herod you should know converted to Judaism history tells us and most historians and theologians will say probably as genuine as it could be of a conversion in his life but he converted to Judaism and if that was the case then you should know about Herod this that for him to have 10 wives he couldn't have them all at once and so that means he had gotten married and gotten divorced and gotten married and gotten divorced over and over doesn't mean it was it was messy can we just say that but here's what happened he became very paranoid the Herod we need in Matthew 2 becomes very paranoid very self-obsessed very self-preserving protecting his throne and he was even worried about his own wives and his own children taking his throne and so he is known in history as one of the most barbaric gruesome murderous people in all of history because he killed his own wives and children so that he could preserve his throne documented throughout history in fact Josephus one of the ways we get a source from which we get some of this history about Herod shows us that even Caesar Augustus sarcastically quipped about Herod at one point said you know it would be better to be a pig in Herod's household than a son and a little bit of sarcasm in that is they probably wouldn't eat you know a pig as a Jew during that time so a pig would even be safer than a son in the household of Herod that's the Herod that we run into in Matthew chapter 2 pretty gruesome guy guy we don't look
[time=1482] at quite a bit but here's the impact those are some of his history background accomplishments and some of his challenges maybe you can relate with some of his challenges but his implication for the Christmas story is this and if you hear if you didn't hear any of that this is the part you should know about here is that his implication for the Christmas story is that he represents what the world was at the time of the original Christmas
[time=1508] story when Jesus came onto the scene but he also I think in so many ways represents the world that surrounds us now the kingdom of man because in your notes you're going to find a key phrase and that key phrase is that Christmas is a clash of kingdoms say that with me Christmas is a clash of kingdoms because the kingdom of man
[time=1530] was winning and ruling the Roman Empire was taking over the world
[time=1536] at this time yet God decided he wanted to bring about a new kingdom
[time=1546] but he brought it about in the most humble of ways a baby lying in the manger wrapped in swaddling clothes and we see a clash with the kingdom of man that by the way is the same kingdom
[time=1560] those same words of those people the kingdom of man that was ruling and reigning at the time of Herod and Herod was a big part of that maneuvering his way into that as a king of the Jews those same words that led to the decree that led Mary and Joseph while she was with child while she was pregnant to travel to Bethelheim for the census shows us how in control the kingdom of man was at this time but God but God came onto the scene and he decided I'm going to establish a new kingdom and so Christmas really when you look at the story of Herod you look at what's happening in history is a clash of kingdoms with that in mind let me read to you the first 23 verses of Matthew chapter 2 where we get the perspective of the magi the wise men that you see in the nativity scenes and you get the perspective of Herod and so I'm just going to read straight through this story now that you've heard some of his background they're going to give you two big applications that we can hopefully take from this story and maybe apply to our own challenges this Christmas season who's ready for the word this morning. Verse 1 Matthew chapter 2 now after Jesus was born in Bethelheim of Judea and the days of Herod the king behold wise men or magi in the gree from the east came to Jerusalem saying
[time=1638] where is he who has been born the king of the Jews remember that for we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him when Herod the king heard this he was troubled now you know why and all Jerusalem with him and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born they told him in Bethelheim of Judea for so it is written by the prophet and you O Bethelheim in the land of Judea are by no means least among the rulers of Judah for from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel
[time=1675] verse 7 then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared and he sent them to Bethelheim saying go and search diligently for the child and when you have found him bring me word that I too may come and worship him verse 9 after listening to the king they went on their way and behold the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was when they saw the star they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy and going into the house they saw
[time=1710] the child with Mary his mother and they fell down and worshiped him then opening their treasures they offered him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh and being warned in a dream not to return to Herod they departed to their own country by another way verse 13 now when they had departed behold an angel of the lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said rise take the child and his mother flee from Egypt and remain there until I tell you for Herod is about to search for the child to destroy him and he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt that all these things are going to come together in a glorious way in just a moment as we dig through it verse 15 continues and he remained there until the death of Herod this was to fulfill what the lord had spoken by the prophet out of Egypt I called my son verse 16 then Herod when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise man became furious somebody say furious some of you came in today and you can identify with Herod because your challenges have gotten you just to that spot and he sent and killed this is the part of Christmas we want to forget but it's one of the dirtiest messiest parts of history that's also a reality of that first Christmas because he was furious he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and all that region that were two years old or under according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise man then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah a voice was heard in Ramah weeping and loud lamentation Rachel weeping for her children she refused to be comforted because they are no more now verse 19 but when Herod died
[time=1812] and so ends the story of this man called Herod behold an angel of the lord
[time=1818] appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt saying rise take the child and his mother go to the land of Israel for those who sought the child's life are dead and he rose and took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel but when he heard that artyles was raining over Judea in a place in place of his father Herod he was afraid to go there and being warned in a dream notice in the theme of that God speaking I believe he's going to do the same to you he was warned in a dream he withdrew to the district of Galilee and he went and lived in a city called Nazareth that was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled he shall be called a Nazarene
[time=1858] a lot of verses a lot of text I want to unpack some of that for you today by literally just looking at two things two things that we can learn about God and how he works in the midst of challenges today so number one is this jot this down if you're taking notes God turns challenges into completions God turns challenges into completions
[time=1880] there's a reason I want to read all 23 of those verses to you and I didn't want to skip through those or do little segments it's because in that passage we see a lot of completions we're going to see a lot more than just that but I think you can apply to your life but let me give you four prophecies you can just circle these in your Bible or jot down what verses they are I'm not going to go back and read them but four prophecies that became completions in the middle of the challenges that we were seeing in the first Christmas season so the prophecy about Bethlehem that was fulfilled in verses five and six of Matthew two Matthew two five and six we saw the prophecy about the significance of Bethlehem being fulfilled it was spoken hundreds of years before Jesus would come onto the scene there were also prophets about Egypt prophecies about Egypt verse 15 we see the fulfillment of that prophecy the third there was prophecy about Herod's massacre that took place in this Christmas story and his verses 17 and 18 we see that being another completion and then last but not least he was to be called an azerine the Savior this Messiah and verse number 23 of Matthew two we see that completion and there's a reason I want to point those out to you
[time=1955] and this week I was just thinking about my kids and we watched some Christmas movies and just how we I think are called to bring a child like faith to Christmas I think Christmas brings a lot of that child like faith out in a lot of us doesn't it's we're a little more hopeful even if it's a hopeless season of life you can't help but at least get a glimpse of a little bit of hopefulness at Christmas it pulls some of that out Otis and so we were watching that character I showed you earlier the Grinch we were watching the Grinch a couple of weeks back with my kids and I'll still remember one thing that my little five-year-old daughter Cali said you're Grinch we watched the Jim Carrey one you know the big smile evil looking guy and so she's five and she's kind of leaning back in her see she had seen him before and she's seen the movie that's the point here she had seen the movie so I looked at her I said he's he's not an early nice guy she said no he's mean and then she said but it's okay he's gonna lose
[time=2015] and I was thinking about that phrase this morning and how maybe it from a five-year-old little girl maybe we could learn something about Christmas because here's what I want to submit to you today when you know the end of the movie when you know the end of the story it changes how you walk through the scenes in the middle and Christmas this time of year reminds us that we have a real enemy who brings about real challenges in our life but to quote my little five-year-old daughter he's going to lose we're reminded this Christmas season that God can take any challenge and turn it into a completion that God who is working inside of you
[time=2057] is going to bring something new to fruition there's going to be some fruit from this pain there's a purpose from the pain that God is working in to bring out inside of your situation and your challenges God can turn any challenge into a completion just like he did with those fulfilled prophecies with the same words of the earthly decrees
[time=2082] of the kingdom of man God maneuvered and put his son
[time=2088] in strategic places that would fulfill prophecy bring about completions and set up a future that only God could have brought about with the same words of the king Herod's with the same words of the Roman Empire the kingdom of man was now about to clash with the kingdom of God God moved in a new kingdom and fulfilled prophecy as he did it and there's a a phrase in your notes I want to point you to and it's this that sometimes the challenges that you face are just channels sometimes the challenges that you face are just the channels that God is going to use to complete the work he's doing inside of you
[time=2131] somebody in this place is going to leave I believe with all of my heart looking at the challenges you face but now not seeing so much a challenge instead of seeing a challenge you're going to start to see a channel that God's going to channel some completions some work inside of you this Christmas season and he's going to bring it to completion just like he did in this Christmas story because God finishes what he starts
[time=2157] my God doesn't leave anything incomplete my God finishes what he starts the Apostle Paul said it this way in Philippians chapter 1 and verse 6 he said and I am sure of this that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ and I want you to know people today even though you may be waiting until the day of Jesus Christ and it may feel like it is a long way off God even today even in the midst of your challenges is working right now in your heart and in your life in your changes in your complexities in your circumstances in your challenges to bring out some completions that I believe he's even going to let you see glimpses of right now but no matter what you see what glimpses of hope what glimpses of completion you can know just like we learn about the grant he's going to lose just like we know by reading the end of this book this collection of writings called the Bible he's going to lose will this enemy of ours and you can have hope this Christmas season that should cause somebody to shout in this place because somebody needs that hope we all need that hope because we all have our challenges and God's going to finish what he started inside of you somebody's dreading a Christmas gathering today or tomorrow or this week somebody's dreading going because it's filled with conflict
[time=2243] somebody's dreading going into this holiday break at Christmas because all you're going to do is fight with your kids you dread having that conversation at Christmas because it's just going to be challenging but in the middle of those challenges God's working just like Herod when in verse 16 he became furious verse 16 reminds us here's the thing as a converted Jew Herod should have seen he should have seen he should have known that the Messiah was coming bringing purpose bringing completion bringing peace but here's why he couldn't see it he was blinded by the fact that he couldn't get off of his own throne it was all about who was going to be king that Christmas and Herod didn't want to do anything but defend his throne and instead he should have seen the completion of a new throne and a new kingdom and we get to live in light of that fact that's why we can take hope and take heart this Christmas season here's what I want you to know there's some Herod in all of us look at somebody and say I see a little Herod I just made somebody's Christmas in this place didn't I you've been waiting to say
[time=2314] that and you the pastor said it there's a little Herod in all of us today and a lot of times I think it shows the most when we reject
[time=2326] the kingship of Jesus when we refuse to give up our
[time=2332] our throne but I remind you again that Christmas is about a clash of kingdoms
[time=2338] because a new king entered history a new king entered the scene and that may scare and terrify some of you but I want you to know you should be able to take heart in that very fact because this new king wants nothing but your best interests he has good plans for you plans to prosper you and give you a future and a hope does that mean that you won't have challenges does that mean you won't have Herod moments in your life absolutely not but now you have a new king that's clashed with the kingdom of man the kingdom of God has come and it changes how you look at everything that happens in and through the kingdom of man no Herod can hurt you apart from the
[time=2377] hand of God allowing it even the Herod within you can't tear you down apart from the hand of God showing you that same compassion and so here's the thing you should know if Jesus is king Herod's not king if Jesus is Lord then Caesar Augustus
[time=2399] is not Lord if he's the king of kings and the Lord of Lords this Jesus you ready for this that means you aren't the king or the Lord
[time=2413] that's the hard part of Christmas sometimes is to say here's the throne
[time=2419] and so today I challenge you to ask yourself this question who's the king of Christmas what is God working to complete in you through your challenges number two not only does God turn challenges into completions God also turns challenges into chances how many of you know we serve a God who's a god of second chances some of you came today looking for grace wondering has God given up on me we serve a God who can turn challenges any challenge yes yours can turn challenges into chances and we see a bunch of different chances that are given in this story and so I want to walk you through a few of those the first one are chances to hear somebody say here chances to hear we see that in the way that God communicates through angels and dreams particularly in this story Matthew 2 I'm going to give you four just like there are four prophecies that will were fulfilled I want to give you four ways that people heard from God the first is in Matthew 2 and verse 12 and it's the magis the wise men as we call them they hear from God and say don't go back to Herod and so they went back a different way to their country so they heard from God Joseph and Mary or the next three the second one is in Matthew 2 13 and it's Joseph and Mary and Bethlehem about going to Egypt the third is Joseph and Mary in Egypt about going to Israel and those fulfilled prophecies they were a part of those completions but they were also chances that they had to hear from God and listen to what God wanted to say in their lives the last one was why Joseph and Mary were in Egypt in verse 22 of Matthew 2 about going to Galilee going to Nazareth and that led to the completion of that prophecy can I ask you a question what is it that God wants you to hear from him this Christmas I believe you got a chance to hear from God in this place today
[time=2541] what is it that God wants you to hear from him this Christmas and I want you to know it's probably a whisper God often speaks through a still small voice not a big loud booming angel or dream though he can certainly do that as he pleases because he's God and we're not but a lot of times we hear from God in a still small voice and I love that God whispers to us because a whisper implies that he's close enough for us to hear can somebody hear me today somebody needed to hear that today that God's close enough he is with us that's why he can whisper that's why he can speak to you in a still small voice with your chance to hear him today is because he didn't leave you or forsake you he's not a million miles away like maybe you feel like he is in the midst of your challenges he's close enough so that you can hear him in the form of a whisper you've got a chance to hear from that God today we have a chance to hear Herod missed his chance to hear he wasn't jewish we've learned about that but in verse two that phrase king of the jews was a big threat to Herod because the roman senate gave him the title king of the jews who is this king of the jews and if it's going to be a baby while i wipe out all the babies and that's exactly what he did when he became furious because there was a big threat because if there's a new king of the jews then that means this new kingdom remember clash of kingdoms that means this new kingdom of god that would be a threat not only to the jews that would be a threat not only to my kingship that would be a threat to Caesar Augustus that would be a threat to Rome that would be a threat to the entire kingdoms of the world if such a kingdom entered the scene and so he was rightly afraid and rightly furious if you looked at things from the perspective of the kingdoms of man because god came to dethrone every king and that's why today you should know our hope though we submit to though we pray for though we speak into the light with light the government
[time=2652] and how we are arranged as a nation our hope doesn't lie in a government to provide what we need our hope lies in the new king the kingdom of god who has come to take away the sins of the world
[time=2666] somebody in this place this christmas your hope is tied up in what other people and what it may be a government or a king or a kingdom of men can do for you your hope shouldn't be there because you have something much greater to put your hope in it's the kingdom of god and jesus who came to build it and when he built that kingdom he said i'm gonna build my church and the gates of hell won't even be able to prevail against it he's going to lose will this enemy of ours
[time=2696] that's the message of christmas that's your chance to hear this christmas season that's the clash of kingdoms that we read about in
[time=2706] this story let me talk about chances to hope it's not just chances to hear but chances to hope somebody needs some hope this christmas somebody feels very hopeless because
[time=2721] of the challenges that you find yourself facing i want nothing more today than to you than for you to believe this place believing not me don't believe me i'll fail you sometimes people put pastors on a pedestal and think we're perfect i'm so far from perfect you just you just don't even know don't believe me believe jesus that's my hope is that somebody will leave this place believing jesus that he hasn't given up that all hope is not lost you have a chance to hope christmas is your chance
[time=2756] to hear christmas is your chance to hope somebody's going to leave here hoping again it's time to hope again look at somebody say hope again hope again because sometimes hope seems far-fetched and you can't reach it you can't grab it but this is your chance to hope again because god hasn't given up he's got hope for you in the midst of your hopelessness today there's hope in the midst of your hurt there's hope in the midst of your hurt that you're afraid of walking into at the family gathering coming up you know those places don't act like your family's not as complex as mine we all have hurts we all have relationships why because there's people every time i go to a christmas gathering people are there and they mess it all up
[time=2808] and then i look in the mirror and it gets even worse because there's a lot of hair it in me but in the midst of that hurt there's hope christmas is your chance to hope again and i want to give you a a challenging message today about your pain and about the hurt and it's to not allow the pain to cause you to miss the purpose it's to not allow maybe what you've lost detract from what you still have
[time=2844] and the biggest challenge of all is this is that sometimes my greatest challenge
[time=2850] is me for me i would say it this way almost all the time okay all the time my greatest challenge is me everywhere i go there i am i can run i can hide i can put a mask on i can do my best church smile
[time=2871] show them your best church smile those of you know what i'm talking about that church smile you put on when you come in church doesn't matter what happened in the parking lot but you're gonna say hey brother and sister and put on that smile you can put on your best church smile but still the challenges you face are going to be with you they're not going away but there's a way to have hope in the midst of those challenges and so my challenge to you is this there's a little here in you maybe it's time to confront the here in you this christmas maybe it's time to stop letting your faults
[time=2904] cause you to define yourself as a failure if jesus let me submit something to you if that's you if you still see you as a failure if jesus can look past your failures and your mess being the perfect spotless lamb of god who is the son of god who came to take away the sins of the world who lived a sinless life that you and i could never live if he can look at you and not define you by your failures do you think maybe you should be able to do the same thing maybe it's time to confront that Herod inside of you what's your Herod maybe it's time to realize that god is with us that god is with you and if god
[time=2946] is with you then that means he's within you and maybe you're defined less by what happens to you and more by what is happening in you and who has been deposited to you scripture tells us as soon as we come to know jesus through a personal relationship with him we're given this deposit a guarantee a stamp a seal that marks us as his and john chapter 10 if you think you can
[time=2972] lose that because of how big of a knucklehead you are i wrestled with that for many years can i lose my salvation did i really get saved and then i read john 10 and i'm reminded where god says nothing can snatch us from the hands of our father
[time=2988] you're his maybe this christmas it's time to confront the Herod and you and stop letting your failures define you as a failure but instead as a saint yes i said a saint i know you looked at somebody and said not me i'm not a saint and somebody just looked at you and i know
[time=3009] you know what though we don't act like saints very often but when we know jesus the message of christmas is that jesus being with us us laying our life down for him now you don't just get that because it happened there's a step we've got to take and i'm going to give you an opportunity to take that step there's a surrender that happens a step of surrender where we have to say god this is not my life anymore i can't save me my life is now yours i turn away from me and i turn to you jesus now when we do that though we're defined by this god with us this Emmanuel that's what defines us and we go from the center that was to the saint that god's making that's the message of christmas that's why you can hope in the midst of your hurt this christmas season so maybe it's time for you you're ready for this some of you at your christmas gathering this coming up this week it's time to shift from grumpy to grateful and stop being grumpy about what's not happening and start being grateful for what is because god does still love you and he has not given up on you and here's what we see the comparison of Herod and jesus Herod left us with ruins
[time=3083] with a museum there is in fact a museum in Jerusalem Israel that has artifacts and memories and pictures and i don't know if that one we showed you is that or not doesn't really matter to me you can put whatever picture because all he left us is a museum you know what though where Herod left ruins jesus left the church where Herod left a museum jesus left a timeless message that changes the course
[time=3112] of history and eternity that's what christmas is all about and i want you to know today that the promise of christmas is not the promise of christmas is not the absence of challenges
[time=3126] the promise of christmas is the presence of christ the promise of christmas is not that your challenges go away but that jesus is going to walk with you through those challenges he's with us through challenges christmas is a clash of kingdoms who is your king this christmas when i asked you just to bow your heads with me close your eyes nobody look around just reflect on that question for a moment most important part of our service is right now because here's the thing we could give the best service possible i could preach the best sermon i could ever preach for you but if it doesn't go home with you then what does it matter why do we gather so i want to give you a chance to respond not to me but to him to this Emmanuel to this jesus if you're a christian if you call yourself a believer a follower of jesus then what challenges does god need to walk you through what completions is he bringing about what communication is he giving to you in this season what challenge is he now about to turn into a chance chance for you to hear chance for you to hope somebody's here though and you would say i don't have that hope because i haven't taken that step of surrender that you've referenced today this christmas is the best time ever why because it's this christmas no because it's now and because we're not promised tomorrow this could be your last christmas or last christmas dare i say could be your last christmas
[time=3220] you may not make it to this christmas that's not our plan but the question must be answered and will be answered is who have i trusted as my king what kingdom has won in my life
[time=3234] who do i believe in to save me that's the point of christmas is that you have a god who is a manual he is god with us he came for you he came from sinners read his genealogy but yet he was without sin he didn't sin like all the rest of the people in his genealogy he came from sinners because he came for sinners and that's you and that's me when he went to that cross after living a sinless life that you couldn't live and i couldn't live he died a death paying a penalty that we could not pay
[time=3269] because we're so far from god's standard of perfection so far it's one of the things that makes us all on the same boat we all need jesus but he did die on the cross and while he was
[time=3283] on that cross paying that price for you and for me you were on his mind and then he went to a tomb many people thought they would lock him up in there and he would stay in there forever but he was only borrowing the tomb because three days later the stone was rolled away and out of that grave came this jesus who came that first christmas as a little baby to be a manual to be god with us so that today you could be sitting in this place hearing the message of christmas knowing that this little baby who came didn't just come to change history he came to change your eternity and he did that when he died on the cross for you and now your part in that is not to pay that price you can't pay it's to accept it it's a gift it's grace it's by grace through faith you have been saved not of works because if it was of works that means we did it that means we could boast about it he already paid the price the good news of the gospel means he already won the victory it's time today to stop fighting for that victory and fight from that victory for you if you don't know jesus if i were to ask you today if you were to die today do you know you'd spend forever with jesus in heaven somebody in here i believe is saying i would like to know that but i don't know that i believe god's working inside of you right now he's asking you to take a step a surrender it'll be the best christmas you could possibly have to walk into it as a saved child of the king of kings and the lord of lords and you're saying enough tell me about it i'm ready god's working in me i just don't know how to say it like you said it pastor that's the beauty is god doesn't want you to say it like i said it he doesn't want me to say it you don't even have to be in a church to take the step it's about your heart being offered up to him and saying jesus i do need you to save me to forgive me i give you me will you in your own words from your heart to him in this place if that is you if he's stirring that inside you will you cry out to him where you sit right now in this place and your christmas is going to change your eternity we do that right now
[time=3417] there's a little bit of Herod in all of us perhaps today you've seen that there's
[time=3424] a little bit of Herod in you and maybe god has been at work inside of you maybe even within the challenges that you face he is with us through challenges and our greatest challenge so many times is ourself it's me my greatest challenge is me perhaps you've realized today that you are your biggest challenge but today there's good news for you doesn't matter how big that challenge is god is willing to meet you in the middle of those challenges in the middle of your sin just as we've discussed today he is lord he is bigger his grace abounds so much more than does your sin that's why he went to the cross for you that's why he paid that price you couldn't pay after living the sinless life you couldn't live so that he could pay for your sins to wash you as wide as snow even though we don't see that picture looking back at us in the mirror that's what he sees when we give our lives to Jesus because he rose from the dead he didn't stay consumed by death he defeated death he defeated your sin when he rose from the dead and salvation really is as simple as turning away from me trying to save me and saying Jesus i need you to save me will you forgive me and i promise you if you'll ask him in your own words from your heart to him he will do just that take time today to make sure you take that step if you've been holding off if you've been waiting make sure that today's the day of your salvation and yes despite what the enemy may be whispering in your ear right now today can be that day and i believe it will if you'll just take that moment if that is you we have lots of resources lots of next steps that we would love to help you with we've got a booklet that i'd love to get into your hands called beginning steps a growth guide for you believers and we would love to put that into your hands through the mail through dropping it off as you come by our church here whatever is more convenient for you several ways you can get in touch with us as we've discussed but one of those is by reaching out to us through the email address or phone number that's going to be on your screen please use that to let us know what God's up to in your life tell us your story and we will do nothing more nothing less than just walk beside you in every way that we possibly can thanks as always for tuning in giving us a little bit of the time of your week that we know is precious and valuable we can't wait to see what God is up to in your life to hear from you to know your story and to walk with you as we can God bless you and i hope to see you next week
[time=3577] you
