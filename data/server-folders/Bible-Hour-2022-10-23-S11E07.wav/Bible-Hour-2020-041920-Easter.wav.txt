[time=1] - Well, happy Resurrection Sunday.
[time=3] I am so, so honored.
[time=6] It is truly my joy to be able to welcome all of you from around the world right now into today's message of hope for the Resurrection.
[time=16] We've been singing about it all day.
[time=18] I wanna welcome all of you joining us online through all of our social media platforms, through our website, our app.
[time=25] Welcome to Blackhawk, but more importantly, welcome to Resurrection Sunday to God's church.
[time=31] I wanna specifically welcome those of you who found us through our partnership with Star 883.
[time=37] So however you're listening on their app, website, or on the radio all around the world, welcome to Hope today, because Hope is here and his name is Jesus.
[time=50] My name is Pastor Kevin Rivers.
[time=51] I get the privilege and the honor of pastoring here at Blackhawk Ministries, but more importantly, I get the privilege and honor to proclaim the good news of the Resurrection that Jesus is risen today to all who will hear the good news of the gospel all around the world.
[time=69] I am just so pleased to be able to share with you this message of hope.
[time=75] And so today as we turn in our Bibles to Luke 24, it's the Resurrection story today.
[time=80] I wanna say something to you, no matter how you're celebrating, would you have ever dreamed Easter would look like it does today?
[time=88] No matter how you're celebrating, and let me say this, no matter if you're celebrating, some of you may have found us through one of our partnerships, one of these avenues to hear today's messages, and you're not really here to celebrate, you're here to search, you're here to seek, you're here to try and see if there is any hope you can latch onto on this Easter Sunday.
[time=110] We call Resurrection Sunday.
[time=112] I welcome you and we're glad you are here.
[time=115] However you're here, I believe it's on purpose, and I welcome you to what God is doing.
[time=121] And on our website, no matter how you're watching, I'm gonna encourage you today to whatever venue you have to chat with us, whatever venue you have as a comment section, whatever venue you can respond, please do so.
[time=133] I'm gonna say comment this or shout it if you're listening on the radio in your car, but let's do so together.
[time=139] Let's go on this journey together today, and blackhopministries.org/prayer is a place you can go from any device anywhere in the world, and we have people, leaders, elders, deacons, pastors, staff, ready to speak with you, ready to chat with you, ready to help you if you have needs, ready to just communicate if you need a connection today.
[time=158] Welcome to Sunday.
[time=160] We said on Friday, the day we reflect on the sacrifice of Jesus, that Sunday is coming.
[time=167] And I'm here to announce that Sunday is here, and God's mercies are new every single morning.
[time=174] And I wanna preach to you today about the potential for a pandemic, the potential for a pandemic.
[time=181] I gotta admit, I never would have dreamed I would be preaching such a sermon on an Easter Sunday to an empty auditorium.
[time=188] But life has a way of throwing curveballs, and perhaps those curveballs have brought you to this moment.
[time=195] I believe with all of my heart today that God has massive potential for you, even in the season of chaos and of pain.
[time=204] Yes, potential in a pandemic.
[time=207] No matter what you bring to the table today, Luke 24, the first nine verses, if you've got your Bibles, pull up your apps, and let's go on a journey together.
[time=215] And we've been saying here at Blackhawk that we believe this about church, but today I wanna proclaim that Easter cannot be canceled.
[time=223] Church cannot be canceled.
[time=225] Because church is not a place.
[time=228] Church is a people.
[time=229] Church is not a building.
[time=231] It is a body.
[time=232] The church has left the building.
[time=233] We've been deployed.
[time=235] Church is not a facility.
[time=236] It is a family.
[time=238] And even though our auditoriums, even though our buildings are empty today, we are bound together because of the fact that so is the grave.
[time=248] The grave is empty today.
[time=250] And because of that, we have hope.
[time=252] We have potential.
[time=253] And as God spoke to me this week as I've prayed for you and I don't even, we may have never met.
[time=259] You may be hearing my voice for the first time today.
[time=263] But I believe this is a divine appointment for me to do two words that God has really laid on my heart today and it's this proclaim potential.
[time=272] Because God still has potential for you in your life because of the hope of the resurrection.
[time=278] So let me speak to this today as we determine whether or not we are resurrection ready.
[time=282] Can I ask you today, are you resurrection ready?
[time=285] Maybe you say I don't know.
[time=287] And I wanna give you a few reasons why we can and why we do here at Black Hawk believe in the resurrection.
[time=294] It starts with the fact that it's proclaimed in the word of God, but even if you're not sure how you feel about the word of God this Easter and you've been brought here and you're wondering how you can know the truth.
[time=305] I believe we can know the truth.
[time=307] We can know the way.
[time=308] We can know Jesus.
[time=309] We can believe in the resurrection because eyewitnesses have passed it down for centuries starting with this tax collector named Matthew.
[time=318] And then came this Greek named Mark who documented the accounts of Peter who walked and talked with Jesus and who saw the empty tomb.
[time=327] Then a Greek doctor named Luke recorded this orderly account for Theophilus that he may believe and little did he know that it would be here today as eyewitness account handed down through the centuries so we could believe, so we could find potential even in this pandemic.
[time=342] Peter declared it.
[time=343] My personal favorite is that James the brother of Jesus declared that his own brother is Lord.
[time=349] Let me ask you what would it take for you to proclaim that your brother is Lord?
[time=353] Well James who didn't even necessarily believe everything that Jesus said he was during his ministry because of the resurrection and following the resurrection.
[time=363] He gave his life to proclaim that the resurrection was real and that his brother Jesus is Lord and he in fact was stoned because of that belief as he became the pastor of the church of Jesus in Jerusalem.
[time=377] We believe today that the resurrection is true because Paul who persecuted Christians proclaimed it and he proclaimed the power of the resurrection.
[time=387] And today before we get to Luke chapter number 24, Paul said it this way, that same Paul in Philippians three verses 10 and 11, he says that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and may share in his sufferings becoming like him in his death that by any means possible, I may attain the resurrection from the dead.
[time=410] You may have not expected Easter would look like it looks right now for you in this place, in this moment today, but I believe today is a divine appointment and I believe with all of my heart that our expectation is what will now determine our experience.
[time=425] And so I ask you with that in mind, what are you expecting today?
[time=429] Do you expect to hear from God?
[time=432] I wanna declare to you today, proclaim to you today, God has potential for your life.
[time=438] And it all is possible because of this resurrection of Jesus, he is risen.
[time=443] Are you resurrection ready?
[time=445] Are you expected today?
[time=446] Because if you're expectant, I know, I believe, I promise you will experience the word of God in your life because he's got a word for you.
[time=457] Why? Because what fear sees as an obstacle.
[time=459] Maybe you've been living afraid.
[time=461] What fear sees as an obstacle, faith sees as an opportunity.
[time=465] And we see this opportunity even through death in Luke 24.
[time=468] Let's go there together.
[time=470] If you're with me in the comments or in your cars or in your homes all around the world, by the way, thank you for having me over wherever that may be.
[time=477] Today, I wanna invite you into this.
[time=479] And if you're ready for the word of God today, type in those comments, say it out loud, amen.
[time=484] Say I'm ready today.
[time=485] Luke 24 verses one through nine.
[time=487] This is Sunday morning, the resurrection Sunday of Easter.
[time=491] I'm gonna read to you from the English standard version today.
[time=493] And verse one of Luke 24 says, "But on that first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared, and they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.
[time=506] But when they went in, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
[time=511] While they were perplexed." That's a good word for us today.
[time=514] While they were perplexed about this, behold two men stood by them in dazzling apparel.
[time=520] And as they were frightened, another good word for us today.
[time=523] And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, why do you seek the living among the dead?
[time=532] He is not here, but has risen.
[time=535] Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee that the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and crucified and on the third day rise.
[time=546] And they remembered his words, verse nine, and returning, underlying that, circle that.
[time=554] Make a mental note of that.
[time=555] And returning from the tomb, they told all these things to the 11 and to all the rest.
[time=563] May God bless the reading of his word, especially on Resurrection Sunday about the resurrection of our risen King, Jesus Christ.
[time=571] Today I wanna give you from that passage from those nine verses for things that the resurrection means for me.
[time=577] Number one, write these down.
[time=579] Take notes, you can use our app to do so, however you do it.
[time=582] Let's remember these things.
[time=583] Number one, resurrection means I can release my baggage.
[time=591] This comes from verse one.
[time=593] And maybe you, like these ladies who went back to the tomb, have brought some baggage with you today.
[time=599] Because in verse one, it says that after the Sabbath, because the Sabbath has previously happened, it was a Saturday.
[time=605] And the body of Jesus, that Friday evening was laid in the tomb.
[time=610] They had gone to prepare spices.
[time=612] And they took the whole day of Saturday by law off of doing so because they had to wait 'til the next day to get past the Sabbath.
[time=619] But then they bring, verse one, they bring, on that first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared.
[time=628] Though spices represented the embalming of the body, they had ointments, they had spices, they were gonna do the traditional things that they would typically do to have a body laid to rest in a tomb.
[time=640] But I think those spices represented a little bit more.
[time=644] I think those spices represented their trials.
[time=647] I think those spices in that ointment represented their troubles.
[time=651] I think it represented the trajectory of their life that they were deathly afraid of, because they had heard Jesus say these things, yet he was in a tomb.
[time=662] And so we often skip right past, verse one, but today I wanna challenge you to answer the question, what did you bring with you to the table?
[time=670] What have you brought with you in this moment?
[time=673] What baggage do you have that maybe, just maybe you need to release today?
[time=679] I wanna declare over your life that resurrection means you can release your baggage.
[time=683] You can put it down as they brought all of those spices that was their trouble, tragedy, trauma, and the trajectory they saw themselves going.
[time=691] Because of the resurrection, little did they know they would be able to lay it all down and to move forward in a new direction.
[time=699] So what are you carrying today?
[time=701] What are you carrying around?
[time=703] What trauma did you bring with you into Easter?
[time=706] What death are you dealing with as we look into this day of life?
[time=712] God has a message for you as we look at the potential because hear me today church, hear me today my friends, my family, I feel bags dropping in people's lives in this moment.
[time=722] I feel weight being lifted because the resurrection is real.
[time=727] We can release our baggage, our past, our traumas.
[time=732] It doesn't mean they're not there.
[time=733] It doesn't mean we forget them, but it means we are set free from them and we have a load bearer named Jesus Christ who carries them with us today.
[time=743] That's what the resurrection means for me.
[time=745] And maybe you, like the ladies who went to the tomb, are in a place of desperation today.
[time=750] Maybe that's why you have come to this place, but today I declare that desperation is a set up for revelation.
[time=757] God is ready to reveal Himself to you through His resurrection.
[time=762] And I wanna tell you today, friends, God is not afraid of your fear.
[time=767] And He proved that on this resurrection Sunday today.
[time=770] And it's because of number two that we can continue this process.
[time=773] Verse one, we see that resurrection simply means I can release my baggage.
[time=777] Number two, resurrection means I can realize what I've missed.
[time=782] Maybe you've been missing something about the resurrection.
[time=785] Maybe you've been missing something about what God is trying to teach you in this season, but because Jesus is alive, the resurrection means that I can realize what I miss.
[time=794] This comes from verses two through five, because in verses two through four, here's what happened.
[time=800] What they figured was not what they found.
[time=803] How many of you figured we would have Easter happening at social distancing, physical distancing?
[time=810] How many of you figured Easter would look like it does for you right now?
[time=814] Well, you can relate with these ladies because they found three things that they did not figure they would find in verses two, three, and four.
[time=822] In verses two, three, and four, what they figured is not what they found.
[time=826] Number one, they figured they would find the stone in place, the body in the grave, and it to be completely silent so they could go in and prepare the body.
[time=836] But instead, verse two, they found the stone rolled away.
[time=838] Verse three, they found as they went in the tomb that it was empty and there was no body there.
[time=843] And in verse four, they found two men in dazzling apparel who were angels to proclaim that he is risen.
[time=849] He's not here because he is alive.
[time=853] In verse five, it says they were frightened.
[time=855] I bet they were.
[time=856] Maybe you're frightened today and you can relate with them.
[time=860] And I believe this about life that when what you figured isn't what you find, you often find yourself in fear.
[time=868] And that's exactly where we find ourselves in this season of pandemic, in this season of COVID-19, in this Easter Sunday of 2020, what we figured is not what we found and the same was true for them.
[time=881] We didn't figure we'd find our nation in this state, but I believe God is trying to help us find something through our fear and to be a nation on our knees during this time.
[time=890] And I believe that God wants it to start with you and with me.
[time=894] Have you ever said it's not supposed to be this way?
[time=897] Have you ever said, well, I never would have dreamed.
[time=901] Maybe that's where you're coming from today.
[time=903] You never would have dreamed your life would be in the situation that it is.
[time=907] And that probably goes way deeper, way deeper than simply COVID-19, isolation in your home.
[time=916] Probably has to do with your relationships.
[time=918] It probably has to do with struggles.
[time=920] It probably has to do with traumas from your past that you've never dealt with.
[time=924] And when I say release baggage, that doesn't even seem possible to you.
[time=927] But today I pray God will help you realize something new.
[time=931] Going back to before the crucifixion in Matthew 16, Matthew 16 and verse 22, verse 21, we see that Jesus had began to tell the disciples at this point of his ministry that he must die and suffer and that he would be raised to life on the third day.
[time=948] But in verse 22, Peter, leave it to Peter, big mouth Peter.
[time=952] I can relate with Peter.
[time=953] Does your mouth ever get in your way?
[time=955] Mine too, Peter said me as well.
[time=957] Verse 22 of Matthew 16, it says, "And Peter took him aside being Jesus and began to rebuke him.
[time=963] First of all, any time you think you're in a place to be able to rebuke your creator, the perfect son of God, you're in trouble already." But Peter did that.
[time=973] He did that kind of thing often.
[time=974] But he rebuked him saying, "Far be it from you, Lord.
[time=978] This shall never," at home, right in the comments, say it out loud, never.
[time=982] I never would have dreamed I'd be here.
[time=984] He said, "This shall never happen to you." And the Greek word for never is like a double negative.
[time=991] It's ume, it's ume, it's like no never.
[time=995] It's a double emphatic negative that no way, know how, ume, know never would this ever happen to you.
[time=1003] Probably in your life today, you have some ume moments.
[time=1006] I never would have thought this.
[time=1009] We never would have thought Easter would look like this.
[time=1011] I never would have thought my marriage would have fallen apart.
[time=1014] I never would have thought I will never, maybe you've ever said that before.
[time=1017] I will never raise my kids like those people.
[time=1020] I used to say things like that too.
[time=1022] I'd say I would never raise my kids that way.
[time=1024] And then you know what happened? I had kids my own.
[time=1028] I've got three.
[time=1029] And you know, I realized that those nevers, I said, that they kind of fall short.
[time=1033] Some of you would say today that I never would have gotten into addiction.
[time=1039] I will never struggle with pornography.
[time=1042] I'll never get a divorce.
[time=1045] I'll never struggle financially like my parents or my grandparents.
[time=1049] I'll never have this struggle with addiction.
[time=1052] I'll never get to this kind of a place.
[time=1056] Ume, no never.
[time=1057] You may have said, Ume, you me, but not me.
[time=1062] As we look at this Greek word that is so strong and that is so what we do in life, we never think we would end up in the places that we actually end up.
[time=1071] But it's in those moments where God wants to help you realize something new and it's possible because of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=1081] So no matter what your nevers may have looked like and how they may have fallen apart, I want to show you God's never.
[time=1086] Are you ready for this?
[time=1087] Hebrews 13-5, the end of the verse there, we see that God's never is different.
[time=1092] Our nevers let us down.
[time=1094] Our nevers fall apart.
[time=1096] Our nevers don't look like we thought they would, but God says to you at the end of verse five of Hebrews 13, I will never, same Greek word, Ume, no never, emphatic.
[time=1106] It is finished.
[time=1107] It is done, I will never leave you nor forsake you and maybe just maybe this is something that you've been missing in your life and the resurrection today is gonna help you realize what you have been missing.
[time=1121] God will never leave us or forsake us.
[time=1125] In Luke 24, the same chapter we're at today, following the resurrection a few days later, some travelers were going away from Jerusalem, running away from the problem and the trauma that they had experienced.
[time=1136] In verse 21 of Luke 24, Jesus met them going the wrong way.
[time=1141] Aren't you glad Jesus meets us even when we go the wrong way?
[time=1145] Before he turns us around, in verse 21 of Luke 24, they say to Jesus, yeah, but we had hoped.
[time=1152] We had hoped he was the one to redeem Israel.
[time=1156] You ever had the we had hoped moments?
[time=1158] Well, I had hoped that the medication would be working by now.
[time=1161] I had hoped that my diagnosis could be changed by now.
[time=1165] I had hoped that my marriage would have come back together by now.
[time=1169] I had hoped you fill in the blank, but Jesus meets us on those had hoped moments, those nevers that got blown up and reminds us, helps us realize that the resurrection means that we can find what we have been looking for and what we've been missing.
[time=1188] Even in fearful times, God wants you to see what you've missed.
[time=1191] And in verse five, the angel asked them this very important question.
[time=1194] I don't want to spend some time here.
[time=1196] Why do you seek the living among the dead?
[time=1199] I think that's what some of us do in life.
[time=1201] We end up seeking the living among the dead.
[time=1204] We're looking for the right things, but we're looking in the wrong places.
[time=1208] Why do you seek the living among the dead?
[time=1212] The angel asks them, he's saying to them, if he's not in a dead place, why are you in a dead place?
[time=1218] It's a good word for us today.
[time=1220] Death is something we're keenly aware of in a season as we're isolating, as we're physically distancing.
[time=1227] And oftentimes finding ourselves very fearful of a virus during this season.
[time=1231] We're reminded of the frailty and the brevity of human life, but sometimes that fear will cause us to seek good things like acceptance and purpose and hope and meaning and confidence, but we'll look for them in dead places.
[time=1245] The angel is telling these ladies and God is telling you on this Resurrection Sunday, don't look for the right things in the wrong places.
[time=1252] The angel is saying to us today, if Jesus is not here because he has risen, don't you be dwelling in these places of death, look for him in the places of life and you will find him there.
[time=1265] Resurrection means if he got up, I can get up too.
[time=1269] And I'm glad to know that today, because some days it doesn't feel easy to get up, but because he got up, I can too.
[time=1276] Romans chapter eight and verse 11, in the new living translation reminds us of this where it says the spirit of God, who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you.
[time=1289] That same power that raised him up lives and dwells in us as God's children.
[time=1294] And because he lives, I cannot just face tomorrow, but I can seek him and find him in all of the right places today.
[time=1303] How many of you at home would say that you were talking about realizing stuff that we've missed, but as a student, you don't really miss much.
[time=1311] How many of you would say, I'm the A student in the house, look at each other, whoever you're with today, identify who's the A student, the one who never misses anything, point at him.
[time=1320] Don't touch him, but point at him.
[time=1322] You never miss anything.
[time=1324] Well, I've missed some things as a student before.
[time=1327] I don't know about you.
[time=1327] I remember a time when I was pursuing my master's degree with Liberty University, and I was prepared for this huge project.
[time=1334] And this project was a massive portion of my grade.
[time=1337] And so I was prepared, I worked really hard on the project, I was proud to turn the project in, and I sent it in, and then in conversing with the professor, I realized that his four words changed the trajectory of my coursework.
[time=1351] I turned it in, I was so proud, I couldn't wait to hear his feedback.
[time=1354] And you know what he said, here's his four words.
[time=1357] Great content, wrong assignment.
[time=1362] Yep, I had done the complete wrong assignment.
[time=1366] I was doing the right effort, with the right effort, the right things, but I did the wrong assignment.
[time=1372] Now, he was gracious to me and allowed me to go back and do the right assignment and fix my grade.
[time=1378] But I wonder sometimes, especially in seasons of trials, when I believe God wants to show us through our troubles, what his plan is perhaps the most in our lives.
[time=1387] I wonder if we're doing a lot of the right things, but doing them for the wrong reasons.
[time=1391] I wonder if we're seeking the living among the dead.
[time=1394] I wonder if we miss the voice of God, and if he were to look at us right now, would he maybe just maybe say to us, great content, wrong assignment?
[time=1404] I believe today God wants to help you realize what you've been missing.
[time=1408] So you can work on the right assignment.
[time=1410] Here's the right voice in this season.
[time=1412] And he will change your life in powerful ways, just like those who went to the tomb.
[time=1419] Great content, wrong assignment.
[time=1420] And I wanna tell you today, that some of you are looking for acceptance in the wrong people.
[time=1425] I've often taught that naming rights were only given to the Father.
[time=1428] Today we would say that is sexist, but that was the reality in antiquity.
[time=1433] The Father had to sign off on naming rights.
[time=1435] And I wonder if you're looking for approval from someone who shouldn't have naming rights in your life to begin with, that only your Father, only your Creator, only your Creator, Sustainer, and Father who is the Lord of all.
[time=1448] The one who raised Jesus from the dead has naming rights in your life, but maybe you're looking for the living among the dead.
[time=1454] You're looking for approval from people who shouldn't have naming rights in your life to begin with.
[time=1458] Maybe you're looking for success, and you're looking for approval.
[time=1464] You're looking for sustenance.
[time=1466] You're looking for peace from success, satisfaction from money, fame, or success.
[time=1471] Maybe you're looking for the living among the dead.
[time=1474] I wanna tell you today, everything you're looking for can be found in Jesus.
[time=1479] Everything you're looking for can be found in Jesus.
[time=1484] God wants to use this season to remind you to be about the right assignment, about the right purpose.
[time=1489] He will help you release your baggage.
[time=1491] He will help you.
[time=1493] He will help you to realize what you've missed.
[time=1495] Number three, resurrection means I can remember what I forgot.
[time=1498] Some of you are realizing for the first time the power of the resurrection today.
[time=1502] You're realizing what you've been missing about it.
[time=1505] But for some of you, you've known the power of the resurrection, but you've forgotten some things.
[time=1510] You've forgotten how powerful the resurrection truly is in your life.
[time=1514] So resurrection means you can remember what you forgot.
[time=1517] Verses six through eight, go back there with me.
[time=1520] And we see that word, remember twice.
[time=1522] Verse six, he's not here, but he's risen.
[time=1524] Remember how he told you while he was still in Galilee that the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise.
[time=1535] Verse eight, this is my prayer for you today.
[time=1537] And they remembered his words.
[time=1541] Remember is used twice in this passage.
[time=1544] And part of their problem wasn't that they didn't know, but that they forgot what they already knew.
[time=1550] And they had chosen to live without hope, chosen to not believe.
[time=1554] They had lost the hope they once held on to.
[time=1559] Maybe you feel that way as well.
[time=1561] My prayer for you today is that you could remember, remember his words today.
[time=1568] Resurrection causes us to rediscover the hope of Jesus.
[time=1571] And I believe that today God's gonna help bring to your memory some things you have forgotten.
[time=1576] And it's kind of like this Easter egg, it's hollow.
[time=1579] For some of you today, you've seen these all around and this Easter egg looks pretty on the outside, but it's all hollow on the inside.
[time=1587] Some of you feel like this is your life.
[time=1590] It's hollow, your hope fills hollow.
[time=1593] Some of you today feel like the hollow hope you brought to Easter needs a reminder.
[time=1598] The hollow hope you brought to Easter means today that you need to realize what you've been missing.
[time=1603] And today I declare in Jesus' name that the resurrection means that I can realize what I've missed and I can remember what I've forgotten.
[time=1610] And that means my hope goes from hollow to hard-boiled.
[time=1614] That means today that we can throw away the hollow hope that we brought to this Easter and instead hold on to a hard-boiled hope that even when it cracks on the outside, there's still sustenance.
[time=1626] There's still solid stuff on the inside today.
[time=1630] Jesus' hope is not hollow, it's hard-boiled.
[time=1633] May we live and remember that kind of hope as we remember today the words of Jesus and the fact today that he is alive and he is not in the tomb.
[time=1643] That the tomb is empty today.
[time=1645] We can have that kind of hope.
[time=1648] And that leads to number four in verse nine where we get it from.
[time=1651] That resurrection means I can redirect my path.
[time=1658] Their turnaround in verse nine, because look at it, verse nine, and returning after they remembered his words and returning from the tomb, they turned around.
[time=1667] They did a 180 in their life and it was their turnaround, get this, that led to the beginning of the message of the resurrection being told.
[time=1676] These ladies who would be some of the most unlikely people to carry the message of the resurrection, especially in that ancient culture were the first people to go and declare and tell about this resurrection.
[time=1687] But it's came because resurrection led to a turnaround in their life.
[time=1692] They spun around, went a different direction and I declare today it's time for a turnaround in your life because resurrection means I can redirect my path.
[time=1702] Because of the resurrection, I can go a new direction.
[time=1706] And I believe that God's doing something new in our life right now.
[time=1710] I believe that when God does something new he always disrupts something normal.
[time=1716] Isn't that true of us today?
[time=1718] When God does something new he disrupts something normal.
[time=1720] He's disrupted all of our norms in life today and God wants to disrupt your norms so he can do something new because his greatest invitations often come through his biggest interruptions.
[time=1732] How is God inviting you into something because he's interrupted your life?
[time=1735] I believe God is trying to get our attention as a nation and as a world and he's trying to get your attention through this season, through this pandemic.
[time=1744] He didn't cause it but he's allowed it.
[time=1746] It's all sifted through his hands and because of that he wants to do a work in your life, do something new in your life.
[time=1752] But a lot of times even though we're positioned for a miracle we want the miracle without the mess.
[time=1758] But it's the mess that God uses to bring a message.
[time=1761] It's his test that lead us to the testimonies of our lives.
[time=1765] So whether today you have a realization that you've been missing or you're remembering something that you've been forgetting, I know that today is a day for you to release the baggage and move forward.
[time=1778] I know that God wants today, Resurrection Sunday to be a time of redirection for your life or all called to do just that.
[time=1786] Today we can experience some resurrection redirection.
[time=1791] And I believe it's time for resurrection redirection in your life as those ladies turned around and left the tomb, left the place of the dead to go pursue the living.
[time=1799] It's time for you to pursue eternal life and to follow after Jesus with your heart.
[time=1804] God's calling, write this down.
[time=1806] God's calling is bigger than your crisis.
[time=1815] And I believe as we see the disciples' story, callings are often born out of crisis.
[time=1821] Out of this time of crisis where the resurrection took place they're calling to go and be the hands and feet of Jesus to continue and build the church exploded.
[time=1830] And because of that, we are here today.
[time=1832] And when many thought that Easter would be canceled, we're here today because God's calling is bigger than our crisis.
[time=1839] And God will take our crisis moments in life and lead us to callings.
[time=1844] Will you pursue his calling because his plan for your life far exceeds the problems of your day?
[time=1850] I believe that.
[time=1851] I declare that over your life today.
[time=1853] So don't let something small that seems big, block out something even bigger that God wants to do in your life.
[time=1859] The early church get this, they had no money, no political influence, no power, no building, no YouTube, no live streaming.
[time=1868] Yet they turned the world upside down.
[time=1872] And salvation has been coming to homes all over our city.
[time=1875] I've gotten news of young and old who have decided to accept Jesus.
[time=1878] We've had people that were picking up communion packets that came back to get another one because somebody in their family had decided to trust Jesus.
[time=1885] The church is still winning even when it feels like it's not.
[time=1888] And it's all true because of the resurrection.
[time=1891] So my challenge to you right now is this, don't waste your quarantine.
[time=1897] When COVID-19 is just a story that we tell to future generations one day and it will be, may we live in such a way today, may we not waste our quarantine today in such a way that the stories we tell are worth telling.
[time=1912] Let's turn our stuck into stillness.
[time=1914] Let's turn our situation into a story.
[time=1918] And today I wanna give you a chance for some resurrection, redirection in your life, a pause moment for you to pray.
[time=1924] For those of you who are believers today, you would say in this moment, you would say that, you know, I just need some redirection.
[time=1932] I need to release some baggage.
[time=1934] I need to be reminded of what I've forgotten.
[time=1936] I need to realize some things that I've missed.
[time=1938] Don't waste your quarantine.
[time=1940] Love your family well.
[time=1941] Some of you today would say that I need to trust Jesus.
[time=1944] And I wanna give you a moment to do that.
[time=1946] We used to say, as I was a kid, it's the ABCs of salvation.
[time=1949] I'm not gonna lead you in a prayer 'cause your heart's screaming it.
[time=1951] You've heard the good news of the gospel.
[time=1952] We have all sinned, fall short of God's glory.
[time=1955] It creates a gap between us and God.
[time=1957] That gap was filled by Jesus' death on the cross and his resurrection.
[time=1961] And because he lives, I cannot just face tomorrow.
[time=1963] I can have eternal life today.
[time=1965] ABCs of salvation is admit, believe, and confess.
[time=1968] I admit I'm a sinner and a need of a savior.
[time=1971] I believe that Jesus paid the price for my sin after living the sinless life I couldn't live.
[time=1976] I believe he died and I believe he rose again.
[time=1979] He's alive today.
[time=1980] And I confess with my mouth that Jesus is Lord.
[time=1983] I declare today that I'm not the one who can save me, but Jesus is asking to forgive you and he will do just that.
[time=1989] Stop right now.
[time=1990] Pause in this moment and do just that.
[time=1993] Don't miss this opportunity.
[time=1995] Right now, wherever you're at, there's nothing more important than giving your life to Christ.
[time=2001] So whatever decision you need to make, I wanna challenge you to make it.
[time=2004] And then in just a moment, I'm gonna read a proclamation of potential over you as the family of God.
[time=2010] But in this moment, don't miss this chance to receive Jesus as your savior.
[time=2015] He's waiting, he's calling.
[time=2018] There is potential in this pandemic because all of the potential comes from the Spirit of God who raised Jesus from the dead, who wants to indwell and live inside of us.
[time=2028] Trust in him.
[time=2029] And listen, if you said yes to Jesus, you can go to blackhawkministries.org/prayer.
[time=2033] But if you said yes to your next step, there's a special site we have just for you.
[time=2038] It's blackhawkministries.org/yes.
[time=2042] If you said yes, go there.
[time=2043] We have leaders ready to speak with you.
[time=2047] And no matter what you're doing, say yes to Jesus, to baptism, to finding a church home, wherever that may be, blackhawk or elsewhere.
[time=2053] We're all on the same team.
[time=2055] But no matter where you're at, let me read this potential proclamation over you in this place today, this proclamation of potential.
[time=2062] I encourage you close your eyes and just let me read this over you in our last few moments together because there is potential even in a pandemic.
[time=2071] You can find potential in this pandemic because you are God's masterpiece created in Christ Jesus to do good works which he declared for you in heaven before you are ever born on earth.
[time=2083] You will see God overcome baggage in your life and release the past as you realize the power of the resurrection.
[time=2091] You will by God's grace and empowered by his spirit, live your life with purpose, being reminded of his love for you every step of the way.
[time=2100] You will keep your eyes fixed on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of your faith and redirect your path with no regrets and no excuses because eternity matters and he will never leave your side.
[time=2114] You will hold nothing back, your yes changes everything, your prayers will come storms, your faith will move mountains, your words will give life, your hands will bring healing and your feet will deliver the good news of hope to a hopeless world and your faith will overtake your fear as you go.
[time=2132] You'll leave no words unsaid, no deeds undone, no hope unshared.
[time=2136] You have God's word as a lamp to your feet and a light to your path.
[time=2140] You have God's spirit as your power.
[time=2142] When you are weak, he makes you strong.
[time=2144] When you feel stuck, he helps you be still because Jesus is risen.
[time=2150] You will not waste your quarantine.
[time=2152] You will not back down to fear and the lies of the enemy.
[time=2156] You will focus on the truth and see God do something new as he disrupts our norms.
[time=2162] You are empowered by God, trained by fire, corrected by his word, driven by his purpose and your calling is bigger than this crisis.
[time=2171] Your name is written in his book and your life belongs to him because your life is not your home and because earth is not your home.
[time=2180] You will live for the glory of God and not the applause of men because Jesus lives.
[time=2185] Trials can't stop you.
[time=2187] People can't break you.
[time=2188] Money can't buy you.
[time=2189] Haters can't silence you.
[time=2191] Demons can't defeat you.
[time=2192] Resurrection power lives within you with his help and by his power.
[time=2197] You'll see God bring his plan to completion in your life in big ways as you take small steps.
[time=2203] When you tell the story of COVID-19 and Easter 2020 to future generations, you will have a God's story worth telling because your trust and your faith is in Jesus during this chaotic season.
[time=2217] Your identity is in Jesus.
[time=2219] You're sealed by God's Holy Spirit of promise and you are loved by your creator.
[time=2225] May God bless you this Easter Sunday.
[time=2227] Let's celebrate that hope.
