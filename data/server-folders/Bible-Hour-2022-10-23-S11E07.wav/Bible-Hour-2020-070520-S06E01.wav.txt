[time=0] (dramatic music) - Could you use a little of God's fruit in your life today?
[time=5] Can I get a name in if you need some of God's fruit?
[time=8] Glad to have all of you here.
[time=9] Welcome to all of you online, at home, and all of our locations around our campus and here in the room wherever you may be, both physically but also spiritually.
[time=19] We are glad you're here.
[time=21] We are glad that you're ready to connect with God's word.
[time=23] I wanna start today as we start this new series.
[time=26] I wanna start with a question to you today.
[time=29] Do you ever feel like you've just lost your passion?
[time=33] You can say yes in this place.
[time=36] I'll speak for us and say, "I know I have, do often feel that way." Where you go through a season like the season we're in in our world, our nation with pandemics, and it feels like your passion just gets drained straight from you.
[time=50] And so this summer and on into the fall, we are gonna be in Galatians chapter five.
[time=54] I invite you there now, Galatians chapter five.
[time=57] And we're gonna be looking at a series, we're gonna call refresh.
[time=61] Because sometimes it's just important for us to refresh ourselves on what the fruit of God really looks like, what he wants to do in our lives.
[time=70] And can I start by just telling you something today that God wants to do something in your life today.
[time=76] He has not given up on you, even when we give up on him, even when we are faith less, he remains faithful.
[time=84] And so I'm glad you're here.
[time=85] We're gonna go through this series called Refresh.
[time=87] Looking at the fruit of the spirit.
[time=89] And so today I'm excited to share God's word with you from Galatians chapter five.
[time=94] Let's meet there together in Galatians five.
[time=96] But to do that and to start this series, I gotta give you a little context about just what Galatians five is about and what it will be in terms of a foundation for us to build on in today's time in your life.
[time=108] Because no doubt you like me and certainly our world needs a little bit of the fruit of God's spirit.
[time=114] Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
[time=118] If ever there's been a season where we could use a little more of that, I believe we're in that season.
[time=123] And so when our passion and our enthusiasm wanes, today's gonna be a refresher course.
[time=128] And Paul, this interesting has just finished a discourse about division.
[time=132] And I wanna read to you before our passage, starting in verse 16, verses 13 through 15, I preached this to you recently on a message we called choose Jesus, not sides during this season where so many tensions are present.
[time=146] And so I encourage you to check that out if you missed it.
[time=147] But I preached this passage in part, and Paul says this, for you are called to freedom, brothers, and I'm glad we have freedom as a nation.
[time=155] And this weekend we celebrate that.
[time=156] And I'm glad to live in such a nation like we get the privilege of living in and being a part of today.
[time=163] But even that great freedom pales into comparison to the freedom that is eternal freedom.
[time=170] We have in Christ Jesus.
[time=172] And aren't you glad we have that freedom that Paul talks about?
[time=174] He says you're called to freedom, brothers.
[time=176] Only do not use that freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love, serve one another for the whole law is fulfilled in one word.
[time=183] You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
[time=185] But if you'd buy it into vower one another, watch out that you're not consumed by one another.
[time=192] And so today we're gonna read what follows that with that as the context and the backdrop of Paul's discourse on divisions.
[time=199] He now gives us what you really could look at because of this remedy of how we can overcome those divisions and how we can overcome the opposite of the fruit that he is going to share with us.
[time=210] Are you ready for God's word this morning?
[time=212] If you are right in the chat, say it in the room, say let's go.
[time=214] Galatians chapter five, starting in verse 16 says, "But I say," that's where Paul kicks us off.
[time=221] Here's where we've been.
[time=223] You're gonna bite into vower one another if you go down these paths.
[time=225] But I say, I'm gonna give you a remedy here.
[time=228] But I say walk by the spirit and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh for the desires of the flesh are against the spirit and the desires of the spirit are against the flesh.
[time=239] For these are opposed to each other to keep you from doing the things you want to do.
[time=244] Verse 18, "But if you are led by the spirit, you are not under the law.
[time=248] Now the works of the flesh are evident.
[time=250] Sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these.
[time=265] I warn you, as I've warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God." Verse 22, I'm glad the passage didn't stop there.
[time=273] But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control against such things, there is no law.
[time=285] And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
[time=292] If we live by the spirit, let us also walk by the spirit.
[time=295] Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.
[time=300] And may God take the reading of his word and just like seeds in our lives, just multiply it so that it'll become fruit in our daily walk.
[time=308] I pray that over you all week as I prepare for how God would have us to dig into his word together today.
[time=314] Today, I wanna talk to you about poisonous fruit.
[time=316] Poisonous fruit, because if we're gonna talk about the good fruit, the fruit of the spirit, we've gotta start with the poisonous fruit.
[time=322] And if you answered yes earlier, have you ever found that your passion tends to wane, that you have lost, it would seem, your passion?
[time=331] Maybe that's personally, maybe that's professionally.
[time=334] Perhaps that's even spiritually.
[time=336] You used to be so fired up about following Christ, and then it kind of wanes.
[time=341] It gets to a lot more difficult, life happens.
[time=344] If you answered yes to any of those things, or if you're living those things, what I believe often happens is that our passion gets poisoned.
[time=351] And Paul gives us a description of how we can avoid that and what it looks like to not avoid that.
[time=356] Poisonous fruit from Galatians 5.
[time=359] And if you've been following us on social media, you've seen some pictures that look like this one on the screen.
[time=365] It's the question of would you rather, would you rather eat this fruit or that fruit?
[time=369] So can we have a little fun together this morning?
[time=371] So let me ask you, in the room and at home, would you rather eat, and I know it's a little distorted, but you can follow along, just take a guess.
[time=379] Would you rather eat A or B?
[time=381] A's on the left, B's on the right.
[time=383] You're like, I don't think I won't eat either one of them.
[time=385] So A, A, I'm not eating.
[time=389] Look, you gotta play the game, all right?
[time=390] B, all right.
[time=392] Well, if you said A, then you just ate an unripened a key fruit that can cause Jamaican vomiting sickness and ultimately lead to a coma or death.
[time=403] Yeah, you're welcome.
[time=406] Just A to keep you awake, B to actually make a point I'm gonna get to in just a minute.
[time=410] Let's go to the next one.
[time=411] Oh, there it is, yeah.
[time=412] I like this one, this is one of my favorites.
[time=414] How many of you think you would rather eat A?
[time=416] Raise your hand, A, at home, play with this as well.
[time=419] All right, hands down, B.
[time=421] Ah, that's what I figured.
[time=422] I did the same thing, and unfortunately, check this out.
[time=425] If you ate B, it's a mansion, you know, I think I'm saying it right, but it's known as the Little Apple of Death because it can cause hours of agony and potentially death with just a single bite.
[time=439] Ouch, you're welcome.
[time=441] Let's do a couple more.
[time=442] Look at this one, would you rather A, A, hands down, B.
[time=447] All right, well, if you said B, then that is buckthorn berries when ingested they can cause inflammatory disorder of the peripheral nervous system.
[time=460] Poisonous fruit, one more.
[time=461] How about this one, A or B?
[time=463] A, A, B, B.
[time=468] Well, this was kind of a trick one because the Rumbutan fruit, which is A, and Buddha's hand as it is known in B, they're not found in your grocery store, but they're both very safe to eat.
[time=478] And so A, I wanted to see if you're awake with me this morning, but B, I wanted to point out the fact that even with those physical fruits there, just like it is with our spiritual life and our walk with God, it can be pretty hard to identify the poisonous fruits in life.
[time=494] Can I get an amen?
[time=495] Sometimes they creep up.
[time=496] Sometimes they look like they're really good.
[time=498] Sometimes that makes a lot of sense.
[time=500] Sometimes you don't even think, but you can find yourself in a place where you are seeing your passions poisoned.
[time=508] And that's what Paul is talking about here.
[time=510] Galatians chapter five, even in verse one that came before what we just read starting in verse 16, just in case you needed a wake up call, reminds us of this.
[time=518] Galatians five, one, for freedom.
[time=520] Christ has set us free, stand firm, therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.
[time=525] And this freedom in Jesus is what empowers us to live, this empowered, refreshed, and passionate life that God has for us.
[time=535] And it's through the Holy Spirit, the fruit of the Spirit of God, because the Spirit of God, he's our God.
[time=540] He is our guarantee, he is our guide.
[time=542] He convicts us, he comforts us, and he conforms us to the image of Christ so that we can look more and more like him.
[time=550] Yet our tendency is to creep back to the slavery, to the bondage, to the sinfulness that caused Jesus to come and die on the cross for our sins to begin with.
[time=562] Not if you agree that you tend to do that too.
[time=565] We tend to go back to that which Christ has set us free from.
[time=570] We see our passions, our perspectives get poisoned.
[time=573] So I wanna give you three things we see from this passage, three sections, the first is the fight.
[time=578] There's a fight that is being described in verses 16 through 18.
[time=582] Look there again, Paul says in the context of overcoming these divisions, then biting and devouring one another, timely message for us.
[time=590] But I say walk by the Spirit and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh for the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh.
[time=599] You see the fight, you see the conflict.
[time=601] For these are opposed to each other to keep you from doing the things you want to do.
[time=607] But if you're led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
[time=610] And so that's where we see this fight.
[time=613] And ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make to you in case you didn't already know this.
[time=617] You inherited a war.
[time=620] You're in the middle of a war.
[time=623] Sometimes you see it and know it really clearly.
[time=626] That war, that fight around you is very evident and it's physical at times, but the Bible tells us that our war is not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers of darkness.
[time=638] And the beauty is I know the end of the story, but sometimes we forget that we inherited a fight and we live in a world that's full of worldviews that would say, hey, just be true to yourself and you don't have to worry about that.
[time=650] And it's like we just put on a blindfold, like our staff did this last week on this stage doing taste tests blindly.
[time=656] They're crazy to say yes to that.
[time=658] You could check it out on our social media, it was hilarious.
[time=660] But sometimes we do that spiritually and we'll put on a blindfold to say, there really isn't a war, but I came to remind us today that there is a war.
[time=667] It's against the spirit of God, the fruit of his spirit.
[time=671] It's against sin and the flesh and there in conflict and there is a problem.
[time=676] You inherited the problem.
[time=678] You are in a war.
[time=680] And here's what this passage reminds us is that if you choose not to fight, if you choose to say, well, I'm just gonna do my own thing and not worry about that.
[time=687] Listen, my friends, with all the love and grace, I can muster inside of my heart.
[time=692] I came to tell you today that if you choose not to fight, you will become a casualty of the war.
[time=699] That's the bad news.
[time=700] But the good news is that Jesus came and Jesus conquered.
[time=705] Jesus came into this broken, messy, sinful world.
[time=710] He came down to us in our lowest points and he wants to do that in your life right now.
[time=715] Some of you came in the room, some of you are watching online.
[time=717] This is the last ditch effort.
[time=719] Jesus meets us in those moments.
[time=723] Jesus meets us in that war against who God is, against his standards of perfection that we can't meet.
[time=731] Our sin separates us from God and condemns us to this eternal place called hell.
[time=736] But God, but God, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[time=740] He showed up and humbled himself to the point of obedience, the point of a bondservant, a slave even as it is in scripture.
[time=749] The son of God came and humbled himself so that he could win this fight.
[time=754] And he won the victory.
[time=756] I've read the end of the story.
[time=757] Have you?
[time=757] Jesus has already won.
[time=759] He has already conquered.
[time=760] Yet we live in the midst of a fight and this tension between the flesh and the spirit, again, between the works of the flesh and the fruit of the spirit.
[time=769] So let's contrast these two things for just a moment.
[time=772] The works, when you hear the word works, it's this idea of toil, this idea of struggle and of straining and it's a me-produced thing.
[time=782] The works of the flesh, the Bible says, it's a me-produced thing.
[time=786] What it essentially is for us is acting in order to achieve.
[time=791] When I achieve something, you gotta act on it.
[time=794] You gotta accomplish it yourself.
[time=796] On the contrasted side, fruit is this idea of refreshment and enjoyment and fulfillment.
[time=802] It's not me-produced, it's he-produced.
[time=805] Instead of looking at the works of the flesh, acting in order to achieve, fruit is achieving through receiving.
[time=812] Fruit is achieving through receiving.
[time=815] Only through Jesus could that be possible.
[time=817] Yet it is in his name, by his blood, because of his power and through his spirit in the middle of this fight.
[time=825] But here's a context you have to get.
[time=827] I'm gonna spend this, we're gonna do nine weeks going through each one of the pieces of the fruit of the spirit, but to do that, I wanna set up this context.
[time=834] And if you miss this next statement, you might as well not come to church.
[time=839] You might as well not show up for love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, generalness, and self-control.
[time=843] You don't hear pastors say that very often, but this is so true.
[time=846] You miss the point of the gospel if you miss the point of this statement, and we see it in Paul's writing.
[time=850] Write it down this way.
[time=851] Embracing your inability is a prerequisite to experiencing God's ability.
[time=857] If you think your ability can get you there, if you think you can be good enough to meet God's standard.
[time=863] If you think you can spiritually, eternally, find and achieve life on your own, you miss the point of the gospel.
[time=870] You miss the point of why Jesus came.
[time=872] He came because our inability was so strong that it took a God to come and become man.
[time=879] The word became flesh and dwelt among us.
[time=882] And because the word became flesh, because God became man, we have the hope of eternal life.
[time=887] While we were still sinners, Christ died for us, and I'm so glad that he did, because without him, without his ability, our inabilities would crush us.
[time=897] But because of his ability, we've got to start by recognizing.
[time=901] Listen, if you don't recognize the need for a savior, the gospel is pointless, and then we're blinding ourselves to the reality of sin, the reality of how much we need a savior.
[time=913] Some of you say, this is tough stuff, you're right.
[time=915] It is, Jesus entered the tough stuff.
[time=917] And then he brought about some great things.
[time=919] So our inability is the foundation.
[time=921] It's when we're weak, then we're made strong.
[time=924] So in our weakness says, we will decrease that he will increase.
[time=928] And we see this contrast even in this fight here.
[time=931] These competing desires are spelled out, but there's some important foundational things you got to understand about this fight.
[time=936] Not just that you'll be a casualty if you don't choose to fight.
[time=938] And guess what?
[time=939] If you fight in your own strength, that's what will spend the rest of our time on.
[time=942] You're still gonna lose.
[time=943] You need the strength of God's Holy Spirit.
[time=945] You need the strength of Jesus Christ.
[time=947] And I'm gonna tell you how you can achieve that.
[time=949] But these competing desires tell us that walking in the spirit is the way to overcome your flesh problems, not the other way around.
[time=957] I need to make this super clear because so many times in religious sectors, we think it's the other way around.
[time=962] We think that, well, if I avoid sin, then I can walk in the spirit.
[time=967] Like I'm gonna get cleaned up enough to come to church.
[time=969] You ever heard that before?
[time=970] I always say it this way.
[time=971] Listen, if you wait for that, nobody will ever be in church.
[time=974] Nobody will ever listen to any sermon because we are messy, broken, sinful people.
[time=978] So come and let Jesus clean you up.
[time=980] He's good at it.
[time=981] He's been doing it for centuries.
[time=982] And he's still good at it today.
[time=984] But you can't get this backwards.
[time=985] Notice verse 16.
[time=987] It says that you walk by the spirit and then it says you will not gratify the passions, lust, desires of the flesh.
[time=994] You can't get it backwards.
[time=996] You don't avoid sin so you can walk by the spirit.
[time=999] You walk with God's spirit because apart from him and his strength, you won't be able to avoid sin.
[time=1003] You won't be able to avoid problems of your flesh in this fight, in this contention, in this battle, in this war that we are in together.
[time=1011] So we often try to flip those today, but the formula for beating sin is to tap into his spirit, not your strength.
[time=1018] Your strength, you ever tried to do faith by your strength alone?
[time=1022] You ever tried that before?
[time=1023] How'd it go?
[time=1024] Went okay here and there, right?
[time=1027] You know, a little, and then crash and burn every single time.
[time=1031] I've been there done that.
[time=1032] We need the spirit's power if we're gonna get anywhere in this fight, and it's a fight that he has already won.
[time=1037] Verse 17, all this is here because it's gonna keep you from doing what you want to do, both senses.
[time=1043] The spirit works to keep us from doing what the flesh says we want to do, but the flesh will try to keep you from doing what the spirit wants you to do.
[time=1051] And what you want to do in the spirit, there are times you have both sides of the conflict.
[time=1055] You know what's right, but the flesh is wanting to do it and you're feeling drawn to that.
[time=1059] Then there are times where you're in the middle of a bad situation, you're making poor choices, but the Holy Spirit convicts and comforts and conforms you and guides you and draws you.
[time=1068] That's why assurance of salvation is less about my perfection than it is about God's pull because he pulls you.
[time=1074] You felt that tension.
[time=1075] Can I get a name in if you felt that tension?
[time=1077] And the tension you feel like this often feels like this.
[time=1080] And it comes to a head, it comes to a breaking point, perhaps you're at a breaking point in this fight that we live in.
[time=1087] I can't preach this without taking you to Romans eight.
[time=1090] You guys will have to hold me accountable.
[time=1091] I can't preach Romans eight.
[time=1093] I could preach 10 series on Romans chapter eight, one of my favorite chapters in all of the Bible.
[time=1098] It really is, I promise.
[time=1099] Just like this book is one of my 66 favorite books of the Bible, love them all.
[time=1103] But I want to read the first four verses of Romans eight.
[time=1105] And if you want a deeper dive into this tension, this fight, read Romans eight this week, let that be your devotional.
[time=1111] But let's read the first four verses, shall we?
[time=1113] You guys with me today?
[time=1115] You enjoying this, this is good stuff.
[time=1117] This has changed your life.
[time=1118] God's got a change he wants to bring about.
[time=1120] Romans eight, one through four.
[time=1122] There is therefore now no condemnation.
[time=1124] Praise Jesus for that, 'cause I stand condemned.
[time=1127] I'm dead.
[time=1128] And a lot of times we as dead people try to breathe CPR, breathe life into that which Jesus has already condemned.
[time=1135] That was Jesus has already killed our sin, all this list that we're gonna look at in a moment.
[time=1139] But there's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus because he's won the victory.
[time=1143] I'm glad of that.
[time=1144] There's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[time=1146] For the law of the spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death.
[time=1152] For God has done what the law weakened by the flesh could not do by sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin he condemned sin and the flesh in order that the righteous requirement of the law may be fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh but according to the spirit.
[time=1172] I love Romans eight, you should read more of it this week.
[time=1174] But a theme of Galatians and Paul's writing to the churches there in Galatia is this tension, this perceived tension just like we see between the works of the flesh and the fruit of the spirit.
[time=1187] There was this perceived tension between the law and grace because the law is the system in which they operated and then came Jesus proclaiming the good news of the gospel.
[time=1197] Then came Jesus proclaiming the kingdom of God.
[time=1199] And so Paul is speaking to this battle, this tension, this fight that is perceived by law and grace, law and the gospel.
[time=1207] And don't think for a second that that battle has ended.
[time=1209] Don't think for a second that we don't still wrestle with those same tensions.
[time=1213] They divide churches and this message is just as much needed today as it was when Jesus preached it, when Paul wrote about it, then.
[time=1220] But I wanna give you a good picture of law and grace.
[time=1223] This is one of the best illustrations I've ever seen about it.
[time=1226] The law is like a thermometer, a thermometer.
[time=1230] It clarifies a temperature.
[time=1233] It clarifies the temperature of your sin.
[time=1235] It shows you how much.
[time=1237] It's like a mirror.
[time=1238] It reminds you of like, wow, I'm kind of messy.
[time=1240] You ever read the Bible and then put it down going, whoo, I'm in trouble.
[time=1246] Ever felt that way?
[time=1247] If you have it, you should because we are apart from Jesus.
[time=1250] The law, Jesus said, I came not to abolish the law, but to fulfill the law.
[time=1255] That means he lived it out in a way we could not live it out.
[time=1258] The law is a thermometer that clarifies the temperature of our sin, grace, the gospel, the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1266] Becomes a thermostat.
[time=1267] You have both in your home most likely.
[time=1269] It's usually built into one thing.
[time=1270] It's got the number that everybody fights over.
[time=1272] You punch it up because it's too cold and then they come punch it down and you go back and forth and then you set a passcode.
[time=1278] So they can't, now I'm just kidding.
[time=1279] I've never done that.
[time=1279] You probably have, right?
[time=1280] But you know what I'm talking about.
[time=1282] But the same thing happens.
[time=1283] We like the thermometer because we can, like in COVID season, hold it up to the forehead and be like, whoo, your temperature's too high.
[time=1290] And it's like, well, hey, I don't have that sin, but you do, so I'm just gonna condemn you for it.
[time=1294] And we often like the thermometer part of that, sometimes in the church world.
[time=1298] It's important, it matters.
[time=1299] Jesus came to fulfill it.
[time=1301] It's truth and grace.
[time=1302] Jesus said, people will constantly want to box him into truth or grace.
[time=1306] And Jesus said, I am truth and grace.
[time=1308] I am the way of the truth and the life.
[time=1309] And no one comes to the Father except through me.
[time=1312] He embodied it all.
[time=1313] But it's only by his gospel.
[time=1315] It's only by the good news of his grace that the temperature of our sin can be changed while the law like a thermometer clarifies it.
[time=1323] The thermostat of God's love and grace and the person of Jesus Christ is the only thing that can change that temperature.
[time=1329] And I'm glad of that.
[time=1331] That's a picture of this fight that we're in.
[time=1334] You can't understand the rest if you don't understand this fight.
[time=1337] Let's talk about the flesh because then Paul goes into the flesh and the fruit.
[time=1341] That's the first section and it changes, doesn't it?
[time=1344] How you read the whole rest of the passage, understanding this fight that we are in.
[time=1348] May we fight blocking arms with Jesus so that we don't end up a casualty of that which Jesus has already won the battle over.
[time=1356] And here's some more picture of what he won the battle over.
[time=1358] The flesh versus 19 through 21 is the theme of Galatians.
[time=1363] And it's a picture of the junk food.
[time=1366] How many have you ate a little extra junk food over the holiday weekend?
[time=1369] All right, some of you are honest.
[time=1370] The rest of you just, you know, yeah, we believe you.
[time=1373] We'll choose to believe you.
[time=1374] We choose to trust.
[time=1376] We look for reasons sometimes though, don't we?
[time=1378] To eat some extra junk food.
[time=1379] You've been on a good track.
[time=1380] It's like, well, hey, it's the 4th of July, it's COVID season, right?
[time=1384] And we feast on some junk food.
[time=1386] And I know some of you at home, you've got Doritos on your couch right now.
[time=1391] I can just see it.
[time=1392] I can smell it from here.
[time=1393] And a lot of times though, what feels good and is fun in the moment, you end up looking back like, oh, why did I eat the whole bag of Doritos?
[time=1403] Three or four would have been totally sufficient.
[time=1405] And so if you're eating Doritos at home, it's all right.
[time=1407] We're no judgment here.
[time=1408] We probably did over the weekend too, but we often spiritually do the same thing.
[time=1412] We know the fruit of the spirit.
[time=1414] It seems like such a simple thing, but we end up going to the junk food in our life.
[time=1418] And so Paul in verses 19 through 21 describes the junk food.
[time=1422] Paul describes the works of the flesh.
[time=1425] Paul describes these sins that lead us down certain roads.
[time=1428] And I'll give you two things, the flesh will produce.
[time=1431] Number one is legalism.
[time=1432] Number two is lawlessness.
[time=1434] The flesh will produce legalism or lawlessness.
[time=1437] Legalism is working by our own power, by our own strength essentially, and by our own ultimately rules and regulations that we create in order to earn God's favor.
[time=1447] And a lot of times you see spiritual bullying with that where we create all these rules and if you don't dress a certain way or you don't do things in this man-made certain way of doing things, it's really preference driven, over gospel driven, then we end up bullying people spiritually.
[time=1462] And that can happen in any church.
[time=1464] And I would argue it happens in every church in one way, shape or form, because the flesh wants to produce this legalism, earning God's favor by doing things in certain rules and regulations and ways.
[time=1474] Here at Blackhawk, we're all about God's rules and regulations.
[time=1477] We wanna do things God's ways.
[time=1479] We don't wanna add to or take away from the word of God.
[time=1482] We don't want it to be our way because we see what our way gets us.
[time=1485] We want it God's way all the time, all the way every single day.
[time=1490] And so that's why we try our best to not get caught up in legalistic arguments and debates here at Blackhawk.
[time=1497] Another thing that the flesh will produce is lawlessness.
[time=1500] And that takes you to a place where you're less concerned about God's favor.
[time=1504] You're really just concerned about the mantra of the day, which is you just do you, boo, which is be true to yourself.
[time=1512] But the problem with being true to myself is that I'm not really looking to please God with any moral standards, any moral absolutes.
[time=1519] And I can really just do whatever I want to.
[time=1521] And scripture's really clear and eternity's really clear and life even shows us very clearly what this lawlessness, this do whatever it takes to please myself will get us.
[time=1531] And many of you are here today, you're watching today, maybe you're at a breaking point today because you've lived in the midst of legalism or lawlessness and you've seen that it is not fulfilling.
[time=1540] And you've tried everything to fill those voids and it's gotten you nowhere.
[time=1545] So you sit here today or you sit there today wherever God has you, you didn't anticipate hearing this kind of a message yet, God speaking to you, right?
[time=1553] Now, I challenge you to stop looking to temporary things, earthly things, look beyond what the flesh will bring us.
[time=1561] And then these works of the flesh, there's 15 characteristics listed there in verses 19 through 21.
[time=1567] I'll put them in four categories for us to help us remember and understand them a little bit.
[time=1571] But here's what I want to tell you, you've probably done them.
[time=1574] Figured to be quiet, there's crickets in here.
[time=1578] You've probably done most of them.
[time=1580] And we stand condemned already in the flesh.
[time=1583] This sermon's kind of a tough one for us, isn't it?
[time=1585] And until we get to the end, that's kind of us how life is and be reminded of that today.
[time=1589] But we've got to understand what God's saving us from if we want to be saved to and for something special.
[time=1595] 15 characteristics, four categories.
[time=1596] Category one, sexual sin.
[time=1598] See the first three there, there's sexual immorality.
[time=1601] The Greek word is porneas, where we get our word pornography from, is listed there first, impurity, sensuality, which takes it to like a love of the sin, a love of sexual sin.
[time=1613] And boy, we see the sexualization of culture and society taking root in so many different ways.
[time=1621] And so you see that first category that moves then to spiritual sin.
[time=1625] Spiritual sin, two things listed there, idolatry and sorcery, where you pursue anything in the spiritual realm for eternal life, for justification, for overcoming internally and eternally other than Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ alone.
[time=1641] It becomes an idol and that can be things, that can be people, and then sorcery is something that they would have dealt with then.
[time=1648] We deal with it today where we find all these different avenues, but Jesus is the only one.
[time=1653] Social sin is the biggest category.
[time=1656] The relational sins, if you will, of socialization in our society and things that happen as we run into people.
[time=1663] Have you ever run into people at church?
[time=1665] How about in your home?
[time=1666] You ever had any of these problems?
[time=1668] Let's go through them real quick.
[time=1669] I'm guessing the answer is yes.
[time=1671] Inmity really is just hatred.
[time=1673] It's where you have hatred in your heart.
[time=1675] Jesus spoke of that and said, "Have you ever murdered anybody?" No, I've never murdered anybody.
[time=1679] Well, you have if you've hated someone in your heart.
[time=1682] And that's what we're reading about here.
[time=1684] Strife, which is discord, division, which is further spelled out later.
[time=1688] Jealousy, fits of anger as temper that arises when you should suppress it.
[time=1692] Rivalries, which really speaks to a heart level motive of a selfish ambition, where you're only seeking that which you would benefit from above other people.
[time=1702] And that leads to dissensions, divisions.
[time=1705] We know all about those in our world today and the churches around today.
[time=1708] We see the fruit of the flesh.
[time=1711] We see the works of the flesh evident in these things.
[time=1713] And then Envy, which is ill will, where jealousy swells up and you wish poorly for other people.
[time=1721] Can we just collectively go like that for a minute?
[time=1724] Yeah, doesn't it?
[time=1725] And then we're not done.
[time=1726] The fourth category is substance sin.
[time=1728] So you've got sexual sin, spiritual sin, social sin, substance sin, drunkenness and orgies, which is obscenity.
[time=1735] It's more like the lawlessness that we talked about just a few moments ago where you have a love of that sin.
[time=1741] It becomes to the point where it is controlling and consuming in your life.
[time=1746] You think of addictions, you think of the list could go on.
[time=1749] And then Paul says, "Things like these," as if to say, "Hey, the list could go on forever and ever." And your list could go on forever and ever too, couldn't it?
[time=1758] Does anybody feel depressed enough yet that I could move on to the fruit?
[time=1762] Because that's what the flesh will get you and some of you are living in the flesh and it's time to turn to the fruit of the spirit of God.
[time=1768] You see the fight, you see the conflict.
[time=1770] And it's the flesh, but now let's talk about the fruit.
[time=1774] But before I do, I gotta say this about the flesh.
[time=1778] It's that when flesh collides with God's faithfulness, and I want to remind you that God is a faithful God, this statement is something you can adopt and know and maybe you came today to hear this statement, when your flesh collides with God's faithfulness, your failure is not final.
[time=1794] Because when you read a list like that, you go, "I'm in a bad spot." And you're right, you are.
[time=1803] But God, two of the most powerful words in all of history, but God.
[time=1810] He sent His Son Jesus to pay a price for your sin.
[time=1813] And on that cross, He thought of you.
[time=1816] And because of Him, your failure is not final.
[time=1818] God will often allow us to fail in our own strength so that we see that we can only succeed by His.
[time=1824] God will often use our greatest times of breaking to lead us to His greatest times of blessing.
[time=1830] He will bless you as you're broken.
[time=1833] A broken and contrite spirit, God will not despise.
[time=1835] God doesn't hate you because if your sin God loves you enough that He entered your sin and sent His Son to die to pay a price for you.
[time=1842] You really have two options with dealing with the flesh before I take us to the fruit.
[time=1846] Option number one is gratify, verse 16.
[time=1849] Walk by the Spirit so you don't gratify the desires, lust, passions of the flesh.
[time=1853] You can gratify it or you can crucify it.
[time=1856] Galatians chapter two and verse 20, verse 24 in our passage of reading now talks about crucifying the flesh, but Galatians chapter two and verse 20 says this, I've been crucified with Christ.
[time=1870] It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me and the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave Himself for me.
[time=1883] Be encouraged, my friends, God loves you so much.
[time=1888] Despite your sin, despite your mess, despite the flesh in the middle of this fight, He leads us to the fruit.
[time=1895] That's verses 22 through 26.
[time=1897] It's love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.
[time=1901] You may wonder, how do you have it memorized?
[time=1903] Well, I was a PK, I grew up in church and there's a certain song and it would start with like the fruit of the Spirit's not a banana, banana.
[time=1911] You ever heard that?
[time=1912] You should check it out, Google it, YouTube it.
[time=1914] It's awesome because in my head, as I've studied, see I've been doing this for a while, getting ready for this series and it leads you to the chorus of the song and it's stuck in my head.
[time=1923] And some of you, how many of you are stuck in your head now already too?
[time=1926] Okay, some of you know my fellow church goers, or some of you maybe you didn't go to church in your past or you didn't have the blessing of that.
[time=1932] So I've got a surprise for you.
[time=1933] I'm gonna bless you and get it stuck in your head too.
[time=1936] You ready?
[time=1937] Here's how the chorus goes.
[time=1938] Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.
[time=1943] Now you get to do it two more times, ready?
[time=1945] Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.
[time=1954] Give yourselves a hand.
[time=1955] Well done.
[time=1957] And now it's stuck in your head and every time you think of doing something contrary to what God would want you to do, you're gonna hear your pastor go, (humming) you're welcome, you're welcome.
[time=1966] I'm glad that we have the fruit of the spirit because if the passage ended with the fight and the flesh, we'd be sunk.
[time=1973] But we have the fruit of the spirit and we're now gonna spend the next nine weeks going one at a time on love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.
[time=1980] We need that, you need that, I need that.
[time=1983] Our world needs that.
[time=1984] And here's the beauty, we have that.
[time=1986] And don't miss this last little bit of teaching that'll set up everything else that we're going to do because I gave you a couple of things that the flesh will produce.
[time=1993] It'll produce legalism and lawlessness.
[time=1995] The spirit will produce, here's two things.
[time=1997] Freedom and fruitfulness.
[time=2000] The spirit will produce freedom and fruitfulness.
[time=2003] And I gotta clarify something.
[time=2005] A lot of times, I'm gonna step on a few toes, we'll say the fruits of the spirit.
[time=2011] Look at your Bible real quick.
[time=2012] What does it say?
[time=2013] It says fruit.
[time=2015] Everybody say fruit.
[time=2016] It's not good for COVID but great for theology because it's a singular word that describes this plural listing of nine fruit pieces of the spirit because it's the fruit of the spirit.
[time=2032] So now you can work on that this week when you say it, you say fruit of the spirit because it is, here's why.
[time=2037] Here's why it's such a theologically big deal as we study God.
[time=2040] People will say things like this.
[time=2042] I talked about it last week.
[time=2042] They'll say, I need more of the spirit in my life.
[time=2045] No, the thing is, as a son or a daughter of God, if you have trusted in Jesus as your savior, it's a package deal.
[time=2051] You get 100% of God's spirit all the time.
[time=2055] Now do we walk in that all the time?
[time=2057] Do we live that out all the time?
[time=2059] When we look in the mirror, do we see the whole package of the spirit of God?
[time=2062] No, because we're in a fight between the flesh and the fruit of the spirit.
[time=2066] But whether you believe it or not, if you're a son or a daughter of God, trusting in Jesus for salvation, you're indwelled by His Holy Spirit.
[time=2074] He is living an active inside of you and you get all of Him.
[time=2077] You get all nine of the listings and all of the other things that we can't even create words to describe about the presence of God.
[time=2084] You get a package deal.
[time=2085] It's a singular description of a plural implication in your life.
[time=2092] That'll preach, you have the fullness of God.
[time=2096] Let me prove it to you in John chapter one.
[time=2098] Let's look at this verse together in John chapter one, it's verse 16 for from His fullness.
[time=2104] We have all received fullness, all.
[time=2109] And then if you don't believe it, grace upon grace.
[time=2113] Grace is not getting stuff that is getting stuff that you don't deserve.
[time=2117] Grace is getting stuff you don't deserve.
[time=2119] Mercy is not getting stuff you do deserve.
[time=2120] You have all of that.
[time=2122] All of the fullness of God.
[time=2123] All of the fruit of the spirit.
[time=2126] And I'm not gonna go through all of these because we're gonna do that for nine more weeks, but we all know we need that list of nine things.
[time=2133] But I'll end by telling you this, that walking in step with a spirit is not about trying, it's about relying.
[time=2140] We've all said we've tried before in our own strength.
[time=2143] It's about relying.
[time=2144] Doesn't mean, am I saying don't try to live a good life?
[time=2148] No, you should, but not from your own strength 'cause you've tried that before, not if you've tried that before and it didn't get you anywhere.
[time=2155] It's about relying on the spirit strength inside of you.
[time=2158] And what happens when you follow Jesus is he overflows.
[time=2161] He spills out, you cannot help it.
[time=2165] As you follow Jesus, his spirit indwells you and it overflows in your life.
[time=2170] Walking in step with the spirit, as we see at the end of the passage in verses 25 and 26, is about relying on him.
[time=2176] There's four verbs there that I gotta point out.
[time=2178] And all of these verbs have a dynamic relationship with the spirit, with their cause, with their source.
[time=2186] And those verbs, verse 16, walk by the spirit.
[time=2190] Verse 18, be led by the spirit.
[time=2192] Verse 25, live by the spirit.
[time=2194] Verse 25 again, keep in step with the spirit.
[time=2197] Every verb is contingent upon the spirit and not self.
[time=2202] Every verb is all about the spirit.
[time=2205] And I wanna go back to those of you who say, maybe you've lost your passion.
[time=2209] I would remind you today that what God will do is he'll refresh you, he'll reignite some passion.
[time=2215] Perhaps your passion isn't something you've lost.
[time=2218] Maybe you've just left it.
[time=2220] Maybe you've allowed your passion to get poisoned by the poisons of the flesh and the distractions that are plenty in the world around you right now.
[time=2228] Maybe it's time to return, to refresh your original passion of Jesus Christ, the only eternal passion that matters.
[time=2236] So don't let poisonous fruit keep you from passionately following Jesus.
[time=2240] What poisonous fruits have been distracting you, have been poisoning your perspective, have been poisoning your passion lately.
[time=2247] Maybe it's time to return to the fruit of the spirit today.
[time=2250] And today in verse 26, look at verse 26.
[time=2254] Let us not become, you may think, kind of a weird way to end the passage, but let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.
[time=2262] Those verbs that we just walked through, they lead you to humility.
[time=2266] Don't become conceited, envying, provoking one another, 'cause that's what happens, it's the flesh way, right?
[time=2270] It's the works.
[time=2271] But instead let that kind of humility get directed towards all of humanity.
[time=2279] That's what happens when the fruit of the spirit takes hold in your life.
[time=2282] Your humility gets postured towards humanity and you love people a little bit more like Jesus loved you, loves you and loves the world around you today.
[time=2292] I wanna ask you to buy your heads, close your eyes.
[time=2295] A lot of times those passions when we get poisoned, they divide us because preferences start to preside over us.
[time=2302] And maybe it's time to get back to the original passion, the original fruit, the original power and source.
[time=2307] And it's not what you do that makes it meaningful.
[time=2309] You may be going to something mundane this week, believers.
[time=2313] Something mundane and it doesn't feel meaningful.
[time=2315] What makes something meaningful is not what you do, it's who you do it for and who you do it through.
[time=2320] And so that applies to everything.
[time=2322] Whatever you do, work hardly as unto the Lord today.
[time=2326] What you do for the Lord, it'll even make the mundane meaningful.
[time=2330] So in this room, maybe there's a step to walk in step with a spirit this week if you already trust Jesus as your savior.
[time=2337] But some of you are here and you haven't trusted Jesus as your Lord and savior.
[time=2340] And today is your day, I believe it, I know it.
[time=2343] Not because I'm here, but because I know the spirit of God is drawing you at home, here in the room, in another location, wherever you may be, you didn't anticipate it, but God's drawing you in this place.
[time=2353] The good news of the gospel, you've heard it clearly today.
[time=2355] It's not self, you can't be good enough on your own, but Jesus already was.
[time=2360] He already won the fight over the flesh.
[time=2363] And the fruit of his spirit can be yours by trusting in him.
[time=2367] It's not about achieving it.
[time=2368] You achieve by receiving him, trusting in him.
[time=2371] You say, how does that look?
[time=2372] Well, ABC admit you need him.
[time=2375] You've seen that clearly today.
[time=2376] Believe, believe Jesus is who he says he is, and that he died after living a sinless life to pay a price for your sin, that he is risen, believe that he's alive, and because he lives, you can take part in his victory today.
[time=2391] And then see his confess.
[time=2392] ABC admit, believe, confess.
[time=2394] Love those three letters.
[time=2396] The letters that God used to help me understand salvation is a child, and maybe it's time for you to come to God as a child confessing with your mouth.
[time=2403] Your own words, your words don't save you.
[time=2405] That's why I'm not gonna lead you in a prayer.
[time=2406] God doesn't want perfect words.
[time=2407] He wants a surrendered heart.
[time=2409] You truly trust him for salvation.
[time=2412] Stop trusting in you.
[time=2413] If that's you, I'm gonna give you a moment just to cry out to him right now.
[time=2416] Don't miss this opportunity.
[time=2417] Don't get distracted.
[time=2418] Whatever noise internally or externally is happening.
[time=2421] Don't miss what God wants you to do.
[time=2423] Pray and ask him, he'll walk with you.
[time=2439] In the room believers that have trusted in Jesus, I think God's given you a step to help you better walk in step with the spirit this week.
[time=2451] And if he's given you a specific step to take, to walk in step with him, I just wanna pray for you in just a moment.
[time=2455] Would you lift your hand?
[time=2457] Say pray for me.
[time=2457] I've got some steps I need to take this week.
[time=2459] I see you, I see hands all over.
[time=2461] Praise God, lift him high.
[time=2463] Thank you for your honesty, your boldness.
[time=2464] You can put your hands down.
[time=2465] Who in the room are at home, and you lift your hands too at home.
[time=2468] God sees you, people around you think it's weird.
[time=2470] They probably need to lift their hands too.
[time=2472] Let's do it together.
[time=2473] If you said yes to Jesus, the angels in heaven are roaring right now.
[time=2477] We wanna roar too.
[time=2478] And I wanna give you some next steps in just a moment.
[time=2480] If you said yes to Jesus, we wanna celebrate with you.
[time=2482] Would you lift your hand right now?
[time=2484] It's gonna pray for you and give you next steps.
[time=2485] In the room, at home, lift it, lift it high.
[time=2488] I see you, I see you.
[time=2489] Praise God for both of you.
[time=2491] I see you, thank you Jesus.
[time=2493] Yeah, lift it high.
[time=2497] God sees you if you're at home, no matter where you're at, you can put your hands down.
[time=2500] God, we celebrate today.
[time=2503] Hey, we never get numb to these moments, God.
[time=2505] All we did was read your word.
[time=2508] All we did was point to Jesus today.
[time=2510] But you do something eternal.
[time=2512] All we can do is earthly, but you do everything eternal.
[time=2516] And then it shows up in the earthly.
[time=2517] And today that has happened.
[time=2519] God, your love and grace has intersected sin and the need for salvation.
[time=2523] And it has changed eternities in this room.
[time=2526] And I believe around the world, those who are listening now, those who are here in the future, we praise your name.
[time=2530] We join with the angels in heaven.
[time=2532] We celebrate these souls, these lives, these precious children of God.
[time=2538] I welcome you to God's family.
[time=2540] And I'm honored to be a voice for him today to do so, to welcome you into his home.
[time=2545] The Father's house, you're a part of it now.
[time=2547] It's not this building, it's his presence.
[time=2550] So God, we thank you for all of that.
[time=2551] We welcome these to the family of God.
[time=2553] And we celebrate in the name of Jesus.
[time=2554] And all God's people said, "Hey man, let's celebrate.
[time=2558] "Welcome these to the family of God." Do it loud, do it proud, because there's nothing like these moments.
[time=2563] And listen, if you said yes to Jesus today, we wanna walk with you.
