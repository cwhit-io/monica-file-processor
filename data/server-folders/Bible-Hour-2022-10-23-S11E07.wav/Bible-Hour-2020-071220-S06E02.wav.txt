[time=0] Without in mind, hey, we're all about equipping missionaries in case you can't tell, and you are one of them. And we're in a series called Refresh. And in this series called Refresh, we want to refresh ourselves with the truth of God's Word. We want to refresh ourselves
[time=15] of the basics, if you will, of what we are called to do as followers of Jesus. We're looking at Galatians
[time=22] 5. I've got two passages I invite you to today. Galatians chapter 5, where we're looking at the fruit of the Spirit. And if you missed last Sunday, it is the foundation of this whole series. Don't
[time=33] worry, God will still speak to you today. But this week, in your devotion time, go back to last Sunday
[time=39] and join us in Galatians 5, 16 through 26. I taught you about poisonous fruit. And I gave you the
[time=45] context of this fight that we are in between the flesh and the fruit of the Spirit. And now we are
[time=51] going to go through nine weeks. And is it fruit of the Spirit or fruits of the Spirit? Fruit.
[time=58] Everybody say fruit. Again, bad for COVID, good for theology. It's fruit because it's singular,
[time=64] because listen, if you know Jesus, you get the whole package deal of his Spirit. All of him, all the time. And so we have this plural listing that we're going to go through one week at a time now, but it is a singular word because it's the fruit of God's Spirit. It's not the fruit of self.
[time=79] Go back and watch the message if you missed that foundational message.
[time=82] But today, I want to talk to you from Galatians 5. The other passage is Romans chapter 12. Romans chapter 12 verses 9 through 18. Have both of those marked. Romans comes first, then you can get to
[time=93] Galatians. And let's dig into God's word together today. I want to preach to you about genuine love.
[time=99] The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. If you were here last week, or you joined us at home last week, how many of you have been singing the song because of me this week? And you were like, "That pastor of mine, and you've been singing the song." Rid your hand if you've been singing it.
[time=115] So I'm like, "Okay, only a few." Well, that means I got to sing it every week then. So let's, no, I'm just kidding. I'll spare you this week. But today, I want to talk to you about the first of the fruit, and that is love. Genuine love. Let's look together at Galatians chapter 5,
[time=129] then we'll hop to Romans chapter 12. And let's look just first of all at Galatians 5-22.
[time=135] It's a short verse that has a big, big meaning for us. You ready for the word today? Let's dig in.
[time=141] Galatians 5-22 says, "But the fruit of the Spirit is love." We'll stop there for now,
[time=148] because there is so much to unpack there. And to help us do that, Paul wrote about love in a lot
[time=154] of his writing. He wrote Galatians 5, but he also wrote Romans 12. So find your way there. And as you find your way to Romans 12, notice that love is the first of the fruit of the nine pieces of the
[time=164] fruit that are listed. It's the first one. I would call love the peeling of the fruit. It's the covering
[time=171] that holds all of the rest of what we're going to talk about together. Now, Paul writes about how
[time=177] there's faith, there's hope, there's love, but the greatest of these is love. And the most famous,
[time=183] perhaps, verse in all of Scripture, John 3, 16, I'll break it apart for you even in a few moments, but it's that for God's so love, the world love is such a foundation and is such a need. And that's
[time=195] why we're refreshing ourselves on these fruit pieces of who we become in Christ as we're conformed
[time=202] to His image. It's His Spirit that conforms us. It's His Spirit that convicts us. It's His Spirit that reminds us of the truth. And so as we look at this, we cannot miss the foundation of love.
[time=214] Love has mentioned some 500-ish times in Scripture, and it's interesting that the word that is in Galatians 5, the fruit of the Spirit is love, is agape. It is agape. It's the
[time=225] noun form of that love. But in English, have you noticed that we have tended to distort love?
[time=231] And we have one word for love. And it's what? What is it? Not a trick question. Love. That's the one
[time=238] we got. But in the Greek language, specifically, there's a lot of variations of how you could say the word love. A few of them is storgae, which is like a familial, like a family affection that you can have. We've got our word Philadelphia from Philaeo, which is a Greek word that talks about a brotherly kind of affection. There's eros, which is a romantic or sexual kind of love. But then to tie it all together, and this is the word that's used in Galatians
[time=264] 5, and this is the word that is used in Romans chapter 12 that we'll read in just a moment, it is agape. Everybody say agape. Agape. Say it at home. Agape. Agape. Because agape is this
[time=277] sacrificial kind of love. It's a different level of love than really we can attain in and of ourselves
[time=284] at all. And a lot of people will define agape love, and it's an okay definition, I'll say, as this
[time=291] unconditional love that God loves us unconditionally. And I would say, you know what, that's a pretty okay definition, but I want to one up it. Because really what God loves us, this agape love is a
[time=303] self-sacrificing love. It costs Jesus everything. It costs him his life. He left heaven and came here.
[time=309] But I would say that more than an unconditional love, this love that God has, it is a counter-conditional
[time=315] love. Because your condition is that we are dead and our trespasses and sins. It's a real
[time=322] condition. And God loves us in spite of and through our conditions. So his love is really even better
[time=328] than unconditional, where it just disregards the conditions. God stepped into the conditions of us
[time=335] and loves us counter-conditionally. I'm glad of that. That's even better than I was taught as a kid.
[time=342] To think of it that way, wow, that God loves me that much. That's the agape love. That's the kind of love that's in Romans 12. Meet me there. We'll re-versus 9-18. Because Paul expounds on this love
[time=353] and calls it a genuine love. You'll see in the first part of verse 9, it's that let love be genuine. And so hey, I've got my mask. Here's what you've got to do before we read it.
[time=361] I've got my mask these days. And really, if you're going to let love be genuine,
[time=367] you've got to take off the mask. Bad COVID, good theology again. So let's do this. Let's keep our
[time=373] masks for COVID. But let's take off the spiritual masks. Maybe you'll wear a physical one. But
[time=379] don't we wear a spiritual mask and we fake our way through the Christian walk of faith in our lives.
[time=386] We often call it here the church smile. There's a lot of new families here. I'm so glad you're here.
[time=390] I just love it. I just love it. No telling how many of you are new with us and we're like, welcome. We're glad to have you a part of the family. We call it here the church smile. That's the mask that we typically wear. We got the sign that says there's a smile under the mask and all that now. But a lot of times the smile, even under the mask, is the mask behind the mask and that's the church smile. That's the one that when you step out of the car after you've had a knockdown drag-out fight all the way to church, you step out and you go, hello, brother. And we don't do this anymore. So it's like this or this or this or whatever we do now to greet each other. But you put on the smile and you act like everything's okay. But listen, can I put you at ease for just a moment? We all know your secret. It's not always okay. And can I give you our secret,
[time=431] the secret for everybody? Ain't nobody else really okay either. We are all pretty broken and messed
[time=437] up. And it's okay to not be okay. And Jesus meets us in our not okay. So can we agree as we read Romans 12? Let's take off the mask, give Jesus all of us. And I believe you'll do something special. Who's with me? Can I get an amen? Romans 12, let's read verses 9 through 18. Paul says,
[time=453] Let love be genuine, abhor what is evil, hold fast to what is good. Love one another with brotherly
[time=460] affection. Out do one another in showing honor. Do not be slothful in zeal, be fervent in spirit,
[time=468] serve the Lord, rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer.
[time=475] Contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality. Bless those who persecute you,
[time=482] bless and do not curse them. Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. Live in
[time=489] harmony with one another. Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly. Never be wise in your
[time=495] own sight. Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of
[time=503] all. Verse 18, If possible. So far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all. And may God just
[time=510] take his word and the reading of it and make it a seed that just sprouts eternal stuff in your
[time=516] life this week. Let's dig into that one verse at a time. I want to give you as we take off the mass today to get to some real actions because genuine love produces actions. The noun version
[time=528] of this word love is agape. Agapao is what it turns into. It's the verb form of that because we
[time=534] go and do something with it. So as we talk about genuine love from these 10 verses, let me now give you 10 actions of genuine love. 10 actions of genuine love. And I know you heard 10 and you went
[time=546] woo, lunch time's going to be late today. But I'm going to give us through them quickly because they're pretty self-explanatory. Number one comes from verse nine is lean on the spirit's discernment.
[time=556] Lean on the spirit's discernment. Remember, who is this the fruit of? Is this the fruit of self that we're reading about? No. This is the fruit of the spirit. This is the fruit of the tree
[time=567] of Jesus Christ because we cannot live these things out, especially agape love without the power of
[time=576] Jesus that is indwelling us through His Holy Spirit the moment we become a child of God. So we have to lean on the spirit's discernment and the spirit's love because verse nine says let love be genuine. But here's where the discernment comes in. Abhor what is evil. That means hate it.
[time=591] Literally means to hate it to push it aside. It's awful. It's a great form of hatred towards
[time=598] this. You need to say well the Bible doesn't say to hate it does to hate evil. Abhor what is evil.
[time=603] Hold fast to what is good. And I realize in this room, at home, in our world right now moral
[time=609] absolutes are hard to land on for people. I'm glad that I've wrestled through that. I used to think that too as a PK. I wrestled with, you know, can I really trust the Bible? If you're here today and you say well can I really trust the Bible? Is it really true? Is it really all these things that you guys say it is? Is Jesus really all He says He is? I want to encourage you and challenge you.
[time=628] I'm not here to rebuke you. I'm here to say seek God. Draw near to God and He'll draw near to you.
[time=633] I've been there done that. As a PK I knew all the Sunday school answers but I started to question am I believing it because somebody told me to believe it and then I started seeking it out.
[time=642] And you know what I found? The more I dug about the history of humanity, the more I dug about eternity, the more Jesus showed me that He is the way, the truth and the life, that He says He is and that we really can't come to the Father except through Him. And so seek Him and you'll find who draw near to God. He's going to draw near to you. And so we need this kind of discernment even to know what's right and wrong these days. Everything is so blurred in today's culture and society.
[time=667] But if you're pursuing things that are evil and a lot of the time, you know, this conscience thing that God created us with, it starts to show you. And some of you are pursuing evil things right now and you deep down know it's evil but you're justifying them. And I want to remind you today
[time=683] as your pastor on a shepherd you towards this thought that pleasure is not permanent. This earthly pleasure that maybe you're pursuing, it's not permanent. The enemy always wants to take you farther than you want to go, make you stay longer than you plan to stay, and make you pay a price you cannot afford to pay in this fight between the flesh and the fruit. And if you don't feel
[time=705] that fight in today's world, your heads in the sand, that fight is real and you're living at
[time=711] every single day. So James chapter one, let me read to you from James 1 14 through 15, if that's where you are today, then look to the fruit, this pleasure you're pursuing. Maybe you're
[time=722] having that long lingering conversation with that person at work and you're married and you don't need to do that. Maybe you're looking too long at images on wine, maybe you're not loving your family the way you should love them, you're creating an idol out of work, could the list not go on
[time=738] and on and on and on whatever it is, this pleasure that is temporary, that feels good in the moment,
[time=744] it's not permanent. Only the fruit of the spirit can truly become a permanent kind of fruit. James
[time=750] teaches us about that. James chapter number one and verse 14, we'll start there, but each person
[time=757] is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. See the progression here, then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin and sin when it is fully grown brings
[time=768] forth death. Many of your own that path right now, and I came to be a voice for the Lord to say,
[time=774] listen to the love of God today, the agape sacrificial love that is the only satisfying kind of love
[time=781] that we need to discern between. But our definition of love often comes from this Greco-Roman history, it's the history about love that we get Cupid from where Cupid shoots his little arrow and it hits
[time=792] us in the heart and then we start saying things like, this is just bigger than the both of us.
[time=797] And we start to say things like, just follow your heart. You ever heard those things and somebody
[time=803] be like, yeah, I said that just yesterday. If you did, let me tell you what the Bible says about your heart. Jeremiah chapter 17 and verse 9 tells us that the heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Some of you just had a course correction. It's like, well, maybe I don't need
[time=819] to follow our heart. So what does the Bible say to do with our heart then? Well, one of my favorites that my family has hung our hat on for many years is Proverbs 3, 5, and 6. It tells you what to do with your heart. It says, trust in the Lord with all of your heart. So your heart, instead of following
[time=838] it, is you make your heart follow Jesus. Don't follow your heart. Follow Jesus. Give your heart to Jesus. Give all that you are to Jesus. Trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding. But in all of your ways, acknowledge him and he will make straight your
[time=854] paths or he will direct your paths. And so that's where we get our discernment. And so lean on the
[time=860] spirit's discernment and not your own in love. I got to tell you, today's society, this Greco-Roman
[time=866] mindset that turns into so many different views of what love truly is, it's more about how you feel.
[time=872] Love's not a feeling. I'm going to say something that you may think would get you in trouble, but
[time=878] I don't always feel in love with my wife. There I said it. And guess what? She already knows. I don't
[time=885] always feel in love. And way more than I don't always feel in love with my wife, she doesn't always feel in love with me. I know me pretty well. And sometimes I make it difficult. And if you're married, you don't always feel in love. Love is less a feeling than it is the spirit-led discerned choice
[time=904] that we make. And I'm glad that the spirit of God through his son Jesus Christ chose to love me. God made that choice. God modeled that choice. And because he made that choice, I can make that choice too with how I love him and how I love other people, even when it feels impossible to do so. So lean on the spirit's discernment. Number two from verse 10 is compete.
[time=925] Yeah, I said it. Compete. It's like you don't hear that word at church. I'll speak to it.
[time=930] Compete at giving honor. Verse 10 says love one another, sagape, agapao. It's how you live it out.
[time=937] Agape, love one another with brotherly affection. Outdo one another. Outdo one another in showing
[time=944] honor. I love this word, outdo. Because here's the thing, how many of you say I'm super competitive?
[time=950] I'm going to raise my hand first. I'm a competitive dude. I like to win. Some of you aren't raising your hand. And I know you. I've seen your competitiveness. And sometimes we live out this Christianity that's almost like Christianity condemns competitiveness. And I would say not at all,
[time=965] not in the slightest. In fact, it's one of the things I love about scripture. If you've never read scripture through the lens of your humanity, I encourage you to do that this week. It's not this high and lofty doctrine that is just a doctrine. It's just this unattainable, unreachable, unreal list of books that these knuckleheads wrote. And God just made it so
[time=984] unattainable that we just get to look at it. No, you see it through the lens of people. It's why God wrote his word. It's his word, not their word, but he used human-flawed, knuckleheadedness. That's my new word for the day. You're welcome. I just created a word at church, knuckleheadedness. He uses all of those kinds of people like you and me to write it down so that we see how his grace, his love intersects our humanity. I love scripture. And if you don't believe
[time=1010] me about competitiveness, read John's writing in John chapter 21 after the resurrection about how he went to the tomb. And Peter and John, they all went there and he makes it really clear. I think it's like six times or something. And when the one who Jesus loved, that's him, by the way, because he's winning, right? Got there first. I beat him there. He's competitive. I love scripture.
[time=1032] I love the Bible. This is one of my 66 favorite books of the Bible. You should join me in looking at those. But here's the thing about this word, outdo, the word, the Greek word for outdo literally means to lead the way. It means to go before. It's a competitive kind of word. You win.
[time=1047] And so some of you are like, yes. Now I can go win my argument. I'm going to know. Let's look
[time=1053] at what do we win at? Because the Bible, Christianity does teach competitiveness, but it teaches it
[time=1059] towards what outdo, win, lead the way in one another and showing honor. In our world today,
[time=1069] we compete by winning an argument. But the thing about an argument is you might win, but if you win, somebody else loses. But with Jesus, when his love, when his agape, sacrificial love
[time=1081] enters any relationship, it's a win-win. And we start to learn what competitive nature actually
[time=1087] looks like. So let's compete at honoring over each other rather than competing to win an argument
[time=1094] today. Number three, so we're going to lean on the spirits to sermon, not our own. Proverbs three, five, and six. We're going to compete at giving honor. Number three, stop procrastinating. Verse 11, stop procrastinating. Verse 11 says, "Do not be slothful in zeal, be fervent in spirit,
[time=1110] serve the Lord." Slothful is a word that means slow, tardy, sloth-like, or lazy. And I'm here to
[time=1116] confess, confessions of a pastor is that there are times in my faith journey where I am sloth-like, slow, tardy, and lazy in my faith. Maybe you can relate. The opposite of that is,
[time=1127] don't be slothful in zeal. That's your passion. It's the fire that God puts in you. It's the fruit of the spirit that we get to live out. Be fervent, though. That's Zeo. It is, I love this word. The original word get this is to sieve or to boil. It's talking about like a boiling over this word.
[time=1143] It's used often to describe the sound of the bubbling of a boiling pot. It's the boiling water.
[time=1150] I love this word because we're to be fervent. We are to be fervent in the spirit, in our spirit.
[time=1156] It starts with him inside of us and it bubbles out. It bubbles over. We just bubble up with the
[time=1163] love and the zeal and the passion and the fruit of God because we cannot contain it. That's what
[time=1169] we're looking at here. And why do you say stop procrastinating? Because the previous part says,
[time=1175] don't be slothful in that. Don't be tardy. And some of you are kind of like this guy spiritually.
[time=1181] You're just hanging out. Sloth-like faith. Some of us are spiritual sloths. And we're just hanging
[time=1190] out. You just come sit. You just come soak. You just come absorb. You like to receive the love of God,
[time=1196] but you haven't really leaned into it enough to his discernment enough and stop procrastinating enough to start letting it bubble out, to let it zay-o, to let it spill over, to let it boil out
[time=1206] into your life. So it's time to go from a spiritual sloth to a spiritual cheetah. This is time for you to get running. Time for you to get moving. And as I lead people, often people say, I want to see God move in my life pastor. And here's my statement to you. If you're saying that today is if you want to see a move of God in your life, get moving. Some of you, we use the name of
[time=1227] prayer and we should pray. I'm going to talk about it. We use the name of waiting and there are times to wait to become a spiritual sloth. When God says, take a step. If you want to find the unknown
[time=1238] will of God for your life, do the known will of God in your life. He's called you to love people.
[time=1243] He's called you to be a good husband. He's called you to be a good wife. He's called you to serve. He's called you to be a good father or a good mother. He's called you to your workplace to wherever
[time=1253] whatever that looks like these days. He's called you to all the places. He's called you to be Jesus in those places. You know that. You know you're called to stop procrastinating, to lean into the
[time=1263] spirit's discernment in your life. He's called you to live out agape love. He's called you to compete at giving honor. So start by doing the known will of God. And as you do, he'll show you the unknown stuff in your life. Stop procrastinating. Let's get moving. Number four, from verse 12 is
[time=1280] find peace through prayerful patience. Find peace through prayerful patience. Rejoice in hope. Verse
[time=1286] 12 says, be patient in tribulation. Be constant in prayer. The word patient to be patient in tribulation
[time=1292] means to remain or to remain under. I don't like that. Remain under tribulation. I don't want to do
[time=1299] that. I don't want to sit there. I don't want to rest there. And pastor, don't you always preach that God calls us through tribulation? Not to it. Yeah, but a lot of times life is going to be full of it. In fact, Jesus, John 1633 said in this world, you will have tribulation, but you can take heart because I've overcome the world. And so pastor Steve Webster preached one of the best messages I've heard recently on abiding. It's making yourself at home. It's resting. That's the picture that's here. We can rest in affliction. We can trust and find peace even in our tribulations through prayerful
[time=1330] patience. And it comes through constant prayer. The word constant is the same kind of word. It could
[time=1336] also be translated to remain. You remain there. Now, we can't hold our phones going down the road in
[time=1342] Indiana anymore. And you also don't need to fold your hands and close your eyes going down the road.
[time=1347] So the pastor did not say that. But I'll tell you, some of my sweetest times of prayer are going down the road. My eyes are open. My hands are on the stairwell, ten and two. All right? No phone.
[time=1356] Just listening to maybe what God's prompting of my spirit. Pouring out my heart to God out loud
[time=1362] or in my spirit. That's the kind of thing that God's talking about. It's that constant prayer that will give us that remaining abiding restful peace and tribulation. And that is how my friends
[time=1374] we can rejoice in hope as verse 12 says. Number five is generously love God's people.
[time=1381] Because it's going to start to overflow as you do those things. Verse 13 contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality. I would tell you church that we're never more like God
[time=1391] than when we give. John 3 16 perhaps the most famous verse in all scripture. For God say it with me,
[time=1397] if you know it, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes
[time=1404] in him will not perish but have everlasting life. I could tell you 300 things about that verse but
[time=1410] I want to tell you three. Number one is that God's love is great. God so loved the world and God so
[time=1417] loves you. He could have said God loved the world enough that he sent Jesus. Could be what was written. No, God so loves us. We sang it earlier and you need to personalize that statement. Personalize
[time=1430] John 3 16. God so loved Kevin that he sent his son. And a lot of you right now, I know this about
[time=1438] you because I've been there. You can't do that. It's easy to say, well, God loves you but God wants you to say and own and know that God loves me. God does love you. I'm preaching it to you but you need to personalize it. God so loves blank. You put your name in the box. He thought of you when he
[time=1453] did it so we should be able to own it now. And if you can't, you don't really understand the agape love of God. It's a beautiful thing. God's love is great. God so loved the world. Number two, God's love is generous. God so loved the world that he gave. That's why we're never more like God
[time=1469] than when we're giving because he gave everything to us. God's love is great. It's generous. It's also global. A lot of times we don't think it's for us. We think it's just for them because God so loved the world. Great. That he gave is generous but it's also global that whoever or who so ever
[time=1486] believes in him. It's the same word that's used to describe scripture. All scripture is inspired by God. Just as much as all scripture comes from God, all people, the whosoever of the world. The Greek word posse. All of us. Every single one of you. Yes, with that skeleton in your closet, it still
[time=1502] counts. It applies to you. And so we're to generously love God's people and personalize it for ourselves.
[time=1508] And then number six is to, here's where it gets more difficult. They're like, yeah, I can buy that.
[time=1512] Here's number six. Show grace to those you don't like.
[time=1515] I got quiet. Show grace to those you don't like. Verse number 14, "Bless those who persecute you
[time=1523] bless and do not curse them." Tells us twice. Bless them. Bless them. It's that important.
[time=1529] And the word bless means literally to speak well of. It's not to go, all right, I suppose I pray for my enemy. So God, I don't even know what to pray for him. So I pray for my enemy. Jesus name, amen.
[time=1538] I'm done. That's not, that's not what this word means. It's literally to speak well. It doesn't mean to lie and come up with good things because if you've ever met anybody that's hard to speak well of, I'll say yes for you. You can say that in church. Yeah, I'm so, I'm related to some of them. Can I get an amen? It's hard to speak well of people sometimes, but it's to find the good.
[time=1558] It's to find the common ground. It is to look for ways to be a blessing and encouragement and to
[time=1564] speak well of that person. The opposite, the contrast of this is to wish ruin upon. Jesus said,
[time=1571] if you've ever hated anyone in your heart, you've committed murder. I got another confession for you as a pastor. I bet you didn't realize you had a pastor who's a murderer. I've probably come
[time=1582] more close physically than even mentally sometimes than I'd ever be willing to or want to admit to.
[time=1586] You probably have to though. That's the contrast that we see in God's word here. So we're just a look to show grace to those we don't like and it goes, it starts at the heart and it goes to the hands and in the world right now there's a lot of hurling of comments, but what we need more of is conversations. Jesus is the truth. He's always right and cannot news flash for you for a minute.
[time=1605] This may be tough for some of you to hear. You are not always right. I am not always right. Jesus
[time=1612] was, but he still sat down with people to have a conversation. He still paused to understand someone's
[time=1620] context and the key to understanding someone's context is to stop hurling comments long enough to have a conversation. Boy, our world needs a lot more of this today. We strive to be right all the time and I've taught you recently to choose Jesus not size. If we would get less concerned about red and blue, Republican and Democrat, right and wrong on this topic or that topic and just choose Jesus and just try to do what Jesus did and how he loved people, we would see this is what I pray. Oh my gosh, my heart just aches for the church and I see so many comments hurled even inside the church and it just breaks my heart. I pray with all of my heart that black all, that the church globally would become so agape in our love, so sacrificial in our love that in a
[time=1660] world that is just biting and devouring. Galatians 5, 13 through 15, the context that came before the
[time=1666] fruit of the spirit passage is all about biting and devouring in a world that's killing each other in a world that is just ripping each other to shreds. I pray the church could be so unified that people say, what's going on at Black Hawk? What's going on in God's church? I don't believe everything they believe. I don't know what they're up to, but I know our world needs some more of that and I need me some of that. If it's Jesus, then give me Jesus. I pray that people look at us and see our agape love and our unity at such a level, at such a level that they can't stay away
[time=1698] from this place and from God's Word and from Jesus because they see us doing something that's so counter-cultural, which is coming together when the world is falling apart. But that's not easy.
[time=1710] It's not an easy path. You saw love and you thought, ooh, easy sermon. Fluffy sermon. No,
[time=1716] love's a choice. It's difficult. It's hard to lean into. That leads to number seven, which is bear the blessings and burdens of others. Verse 15 says rejoice with those who rejoice and
[time=1727] weep with those who weep. And what I see happening a lot is facts being thrown. People post an article online and then another say, well, let me one up your article with my article and it just becomes this war of facts. And I've learned this about facts. That facts, while important, the truth of God's Word is the fact, it's the main fact that you need. That facts, I haven't really seen facts change many opinions. You know what I have seen change opinions? Friendships. Friendships
[time=1752] change way more opinions than facts. And that's why I'm so glad I can say, what a friend we have in Jesus. He became a friend to people that he didn't agree with. He confronted through love and grace,
[time=1763] agape love. And we're called to do the same thing. Galatians 6-2 bear one of those burdens and so
[time=1769] fulfill the law of Christ. Number eight is find harmony. Here's what will happen when you do that.
[time=1773] Find harmony through humility. Verse 16 says live in harmony with one another but do not be
[time=1779] haughty, which is the opposite of humility, but associate with a lowly. Never be wise in your own sight. So find harmony through humility. Christians for a moment, can I have your attention and your
[time=1790] eyes at home or wherever you're at. Listen to me for just a minute. If you call yourself a follower
[time=1796] of Christ and you're a part of the biting and devouring that's going on online or elsewhere right
[time=1802] now, listen, when Christians fight with Christians in front of non-Christians, everybody loses.
[time=1809] That is why Jesus in the high priestly prayer, John 17 said, Father, my prayer for them, that's you,
[time=1816] that's me, that's us, is that they could be one as you and I are one. And that, my friends,
[time=1824] is what will stand out in a world of biting and devouring. That will be the loudest megaphone for the gospel that God's church could ever know or be a part of. So may we, Black Hawk, church,
[time=1835] Christians, followers of Jesus, disciples who make disciples embody that kind of love in the spirit of God. It's not your fruit. This is fruit. We're going to have to have that but we'll find harmony through humility and humility. What it'll do is it'll turn me into we. You think bigger than
[time=1851] me because humility is the opposite of thinking just about myself. So show grace and give space
[time=1858] to those around you this week and you'll find harmony through humility. Verse 17 is number nine, value your reputation over retaliation. You ever want to retaliate? I'll show you.
[time=1871] No amens. I do. I do. Maybe I'm by myself but I want to retaliate but God says vengeance is mine.
[time=1877] I will repay says the Lord. He'll take care. He's going to make everything right. All the people that are wrong. All the people that did you don't handle all of that. It's not your job.
[time=1885] What our job is, is this verse, repay no one evil for evil. Verse 17, but give thought to do
[time=1891] what is honorable in the sight of all. That does not mean you're going to please everybody.
[time=1895] Lord knows if I've ever learned anything through ministry is that you can't please everybody.
[time=1899] I can't please myself. What makes me think I can release a congregation and have everybody happy and everybody's preferences met. You can't do the same thing in your life just as much as I can't make everybody in this room and beyond happy with how I preach or how long I preach. Some of you are already like, I don't need to change clothes there. Right. What it does mean is that you value how the gospel is seen. You may be the only Jesus some people see. It means you value
[time=1921] that above retaliating, repaying evil for evil. And so I got a word for somebody today.
[time=1926] And this has just struck me all week. And this is the action step from this is don't do something permanently unwise because you are temporarily upset. A lot of times we make permanent decisions
[time=1939] during a temporary time of being upset. And what you're going through as much as it feels permanent is temporary. It's all going to pass away. Jesus is going to make everything right one day.
[time=1948] You may deal with it the whole earthly life that you live, perhaps, probably not even that, but even if you do, that will go away. So let's don't make permanent decisions based off temporary
[time=1957] circumstances. Number 10 and lastly, do your part to pursue peace with all people. Verse 18, if possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all. If possible shows you that,
[time=1968] listen, I'm going to set somebody free with this. If possible shows you that it's not always going to be possible. He says, if possible. Have you ever tried to leave off counsel with people and it's like, look, we've talked about this for the 29th time. Are you going to try any of what we've talked about? If you ever had those conversations, I hadn't had nobody in the room or at home either, not at Blackhawk. You would have never done something like this. But with your family member of that knucklehead that you deal with, it's like, we've talked about it 29 times. You hadn't done it yet.
[time=1995] If you just take the step, if you just do your part, things would get better. And then we get so
[time=2001] better because things aren't getting better and they're not taking a step and I'm preaching to somebody because you feel condemned by that. You feel like you're failing because of that.
[time=2008] You feel like you'll never get past that. And I came to tell you today that there's three parts to relationships, to love and to life. There's God's part, there's my part and there's their part.
[time=2017] You don't have to worry about God's part. If you have been, stop it because you can't do his part.
[time=2022] He's God. He's so much bigger than we are. He's faithful when we're faithless. Don't worry about God's part. He will do his part. They may or may not do their part. I don't know who they is, but they may or may not do their part. God looks at you and says, I just want you to do your part.
[time=2036] Do your part and be faithful with your part. As much as it depends on you, live peaceably with who?
[time=2043] Not just the ones that are easy to live with. Oh, but it doesn't mean it's going to work out
[time=2049] exactly like you think every time. So church this week with a God-paying love, genuine love.
[time=2055] May we do our part. I want to ask you to bow your heads and close your eyes today. Nobody's looking around. And I believe somebody's got a decision to make. I believe everybody's got a decision to make. We can't hear about this kind of stuff without feeling stirred. So believers that are in the room, maybe you would say, boy, a God-pay love's got to apply. Maybe to an apology,
[time=2073] maybe to a conversation, maybe to a lack of posting on social media. Maybe you need to just get off social media for a while. I don't know. What's God telling you to do? It's not all bad, but it sure can foster a lot of bad stuff. I've seen it. I don't know what you need to do, but will you respond in this list of 10 actions from 10 verses? And some of you are here, and your response is this, and don't miss this at home. I know the kids may be going crazy.
[time=2096] I know there's all kind of noise around you. And if there's not noise around you, there's noise in you. And the enemy wants to distract you. Don't let him distract you from this moment, because listen, church, God loves you. He so loves you. Despite you, he loves you. He loves
[time=2113] you counter-conditionally through your conditions, in spite of your conditions,
[time=2119] despite your sin. While you were yet sinners, Jesus died for you. I'm not going to leave you in a prayer today if you need to say yes to Jesus. And you know why? Because a prayer doesn't save anybody. Words, perfect prayers, perfect words, doesn't save anybody. What saves someone's soul from sin, from death, and from hell is a surrendered heart. That's your part. It's to admit,
[time=2140] yeah, I'm a sinner. I'm the biggest of all knuckleheads. I need a Savior. And I believe that Jesus is
[time=2148] that Savior. He died for me after living the sinless life that I couldn't live. He did it. He accomplished it. And then he died on the cross and thought of me and said, "It is finished.
[time=2156] It's paid in full to tell us die." It's the word is done. It's finished. It's paid in full. And
[time=2162] then he rose from the dead to win a victory that we could never win over our sin, over our separation from God. And your job is to achieve it by receiving it, to trust in him, to stop trusting in you to
[time=2172] be good enough to save you. Trust in him. Give him your life as best as you can with your words, confess with your mouth, and the Bible promises. God promises you not just through his word but through the person of Jesus that you shall be saved. Right now in this moment, whatever your step is, take it with Jesus right now.
[time=2201] God sees you where you are at home, in the room, wherever you are. I want to ask you to acknowledge
[time=2210] what God's doing. If there's an agape love, a genuine love step that you've got to take, God put it on your heart and it's burning now. You're not going to be the sloth anymore. You're going to be the cheetah. Would you lift your hand and say, "Pray for me faster." I've got to take some steps to display this love. Just lift your hand and lift it high. God bless all of you for your honesty. Thank you. Thank you. I see you. Put your hands down. Who in the room would say, "Today I have nailed down on my salvation. Today I said yes to Jesus. I've been questioning it perhaps, but today I know that I know that I'm a child of God because I've trusted in Jesus for salvation." If that is you right now on the count of three, would you lift your hand at home? I don't care how weird it looks at home and in the room, lift your hands. Ready? One, two, three. Lift it, lift it high. Say, "Pray for me, pastor." I see you. Who else? Lift it high. I see you, man. God bless
[time=2256] you. I see you and I see you. Praise God. Who else? Thank you, Jesus, at home. I can't see you,
[time=2262] but God does. I don't care where you're at. God meets you there and he's proven it today. And God, we thank you today. I pray for these who've said yes to Jesus. I pray for these who are ready to take a next step. Those who are ready to be baptized, God, we thank you that you're on the throne. We thank you and praise you with the angels in heaven for the family of God growing today. We welcome these
[time=2281] who have raised their hand to the family of God as a son and a daughter of yours. It's just the beginning. Now a gape love has taken root and it's going to spill over through the fruit of your spirit. We thank you. We join the angels in heaven. We praise your name today for every next step that you would equip and empower us as we move forward together. We pray in the powerful, matchless name of Jesus and all God's people said. Amen. Join me. Let's welcome these to the family of God join the angels in heaven let's don't get
