[time=0] - Well, good morning church.
[time=2] I gotta say, there's nothing quite like just singing holy, holy, holy, to the Lord God Almighty with family.
[time=10] And for us, that family is in the room, but it's also online and we're spread out everywhere.
[time=15] And it's a joy to worship Jesus, no matter where you may be doing it from.
[time=19] And I gotta just say, it's a joy to be considered your pastor, to love you, to shepherd, and to be a part of this amazing family in this place.
[time=27] Thank you for leaning in.
[time=28] And thanks for being here, wherever here may be, to dig in to the Word of God together.
[time=33] And so I gotta tell you a couple of things about next week, because if you miss this, you may be disappointed next week.
[time=39] We're not gonna be nine or 11 next week.
[time=41] This is for online and for all of us who are in the room, wherever you may be, we'll be outside on the front lawn for an outdoor baptism service next Sunday the 16th at 10 a.m., not nine, not 11.
[time=53] Everybody say it with me on three, one, two, three, 10 a.m., next Sunday, bring chairs, bring blankets, bring drinks.
[time=61] If you missed our announcements before the service, blackhawk.fyi, and you think we've started now?
[time=66] We talked about it in our announcements prior to the service.
[time=68] Check that out.
[time=69] It's got all of the announcements and details.
[time=71] This Saturday, we've got a great family event called chalk the walk, big fall kickoff weekend that is ahead of us.
[time=78] So check out our website, dig in to all of that.
[time=80] So much is going on for our Blackhawk family.
[time=83] And I just gotta pause before we dig into the Word of God.
[time=85] Couple of quick things, one, I want to thank Pastor Steve Webster and Pastor Kevin Newbury for doing an outstanding job of leading us through a study of peace and of patience.
[time=95] Can we give it up for those guys and how the Lord uses them?
[time=97] Yes.
[time=98] So thankful for their teaching.
[time=100] I know I've been trying to better grasp peace and even the other P word, that patience word last week that we got a great challenge from today.
[time=110] But I want to thank you, Church, for leaning in during this season, wherever you may be doing it from.
[time=114] I know many of you are wondering, there's kids in the room.
[time=116] I think we've had more kids joining us today so far than we've had since we've been re-engaging and in-person activities.
[time=123] And I know you're wondering what does that look like for kids ministry?
[time=126] In some ways, I'll tell you, we do too.
[time=128] You can help us by volunteering in that, but we do have plans coming together.
[time=132] We'll be rolling out to you this coming week about what it looks like following our kickoff and how we'll start to re-engage some kids ministry.
[time=139] Can I get an amen parents in the room?
[time=142] We're in this together at school, re-engages.
[time=144] We are just asking you to join us in praying for all of the leaders who are working so diligently in this time.
[time=150] And I just wanted to tell you, thank you.
[time=152] With these, all of the different things that we have going on so much tends to rip us apart, yet you, Church, have decided, let's lean in together and be the Church.
[time=161] Can I get an amen one time before we dig into God's word?
[time=164] Let's dig in to Titus chapter three today.
[time=166] I want to invite you there.
[time=167] We're in a series of messages in Galatians five, but we'll primarily land in Titus chapter three.
[time=174] Today, toward the end of your Bible, meet me there in just a moment.
[time=177] Our series is called Refresh, Refresh.
[time=180] And not if you could use a little refreshment about right now.
[time=184] And that's why we're digging into this series, looking at the fruit of the Spirit.
[time=187] I preach to you Galatians five, 16 through 26, this overview, this overarching war.
[time=194] Because in case you didn't know, you're in a war.
[time=197] And in case you haven't noticed in the world around us, you kind of see evidence of that.
[time=201] And this war is between the flesh and the fruit, between ourself, our sinfulness, and the spirit of God.
[time=208] And we are in a war, we are in a battle.
[time=211] Jesus has already won it, but we are called to fight in it in this world.
[time=214] And this series will help us be able to live out what that looks like.
[time=218] And so today, we're going through the fruit of the Spirit.
[time=220] It's a package deal, but there's a list of nine things.
[time=224] And we are in our sixth week overall of the series, the fifth fruit, and it is kindness.
[time=229] And today I want to preach to you about useful kindness.
[time=232] Useful kindness.
[time=235] Before we read Galatians five and then move to Titus, have you ever been told a phrase something like this, "Why don't you make yourself useful?" You ever heard that before?
[time=244] When I hear the word useful, I think of that.
[time=246] Kids in the room, I know growing up, if I was ever lazy or something, my parents might say something like, "Hey, why don't you make yourself useful "and go take the trash out?" Or, "Why don't you make yourself useful "and clean that mess up?" Or, you know, jump in and help.
[time=259] Well, today, that's what I want to teach you a little bit about today when it comes to kindness, is that kindness really is a whole lot more, a whole lot more than just doing something nice.
[time=269] That's a pretty good start.
[time=270] But kindness goes a whole lot deeper.
[time=273] So let's look at the verse that drives all of this.
[time=275] It's Galatians five, 22 today.
[time=277] I'll show a part of that to you on the screen.
[time=279] Then we'll go to Titus chapter three.
[time=281] You ready for the word today?
[time=282] I'm excited to preach.
[time=283] I might preach three times as long today.
[time=285] It's been a couple of weeks since I've been, I'm just kidding.
[time=287] Galatians five, verse 22 says, "But the fruit of the spirit is." And in that list, kindness, kindness.
[time=297] Now let us go to Titus chapter three.
[time=299] And I want to tell you, we've been digging into the Greek words.
[time=303] And I realized for some of you may say, "Why don't we do that?
[time=306] "What's the Greek word?" Well, your New Testament was written in Greek and the original language is Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic, that we learn the scriptures from, help us get a way deeper understanding than what may show up on the surface in English.
[time=320] As an example, we have one word for love.
[time=322] What is it again in case you forgot?
[time=324] Love, there's no trick question.
[time=325] One word, but in the Bible, there are at least these four words that give us a different layered picture of what love can truly look like.
[time=333] And the same is true for all of these words.
[time=336] Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
[time=341] And so I want to give you the original language, the Greek word for kindness is Christotus.
[time=346] And everybody say that with me.
[time=347] You can sound real smart at lunch.
[time=348] You ready for it?
[time=349] "Crestotus." One more time, "Crestotus." And this word really means, here's where my title comes from.
[time=355] It means useful, profitable, beneficial, and even benevolent.
[time=362] And so you see, it's a way deeper meaning than just let's do something kind or be nice to someone.
[time=367] That's a good start, but it's really a usefulness, a profitability, a benevolent giving of oneself so that it benefits others.
[time=376] And so we're gonna break that apart.
[time=377] This word's used some 10-ish times in the New Testament.
[time=380] And one of those times is in Titus chapter three.
[time=383] And so we're trying to give you a picture of how God's word portrays all of these words that we all, I think we've all established.
[time=389] We need a little more of them in our world today.
[time=392] And kindness is certainly one of those.
[time=394] This word in particular is translated.
[time=396] A lot of times has kindness as it is in Galatians 5, but sometimes has goodness as it is actually in Titus 3, verse four that we'll read in just a minute.
[time=405] And then we see Paul who's writing to Titus add to that by saying it's goodness and the loving kindness.
[time=412] And so he even builds on that.
[time=413] So let's go to Titus chapter three.
[time=415] Paul is writing to Titus in the context of church leadership.
[time=418] The first chapter gives us a glimpse of elder qualifications.
[time=422] And then he's moving into what we can just call Christian conduct or how believers, people who follow Jesus should conduct themselves, should behave, should act both A with other believers, but then B with the world.
[time=436] And this is kind of the heart of the series, is it not refresh?
[time=439] We want to learn how we can embody the fruit of God's spirit over the fruit of myself in the world around us.
[time=447] And even starting with believers around us because sometimes that can be difficult.
[time=451] Can we just be real and honest today?
[time=453] All right, now that we know that, let's go to Titus 3, which is really digging in to our conduct with the world around us.
[time=458] Titus chapter three, starting in verse one.
[time=461] And I'm gonna give you four reminders today and it's because of the first word.
[time=464] He says, "Remind them." Remind them, let's dig in.
[time=466] "Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work, to speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle and to show perfect courtesy toward all people.
[time=481] For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another." Verse four, I'm glad there's a verse four.
[time=495] "But when the goodness," there's our word.
[time=497] "Cristotus," there is what we're talking about today.
[time=500] It's the fruit of the spirit.
[time=501] "But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, He saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to His own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior.
[time=523] So that being justified by His grace, that we're justified, what does it mean to be justified by His grace?
[time=529] The way I always remember it is it's just if I'd never sinned.
[time=533] That's what it means to be justified by God's grace.
[time=536] He washes it all away.
[time=537] Being justified, verse seven, "By His grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
[time=543] The saying is trustworthy.
[time=545] And I want you to insist on these things so that those who have believed in God may be careful to devote themselves to good works.
[time=554] These things are excellent, and not notice, and profitable, useful, and profitable for people.
[time=561] But avoid foolish controversies, genealogies, dissensions, and quarrels about the law for they are unprofitable and worthless, not useful." Verse 10, "As for a person who stirs up division after warning him once and then twice have nothing more to do with him, knowing that such a person is warped and sinful, he is self-condemned." Some pretty strong language in there, right?
[time=583] So let's dig into all of that.
[time=584] I want to give you today four reminders.
[time=586] He starts with a reminder.
[time=587] Then the first one comes from verses one and two.
[time=590] And that is remember, church, remember God's call to Godly kindness, remember God's call to kindness, that God has called you to kindness.
[time=600] And in those first couple of verses, we see the heart, literally in the middle of the passage.
[time=605] Don't miss this, that it's the kindness of God that leads us to kindness in the world around us.
[time=612] But there are some reminders.
[time=613] We cannot forget some foundations that will hold us back from living that out if we're not careful.
[time=619] The first one is to remember God's call to kindness.
[time=622] And in those first two verses, you could really call this a list of seven calls to godliness or calls to kindness.
[time=629] There's seven things listed.
[time=630] The first one there in verse one is be submissive to rulers and authorities.
[time=634] Other places in scripture if you want to research that because when you hear that, you probably think of these kind of things, don't you?
[time=640] In today's time, I've got to tell you, not much has divided God's church in recent days at least than these little things.
[time=649] And I don't realize in the room, probably you and I and I probably even have some differing views too if you wanted to hear some of my own personal thoughts on these things.
[time=656] But what we're trying to do, and I want to give you a heart of leadership in this, is Romans 13, 1 Peter, chapter two, Titus, chapter three, makes it really clear that we are to be submissive to governing authorities.
[time=667] And so we're working hard church to work with our city, to work with governing authorities, to keep people safe, because I know even though there are differing views and let's be honest, can I be real for just a minute?
[time=678] We don't hardly know what to believe half the time, do we?
[time=681] Can I get an amen?
[time=683] Even with all of that being the case, we want to submit to authorities in ways that make us in a godly way kind, in a godly way working together, in a godly way unified.
[time=693] And you notice there are people who don't want to wear, who do want to wear.
[time=696] We're asking you to wear so that we can do this together.
[time=699] You see our leaders wearing masks, but we respect how God leads each individual person in all this because we just want to be kind, but we want to do it God's way.
[time=708] And that's why as leadership, we are working hard to submit to governing authorities because God asks us to.
[time=714] Now, where does that line get drawn?
[time=715] Because that's where people go.
[time=716] I want to speak to that.
[time=717] Second list, second thing on the list is obedient.
[time=720] Did you see that?
[time=720] Obedient.
[time=721] So who are we obedient to?
[time=722] Is it just to governing authorities?
[time=724] Is it just to pastor, to elders?
[time=726] Is it to my mom, to my dad?
[time=728] No, well, Scripture tells us really clear that we must obey God before we obey men.
[time=732] And so what that means is where we're not asked to sin.
[time=735] And last time I checked, I don't think it's very sinful.
[time=737] I've been wearing one.
[time=738] I don't particularly like these things very much.
[time=741] They don't feel real good.
[time=742] They kind of make, when I wear glasses, they fog up.
[time=744] Can I get an amen?
[time=745] Glasses wears in the room.
[time=746] But I don't particularly like them.
[time=748] But I don't feel like I'm being asked to sin.
[time=750] And so since we don't feel that way, we want to lean in and do this together and to be unified.
[time=755] And I know it's dangerous even talking about masks on a Sunday morning.
[time=758] But this is a perfect scripture to remind us of that.
[time=760] But our call is to obey God before men.
[time=763] Now, if we're asked to do something ungodly, we're going to obey God before men, always.
[time=769] But we want to work together with our city to keep people safe, to work together, to protect the vulnerable among us today.
[time=776] This is just one example.
[time=777] This is the hot button example.
[time=779] Listen, as a preacher, I asked God if I could choose a bunch of other examples and not talk about that.
[time=783] But he said, no, that's the one everybody wants to hear and needs to hear.
[time=786] And so that's what we dig into.
[time=787] Be obedient is the second one.
[time=789] Ready for every good work.
[time=790] If you're like me, do you often feel like you're not very ready for every good work?
[time=794] I know there are a lot of it.
[time=795] I feel very unready for any good work.
[time=798] Forget every good work.
[time=799] Just any good work.
[time=801] To speak evil of no one.
[time=802] Avoid quarreling.
[time=804] This list is here for nothing else today to remind you if you didn't think you were a sinner?
[time=808] Yeah, you are.
[time=810] You've probably quarreled.
[time=811] You've probably spoke evil of someone.
[time=813] And to be gentle, this is one of the fruit of the spirit that we will look at in depth in the coming weeks.
[time=818] And then to show perfect courtesy toward all people.
[time=822] That's your list of seven things, calls to godliness.
[time=824] And we need to remember those things.
[time=826] And if nothing else, we realize I got some work to do.
[time=831] Not if you agree.
[time=832] I got some work to do.
[time=833] I don't do all those seven things really well.
[time=835] But I need to remember my call to those things, especially in times where the world is divided.
[time=840] Especially in times where there's a dark backdrop where God wants his light to shine forth in bright ways.
[time=845] That's kindness.
[time=847] Kindness got a lot more complicated just now, didn't it?
[time=849] It's not just, well, I'll be nice to one person this week and feel good about myself.
[time=853] Nope, it's a lot deeper than that.
[time=854] Remember your call to kindness.
[time=856] Number two, in verse three.
[time=858] Remember how much you require kindness.
[time=861] Let's personalize that.
[time=862] This week, I want to remember how much I require kindness.
[time=866] Verse three, to remind you of that, says this.
[time=869] For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by others and hating on another.
[time=883] In case you didn't know, you require some grace too.
[time=887] And when I remember how much kindness and mercy and grace I require, I can a little bit more easily posture myself to be able to give it out to other people.
[time=899] And that's the beauty of the gospel is we require that.
[time=902] And remember, don't miss where you came from church.
[time=905] Remembering where you came from.
[time=907] Remembering where God brought you from, from the muck and the mire and the death that sin brings about in our life, that the flesh brings about.
[time=915] That's the fruit that we get in and of ourselves.
[time=918] Remembering where God brought you from will poise you to be ready for God to take you where he wants you to go.
[time=925] Remembering where you came from though is a great foundation that he will use to help you be ready for what he wants to do next in your life.
[time=932] And with Jesus, there's always a next.
[time=935] Some of you needed to hear that today.
[time=937] With Jesus, there's always a next.
[time=939] He's not done with you.
[time=941] Remember his call to kindness.
[time=943] Remember how much you require it.
[time=945] Number three comes from verses four to seven.
[time=947] A beautiful, theologically packed passage here in verses four through seven.
[time=952] Number three is remember God's kindness towards you.
[time=956] Remember God's kindness towards you.
[time=959] I'm glad I serve a God who is kind even when I require so much kindness.
[time=965] Verses four through seven, I just wanna read it again.
[time=967] It's just so powerful.
[time=968] It's one of the most powerful butts in all of the Bible.
[time=972] Verses four, but, verse three is all this stuff, all these things that have held me back, all these reasons I require kindness and I'm so broken and messed up and full of death, the fruit of myself, but, verse four.
[time=985] But when the goodness, there's our word, Christotus and loving kindness of our God and Savior appeared, he saved us.
[time=994] Not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy by the washing and regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1003] Love that picture of baptism that's there, the picture of the washing.
[time=1007] And so I wanna tell you, you know, you wonder, you read that if you're new to faith or you're even checking out, you know, what does Jesus look like for me?
[time=1014] And even for those of us who've been in church for a long time, when we hear those kind of words, it's like, well, so what is it gonna happen?
[time=1020] We have an outdoor baptism next Sunday and if you need to be baptized, there's still time.
[time=1024] Go to our website, let us know, fill out a card in the room, contact us online.
[time=1028] There's still time for you to jump in on that.
[time=1030] It's gonna be a special day.
[time=1031] I can't wait.
[time=1032] One of my favorite things we do all year is get to do this outside.
[time=1035] But in the water there, did you know there's no sins floating around when people were baptized?
[time=1040] That already got washed away.
[time=1042] The washing and renewal and the regeneration that comes from the Spirit, it's an internal thing.
[time=1047] It happens because Jesus bled and died because he took my place.
[time=1052] The washing happens, the regeneration, the renewal, the new birth.
[time=1056] We wear shirts when we do baptisms that says made new.
[time=1058] I'm made new because of what God does inside of me.
[time=1061] But then externally, this thing called kindness shows up and we do things like baptism where there aren't little sins floating around.
[time=1067] Those are washed away by the blood of Jesus.
[time=1070] But that water reminds us and it outwardly shows people that it's only by the death and burial of Jesus and by his resurrection that we are made new.
[time=1078] And when we are baptized, I gotta tell you, I look around, I baptize several people that are in the room right now.
[time=1083] And I think I baptize several people that are in the room right now and a part of their journey of getting baptized was them saying, you know what?
[time=1090] When I saw so and so get baptized, that's when God started working on my heart.
[time=1094] And maybe just maybe God's ready to use your next step of baptism to stir that in somebody else because it's an outward testimony of the kindness and the mercy of God that shows outwardly what already happened on the inside.
[time=1107] We're not saved by baptism.
[time=1109] We're not saved by anything we can do at all.
[time=1111] We're saved by the blood of Jesus Christ and that alone.
[time=1116] And I'm glad of that.
[time=1117] I'm glad I know him.
[time=1118] That's kindness because I don't deserve that.
[time=1120] Yeah, God gives it to us so freely.
[time=1123] All right, going back to our verses.
[time=1125] So the washing that leads to this regeneration renewal of the Holy Spirit, verse six, whom he poured out on us richly, richly, this is kindness, this is for us.
[time=1135] He didn't need this, we needed this.
[time=1137] Richly through Jesus Christ, our savior.
[time=1140] So that being justified by his grace, we might become heirs to the hope of eternal life.
[time=1146] We're saved because of God's kindness and his mercy in Christ alone.
[time=1151] Not in you alone, not in me alone, not because of preacher talk to you how, not because you prayed a prayer, but because you said, I need this savior who when I deserved no kindness gave me the kindness above all kindness.
[time=1165] Romans five, eight, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[time=1171] Remember the kindness of God towards you.
[time=1174] And as I think of this, I've got to take you to Romans for a second.
[time=1177] We're gonna put it on the screen.
[time=1178] Romans two and verse four comes after the unrighteous listings that, honestly, a lot of times, if you ever noticed that as believers, we tend to do this sometimes.
[time=1187] We like to feel good about ourselves.
[time=1188] I'll use my statement, make it a little more comfortable for you.
[time=1192] But I think you do it too, because we all tend to do this.
[time=1194] We like to feel like, you know, I'm here and the other people are here.
[time=1197] And we'll use passages like even a Romans one to be like, well, I don't, you know, I don't have that list of sins.
[time=1203] And so, since I don't have that, I can stay here and we like to kind of beat people over the head with truth.
[time=1209] I know that's kind of my tendency.
[time=1210] But then I love what God does and what he demonstrates towards us in his kindness and in his love, like what we read in Titus three, Romans chapter two and verse four says, or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience?
[time=1225] Not knowing, get this, that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance.
[time=1232] It's God's love, his grace, his mercy, his kindness that points people to repentance.
[time=1237] I want to say, you big dummy, just change what you're doing, right?
[time=1240] You big dummy, just see it in my way.
[time=1242] You big dumb, you know, can I get it amen?
[time=1245] Don't let me feel bad up here.
[time=1246] I know you think it too.
[time=1247] I'm just willing to say it.
[time=1249] That's how we go about it.
[time=1250] But it's God's kindness that draws people to himself and don't miss the fact that through the fruit of the spirit, not because you're good enough.
[time=1258] When you display this kind of kindness, God will use you to point people to repentance, to point you to turning away from them, saving them, and point, use you.
[time=1270] Think about this as an ambassador of God's grace.
[time=1273] Through the fruit of his spirit being displayed in your life, he will use you to help people see their need to turn away from them trying to save them and turn into the Jesus who saved you.
[time=1284] What a beautiful call God has invited us into.
[time=1287] And that is why, right down this way, knowing God's kindness leads to showing God's kindness.
[time=1294] Knowing God's kindness leads to showing God's kindness, which leads us to number four.
[time=1298] The final verses that we read is verses eight through 11.
[time=1302] And there's a phrase in there to be careful.
[time=1304] And so that's what I'm gonna remind you number four.
[time=1306] Remember to be careful.
[time=1307] And then there's two key categories we should be careful with.
[time=1311] The first one comes from verse eight, and it is be careful to be devoted to what is useful.
[time=1316] Remember to be careful, number one.
[time=1318] Careful to be devoted to what is useful.
[time=1320] We're talking about useful kindness today.
[time=1322] What's profitable, what's beneficial.
[time=1324] And in verse eight, we see this beautiful picture.
[time=1327] Look at verse eight again.
[time=1328] The saying is trustworthy.
[time=1330] And I want you to insist on these things, be intentional about them.
[time=1333] It's an imperative, insist on these things so that those who believed in God may what be careful to devote themselves to good works.
[time=1343] These things are excellent and profitable for people.
[time=1347] It's useful.
[time=1347] It's useful kindness.
[time=1350] And in verse eight, I wanna remind you of what kindness starts to break apart into as we're careful to be kind.
[time=1356] We're careful to remember the call to kindness.
[time=1358] Remember how much we need it and how much God has given it to us.
[time=1361] Then we're careful to devote ourselves to things that are profitable.
[time=1364] Because a lot of times we do the opposite.
[time=1366] As we do that, we'll learn that kindness takes an expansion of our thinking beyond selfish thinking.
[time=1372] It takes an expansion of our thinking beyond just what affects me.
[time=1376] Kindness is all about them.
[time=1378] It's not all about me, it's all about them.
[time=1380] Kindness is when you compassionately give your capacity for the benefit, for the usefulness, for the profitability of other people before yourself.
[time=1391] You want a good devotional passage to learn more about how Christ did that and how you are called and we are called and even equipped to do that.
[time=1398] Write down Philippians chapter two.
[time=1399] You should just read Philippians chapter two this week.
[time=1401] Great devotional picture tells us to esteem others higher than ourselves because Jesus, we have this mind, we're called to have this mind, but we have this mind.
[time=1409] It's ours through Christ Jesus.
[time=1411] He demonstrated it, he's kind to us and therefore we can be kind to other people.
[time=1416] So kindness really is focusing on what's useful for others, not just for me.
[time=1420] And that's the hard part of kindness.
[time=1421] Told you I was going to make kindness a whole lot more difficult and I'm not making it that.
[time=1425] It just is sometimes, especially in today's world where we see a lot of unkindness around us.
[time=1431] Write it down this way, kindness is contagious.
[time=1433] Kindness is contagious.
[time=1435] And I had a new illustration of this recently.
[time=1437] This last week, I was at a drive-through.
[time=1439] You ever seen the pay it forward moments where somebody pays for somebody's meal and then they pay for the next meal?
[time=1444] And that a beautiful thing.
[time=1445] And so I was at a drive-through here in our own zip comb and it was about lunchtime and I got up to pay for my meal and was picking it up and the lady, sweet lady, I gotta be honest though and she might listen so I think she'd probably agree.
[time=1459] She just didn't look like she was having the best day overall.
[time=1462] However, she told me about something that had happened that day 'cause I got ready to pay and she said, "Oh, your meal was paid for already." I said, "Really, by who?" She said, "The person in front of you." And I said, "I don't think I know the person in front of me.
[time=1475] I wonder who that was." And so I started reaching, I really did.
[time=1479] I don't even believe, I started reaching for my wallet 'cause I'm gonna pay it forward too.
[time=1482] But even for this lady who looked like probably wasn't the best day that she maybe she had ever had, she had been watching something and she looked at me and she thought my pause meant that I was not gonna pay, I think.
[time=1495] And so she said, "Oh, are you not gonna keep it going?" And I said, "Yes ma'am, yes ma'am.
[time=1501] I'm gonna keep it going.
[time=1502] I'm just getting my wallet." And she then explained to me how, and yeah, she was calling this free trial, y'all.
[time=1508] It was like, "You better keep that going.
[time=1510] You're not breaking this chain." And I didn't.
[time=1512] I prayed for the next person.
[time=1513] And theirs was more expensive than mine too.
[time=1514] But you know what, even though it still felt so good, I would rather pay for their more expensive meal than my cheaper meal because to be kind and to keep kindness as a contagious thing was awesome.
[time=1526] And she explained to me that it had been happening all morning since early in the morning.
[time=1531] And I hope it just went on.
[time=1532] I hope it's still going on today.
[time=1533] Probably someone broke the kindness, but listen, church, we are called to display a contagious kindness even in the smallest, most simple ways because it can overtake all the negativity and all the ways that the enemy wants to tear God's church in the world apart in ways that maybe you never dream.
[time=1549] Don't underestimate one little tiny act of kindness because it can kind of become contagious in ways you wouldn't even dream.
[time=1557] So what acts could you display this week to devote yourself to what is useful, not just for you, but for others?
[time=1563] The second part of being careful is verses nine through 11.
[time=1566] Be careful to avoid, so we're being devoted to what's useful on the opposite end.
[time=1571] Be careful to avoid distractions and divisions.
[time=1575] Verses nine through 11 reminds us of this and we'll break those apart here in a moment, but I found this interesting is I studied God's word and look for the uses of kindness, Christotest.
[time=1584] What I've learned is that almost invariably, it's in the context, kind of in a contrast against our sinfulness, our evil and our brokenness in the world around us.
[time=1594] But I found that more often than not as well, this word is used in the context of distractions and divisions.
[time=1601] It's almost like God knew that we would be knuckleheads and kind of get distracted from our mission and get divided over things that maybe don't matter very much.
[time=1610] And so you see this word kindness inserted into distraction and division.
[time=1616] And in verse nine, you see a real good picture of that, but avoid foolish controversies, genealogies, dissensions and quarrels about the law for they are unprofitable.
[time=1625] It's the opposite of useful kindness.
[time=1627] And in verse eight, we saw it is profitable for people.
[time=1629] They're unprofitable and worthless.
[time=1632] And so we see that list of things that we are to avoid as we go through that.
[time=1637] And then verses 10 through 11.
[time=1638] And I know some of you are like, what is he gonna do with those?
[time=1640] That's pretty harsh language.
[time=1641] Let's read them and break them apart.
[time=1643] Verse 10, when you get distracted by that, that is unprofitable and worthless and useless, these things that are listed here, this is what can happen.
[time=1653] As for a person who stirs up division after warning him once and then twice have nothing more to do with him, knowing that such a person is warped and sinful, he is self-condemned.
[time=1662] Pretty powerful words.
[time=1663] And I know when I've read that at times, it kind of feels like, well, that kind of goes against kindness.
[time=1668] Doesn't that go against forgiveness?
[time=1670] And what I point out to you is, first of all, notice that he didn't say don't forgive.
[time=1675] Paul is talking about, remember two things.
[time=1677] Remember the context here.
[time=1678] He's talking to church leaders in the context of a church body within the body of Christ, within the church family and how they act both together, but also individually to people around the church body.
[time=1689] So remember the context, consider the context, but number two, it means consider your circle.
[time=1694] That sometimes, and I wanna ask you a personal question, is your circle right now driving you towards being devoted to things that are useful for the kingdom of God?
[time=1704] Or are they driving you away from such and leading you to things that are distracting you and dividing you from God's heart?
[time=1713] It's a tough question, but it's important for us to ask that question, and that's why Paul wrote this to young Titus in the context of scripture being pointed towards church leadership and church dynamics because church dynamics can get messy sometimes.
[time=1727] As a pastor, I can tell you it is true.
[time=1730] In case you didn't know, every church I've been in, there are people there.
[time=1733] And you know what, every church I've been in, guess who else is there, me?
[time=1738] You wanna know who the hardest person I've ever led is?
[time=1740] Me.
[time=1742] The hardest person you'll ever lead is you, and sometimes we get distracted and divided over things that just pull us away from the heart of God, and we've got an enemy that wants to tear us apart.
[time=1752] And I want you to see this video that demonstrates this really well, okay?
[time=1755] But here's the thing, any of you who feel like maybe a little queasy or not so good about seeing an animal, let's say when a battle over another animal, you can just close your eyes for about 30 seconds, all right?
[time=1767] So check out this video, two gazelles, check it out.
[time=1770] They're fighting, they are locked up.
[time=1774] Look at their friends, I like their friends in the mix.
[time=1776] It's like, check those guys out.
[time=1779] They're just going at it.
[time=1780] It's kinda like what we do, and they're like, whoop, they see something in the background.
[time=1783] Do you see something in the background?
[time=1785] They don't see something in the background.
[time=1787] And they're just going at it, they are so distracted, they're even now divided from the rest of their friends, and they don't even know it.
[time=1794] And, well.
[time=1795] That, my friends, I believe, is a pretty good picture
[time=1807] of what the enemy's doing in churches all across America and all across the world today.
[time=1815] While we get distracted and divided, don't miss first Peter chapter five.
[time=1821] Let's read it together, first Peter chapter five, we're gonna have it on the screens for you.
[time=1824] First Peter five and verse eight, be sober minded, be watchful, your adversary of the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.
[time=1836] And that's why Paul wrote this to young Timothy, because we like those gazelles, we can lock horns, and we can miss what matters, miss making disciples, miss the heart of God, and the whole time, first of all, you'll probably lose some friends, you'll lose relationships that you weren't meant to lose.
[time=1851] You see, those guys, they were gone.
[time=1854] But then came the lion, and he devoured them.
[time=1857] May it not be so of us church.
[time=1859] And when we think of these things, listen, kindness is not passive.
[time=1863] Kindness is not passivity.
[time=1864] Kindness is proactivity.
[time=1866] It's not a sitting back, you're like, well, I'm just gonna be kind and kinda hide.
[time=1870] No, it's being proactive, it's being intentional, it's fighting for unity.
[time=1874] It's leveraging my capacity for the benefit, for the usefulness of other people, even when it's more difficult to do that than it is just to sit back.
[time=1883] And that's why listen to church as a posture of our leadership.
[time=1886] You won't be surprised to know that our elders, and deacons, and council of elders, and staff teams, and pastors, we've met frequently, just for the sole purpose of answering the question, as best as we can, how do we lead and shepherd the flock of God here at Black Hawk through such unique times?
[time=1904] How do we do that?
[time=1905] When we're scattered everywhere, when tensions are so high, listen, I gotta tell you, one of the things I notice in this season is that things that typically don't matter, even in a church context, they just skyrocket because emotions are so high, and it's probably seen in your home, isn't it?
[time=1920] It's probably seen in your workplace, isn't it?
[time=1922] It's certainly in every church, emotions are so heightened right now.
[time=1925] So listen, two things I had on my heart to represent our church leadership.
[time=1929] We have a posture of wanting to walk with you.
[time=1932] Please listen, you are not meant to do this life alone.
[time=1935] I pray God's placed you in a life group and in a community of people where you can not walk alone.
[time=1940] But our church leadership is here.
[time=1941] You can go to blackhawkministries.org/prayer.
[time=1944] If you need counseling, if you need help, if you just need some prayer, if you need a shoulder to lean on, that's for in the room, online, wherever you're at, go there.
[time=1952] That's why we wanna be available not just for your personal struggles, but even corporate church struggles.
[time=1958] If you're having struggles in this church, we're available to walk with you.
[time=1961] That's why you go to our website, blackhawkministries.org.
[time=1964] At the top there, you click the button there.
[time=1966] It says mission, learn about blackhawk.
[time=1968] It's a button church leadership.
[time=1969] We have all of our emails there, all of our elders are there.
[time=1972] We wanna walk with you.
[time=1973] It's not a burden, it's a blessing to walk together through this season.
[time=1977] Especially through these tough seasons that we're going through in a nation right now.
[time=1983] So let's walk together, church, who's in?
[time=1985] Are you with me?
[time=1985] Let's do this together.
[time=1986] Let's do this as a body.
[time=1988] Let's do this as sober-minded people, realizing that the enemy wants to take us down, but he's not going to win because he is already defeated by none other than Jesus Christ, who is the author and the finisher of our faith.
[time=2001] And he has won and because he has won, we can live out his victory today.
[time=2005] We don't fight for the victory.
[time=2006] We fight from that victory.
[time=2009] So let's be careful to not get distracted.
[time=2013] And kindness really is this this week.
[time=2016] As we've looked at this, we were at the Global Leadership Summit this week and just learning to be better leaders.
[time=2020] I'm so thankful for all of you who made that possible and we get to sit with our staff and grow together.
[time=2025] Let's do that as a church.
[time=2027] That's what this passage is all about.
[time=2028] But I wanna take you to Ephesians chapter four.
[time=2032] Ephesians, by the way, is the first book, Ephesians four, first sermon.
[time=2036] I've actually got a little post-it note here that God used in my life.
[time=2040] I wrote it sitting in a restaurant.
[time=2042] I'll never forget it.
[time=2043] It was for the sermon.
[time=2044] The first sermon I ever preached at Black Hawk, and it's still in my Bible.
[time=2047] It was the day, believe it or not, four years ago now.
[time=2051] This next month was four years that you know, you've been putting up with this knucklehead that long.
[time=2056] But I cherish this chapter, but it ends with this statement and I wanna end with it with you.
[time=2061] Ephesians four, verse 29.
[time=2062] Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths.
[time=2066] But only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion that it might give grace to those who hear and do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
[time=2078] Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you.
[time=2085] Along with all malice, here's our challenge.
[time=2089] Say it together with me.
[time=2090] Ready, two words, be kind.
[time=2092] Let's say it one more time.
[time=2093] Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another as God in Christ forgave you.
[time=2101] In the Old Testament, Micah chapter six and verse eight, he has told you, oh man, what is good and what does the Lord require of you?
[time=2108] But to do justice, to love kindness, to walk humbly with your God.
[time=2114] I challenge you church with this question, what display of useful kindness has God called you to demonstrate this week?
[time=2121] And again, it's not useful for you, it's useful for them.
[time=2124] How can you leverage what God has given you this week to be a blessing to other people and in so doing, point them to the kindness of God?
[time=2132] And so I start with one last phrase that I began the whole message with and it's a challenge to all of us and here it is, go make yourself useful.
[time=2143] Let's pray together today and I just wanna challenge you to reflect on what useful kindness is God building inside of you.
[time=2150] Believers that are in the room right now, what step of useful kindness?
[time=2154] Leveraging what God has given you for somebody else, to listen to understand perhaps, to give a financial gift, perhaps, to cover a need, to just go show up to a place, to be with a person that just really needs you to show up.
[time=2166] I don't know what that is, but I believe God has given you a useful kindness step that he wants you to take this week.
[time=2171] And if that's you, I wanna pray for you.
[time=2172] Would you lift your hands, they pray for me pastor?
[time=2174] I've got a step of kindness.
[time=2175] It's just burning in my soul right now.
[time=2177] I see you, God bless you.
[time=2178] I see you in you and I see you praise God all over the room.
[time=2182] Thanks for your acknowledgement.
[time=2183] There's power in just saying, yeah, God, it's me.
[time=2186] I gotta take that step.
[time=2187] And with all heads bowed and eyes closed too, I see you, God bless you, man.
[time=2191] Thanks for, thanks for digging in.
[time=2193] Somebody else in the room, I would say today, you know, you just don't know that if you were to die today, you'd spend eternity with God in heaven.
[time=2201] You have a perfect relationship with Jesus, even though you're imperfect because he died for you.
[time=2206] You just aren't sure you've ever surrendered your life to him.
[time=2210] That you believe perhaps that Jesus is who he said he was, that he died after living the sinless life, that you could never live to pay the price for us, that you could never pay.
[time=2220] He's that sacrifice, the only perfect sacrifice.
[time=2222] And that he rose again, maybe believe that, but you've never confessed with your mouth.
[time=2225] Listen, God's ready for you.
[time=2227] You're not saved by prayer.
[time=2229] You're saved today, solely because of Jesus.
[time=2233] When you just say, I admit I need you, Jesus, in my words, I believe you are who you say you are, to confess with your mouth.
[time=2240] The Bible says anyone who confesses with her mouth that Jesus is Lord, believing that he died, that he is alive today.
[time=2246] Anyone who calls on the victim of the Lord shall be saved.
[time=2249] Maybe it's time to stop putting it off.
[time=2251] It's his kindness that makes it available.
[time=2253] Will you crowd him in your own words right now and ask him to save you and you'll do it right now.
