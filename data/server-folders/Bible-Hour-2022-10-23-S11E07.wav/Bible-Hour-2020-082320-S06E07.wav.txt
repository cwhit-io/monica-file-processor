[time=175] Galatians chapter 5 and Ephesians chapter 5 we're gonna be in those two places we're in a series kids you're ready for your first bingo word it called refresh refresh gave you a hint there we're in a series called refresh really digging into digging into the fruit of the spirit and what does it look like for us to embody the fruit of God's spirit even more than the fruit of myself because
[time=200] the fruit of me doesn't get me the fruit of the spirit I'm not good enough to achieve that but through the spirit of God working in and through us it's the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead he's alive and active and living in us we get to partake in the fruit singular because it is a package deal of love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self-control so we're going to refresh ourselves on that today and I want to teach you today about active goodness active goodness everybody say active goodness ready one two three active goodness because the goodness of God I told you last week as I preached about kindness that a lot of times people will take kindness and goodness and preach them in the same message but there's a lot of distinctive things about these words and I told you last week as well about why why are we digging into the Greek words for these pieces of fruit these elements of the fruit of the spirit it's because there's often this deeper meaning that takes us way further than when I think of kindness of like doing something nice for somebody well we learned that crestotes last week is way bigger than that it's this usefulness and profitability that benefits other people not myself I give up stuff for me to benefit somebody else and in the same way goodness today so I want to teach you about active goodness is agathosune everybody say that so you can sound real smart at lunch today ready agathosune agathosune is goodness in this passage and it means an
[time=292] activity it's active goodness it's a virtue it's energized character I love
[time=298] that definition and translation is character or integrity integrity that
[time=304] is energized and so it's this very active even more radical picture than even kindness a lot of times we'll think that goodness is on the inside and kindness comes out on the outside but really what we see is that the goodness of God is a driver of radical kindness and goodness and when put together it's
[time=324] going to be this activity that you really can't even do yourself cannot get an amen for the sunshine and God's word this morning we are so glad you're here and digging in so this word agathosune is used in the New Testament four times once here in Galatians 5 it's used again in Romans 15 and we're going to look at these other two specifically today 2nd Thessalonians 111 and then Ephesians chapter 5 and so in Galatians 5 we're reminded that the fruit of the spirit is
[time=354] goodness it's love joy peace patience kindness goodness gentleness
[time=361] faithfulness and self-control we're glad to know that we have those in Christ Jesus but let's talk about Ephesians chapter 5 look there with me because this active goodness really it's less about my attempts to be good I need to say that again this active goodness it's less about my attempts to be good it's
[time=380] more about God's ability to be good in me and through me and so let's look at Ephesians 5 where we see this word actively used today Ephesians chapter 5
[time=390] let's read verses 3 verses it verses 8 9 and 10 you ready for the word today church I love it people driving by that may hear the word dig in come jump in with us today we're gonna preach God's word in Ephesians chapter 5 verse 8 for at one time you were darkness but now you are light in the Lord walk as
[time=412] children of light for the fruit of light is found in all that is good that is
[time=418] agathosune that's the same word that's used in Galatians 5 22 love joy peace patience kindness goodness for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true and try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord God I pray
[time=436] over everybody hearing your word today that it would just become a seed in our heart that would sprout forth fruit both here there and everywhere God as we dig in internally in our hearts may it become an active goodness that sprouts into all of our homes in our workplaces God bless the reading and preaching of your word now may it just penetrate our hearts in powerful ways and all God's people said amen so let's talk about those three verses because a lot of times we'll think of kindness as outward goodness as inward but what we see is that goodness is actually together with kindness this radically useful action
[time=471] we talked about useful kindness last week and now we're looking at active goodness together it's this radically active faith that we have together you can write it down this way goodness you could say that it is an inward consumption that energizes our outward character an inward consumption it
[time=489] consumes me internally so much that outside of me inside I'm consumed outside
[time=496] of me I am overtaken with the activity of God I can't help it because it bubbles up from the inside and flows out of me that's the goodness of God because I don't know about you but I've learned that I'm not that good and in and of myself I need some help in this passage there was two imperatives two actions and it was walk us children of light and then find what pleases the Lord and so today church hear me I've got some good news for you in a world that's stuffed with bad news you've watched the news lately it's filled with bad news we hear
[time=530] bad news left we hear bad news right we hear bad news on the TV we hear bad news from our friends and our family but today I've got good news for you and it comes from the goodness of God and here at Blackhawk will often say God is good all the time and all the time God is good so when I say God is good you say all the time when I say all the time you say God is good you ready God is good all the time and all the time God is good let's talk about that goodness three things
[time=558] from those three verses verse eight shows us that number one God's goodness changes people God's goodness changes people and raise your hand if God has
[time=568] done a note work in your life if you aren't where you used to be and you're not where you want to be but you sure aren't where you used to be because God's goodness has changed you from the inside out and this picture is painted for us in verse eight you were darkness not you used to look a little bit like darkness not sometimes you did dark things you were darkness but now because
[time=590] of Jesus you are light and that's how this whole passage begins and we're
[time=596] reminded that God's goodness changes us and then in verse eight B the second part so what do we do with that we walk as children of light verse eight walk
[time=607] as children of light and I love that the word children is used it reminds me of Jesus and Matthew 19 and verse 14 they were these children were coming to Jesus
[time=618] and Jesus while others were trying to keep them from coming to him said this and Matthew 19 and verse 14 he said no let the little children come to me do not hinder them for too such belongs the kingdom of God that's why we've got
[time=633] kids sermon mingle going on that's why we've got such kids ministry coming up next week by the way if you're watching us online we're glad you're here too maybe you saw us through the drone if you saw the drone flying around in our tech team awesome they just go all out and we have a good time but we're glad you're here and maybe you're in the in the building outside the building maybe you're in your building but that's why we've got kids ministry starting to kick back off next week it's why we believe in pouring into these young lives it's why you're going to be overwhelmed overjoyed and blessed by the kids that are being baptized in just a few minutes oh they're testimonies when you hear them in a minute get ready to grab the Kleenex and you understand why it is that God has changed us it's the goodness of God that changes us but what does he change us to this is what we'll often miss church he changes us into children because if we can't have a childlike faith we can't come to the father and the only way to the father is through Jesus and Jesus alone but he converts us into children as we follow him and he says to us in this verse Paul writes to us walk as children of light it's not our light is it the fruit of self no is
[time=700] the fruit of the spirit and because of his light because of his fruit we have light we become light and we get to walk as children of light and we understand why Jesus said things like no let the little children come to me because of such is the kingdom of God I'm glad to be a child of God say man if you're glad to be a child of God today in this place I'm glad we get to celebrate being a child of God and here's what you can take away from this adoption as a child of the king being adopted into his kingdom being adopted by God write it down this way being adopted by God as his children means we adopt God's character it's the fruit of the spirit we adopt the character of God as he adopts us as his kids and so God's goodness changes people I'm not good because I'm good I'm good because goodness lives in me and his name is
[time=753] Jesus Christ and his goodness changes people number two God's goodness contains fruit you'll see why I say contains because it's the fruit of light that we read about in verse nine that's where we see this that is God's goodness that contains fruit you don't contain good fruit in and of yourself but the spirit of God the fruit of the spirit verse nine reminds us of this very fact the fruit of light is found in what is good that's our word agathosune the
[time=782] fruit of light the fruit of the spirit the fruit that shows up visibly and tangibly in your life is found in is contained by what is good and true and
[time=793] right and just after Jesus in Matthew 19 talked about letting the little kids come to me because of such as the kingdom of God he ran into the rich young ruler and if you're familiar with that story he was asking what he's got to do to inherit the kingdom of God and Jesus reminds him that listen you can't
[time=811] be good enough he reminds him there's only one who is good and it's God alone it's God's goodness not our goodness that gives us access to the kingdom that makes us his kids and it's God's goodness that contains the fruit that maybe you've tried in and of yourself to produce for so long but you find yourself falling flat on your face that's the refreshing part of the fruit of the spirit just like fruit is refreshing on a summer day it's refreshing to hear the word of God and know that when I fall short God picks me up that when the
[time=842] fruit of myself falls flat on my face and I've been there and done that where I've tried to produce fruit I remember I'm reminded today that the fruit of light doesn't come from me at all it's contained in the goodness of God it's
[time=856] contained in what is good and true and right and that is God alone so God's
[time=864] goodness changes people God's goodness contains fruit in a couple of verses I'm gonna give you a lot of verses to do some devotions with this week many of them are from Psalm Psalm 119 verse 68 reminds us you are good talking of the
[time=878] Lord you are good and do good teach me your statutes you are good and do good
[time=884] that means goodness is who God is and goodness is what God does and because he
[time=890] consumes us and dwells us empowers us then we get to be good not because we're good but because goodness now resides in us we get to just let God be good and do what is good and be his light and be a picture to those gods planted in your life because God's goodness changes people and it contains the fruit that you've been looking for today I want to take you to Psalm 145 verses 5 through 9 look there with me if you got your bibles flip there pull it up on your phones Psalm 145 this talks about the greatness of God and how it turns into
[time=925] the goodness of God God is great and God is good he's a both-hand kind of God he's everything that you've been looking for did you know today listen my friends some of you may have just came today you got invited and you just hear for a baptism and you're thinking I'm not gonna really dig into anything I'm just here to support a family member a friend I came to share with somebody today outside on a church loan today that everything you're looking for can be
[time=950] found in Jesus Christ maybe you've been looking to the fruit of self give it up for Jesus celebrate that in this place everything you're looking for today can be found in Jesus because it's his goodness that contains all the fruit that we need in this life it's his goodness that changes us from the inside out in our life and so today this picture is painted so clearly in Psalm 145 I want to read verses 5 through 9 says on the glorious splendor of your majesty and on
[time=979] the wondrous works I will meditate they shall speak of the might of your
[time=985] awesome deeds I will declare your greatness they shall pour forth the fame from your abundant goodness and shall sing aloud of your righteousness
[time=997] the Lord is gracious and merciful slow to anger and abounding instead fast
[time=1004] love verse 9 the Lord is good to all and his mercy is overall that he has made
[time=1012] I love that the Lord is slow to anger because as a kid who's had parents and as a parent who now has kids as kids as children of light we tend to do things wrong and we tend to make parents angry sometimes kid nod if kids nod with me if you ever made your parents angry yeah and their parents are going don't don't shake your head I don't get angry I calmly correct right but as kids we kind
[time=1038] of make our parents angry but listen church today I want you to know that God is not angry at you what God doesn't like is the sinfulness this the fruit of the flesh but he loves you so much for God so loved the world that he gave his
[time=1052] only begotten son that whoever you know whatever is in the Greek it's all it's posse it's no matter what has happened it's no matter what is in your background it literally means all everybody say all guess who's included at all you are today
[time=1067] God is not angry at you God is slow to anger but is abounding instead fast love
[time=1073] his greatness demands perfection but yet he knew we could not achieve that
[time=1079] perfection he knew we were going to be like those little kids that make parents angry sometimes he knew that our sin would separate us from him and that's why he sent Jesus that while we were still sinners Christ died for us why because he's slow to anger and abounding instead fast love and his mercy is available to everybody he's created and guess what you're a part of that creation and his goodness changes people and it contains all the fruit that you've been looking for in your life his greatness reminds us that he is powerful but his goodness reminds us that he is personal God is both powerful and personal and he cares about you where you are today God is good to us but God
[time=1122] is also good in us because he is goodness God's goodness changes people
[time=1128] God's goodness contains fruit number three from verse 10 because verse 10 tells us to try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord raise your hand if you've ever said I need to find God's will for my life I need to find my next step maybe you're here today looking for what pleases God what does he want me to do does he want me in this job or that job does he want me to pursue this thing or that thing what does God want from me what is my next step well that's what verse 10 talks about a number three I came to tell you that God's goodness clarifies life God's goodness clarifies life goodness brings clarity and I want
[time=1165] to give you two places from which we find clarity clarity comes from revelation revelation where God reveals and shows himself to us and in case you ever felt
[time=1176] like God was hiding from you maybe God he's agreeing you hear the bells in the background light bulbs coming on a bell is ringing inside of you because God is doing just that he's revealing himself to you he's showing you who he is God listen is not trying to hide himself from you God has revealed himself through his word God has revealed himself through his creation God has revealed himself even through the knucklehead relatives that maybe drive you crazy sometimes he is showing you who he is and a clarifier in life is always the revelation of God that he shows us who he is he reveals himself to us knowing the character of God will always bring about clarity in your life knowing who God is will always
[time=1221] be a clarifier in your life and the good news is God wants you to know him can I tell you something today church look at me for a minute God wants to be with you forever forever if you're listening online today listen God wants to be with you forever and that's why he sent Jesus Proverbs 9 and verse 10 says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy one is insight knowledge of the holy one is what brings insight knowing the character of God brings about clarity in my life and he wants to know you and I like Paul said in Philippians 3 10 wanted this to be my anthem today that I may know him
[time=1259] know him and the power of his resurrection clarity comes from his revelation last thing and I'll spend the rest of our time on this that clarity comes from rest can I get really practical with you for a minute some of you need to rest today clarity comes from revelation but clarity also comes from
[time=1279] rest and in a restless society have you noticed that we live in a restless society today maybe you're restless today maybe you need some grace and some
[time=1290] rest you need a breath of fresh air well the clarity of God discerning what is pleasing to the Lord often comes from times that in a restless world in a restless problem in a restless situation we just stopped to rest in the goodness
[time=1306] of God so I want to ask you a question how do you find rest be honest with yourself how do you find rest some of you say you know I go on vacation or I
[time=1317] sit on the back deck or I grab a cup of coffee or I find some peace and quiet or I play a video game or I read a book or I don't know what rest may look like for you but I'm guessing that you haven't figured out this thing called rest just yet and I'm gonna confess to you that as your pastor this is one of my biggest weaknesses you know here pastors say that we usually try not to preach on our weaknesses but you know what God really has this on my heart heavy for me and for you try to preach to me before I preach to you because if it's not helpful to me it may not be helpful to you and but if I can embody it and internalize it maybe it's time for you to do the same thing and I don't do real well with silence and solitude it's a spiritual discipline to find rest in the goodness of God to listen for his voice like maybe you came to do today so I want to help you find some rest today and I was reading about rest and here are a few things that stood out that I thought wow that is so true of the hustle and bustle of a restless world the first thing I read is that the first half of life we give up our health in order to get wealth and then the second half of
[time=1381] life we give up all of our wealth to try to get back our health something's wrong with that picture and maybe God wants to infuse some rest fullness from his goodness into that process and that I believe this to be so
[time=1396] true that giving God my best will always require rest rest and the difference I
[time=1404] think between living blessed because the fruit of the spirit is blessed you're a child of the king he loves you he's slow to anger and abounding instead fast love but the difference between living blessed and living stressed is often rest it's often rest and I think it's time for some of you that have been prioritizing maybe everything other than your relationship and your walk with God then resting in his love his grace and his goodness and his kindness love
[time=1431] joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self-control it's time to find some rest in that instead of trying to get ahead you know what I've been on you know in a lot of calls and in a lot of hospital rooms as a pastor and oftentimes I get the privilege of walking with a family and though it doesn't often feel like a privilege it is that to walk with a family that may be the end-of-life situation is coming and you know what I've never heard I've never heard anybody look at me and say pastor I wish I would have worked more pastor I wish I would have gotten in a little more over time pastor I wish I would have been a little more successful at that presentation I've never heard it you know what I've heard pastor I wish I spent more time with my family pastor I wish I would have spent more time getting to
[time=1482] know God who I know now loves me pastor I wish I would have spent more time telling people about Jesus pastor I wish I would have prioritized God's
[time=1492] priorities more I've heard that so many times and maybe that's an encouragement to you and the goodness of God to find some rest in who he is today resting in the goodness of God will get this is counterintuitive it will activate God's goodness in my life when I rest in it it activates it and I have more energized integrity and character in my life because of it so perhaps it's time to
[time=1515] shift your rest so you can activate God's goodness I don't know what resting looks like for you and it looks different for all of us but I know it means walking with Jesus I know it means finding time to hear from Jesus today I know that we can do what Psalm 37 and verse 3 says trust in the Lord and do
[time=1535] good that's what it says trust in the Lord notice the order and do good I do good because I trust in God and second Thessalonians I'll read this to you this is the other passage that has agathosune the Greek word that's used in the fruit of the Spirit same word here it's a prayer I prayed over you this week Paul writes this to the church at Thessalonica verse 11 of second Thessalonians one to this end we always pray for you that our God may make you worthy of his
[time=1563] calling and may fulfill every resolve for good agathosune and every work of
[time=1569] faith by his power so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you and you in him according to the grace of our God the Lord Jesus Christ I prayed
[time=1582] that over you this week church and as I've prayed it over you God brought our sunshine and I know you're roasting in it so we're about to wrap it up and get to baptizing but don't miss the restfulness God wants to bring about in his goodness let the still small boy voice of God brush over you as just says this breeze is brushing over us right now and it feels good in the sunshine can I get a name in but you know it feels even better when we rest enough to hear the still small voice of God in our life clarity for life comes from God's revelation he shows us who he is but it also comes from rest and that passage in second Thessalonians reminds us that the end of the world will come and boy these days though we don't know exactly how it's gonna unfold we're reminded the end will come we see signs of his coming we talk about it often and we see that today but let us be ready how are we ready we're ready because we rest in the goodness of God we're ready because we trust in Jesus for salvation we're ready because we trust in his power not my flesh his spirit not myself to empower
[time=1646] me for his good to be active in my life so I close with this application question write it down in pundra this week I asked you how you could demonstrate useful kindness last week this week I asked you a little bit less of an active question or though it would seem but maybe just maybe this question will lead to more activity than you ever thought the question is how can you find ways to rest in God's goodness this week in a world filled with bad may we rest in
[time=1674] God's goodness I don't ask you to close your eyes bow your heads for a moment if you're getting baptized today as we bow our heads you can go to the foyer and get ready for some baptisms in this place today but don't miss this moment don't get distracted let the still small voice speak to your heart in this place maybe today is the day of your salvation you would say that I don't just know that I know that I know that I have a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ in a moment these baptisms are going to signify the death and burial of Jesus as they go under the water and his resurrection as they come out of the water so today wherever you may be today can be the day of your
[time=1713] salvation God is slow to anger but abounding instead fast love his goodness changes people and he wants to change you his goodness contains all the fruit that you've been looking for and it's his goodness that clarifies our lives and so
[time=1730] today I want to ask you if you know and I don't just mean think you know I mean know that you know that you know that you've trusted in Jesus and Jesus alone for salvation if you haven't today then his goodness is calling you it's the goodness of God that draws us to repentance Romans chapter 2 reminds us of that it's his kindness his goodness that leads to repentance repentance is where we turn away from me some of you've been trusting in your goodness to save you and today it's time to trust in the goodness of God that he lived the sinless life you could never live that he died to pay a price for you you could never pay and after that he rose from the dead and because of that what our baptism shirts say can be true of you made new the old has gone the new has come and he wants to indwell you and change your heart and life today and so I want to give you a moment to pray and ask him to do that prayer won't save you but the goodness of Jesus will he loves you dearly his sacrifice his blood that was shed is why we can no salvation walk in this fruit that we've been
[time=1794] talking about if you're a believer how can you rest in that maybe it's time to find some restfulness that'll bring clarity in your life let me give you a minute to reflect and ask God to save you ask God to work in your heart right now in this silence how many of you are here and you would say you know I've
[time=1821] trusted in Jesus but wow something really got to me God revealed himself and I need to rest in the goodness of God in a specific way this week God's already put that on my heart would you lift your hand I want to pray for you I see you all over the place thank you for your boldness lifted high our hands down anybody here that would say hey today is the day of my salvation I said yes to Jesus I've nailed it down I've been wondering I've been thinking but today I know that I know the gospel has been made so clear as God has revealed himself to me if you said yes to Jesus I'm just gonna pray for you and give you some next steps if that is you would you lift your hand right now say pray for me pastor I gave my life to Jesus today would you lift your hand I see you point them out for me if I'm missing anybody I want to pray for you I see you God bless you I see you who else lift your hand lifted high wait me down if I miss
[time=1869] you stand up if I miss you I want to pray for you in this place the heavens are roaring right now and so do we God we thank you today for those who have said yes to Jesus for those who are taking a step to rest in your goodness God for those who will be baptized that pictures the salvation that we have because of your goodness your kindness your mercy your grace and your love that while we were still sinners you died for us God I pray for them and as I give them next steps in a moment I pray we as a church would come alongside them in powerful ways as we sing and worship in a moment and get ready for baptism let us stretch out but God let us not just stretch our legs let us stretch our hearts to hear about who you are to have you revealed to us in a new way that we could rest in it this week we thank you for your grace we thank you for your love we praise you in Jesus name and all God's people said amen let's celebrate with the angels in heaven shall we give it up for Jesus let's welcome these to the family of God I want to ask you if your able you can stand with us stretch out but stretch out your heart stretch out your hands let's sing a couple of songs and don't go anywhere because you don't want to miss the stories of those being baptized in just a moment let's worship together church
