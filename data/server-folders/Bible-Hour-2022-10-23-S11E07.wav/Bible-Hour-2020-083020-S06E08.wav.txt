[time=0] Oh, hey, I am so pumped and honored just to share God's word with you today.
[time=4] If you do have your Bibles, turn to Luke chapter 7.
[time=8] We're in a series called Refresh, and we're refreshing ourselves on the fruit of the Spirit.
[time=13] And it is a package deal that comes together from the Spirit of God.
[time=16] It's the fruit of the Spirit, not the fruit of my flesh.
[time=20] But what we are finding is that flesh and fruit are at war in this life.
[time=24] Have you noticed that lately?
[time=26] Perhaps you have.
[time=27] Looking at the fruit of the Spirit, love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
[time=33] Today I want to talk to you about faithfulness.
[time=36] And I believe with all of my heart that God is a faithful God.
[time=41] He is good all the time, and all the time.
[time=45] We said it last week.
[time=46] I hope you've been resting in the goodness of God this week.
[time=50] And I cannot talk about the faithfulness of God today without recognizing his faithfulness
[time=56] that we saw, his goodness, that we saw last Sunday in our One Service together outside.
[time=62] And so if you didn't get to join us, you definitely should check out the video on our website.
[time=67] We saw just a glorious moment where many followed Christ and believers' baptism.
[time=71] And we saw once again our why.
[time=74] Our why.
[time=75] Why are we here?
[time=76] Why do we gather?
[time=77] What really will push us through?
[time=78] And it's the goodness of God because He is good all the time.
[time=81] And just as good as He is all the time, He is faithful all the time, even when we are
[time=87] faithless.
[time=88] And today I want to talk to you about marvelous faithfulness.
[time=92] Marvelous faithfulness.
[time=93] We're in Galatians chapter 5 for this series.
[time=96] We're primarily going to be in Luke chapter 7 where I've guided you to, but we're looking at this passage Galatians 5, 16 through 26, then.
[time=104] We've been doing that for several weeks now, and we are on faithfulness.
[time=107] And you'll see why I call it marvelous in just a moment.
[time=111] Because the faithfulness we will look at is one that Jesus Himself even marveled at.
[time=116] He was amazed at.
[time=117] But let's look at Luke chapter 7 in a moment, but I'll put on the screen for you, a reminder of the fruit of the Spirit.
[time=123] Galatians 5, 22 tells us, "But the fruit of the Spirit is faithfulness."
[time=129] Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
[time=134] As we're in our last few weeks of this, I'm again reminded of how much our world needs all nine of those things.
[time=140] Jesus is the provider of all of those things, even through knuckleheads like me.
[time=145] And what we're doing in case you are new with us is we're looking at the original language of these words.
[time=150] Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.
[time=154] How are they written?
[time=155] And what is the word in the original language?
[time=157] If you wonder why, there are oftentimes, especially in the Greek language we're seeing in this series that our English words don't do a really great job of capturing the depth
[time=167] of meaning and the depth of just depth and meaningfulness and application to our lives
[time=174] in general.
[time=175] And so we're looking at how these words for all of these different parts of the fruit of the Spirit, how they're used throughout all of Scripture.
[time=182] And I want to do that again with you today.
[time=184] This word, faithfulness, it's peace-tease in the Greek.
[time=189] And here's what it means.
[time=190] It does mean faithfulness as it's translated in Galatians 5, 22, but it's often translated
[time=196] as just simply faith.
[time=197] And I'll show you some examples of that.
[time=199] But it means even to win over, it means to persuade.
[time=202] It has this idea of conviction and deep-seated belief, veracity even, and trust in the truth.
[time=211] It's a groundedness in the truth that leads us to faith.
[time=215] And so we're going to look at that.
[time=216] It's used some 243 times in the New Testament.
[time=220] And it's used in places like Hebrews 11, the Hall of Fame of Faith.
[time=223] Hebrews 11-1 tells us, now faith.
[time=226] That's our word.
[time=227] Now, faith is translated in faithfulness in Galatians 5.
[time=230] Same word.
[time=231] Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
[time=235] That is so much the definition of what faith truly looks like for us and is seen in the same word.
[time=241] Second Corinthians 5-7, we walk by faith.
[time=244] Let's say that together.
[time=245] We walk by faith, not by sight.
[time=249] And that's the same word.
[time=251] It's also found in Luke 7 verses 1-10, it's in verse 9 as we'll see it in a moment.
[time=257] But before I read it to you, Hebrews 12 reminds us that Jesus is the author and finisher of
[time=263] our faith.
[time=264] And so when it comes to faith, Jesus is the beginning of it, Jesus is the end of it.
[time=269] And if that's true, wouldn't you think it would be quite significant that the author and finisher of our faith today would marvel, would be amazed at the faith of somebody else?
[time=281] If you knew of a story where you knew the author and finisher of faith was amazed by the faith of another, I would say that's worth modeling our life after, wouldn't you agree?
[time=291] Well, today is just such a story.
[time=293] This is a story.
[time=294] The only time such a response came from Jesus in Scripture.
[time=297] There's parallel accounts of this story in Matthew chapter 8 and in Luke chapter 7.
[time=302] We're going to read Luke chapter 7 in just a moment.
[time=304] This is the only time we see such a response from Jesus using these words and we'll look at that.
[time=309] So who is this person, right?
[time=310] If you don't already know, you're probably asking, you're thinking it's probably a rabbi, a teacher, a doctor, some big business person or some big hero of the faith.
[time=319] But in fact, it is a Roman centurion, a Roman.
[time=325] The Roman Empire was this enemy, this hated enemy of the Jews, especially in this season of Jesus' ministry.
[time=331] And so that's significant.
[time=333] So how could that even be?
[time=334] But yet we find that in today's story.
[time=337] Let's unpack it together.
[time=338] And I just got to pause and say, I'm so glad you're here.
[time=341] Have I told you that yet?
[time=342] In the room, it's just good to see people in the room and listen, if you're online still, we still see you too.
[time=347] And I am so glad that you're here.
[time=349] God has used this season to let His word, like what we're about to read, reach into homes like yours, into places all around the world and even into our hearts.
[time=357] And it just doesn't mean, it gives me a lot of joy to be able to dig into God's word with you today.
[time=361] You ready to do that?
[time=362] Luke chapter 7.
[time=363] Let's read the first ten verses, Luke chapter 7.
[time=368] After he had finished all his sayings and the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum, now a centurion had a servant who was sick and at the point of death, who was highly
[time=378] valued by him.
[time=380] When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent to him the elders of the Jews asking him to come and to heal his servant.
[time=387] And when they came to Jesus, they pleaded with him earnestly, saying, "He is worthy.
[time=392] And to have you do this for him, for he loves our nation and he is the one who built us our synagogue." Verse 6, "Jesus went with them.
[time=401] When he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends saying to him, "Lord, do not trouble yourself.
[time=407] For I am not worthy to have you come under my roof.
[time=410] Therefore I did not presume to come to you but say the word and let my servant be healed.
[time=417] For I too am a man set under authority with soldiers under me.
[time=420] There will be a hundred as a centurion and I say to one go, and he goes, and to another come and he comes and to my servant, do this and he does it." When Jesus, you wish your kids would act that way, right?
[time=433] Verse number 9, "When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him."
[time=439] That's one of those words that we're going to dig into.
[time=442] He marveled at him and turning to the crowd that followed him, said, "I tell you not even in Israel have I found such faith, peace, peace." It's the word.
[time=452] It's translated "faithfulness" in the fruit of the Spirit.
[time=454] I haven't seen that kind of faith.
[time=456] Verse 10, "And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant." Well, may God just multiply and bless the reading of his word and our hearts and lives today.
[time=466] And I want to give you two things about God's faithfulness from this passage.
[time=469] The first one comes from verses 1 through 5, and it's simply this, that faithfulness is developed through trouble.
[time=477] I figured I wouldn't get a name in.
[time=478] We don't want to talk about trouble.
[time=479] 2020 has brought plenty of that.
[time=481] Can I get a name in?
[time=482] We can name in that part, but faithfulness is developed through trouble.
[time=486] It really is.
[time=487] And we see that in these first five verses.
[time=489] And it's interesting, and I challenge you to go prove me wrong in this.
[time=493] Go look at the miracles of Jesus.
[time=494] Go look at all of the times that Jesus performed a miracle.
[time=498] And you will find that every time it is in the context of a problem, every time, there's a problem to be solved, there's a need to be met.
[time=507] And every time Jesus does something miraculous and powerful, he speaks into one of those problems and one of those needs, into the troubles of people.
[time=515] And he's still, look at me for a minute, he's still doing it today.
[time=518] And so I don't know what trouble you brought with you today, but God wants to speak into it.
[time=523] And he may not do the miracle that you're hoping that he will do, but he wants to do something miraculous inside of you today.
[time=528] Let's go through those verses, verses 1 through 5 is where we see the context of the trouble here where faithfulness is developed, and Capernaum was Jesus adopted home.
[time=537] He resided there.
[time=538] You can read more about that in Matthew 4, 12 through 16 for the scholars that want to dig a little deeper into this story this week, great passage to look at.
[time=547] But Jesus, you need to understand the background of what just happened.
[time=551] He has just completed delivering what would become the most famous sermon in all of history.
[time=557] And in that sermon, he said three words that still resound today, it echoes today.
[time=563] He said, "Love your enemies." So right after he had preached that, we enter into this story, and in verse 2, guess what?
[time=573] Enter an enemy.
[time=575] The enemy was the centurion because the Jews and the Romans, they didn't just kind of not get along.
[time=580] They were mortal enemies.
[time=581] It was such a divide during this time that there would be pure hatred in almost every case.
[time=587] And now this Roman centurion who oversees a hundred soldiers under the authority, as we
[time=593] read about, will look at even a little bit more, under the authority of the brutal, oppressive Roman Empire.
[time=600] The enemy has now entered the picture, so Jesus has just preached it, and no doubt when the centurion comes, the disciples would be in a place where they were like, "Oh, a Roman's servant is dying, hope he dies." And we don't laugh because it's like, "Well, that's just horrible, but I guarantee you there are things like that." There were chocolates, maybe even from the disciples.
[time=619] The Bible doesn't recount that part, but I'm just guessing there were some of those little things happening.
[time=624] There was that deep of a divide and a hatred that was just spreading everywhere.
[time=629] Does that sound a little familiar, by the way?
[time=631] It was a little like our world.
[time=632] There's so much we can learn from God's word, and a lot of times we think these centuries old context don't apply to us, but boy, history kind of tends to do this, doesn't it?
[time=641] We find ourselves in different ways, through different circumstances, back in the same places, and no doubt, here's where we are again, but let's impact that a little more.
[time=648] Verses three through five.
[time=649] What we see is these Jewish elders, just like Elder Rick Holes came up, and then he did an awesome job helping us remember today, praise God for our elders, and I just want to thank our elders.
[time=658] I want to remind you, we are blessed to have some great men and men of God as elders and amazing leaders, men and women who serve in so many different capacities here in our church to lead, to guide, to pour into young, and old, we are so blessed.
[time=671] And I got to thank our elders for what they do, and I'm reminded as we read this passage, but a Jewish elder would be a very high standard in the Jewish religious system, and now they're
[time=682] coming to Jesus, which that's a whole other story in and itself, because Jesus is really tied to that system.
[time=688] He's teaching in the synagogues and the temples, but he's also pretty well ostracized, and he does ministry, as you can see as you see scripture unfold, he's pretty ostracized from everybody for a while, because he's coming to blow some things up, he's coming to establish God's kingdom in a way that nobody even could fathom at the time, and we still are trying to wrestle with what that means for us today, right?
[time=708] Can I get a name in?
[time=709] If we think we've arrived and got all this faith thing figured out, then Lord help us.
[time=713] We need some humility, but in this moment, we see the Jewish elders speaking on behalf of a Roman centurion.
[time=720] That's an odd request.
[time=721] That's an odd story, and that's why, verse 4, you see them pleading earnestly on his behalf saying, "No, no, no, Jesus, you've got to understand he is worthy, he's worthy of your healing.
[time=730] He's worthy of you.
[time=731] I know we probably shouldn't, and your disciples are murmuring in the background.
[time=735] I don't know what was going on, but you should do this.
[time=738] He even helped build our synagogue.
[time=740] He is in our corner, and what I've got to point out is the similarity between this story and our context today.
[time=746] Have you noticed that there's a pretty big divide, there's a big hyper-partisan ship going on in the world.
[time=752] There's civil unrest, there's pandemic, people are disagreeing over almost everything, and we live in the kind of world where if we don't see exactly eye to eye, then we automatically have to become mortal enemies who hate each other.
[time=765] That's basically our context today.
[time=767] It pretty well ties with the context of this day, but what you find is don't miss this.
[time=772] So much often we'll read through passages like this and miss these things that this context is the same, but what God does, what Jesus shows up to do is use the faith, the faithfulness
[time=783] of a Roman centurion.
[time=785] We'll break that apart more, but he's not a picture of faithfulness in God's kingdom at this point.
[time=791] I don't know where he was at in his walk or what God was doing in his life, but at least his position would prohibit him from being seen as a picture of faithfulness and certainly not a part of the team, if you know what I'm saying.
[time=801] But God shows up and uses the most unlikely of a person to tear down the walls of prejudice
[time=807] and of hatred and of division, and it's only in the same as true today, just like it was
[time=813] true in this ancient context.
[time=815] It is true today that only the blood of Jesus Christ, only his faithfulness given to us
[time=821] and manifest in our life as faith and fruit of the spirit, only Jesus can tear down the
[time=827] walls of prejudice, hatred and division, and may it be so of us, Black Hawk.
[time=832] May people look to us just like this faithfulness displayed in this story and say, I don't know what's going on at Black Hawk, but I need me some of that.
[time=840] There are people who don't see eye to eye, but they still love each other.
[time=843] There are people who are on different sides of aisles on opinions on this or on that.
[time=847] Even in an election season, Black Hawk has this unity, it's a unique unity, and I need some of that.
[time=853] Even for those who don't know Jesus, may they look to us and see an example of the faithfulness and the unity of God.
[time=860] Because only Jesus can tear down the walls of hostility, hatred, and prejudice, and you see it happening in this story with a Roman centurion and even these Jewish elders.
[time=871] I wrote it down this way for you guys, for me, for us, as may we not underestimate the
[time=877] opportunity that today's tensions provide to our faith and faithfulness.
[time=882] It's a platform God wants to use to help us shine bright.
[time=885] Write it down this way.
[time=886] Faithfulness is brightest when troubles are darkest.
[time=891] Maybe you have some troubles.
[time=892] God wants to shine His faithfulness through you, so don't discount your down days.
[time=897] Don't discount what God can do in showcasing His strength on the stage of your weakness, because it's when I am weak that then I am made strong.
[time=905] It's when I decrease that He increases.
[time=909] So may we live that kind of a faith and may our troubles drive us to our faith, not from
[time=915] our faith.
[time=916] Just did a funeral, it's the second funeral that I've done for this poor family in three months' time just on Friday right here in this room.
[time=924] They lost a child, lost a grandad, but yet I see this family sitting right there and they're
[time=932] lifting their hands in worship and they're singing of God's faithfulness at funerals.
[time=936] Folks, that doesn't happen in and of our own strength.
[time=942] We can't offer that kind of faithfulness through our own lives.
[time=947] But God deposits us into us and it shines so bright when troubles are so dark and I often talk to you about the church smile.
[time=953] How many of you have heard me talk about the church smile?
[time=955] If enough of you don't raise your hand, I'll go through the whole spill again.
[time=958] If you don't know the church smiles, that smile you put on, no matter what's going on in your life, no matter how big of a fight you had on the way to church, you step out and do it with me.
[time=967] You put on the church smile and you smile real big and now it's under a mask and now nobody knows.
[time=971] It's awesome, right?
[time=972] For some of you, you've been wanting to hide it for a long time.
[time=974] But the church smile and we believe in being a place where it's okay to not be okay.
[time=978] You can come as broken, messy, sinful people because we are all that.
[time=982] Can I get an amen?
[time=983] I still believe that but I want to dig a little deeper into that illustration for just a minute because here's what faithfulness will do.
[time=989] Here's what the faith of the Spirit, the fruit of the Spirit looks like from faithless people like me.
[time=996] There are times that I don't feel confessions of a pastor.
[time=999] Can I do that?
[time=1000] Is it still a safe space for me to do that?
[time=1002] It's not like this is broadcasting everywhere, right?
[time=1004] So let me give some confessions of a pastor.
[time=1006] There are some days I don't feel like preaching.
[time=1017] There are some days I don't really feel like being a Christian and living out my faith.
[time=1023] There I said it.
[time=1024] If you didn't know that pastors feel that way, guess what?
[time=1026] We're all in this boat together.
[time=1028] We need the fruit of the Spirit because the fruit of Kevin doesn't get me very far.
[time=1032] But what I've learned is that as I display faithfulness, even in frustrating times, that
[time=1039] my feelings will often follow my faith, that if I choose to smile and I'm not saying put
[time=1045] on a fake church smile and don't let people in your circle, that's why we say away with the church smile.
[time=1049] You do that.
[time=1050] You acknowledge your hurt.
[time=1052] You acknowledge your brokenness.
[time=1054] You acknowledge your sinfulness.
[time=1055] You acknowledge your need for a savior.
[time=1057] But at the same time, you take action with your faithfulness because there are times that I smile while I'm still hurting and I don't smile while I'm hurting to be fake.
[time=1066] I smile while I'm hurting to be faithful and the more I let God channel his faithfulness and his energy and his strength through me when I choose to do what is right, even when I don't feel like it, the more my feelings become a caboose that start to catch up and follow me.
[time=1081] If you ever tried that in your life, be faithful even when you don't feel like it.
[time=1085] Show up and serve even though you may not feel like it.
[time=1088] Be a good mom and dad, a good husband or wife, even when it's hard.
[time=1092] Do the right thing.
[time=1093] It is always right to do what is right.
[time=1096] And when we do that, our feelings will start to follow.
[time=1099] Now will they catch up every time?
[time=1100] No, but you will be doing what is right.
[time=1104] So may we not wear church smiles by not acknowledging our hurt and our brokenness, but may we be faithful and have the joy of the Lord, the peace of God, Philippians 4, that passes understanding
[time=1115] that can guard our hearts and our minds in Christ Jesus.
[time=1118] Faithfulness is not a feeling.
[time=1119] It's a foundation even through times of frustration to have the faith to step out as one thing.
[time=1126] I got to speak to somebody as you've had the faith to step out and do something.
[time=1130] Maybe it was to take a job.
[time=1131] Maybe it was to start a ministry.
[time=1133] Maybe it was to serve.
[time=1134] Maybe it was to start giving.
[time=1135] Maybe I don't know what it was, but the faith to step out starts to become negated when we don't have the faithfulness to stick it out.
[time=1143] So don't just step out, but have the faithfulness of God to stick it out.
[time=1148] And this is for somebody who you're ready to throw in the towel on a marriage.
[time=1151] You're ready to throw in the towel on a church.
[time=1153] You're ready to throw in a towel on a relationship.
[time=1156] You're ready to quit that God has called you to step out in faith to do.
[time=1161] And I declare in Jesus' name, stick it out, stick it out, don't give up because the faith
[time=1167] to step out can often and so quickly become negated by the lack of faithfulness to stick it out.
[time=1172] Maybe we stick it out and trust God.
[time=1174] And 2020 gives us quite a platform of trouble to do just that.
[time=1179] You probably brought plenty of trouble on your own to that today.
[time=1182] But the point of your trouble, don't miss this, the point of your trouble is not to prove your faith.
[time=1187] Can I give you a secret look up in for just a second, look at me.
[time=1191] God already knows you have weak faith.
[time=1198] The point of your troubles aren't to prove your faith.
[time=1200] The point of your troubles, the purpose God wants to bring out of your troubles is to prove his faithfulness, even where we are faithless.
[time=1208] So faithfulness is developed through trouble.
[time=1210] Secondly, verses 6 through 10, we see this thing about trust.
[time=1213] So faithfulness is also built on trust, verse 6, I love verse 6, it's just a powerful
[time=1219] picture of humility and what God uses, but in verse 6 Jesus went with them.
[time=1223] And notice, I pray over our staff every week, Lord interrupt our schedules because a lot of times God's biggest interruptions are his biggest invitations.
[time=1231] And even though it doesn't go as according to plan, those are the times God may want to show up and do the most.
[time=1237] And so remember that this week, Jesus demonstrated it in verse 6, Jesus went with them.
[time=1240] They were going one way, he hears of this, he diverts and he goes and meets a need.
[time=1245] I'm glad he still does that in my life, but I love what happens in verse 6.
[time=1248] As he went with them, he was not far from the house when the centurion, he sent friends, saying to him, Lord, do not trouble yourself.
[time=1255] I'm not worthy to have you come under my roof.
[time=1258] And probably the disciples at this point, I would guess, would be saying something like, it's about time.
[time=1263] Finally, this joker says something true.
[time=1265] He's right, Jesus, he's not worthy for you to come in his house.
[time=1268] Let's go.
[time=1269] Let's get out of here.
[time=1270] You know what was going on around Jesus, but Jesus was pretty focused on what he was there to do.
[time=1275] And in verse 7, we see that he says, therefore I didn't presume to come to you, don't miss this, but say the word.
[time=1281] But say the word and let my servant be healed.
[time=1285] He said, heal him from here.
[time=1286] This is a COVID-19 approved healing.
[time=1289] It's a Zoom call.
[time=1290] It's like, here's the Zoom leak, Jesus, you don't have to come in person, just do it from a distance.
[time=1295] Let's social distance and do this healing during this time.
[time=1297] I love that picture here because Jesus wasn't even, he didn't have to be there present physically
[time=1303] to do this healing.
[time=1304] And it reminded me as cute as that may be, this wireless long distance healing that happens
[time=1310] here.
[time=1311] It reminded me of a truth that I often feel, and perhaps you do too, that there are times where God doesn't feel like he is present.
[time=1318] Maybe you're in just such a time right now where you're just looking for God to show up, where he just feels a million miles away.
[time=1324] And I wrote it down this way, that even when God feels far away, he's still close and faithful.
[time=1330] I don't remind you of that today.
[time=1332] Remember in this story that Jesus wasn't even physically present to accomplish this healing in this miracle, yet his power sure was.
[time=1341] He didn't even have to be present for his power to show up.
[time=1344] But the beauty of us and our walk with him is that he is always present.
[time=1347] And if he is present, even in times he doesn't feel that way, you can know and trust that he is close and he is faithful and you've heard in Scripture.
[time=1356] He speaks through this still small voice, a whisper.
[time=1359] Why is it that God's voice is described through a whisper?
[time=1365] I think one reason is to remind us that he's close and if we listen, we'll hear his whisper.
[time=1372] The still small voice.
[time=1374] May you hear his voice, may you listen for the whisper, may you listen for how he wants to speak into your life and even when he feels so far away?
[time=1382] This story reminds us even when his presence feels miles away, he is so close and he is
[time=1389] with us.
[time=1390] Can I get an amen?
[time=1392] Verse 8.
[time=1393] I always used to read verse 8 and wonder, why is that in the passage?
[time=1395] It doesn't really make a lot of sense because in verse 8 he says this about authority.
[time=1399] He says, well, hey, I too am a man under authority with soldiers under me.
[time=1403] And I say to one go and he goes, come and he comes and the servant do this and he does it.
[time=1408] What does that have to do with anything?
[time=1410] But as I read this story, he was finding some common ground with Jesus.
[time=1414] What he had recognized is that he's got authority to command soldiers and then he was noticing
[time=1420] that, you know, and he knew his authority to command soldiers came from a higher authority
[time=1426] being the Roman Empire.
[time=1428] And because big Rome said he could say it, you knew you better not cross this guy.
[time=1432] And so they did what he said.
[time=1433] He says, come, they came and says, go, they go.
[time=1436] And he recognized that while he commanded soldiers in the same way, Jesus commanded illness and death.
[time=1443] And they did what he said.
[time=1445] If Jesus said, be healed, they were healed.
[time=1448] Jesus said, demon, get out of him or her, they left.
[time=1451] If Jesus said, no, he's not dead, he's sleeping, they rose.
[time=1455] And he started to, you wonder what was going through his mind, but you see this picture in that statement of realizing that my higher authority is Rome and I command soldiers.
[time=1464] Your higher authority, I don't really understand exactly what it is, but you command illness and death and it does what you say.
[time=1470] It obeys you.
[time=1471] So I think your higher authority's got to be better than my higher authority.
[time=1474] And so I find this common ground in that we're both under authority, but I think I need some of yours.
[time=1481] And maybe God's doing that in your life.
[time=1483] You have missed what the authority and the power of the name of Jesus can mean in your life.
[time=1489] It really is true as scripture tells us that at the name of Jesus, every knee is going to bow and every tongue is going to confess that he is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[time=1500] And I pray over you and all who listen and all who hear these messages every single week that we would be found faithful and that we simply, here's what being faithful is all boiled down to.
[time=1511] Instead of bowing then, we just bow now.
[time=1516] We bow now to the name of Jesus and you see that faithfulness, that faith building, even
[time=1522] in a Roman centurion, the most unlikely of people.
[time=1526] And then what you see happening in verse 9, look there with me, is that Jesus marveled at his faith.
[time=1532] That word, it's like being amazed.
[time=1534] It's like saying, whoa, everybody say, whoa, wouldn't you want to make Jesus say, whoa,
[time=1541] that's what Jesus did in this passage.
[time=1543] He marveled.
[time=1544] He was amazed at him in both Luke 7 and 9 that we just read.
[time=1548] In Matthew 8, 10, the parallel story of this, use the same Greek word, thalmaso.
[time=1554] And that word is only used, this is the only time in scripture where you have this reaction with that word from Jesus toward the faith of another, except from the opposite context in Mark chapter 6 and verse 6, where Jesus was amazed, Jesus marveled at the lack of faith
[time=1571] of those from his hometown of Nazareth.
[time=1574] It's the only time that we see him thalmaso, marveling, amazed at the faithfulness of somebody
[time=1581] else.
[time=1582] And so it made me start thinking is, well, what did Jesus marvel about then?
[time=1586] I'll tell you what he didn't marvel about.
[time=1588] He wasn't amazed by this man's religious accomplishment.
[time=1591] He would not have much access to a lot of the religious system of the day.
[time=1595] He probably worshipped false gods.
[time=1597] Maybe God was doing, we don't know exactly what God was doing in his life, but as a Roman officer, as a centurion, he certainly wasn't a part of that system.
[time=1605] So it wouldn't be knowledge of the law or religious accomplishment.
[time=1608] And so what was he impressed by?
[time=1610] What made Jesus say, whoa, it was simply his faith to trust Jesus to be who he said he
[time=1618] was.
[time=1619] He had seen all that Jesus had done.
[time=1620] He had seen the evidence of the things hoped for.
[time=1623] He had watched Jesus do things that nobody else could do, and he trusted him.
[time=1628] You say, well, that's not very overwhelming.
[time=1630] It was to Jesus.
[time=1632] And that's what he asked of you.
[time=1634] And that's a good example.
[time=1635] The fact that we go, wait a minute, there's got to be more to it, shows us how religious we often get sometimes.
[time=1640] We try to say that it's Jesus plus something that gives us everything.
[time=1643] No, it's Jesus plus something that gives us nothing, but Jesus plus nothing gives us everything.
[time=1649] And trusting in him is the picture we see in this story.
[time=1652] And it's what God wants from you out of your life.
[time=1654] It really is that simple.
[time=1657] May we embrace it.
[time=1658] May we live it out.
[time=1659] He loves you so much in this picture and this story that is painted for us reminds us of this statement.
[time=1665] I've taught you this many times, but it's that what you do for God is never going to be as important as who you are to God.
[time=1672] He really doesn't need us that much anyway, but boy, he loves us.
[time=1676] Who you are to God far exceeds what you could ever do for God.
[time=1680] And then the fruit of the Spirit comes in and you're equipped and you do things for God that you could never do in and of your own strength because of who you are to God.
[time=1689] And a lot of times we say, well, I got to do some things for God before I can be something to God.
[time=1693] And he says, no, who you are to me's got to come first and then I'll do something through you.
[time=1698] You'll do something for me that far exceeds what you could do on your own.
[time=1701] The end of verse nine.
[time=1703] This is a pretty powerful statement.
[time=1704] Look there again with me.
[time=1705] He marveled at him and then turning to the crowd that followed him.
[time=1708] He said, I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith, peace, peace, peace.
[time=1714] That's the Greek word.
[time=1715] Same one.
[time=1716] That's faithfulness in Galatians 5.
[time=1717] And all of Israel.
[time=1718] Now listen, this is such a slap in the face of the religious system, of religious leaders,
[time=1725] of these Jewish elders, even of his disciples.
[time=1728] Because that's saying in all of these systems, I found stronger faith in a Roman centurion than I've found in the synagogues.
[time=1736] Wow.
[time=1738] That is a big bold statement.
[time=1741] And today it reminds us of what Jesus looks for and it reminds me that maybe sometimes I think I miss what he's looking for.
[time=1749] He wants trust because faithfulness is built on trust.
[time=1753] Jesus is not impressed by religiosity, but he marvels at a relationship, this characterized
[time=1759] by faith and trust.
[time=1762] Really is that simple.
[time=1764] Verse 10, we see Jesus respond and when those who had been sent return to the house, they found the servant well.
[time=1770] Verse 10, Jesus responds to the faithfulness of this centurion with more faithfulness.
[time=1776] Did you know that's what God does?
[time=1778] Even when you are faithless, God is still faithful.
[time=1782] He responds to our faithlessness with faithfulness.
[time=1786] But when we are faithful, like the centurion, he adds even more faithfulness.
[time=1791] He does things even more exceedingly abundantly above all we could ask or think.
[time=1796] It doesn't mean that God does the miracle the way you said he should do it or the way you're hoping you'll do it, but he does more than you could ever ask or imagine.
[time=1802] And a lot of times it's in us that he does those things, but you see it happening here in verse 10.
[time=1808] We serve a faithful God who shows up with faithfulness whether we are faithful or not.
[time=1813] He is always on the throne.
[time=1815] He is never surprised and he cannot be thwarted.
[time=1820] I don't know about you, but I'm just encouraged by that in today's world.
[time=1823] I need to hear that as often as possible in today's world.
[time=1827] So we have confidence in Jesus because of his faithfulness.
[time=1829] It's the substance of the things that we can't see.
[time=1832] The evidence of all the stuff that we hope for he brews reminds us.
[time=1837] And what he's asking for from us is a lot like I'll be a dad for a moment.
[time=1841] I feel most honored by my children who are over here.
[time=1844] I'll walk this way.
[time=1847] They don't know what I'm about to do to him.
[time=1848] I'm not going to embarrass you too bad.
[time=1850] They looked at me like, "Dad, we'll talk about this at home." But I feel most honored by my kids when they just trust me.
[time=1859] That like if I show up late and this happened recently, you know, show up a few minutes late to dinner or something because something comes up.
[time=1865] That they go, "Oh, he has a good reason.
[time=1867] It's dad." They just trust me.
[time=1870] And I think they do most of the time.
[time=1872] But I feel honored as a dad when they trust me that much.
[time=1877] When my wife trusts me that much and says, "Well, it's Kevin.
[time=1880] It's dad.
[time=1881] I just trust him.
[time=1882] Whatever happened." I know it was for a good reason.
[time=1885] I just trust him.
[time=1886] You know what God wants from you?
[time=1888] That.
[time=1889] That on steroids.
[time=1890] He wants you to say, "I don't get why God showed up late.
[time=1894] I don't get why he's not answering the prayer, but he's dad and I trust him."
[time=1902] That's it.
[time=1904] Trusting through trouble.
[time=1906] And write it down this way.
[time=1907] It's transformation that becomes the product of trusting through trouble.
[time=1913] Transformation.
[time=1914] You want God to change your heart?
[time=1916] Trust Him even when it doesn't make sense.
[time=1919] Trust Him even when there's trouble, just like we see happening in the story.
[time=1923] I want to leave you with a question to tie all this together today because what thrills and amazes and makes God marvel, marvelous faith, trusting Him.
[time=1932] So I ask you today, what trouble do you need to faithfully trust God with this week?
[time=1939] What trouble?
[time=1940] Do you bring any?
[time=1941] What do you need to faithfully trust God with?
[time=1945] This week.
[time=1946] Not next week.
[time=1947] This week.
[time=1948] Buy your head to close your eyes with me, if you will, and reflect on what is the answer to that question for you.
[time=1953] What trouble should you be trusting into the hands of an almighty God?
[time=1957] And even if you don't get what he's up to, you say, "You know what?
[time=1961] It's okay.
[time=1962] I trust him because he's dad, daddy, I'm a father, and I trust him."
[time=1969] Believers that are in the room, I want to pray for you at a moment.
[time=1970] And I believe some of you right now, you have a very specific thing that you're trying to trust into God's hands.
[time=1975] And I want to pray for that in a moment.
[time=1976] Would you lift your hand and say, "I really, I know exactly what trouble I need to trust into God's hands." Lift your hand, lift it high, proclaim it, just lift it for yourself.
[time=1983] There's power and acknowledgement.
[time=1984] Thank you.
[time=1985] Praise God all over the room.
[time=1986] Thank you.
[time=1988] I see all of you.
[time=1989] And God does even more.
[time=1990] You can put your hands down.
[time=1991] Somebody else in the room, though, it's time for you to trust in Jesus today.
[time=1994] And your next acknowledgement is going to be to lift your hand and say, "Yeah, I'm trusting in Jesus.
[time=1998] You know it's time.
[time=1999] Maybe you're at home.
[time=2000] Maybe you're there.
[time=2001] You're in the room.
[time=2002] Wherever you're at, God knows your heart.
[time=2003] But listen, the good news and the beginning of trust is admitting that I need a Savior
[time=2010] because of my sin.
[time=2011] I fall short of God's glory, woefully short.
[time=2014] But I believe Jesus is who he said he was.
[time=2017] If a Roman centurion can believe it, so can I.
[time=2019] He paid the price for my sin.
[time=2021] I could never pay for myself by living that sinless life.
[time=2024] I could never live on my own.
[time=2027] And he rose from the dead.
[time=2028] And as he rose from the dead, he won the victory that I could never win.
[time=2032] I believe it.
[time=2033] I admit those things.
[time=2035] But thirdly, I confess God's not going to save you because of a prayer or because of words or because I'm here to facilitate it.
[time=2041] God wants a surrendered, trusting heart.
[time=2044] Maybe it's time to stop trusting in you to save you, but start trusting in Jesus.
[time=2049] If that's you and your own words, we ask him to save you right now and he will do just that.
[time=2054] I want to give you a moment to pray over these things.
[time=2058] What a beautiful sight it is to the Lord to see his children choosing to trust him.
[time=2080] I believe he's marveled and amazed and thrilled in this moment, but nothing thrills him more
[time=2086] according to the words of Jesus himself than when a sinner like us finds repentance.
[time=2090] It means we turn from us, we turn to him, we turn from the old us, and we let him make all things new.
[time=2097] Some of you have done that today and all heads are bowed and eyes are closed.
[time=2100] I'm going to do two things.
[time=2101] I'm going to pray for you to welcome you to God's family and I'm going to give you next step.
[time=2104] So if that is you right now, you say I gave my life to Jesus, I nailed it down today in this place.
[time=2109] Would you lift your hand in the room?
[time=2110] Do it at home as well.
[time=2111] God sees you even though I can't lift it.
[time=2112] Lift it high right now.
[time=2113] Say pray for me pastor.
[time=2114] I gave my life to Jesus.
[time=2116] I see you.
[time=2117] Who else?
[time=2118] Lift it.
[time=2119] Lift it high.
[time=2120] I see you.
[time=2121] God bless you.
[time=2122] I see you.
[time=2123] God bless you.
[time=2124] My brother.
[time=2125] Praise God.
[time=2126] All over the place.
[time=2127] Look at home wherever you're at.
[time=2128] Lift your hand.
[time=2129] God sees you.
[time=2130] I can't see you, but God's there.
[time=2132] He's right in your midst and he's welcoming you to his family.
[time=2135] Let me do that right now for all of us.
[time=2136] God, thank you for those in the room, those in different places all over the globe perhaps.
[time=2141] We never know God, but certainly in the homes around here.
[time=2144] We thank you for those who have trusted in you both for the trouble that they have in their life.
[time=2149] But even greater God, the heavens are roaring today for those who have trusted you as Savior and Lord of their life to save them from their sin and give them a home, not in this place called hell, but in eternal life in heaven, in the glory and the presence of the Lord.
[time=2164] God, we thank you for that trust that leads to this transformation from the inside out.
[time=2169] God, we commit together to walk on that journey as a part of your church, God, we celebrate with the angels in heaven and we pray all this in the powerful, the naturalists, the glorious, the marvelous, the amazing, the everlasting, God, the name above every name,
[time=2186] the name at which every knee will bow and every tongue will confess and God we bow and we confess today and we pray all this in the powerful name of Jesus and all God's people said,
[time=2197] [AMEN] Let's celebrate.
[time=2199] Let's welcome these to the family of God in this place today in the room, at home, God sees you, He loves you, we welcome you to the family of God.
[time=2208] We're going to trust Him together.
