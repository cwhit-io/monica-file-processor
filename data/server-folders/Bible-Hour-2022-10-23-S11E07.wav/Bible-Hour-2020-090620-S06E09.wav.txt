[time=0] - Praise God for what surrender brings about.
[time=3] And I can't think of a better group of people to just live a surrendered life with today.
[time=7] So thank you for joining us today.
[time=9] I wanna invite you in your Bibles to two places.
[time=12] We're gonna be in Galatians chapter five, which has been this whole series.
[time=16] And then we'll be in first Peter towards the end of your Bible.
[time=19] First Peter chapter three in just a moment.
[time=22] But as we look at what it looks like to live a surrendered kind of life together, I just want you to know church, wherever you may be, I'm thankful for you.
[time=30] And I know God's got a very special word for you, whether you're at home, scattered around, wherever you may be or in the room.
[time=36] It's good to be family.
[time=37] And it's good to have some of my own family from Alabama here with me today.
[time=42] And so yeah, we've got some southerners in the house.
[time=44] And so we're grateful to have you guys just love family.
[time=48] And I love to be a part of the Black Hawk family.
[time=50] And speaking of family before I get into today's message, I wanna make sure you're aware of one thing.
[time=55] September 13th is gonna be a big day here at Black Hawk, September the 13th.
[time=60] That is two Sundays from today.
[time=62] As you've probably noticed by now, if you've been listening tuning in, paying attention to all things Black Hawk these days, we've been in an effort of relaunching our student ministry, youth ministry, kids ministry.
[time=74] And that looks a little different these days.
[time=76] We've successfully launched our school and it has kicked off.
[time=80] Can I get an amen?
[time=81] Can we give it up for Jesus for all that he's done so far?
[time=84] Absolutely.
[time=86] But we wanna continue that effort and we wanna keep you informed and we're trying to communicate well.
[time=91] And we've been getting a lot of questions.
[time=92] You know, how's Black Hawk doing?
[time=93] What does Black Hawk look like?
[time=95] And in a world full of bad news, not only do we wanna communicate well, but we wanna celebrate well.
[time=100] We need in a world full of bad news, some good news.
[time=103] And so we're gonna give you a praise report and just have a Sunday of biblical challenge to lean into this continued season of unique ministry.
[time=111] And if it's been nothing else, it's been unique.
[time=113] Am I right about it?
[time=114] But so come September 13th, all of our services, you'll hear updates on all the above.
[time=119] So our elders will be here with me, we should be sharing some updates and I can't wait to spend that special day with you.
[time=125] And so as we dig into this season, we've been digging into the fruit of the spirit and as Galatians chapter five, and I'll read verses 22 and 23, they'll be on the screen, but primarily today we'll be in first Peter, first Peter chapter three.
[time=138] And each week I've been trying to give you some kind of an application assignment to go home with.
[time=142] And last week that application assignment was about trouble and trust.
[time=147] And the assignment was to trust God with your trouble this week.
[time=150] And so I ask you, have you been trusting God with some trouble this week?
[time=154] And if you answer it as yes, then I believe that you've seen God to be faithful.
[time=159] If your answer is no, you're in the right place because I wanna point you to a God who is trustworthy and a fruit that he brings about and we can't bring it about ourselves.
[time=167] Today I wanna talk to you about fearless gentleness.
[time=171] Those are two words you don't often hear put together, fearless gentleness.
[time=175] But biblically those words go really well together and I wanna unpack how today because we're looking at the fruit of the spirit that we're in a war, the flesh and the fruit of God, myself and the spirit of God.
[time=186] There's just a constant battle and tension in the world.
[time=190] And you've probably noticed that.
[time=191] And if ever there's a season that the world needs some fruit of the spirit, it is this season.
[time=196] So we're going through love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness today and self-control next week.
[time=204] We're calling it refresh and maybe you need some refreshment for your walk with God in your life today, I think you're in the right place.
[time=211] Let's look at Galatians chapter five and I'll read to you verses 22 and 23.
[time=217] Galatians chapter five, 22.
[time=219] But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.
[time=227] Against such things there is no law.
[time=230] Now this word, gentleness.
[time=232] We were looking at the original language that it was written in because what we're finding is not only A, how these words love joy, peace, patience, all of these words we're looking at, how they're used in the rest of the Bible.
[time=243] Not only did those things give us a really powerful glimpse into a deeper meaning of these words than what we see on the surface, but B, we are also finding that not only does the Bible in its holistic picture give us that glimpse, that the word itself in English, we often don't have words to describe some of what this means.
[time=260] And this word is a good example.
[time=262] It's preutes in the Greek.
[time=264] We're gonna put it on the screen, the transliteration of it anyway.
[time=267] And here's how it's translated.
[time=268] Three different ways in the New Testament.
[time=270] You'll find it as gentleness, like what we're gonna see today, meekness and courtesy.
[time=275] And then you'll also see that it represents humility.
[time=278] It has this picture of a condition of your mind and heart, an internal condition, an internal position inside of you
[time=288] that allows you to display grace in the power of strong character.
[time=292] You're starting to see a picture of fearless gentleness because really it takes strong, powerful, godly, manly, beautiful, powerful, fearless grace to be gentle, especially in a world like we live in today.
[time=307] And the Bible, Jesus himself embodies that kind of a picture.
[time=311] It's used 11 times in the New Testament, this same word, preutes.
[time=315] And it's six times gentleness, four times meekness, one time courtesy.
[time=320] And that one time courtesy is when I preach to you from Titus three, one through 11 on kindness.
[time=326] We looked at that translation.
[time=327] But in today's passage, first Peter chapter three, gonna read to you from verses eight through 18, verse 15, we see this same word, gentleness.
[time=337] And I want us to see how it is the heart of the, yes, this passage, but also of some ways we are called as people of God to be fearless in today's world.
[time=347] No doubt fear has gripped you in one way or another in these days.
[time=350] We're at least afraid of the economy.
[time=352] We're at least afraid of illness.
[time=354] We're at least afraid of impacts of our nation in a time like this.
[time=358] There's all kinds of fears.
[time=360] But some of you are dealing with fears that aren't such big in all encompassing fears.
[time=364] They're very personal fears.
[time=365] And maybe nobody even knows what you're truly fearing today, but fearless gentleness, I believe, will intersect your life in a way that'll be powerful.
[time=373] And in Peter, here's the thing.
[time=375] We're gonna be in first Peter this Sunday to look at gentleness.
[time=378] Next Sunday, I'll be in second Peter because self-control is used, the same word that is used in Galatians five is used in second Peter, chapter one, verses one through nine.
[time=388] But Peter is writing, get this, to a context.
[time=391] In the first century, the Roman Empire is the America of its day.
[time=396] It has the biggest military, has the biggest economy, has the biggest global footprint.
[time=401] It is dominant.
[time=402] It's like an America of today, but interestingly enough, it looked a little bit like what I'm seeing on the news today.
[time=409] This Roman Empire and Peter's writing to the church during this time dominated by this empire, there was a lot of infighting.
[time=416] There was a lot of division.
[time=418] There were a lot of conflicts that were racial, political, economic, and even regional that they were experiencing.
[time=425] And so Peter's writing into this season about how, and this is what I wanna teach you about today, how to display godly gentleness through conflict and suffering.
[time=434] How do we display a godly gentleness through conflict and suffering?
[time=440] I don't know about you, but I don't find that very easy to do oftentimes.
[time=443] I tend to be less gentle when I'm suffering.
[time=445] I've got three kids, a couple of them, they're all very different.
[time=450] Have you noticed that about kids?
[time=451] You noticed that about people?
[time=453] We're gonna look at that a little more today.
[time=454] But my three kids, two of which are in the room right now, when they get hurt, you get physically injured.
[time=460] A couple of them, they really wanna be consoled, talk to, they're okay with that.
[time=464] A hug is good, those kind of things.
[time=466] But then one of my little ones is a lot like me.
[time=470] When I get injured, when I stumped my toe on something, I tend to get a lot less gentle and a lot more mean, to be honest with you.
[time=478] It's kind of like, oh, daddy, okay, it's like, no, just go away, just give me a minute.
[time=483] Just go away, hold on, just give me a second.
[time=488] So how many of you are like that too?
[time=490] All right, I've got three.
[time=491] Okay, some of you are honest, good.
[time=493] And that's the truth of the culture and the climate of the world, is it not?
[time=497] When things get tough, when things get painful.
[time=500] Most of the time, we're a lot like me, when I stub my toe, we get a lot less gentle.
[time=505] We stomp around and we clench our fists, so we grit our teeth and we say, just leave me alone.
[time=511] But today, God wants you to fearlessly lean into a kind of gentleness that I think is gonna take you to new heights in your faith and new heights of showing the faith and the love of Jesus in the lives of those around you.
[time=523] Gentleness fosters these really two fearless steps that we'll look at today.
[time=529] Wherever you're at today, I believe you need some gentleness because it's gonna foster some fearlessness that's gonna be captured in this passage and the flesh and the fruit are at war in this passage.
[time=538] So let's look at those two things.
[time=539] The first one comes from first Peter, chapter three versus eight through 12.
[time=543] Then we'll reverse his 13 through 18 to look at the second one.
[time=546] But gentleness is in verse 15 and it is the heart of all that I'm gonna share with you today.
[time=550] The first one is this, represent heaven in a hellish world.
[time=555] Have you noticed that the world looks a lot less like heaven and a whole lot more like hell in today's times?
[time=562] And no doubt some of you came and you think, well, that's a mighty strong language pastor, but you, if you're honest, would say you've been living in that kind of world and when you look around, we see that, but our call as believers is to give people around us a picture of heaven.
[time=578] And Peter is writing in this context of division and strife and conflict and suffering and slander and even persecution of the church and he gives us a picture of how to do that.
[time=589] So let's read first Peter chapter three verses eight through 12 where we see our call to represent heaven.
[time=595] You ready for the word again this morning?
[time=597] I just love God's word and he's as much of it as I can get in my life.
[time=600] Let's be honest, let's dig him together.
[time=602] First Peter chapter three verse eight.
[time=604] Finally, all of you have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart and a humble mind.
[time=610] Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless.
[time=616] For those, for to this you are called that you may obtain a blessing verse 10, for whoever desires to love life and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking to seed, let him turn away from evil and do good, let him seek peace and pursue it for the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are open to their prayer.
[time=637] But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.
[time=640] Verse 10 through 12 is actually a quote of Psalm 34 as I'll show you in a moment.
[time=644] But before that, we see in verse eight alone, these five things that give us a picture of heaven for call to represent heaven while we're on earth and earth doesn't often look like heaven, especially these days, then what does that mean?
[time=657] And we get five things.
[time=658] First of all is unity of mind, but you notice at the beginning of verse eight, he says two things, he says finally, which is saying to sum all of this up.
[time=667] This is the point, this is what I want you to know.
[time=669] These are the big takeaways.
[time=670] And then he says finally, all of you, that means nobody's excluded.
[time=674] So for those of you who think this is just a good time for a restroom break, it applies to you and me and all of us, if we call Jesus Lord, then this is to us today.
[time=683] And then he says unity of mind, have this unity of mind.
[time=685] And I wanna remind us of unity.
[time=687] That's a word that's used a lot today because the opposite is so prevalent in our culture, is that unity is not uniformity.
[time=694] Did you know the only place that you're gonna find everybody agreeing on absolutely everything is a cult?
[time=700] (laughs) It's just true, people just don't agree on everything.
[time=706] So unity doesn't mean that everybody agrees on everything.
[time=709] You know what unity is?
[time=711] Unity is where I value the relationships in my life.
[time=714] Those that God has called me to be a part of a family with I value relationships more than these secondary issues.
[time=721] Doesn't mean you don't hold to the primary issues.
[time=723] We do that.
[time=724] In fact, we're gonna be looking at a lot of those primary issues in the weeks ahead so that we can be more unified as a church.
[time=729] But what it does mean is that things that often divide us, we gotta ask the question, are they eternal things?
[time=735] Are they temporary things?
[time=736] Are they primary things?
[time=737] Or are they secondary things?
[time=739] And so many times we fight for issues that won't be eternal before we fight for the relationships that God has called us to.
[time=746] That's unity, that's unity of mine.
[time=748] It's where I value that above things that shouldn't matter to me in an eternal sense.
[time=754] It doesn't mean we agree on everything.
[time=755] It means that what we disagree on can be overtaken by the unity of the Spirit and Jesus Christ and what He's called us to.
[time=762] So maybe we'd be that.
[time=763] And then comes sympathy, secondly.
[time=766] This means I wanna understand so I can help you.
[time=769] I wanna understand you so I can walk with you.
[time=774] So I can be in fellowship with you, walking beside you.
[time=778] And when there's no sympathy, there's no civility.
[time=782] Have you noticed that?
[time=784] When we don't empathize, when we don't sympathize, there's no civility, we just get mean like when we stub our toe.
[time=790] It's not gentle, it's quite the opposite than gentle.
[time=793] And so Peter reminds us of that.
[time=795] And brotherly love is number three.
[time=797] This is caring for people like family.
[time=798] It's trying to win people, not win arguments.
[time=801] And then it's a tender heart.
[time=803] And over 900 times in the Bible, we see a picture of heart.
[time=808] The Bible speaks to our heart because our health follows our heart.
[time=811] It's internal to external in Scripture.
[time=813] And so we need a tender heart.
[time=815] And that comes from gentleness as does a humble mind.
[time=818] Number five, we're willing to listen and learn.
[time=820] And I wanna give you today four words that could change the world and your world.
[time=824] You ready for them?
[time=824] They're not near as profound as you think, but you probably don't use them.
[time=828] If you're like me, near as much as you ought to, here they are.
[time=830] You ready for them?
[time=831] Four words to change the world.
[time=832] I could be wrong.
[time=836] And I'm not saying don't share your heart.
[time=840] I'm not saying don't walk with people.
[time=842] I'm not saying don't share opinions.
[time=845] But I am saying that if we would take a posture of gentleness and say, you know what?
[time=849] I could be wrong, but I feel this.
[time=853] Then guess what they might do?
[time=854] We know what?
[time=855] I might be wrong too.
[time=856] And then before long, guess what we're having?
[time=858] A conversation.
[time=860] And those things just change the world.
[time=862] And I say that with some sarcasm, but I say that because I think our world needs a lot more of it.
[time=867] And those things, this picture of heaven will give us a picture of what God intends for us.
[time=872] And it paves the way for gentleness and gentleness paves the way for these things.
[time=875] Then in verse nine, it starts to get applied.
[time=877] Verse nine, look there again, he says, "Don't repay evil for evil, that's works.
[time=882] "And don't repay reviling for reviling, that's words." And so he's saying with your works, evil for evil, and with your words, reviling for reviling, make sure that you do it with gentleness.
[time=892] Don't do the repay thing.
[time=894] In this world today, on the contrary, what does he say, by the way?
[time=898] He says, "Bless." And let me just clarify something.
[time=901] We're looking at the original language for a lot of these words.
[time=903] The Greek for blessed does not mean stab.
[time=906] On the contrary, no, blessed means blessed.
[time=910] It doesn't mean stab, it doesn't mean injure, it doesn't mean kick, it means to love, it means to be gentle, it means to bless while others curse you to turn the other cheek.
[time=918] And this was written before social media.
[time=921] And so the need for this verse has only increased as the years have gone by.
[time=926] We often live by the mantra of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, have you ever heard that before?
[time=931] But here's the problem with that philosophy and mentality.
[time=934] Before long, we're all blind and toothless.
[time=936] I think today's world is getting more and more blind and more and more toothless, and we need some gentleness.
[time=944] And I know what some of you are thinking, if you're like me, 'cause I'm a tough guy.
[time=948] So yeah, but that's just weak, pastor.
[time=950] I'm not called to be weak, I'm called to be strong.
[time=953] And as we go through the rest of today's passage, I think what you're gonna find is real strength doesn't always look like what the world calls real strength.
[time=960] Real strength looks a lot more like Jesus, who, yeah, he got called weak.
[time=965] But boy, we know today how strong our Jesus is.
[time=968] If you don't, I pray you will as we go through our time today, and as believers today, I think we have an unprecedented opportunity not to let the things do us this.
[time=976] Out there, change who we are in here.
[time=979] And the world wants to change who you think you are, how you think you're supposed to operate as a part of the family of God.
[time=986] And meek is not weak, because meek is just Jesus.
[time=990] Jesus displayed meekness, and it's a fearless gentleness.
[time=993] You should write that down, meek is not weak.
[time=997] Gentleness is not weakness.
[time=1000] Gentleness is a lot of what Jesus displayed for us.
[time=1004] And then in verses 10 through 12, we see a quote of Psalm 34.
[time=1008] You should read Psalm 34 this week, great chapter, great Psalm for you to read, good devotion material for you this week.
[time=1014] That's what Peter is quoting there in verses 10 through 12.
[time=1017] But it's the character of Jesus.
[time=1018] And in those verses, we see five promises, really, that if you want these things, and he's saying this is what you will get as you follow Jesus, I'll give him to you briefly is love life, see good days, enjoy peace, answer our prayers, and deal with evil doers.
[time=1032] That's what you see in that Psalm 34 quote there.
[time=1035] Wouldn't you like to love life, see some good days?
[time=1038] Wouldn't you like to see God just continue to answer prayers as you enjoy peace and see him deal with evil doers?
[time=1045] I would like to see some of that.
[time=1046] And as we represent heaven in a world that often looks quite the opposite, that's what we will find as we trust in Jesus.
[time=1052] But it takes some fearless gentleness.
[time=1055] The second thing comes from verses 13 through 18.
[time=1058] I want to read them together, but first I'll tell you what this is moving into.
[time=1061] The heading for this passage in my Bible says suffering for righteousness sake.
[time=1065] Maybe you feel like you're doing that.
[time=1067] Suffering is kind of prevalent these days.
[time=1069] And so this next passage reminds us of a fearless application of gentleness that we are called to use suffering as an opportunity for God's spirit.
[time=1079] We're called to use suffering as an opportunity for God's spirit.
[time=1083] I don't know about you when I stubbed my toe.
[time=1086] I don't think this is an opportunity for God's spirit to work in my life and make me a better person and help my kids see Jesus through me.
[time=1094] I don't really think that way.
[time=1095] I think, get away, leave me alone, go.
[time=1099] And that's what's happening in our world today, but God's calling us to change our picture of suffering.
[time=1105] And I don't know what suffering you brought, but I know you brought something.
[time=1108] We all suffer in different ways and this world has brought about a new kind of suffering and even a new kind of strife and division and even persecution and painfulness for the church.
[time=1118] And if we're called to be the church and walk as the church, it's not an if this happens to us.
[time=1123] It's a when and how this happens to us.
[time=1125] And so we're called to use our suffering as an opportunity for God's spirit, not for myself.
[time=1129] And as we read this passage, you'll see how we can dig into that.
[time=1133] Verse 13, first Peter chapter three.
[time=1135] Now who is there to harm you if you're a zealous for what is good?
[time=1140] But even if you should suffer for righteousness sake, you will be blessed.
[time=1144] Just like we were told to bless when we're persecuted or when there's suffering, we're gonna be blessed is what we see here.
[time=1151] Then we continue, have no fear of them, nor be troubled.
[time=1156] But in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy this verse changed my life this week.
[time=1162] I've never looked at it the way that God's illuminated it to and I can't wait to share it with you.
[time=1166] But honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you yet do it with, here's our word, gentleness and respect.
[time=1178] Having a good conscience so that when you are slandered, not if, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame for it is better to suffer for doing good if that should be God's will than for doing evil, for Christ also suffered.
[time=1194] Once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but being made alive in the spirit.
[time=1205] Love that passage, I wanna break it apart verse by verse with us.
[time=1208] You see a picture of the self versus the spirit in this passage, this word that we're in.
[time=1212] But what you find and what you read there is that suffering becomes this stage for the spirit's strategy in your life.
[time=1220] It's not just this thing that we have to endure, it becomes a stage for God to step onto a platform for your pain to point to purpose.
[time=1229] A stage for the spirit's work, his strategy to grow you in your life.
[time=1234] And when you start to look at life that way, it changes your perspective from the inside out.
[time=1238] Verses 13 and 14 tells us, don't fear them.
[time=1241] I don't know what, who's your them?
[time=1242] Just think about it on the inside.
[time=1244] Somebody that may be a mean to you.
[time=1245] Somebody that's slandering you.
[time=1247] Somebody that's telling lies on you.
[time=1249] Some thing that's happened to you.
[time=1251] Whatever that may look like in your life, that's what Peter's writing to you about.
[time=1254] And a lot of times it is believers in the church and we hurt each other and we stab each other.
[time=1260] We think that blessing the Greek is stab and we stab each other and hurt each other, but no.
[time=1265] And we miss the point, but when that happens, here's a prescription for you.
[time=1269] Don't fear them, don't fear them.
[time=1271] Don't fear that thing.
[time=1272] Don't fear that person.
[time=1274] Or be troubled is what he tells us today.
[time=1277] Why? Because you're blessed.
[time=1279] Let me give you two ways that a Christian can get in trouble today.
[time=1282] Are you ready for them?
[time=1284] It's really profound.
[time=1285] Number one, fear of Christian and you want to get into trouble today, do what is wrong.
[time=1289] The world will be pretty pleased, but it really won't be aligning you with the fruit of the Spirit.
[time=1293] Do something wrong.
[time=1294] Number two, do something right.
[time=1296] You want to get in trouble as a Christian today?
[time=1298] Do something wrong.
[time=1300] Number two, do something right.
[time=1302] And then God's please and then everybody around you thinks you're crazy.
[time=1306] You've lost your mind and you're in trouble either way.
[time=1308] Is that not a good description of today's world?
[time=1310] I guess what that means.
[time=1312] You ready?
[time=1312] It means you're going to have trouble.
[time=1314] It's almost like Jesus knew this in John 1633 where he says, these things I've spoken to you that in me you can have peace in the world, you will have trouble, but you can take heart because I have overcome the world.
[time=1325] It's not if we're going to have trouble.
[time=1326] It's when we're going to have trouble, how we're going to have trouble.
[time=1328] And then in these verses 13 and 14, we see a couple of ways we can respond to trouble.
[time=1332] Number one is fear them.
[time=1334] That's lash out.
[time=1335] That's an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
[time=1337] That's you punch me, I'm going to punch back even harder.
[time=1341] It's lash out.
[time=1342] And that's going to lead to fearing others because you're doing everything you're doing in response to what other people do to you.
[time=1348] Or number two, you can honor him.
[time=1350] Fear them or honor him.
[time=1352] Them, him.
[time=1353] Fear them, honor him.
[time=1354] Instead of lashing out, we're called to love well.
[time=1357] And I want to give you a word of encouragement today, my friend.
[time=1360] I know some of you came in miserable today.
[time=1363] I believe your greatest ministry will often come out of your greatest times of misery.
[time=1369] When I look back at just the walk of faith, the journey of faith of walking with God, the times that I was most miserable, when I look back on him, not while I'm walking through him, it's to stub the toe reaction while I'm walking through him.
[time=1381] Let's get away.
[time=1383] But when I look back on him, I really realized those are the times where God really grew my faith the most.
[time=1388] And some of my greatest ministry opportunities have come out of the times where I felt the most miserable.
[time=1393] And then now I want to walk you to verse 15 because it helps you understand how that can be applied to your life.
[time=1397] 'Cause some of your life, hey pastor, sounds great.
[time=1399] I'd love to have some ministry out of my misery, but I just feel plain miserable.
[time=1405] So how do I get past my misery?
[time=1407] Great question, I'm glad you asked.
[time=1409] Verse 15 answers that question.
[time=1410] 'Cause verse 14, we see this question posed, or I see a command, but becomes a question, at least for me, of how can I in times of persecution or suffering or slander or all these things that Peter mentions?
[time=1421] How can I stay grounded in Jesus?
[time=1424] How can I not be troubled?
[time=1426] How can I not fear those things?
[time=1428] If you've ever asked that, I'm glad you're here today because I'm gonna break verse 15 to the three parts.
[time=1433] First part, he says, "Honor Christ the Lord as holy." In your hearts, honor Christ the Lord as holy.
[time=1441] The word holy is the same original Greek word as hallowed in the Lord's prayer.
[time=1448] In the Lord's prayer, when we pray the Lord's prayer, our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be that name, that kingdom come, that will be done on earth as it is.
[time=1454] In heaven, hallowed is the same word as holy.
[time=1457] It means set apart.
[time=1458] It means that there's this big distinction of priority and a value.
[time=1464] It means that it's set apart as holy, as precious, as above everything else, as supreme, as consuming.
[time=1472] It means you put this above anything else in your life.
[time=1477] It's hallowed.
[time=1479] So Father, may your name be hallowed, but in this passage, the answer to how do I not live in trouble?
[time=1484] How do I not live in fear?
[time=1486] Hallowed Jesus, sanctified Jesus.
[time=1489] It means set him apart as holy, as above everything else in your life.
[time=1493] You say, well, that seems very simple, but is it?
[time=1496] I know I struggle with that in my own life.
[time=1498] And some of you are wondering what my thing is over here.
[time=1501] I wanna show you.
[time=1502] This is a pedestal of your priorities.
[time=1508] And you got a couple of choices.
[time=1511] In this passage, we see him and we see them.
[time=1514] What's your them?
[time=1516] What's the thing that is most frustrating and difficult to you right now?
[time=1520] Who, the ones that, as Peter writes, don't have any fear of them.
[time=1525] But some of us live like, oh, I gotta get their approval.
[time=1529] Top tier, top priority, supreme, hallowed.
[time=1533] And some of you are living with all of your focus and all of your energy, focusing on them, focusing on those things.
[time=1541] Focusing if you start from this way and you read like Hebrew and go right to left, M-E, me.
[time=1546] Maybe it's me, the me in the them is what's tripping you up.
[time=1550] Maybe it's the them, maybe it's the that thing, maybe it's the bank account, maybe it's this problem or that problem.
[time=1555] And it's on the top tier of your life.
[time=1557] Oh, but he's still here, him, eight capital letters.
[time=1560] Jesus, he's still here, but he goes down here.
[time=1562] And I know it's a simple illustration, but my prayer is that you have this locked into your brain this week because some of you think, really, like I do, some of us think that we're gonna have peace and we're not gonna live troubled and we're not gonna have fear when we live a life that truly is built on this foundation and premise, that the pedestal of our priorities, Jesus is there, but really and truly when it comes down to it, we're putting everything else before him.
[time=1591] And that's the whole point of the fruit of the spirit is that it's not his, it's not my ability.
[time=1597] It's not the me that gets me there.
[time=1599] It's when I swap that and I take the me and the them and all of these things and I, you know, they matter, they matter, all this stuff in the world, it matters, it's on a second tier shelf of my life, but at the top of my life, on the throne of my life, I halo, I set apart, I sanctified Jesus as the top tier, most supreme, most important, most consuming priority in my life.
[time=1624] And Peter is reminding you, if you want to display godly gentleness through suffering or through conflict or through division, then he's gotta be on the top shelf.
[time=1632] He's gotta be the top priority on the pedestal of my life.
[time=1636] These things matter, but they are consumed by, they are lorded over by Jesus Christ.
[time=1643] And you know, I can say amen to that all day at church,
[time=1649] but Monday comes and it starts to look a little bit like this.
[time=1656] And we gotta stop it.
[time=1657] Paul says, take your thoughts captive and keep it that way every single day.
[time=1666] It's a daily choice, it's a daily battle.
[time=1668] And I pray that this picture, as simple as it is, will follow you all week long.
[time=1673] Keep him above them, honor Christ as holy, set him apart, sanctified Jesus.
[time=1680] Keep him on the top shelf of your priority pedestal in your life this week.
[time=1685] And just watch, I double dog dare you.
[time=1687] If you make some intentional effort in that this week, I dare you, just watch what God does.
[time=1694] Watch the peace that feels different.
[time=1695] That's where the peace that passes understanding starts to guard our hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.
[time=1700] And here's what I want you to know that, it's when Jesus is most hallowed.
[time=1703] When Jesus is most hallowed, set apart, sanctified, is when you are the most hopeful in him.
[time=1710] But a lot of times we put our hope in them and those things in me.
[time=1714] But the more we hallowed Jesus, the more hope we have for all of those things in our life.
[time=1720] The more hopeful we become in Jesus really hinges on how hallowed He is in our life.
[time=1724] Second part of verse 15 says, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you.
[time=1732] Can I ask you, is anybody asked you that lately?
[time=1735] Like, hey, what's up with you?
[time=1737] Why do you have so much hope?
[time=1738] Some of you are nodding, yes, that is awesome.
[time=1740] I praise God for you.
[time=1741] If you haven't been asked that lately, it might be that the shelves of your life, your priority pedestal, may need to get displayed a little bit more.
[time=1749] Not because you're better at it, not because you try harder.
[time=1751] What have I told you about the fruit of the Spirit?
[time=1753] It's not about trying, it's about relying.
[time=1755] I'm not very good on strength.
[time=1757] How about you?
[time=1758] Raise your hand if that's true of you.
[time=1759] You're not really good, you fall in flat.
[time=1760] Yep, that's all of us.
[time=1761] But when the fruit of the Spirit shows up, it's when love joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, generalness, and self-control starts to consume my life.
[time=1769] But it starts when he's on the top shelf of my life, and it's about relying on him, not trying harder for me.
[time=1774] But may we get asked, pastor, Kevin, you, her, him, where's your hope come from?
[time=1783] And here's the thing, make a defense, that word defense is apologia in the Greek.
[time=1788] It's where we get our word apologetics, which is where we defend our faith.
[time=1791] And when I hear that, I think, oh no.
[time=1793] Well, that means I gotta be a scholar to do what that verse says.
[time=1797] And you know what, if you wanna make a defense for the hope that is in you, I'm not gonna send you, you say, pastor, how do I learn to do that?
[time=1804] You think, oh great, he's gonna send me to a book in the library, and I'm not smart enough.
[time=1808] Nope, you know where I'm not gonna send you to any library, other than that one, this one.
[time=1813] 66 books, you should try 'em.
[time=1815] I'm not gonna send you to a library to become a scholar.
[time=1819] I'm gonna send you to your prayer closet to own your story.
[time=1822] To make a defense for the hope that is in us is not hinging upon your ability to be a good scholar.
[time=1829] It's hinging on your ability to own your story for his glory, and to know from where your hope comes from.
[time=1836] You gotta answer the question, is Jesus?
[time=1838] He's gotta be either a liar, and the things he said just not true, a lunatic, and he was just crazy, or he's Lord.
[time=1845] C.S. Lewis described it that way.
[time=1847] Liar, lunatic, Lord, what is he to you, and why?
[time=1850] And you don't have to have this big scholarly answer.
[time=1852] The best sermon, you ready for this?
[time=1854] The best sermon you'll ever preach in your life is your story.
[time=1859] So how can you this week own your story for the glory of God?
[time=1863] That's the defense that he's talking about.
[time=1865] He's saying, you know what?
[time=1866] When I went through this time, I learned what it looked like to put him above them.
[time=1871] And let me tell you what that meant for me.
[time=1873] It's that story, and I believe we all have one as we go through this life together.
[time=1877] At the end of verse 15, he says, do all this though with gentleness and respect.
[time=1882] Not the worldly kind of gentleness, but the word, lee kind of gentleness, this fearless.
[time=1887] By the way, can I ask you, has your perspective changed on fearless gentleness yet?
[time=1891] You kind of see, don't you now that like, wow, this kind of gentleness is gonna take some bravery.
[time=1896] It's gonna take some courage.
[time=1897] It's gonna take some fearlessness.
[time=1899] It's gonna take some strength to represent heaven in this world, to use suffering as an opportunity for God's spirit.
[time=1906] Boy, that's gonna take some major bravery.
[time=1910] And that's what we see we're called to do.
[time=1912] This is Peter's strategy for Christians who are suffering in America and all over the world today.
[time=1918] Just like it was in the first century around Rome, and to be the church then, it is today.
[time=1922] This is the strategy to hollow Christ, being prepared to make that defense.
[time=1927] With a good conscience, verse 16 reminds us.
[time=1930] But I want you to know this about Christ.
[time=1931] The more you're grounded in Christ, the more you're gonna respond with gentleness.
[time=1935] The more that this looks like your life, the more you're grounded in Him above everything else.
[time=1942] You won't be able to help, but be more gentle.
[time=1945] They just go together.
[time=1946] Gather, Jesus and gentle go together.
[time=1949] And it's not weakness, gentleness is not weakness.
[time=1951] Meek is not weak.
[time=1952] It means standing up for truth, the things that matter, but in a world that stands up for everything, maybe but the truth and makes all the non-issues, the issues, when you display this kind of gentleness, you turn the other cheek, when others slander you, you don't respond and you let God be your defender and you let God deal with the evil doers and the people in your life.
[time=1970] Guess what you're gonna find?
[time=1971] You're gonna look like Jesus, and as you look like Jesus, you're gonna be even more gentle.
[time=1976] Kinda counterintuitive, isn't it, from what the world teaches us, but it's the truth for us today.
[time=1981] And we'll be able to have verse 16, a good conscience.
[time=1984] And when you're slandered, notice it didn't say and if you're slandered, it started with an if you suffer, but we kinda know that's gonna happen, right?
[time=1990] It's when you're slandered, when things happen, when people speak ill of you, when that happens, the shame is on them is what the verse tells us.
[time=1998] God takes care of all those things.
[time=2001] Then verse 17 says, "For it's better to suffer "for doing good if that should be God's will." Now, let's talk about that.
[time=2008] "Suffer for doing good if that could be God's will." Wait a minute, is that saying that it could be God's will for me to suffer?
[time=2013] No.
[time=2015] Oh wait, but Jesus said, "In this world, "you will have trouble." And then Acts chapter four, I wanna show you these verses real quick, because this is just a powerful picture of how God uses suffering.
[time=2027] You think that he can't use suffering in your life.
[time=2029] How about for salvation?
[time=2030] How about for eternity?
[time=2031] Acts chapter four, verse 27, "For truly in this city, "there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, "whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, "along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, "to do whatever your hand," this is to the Lord, "and your plan had predestined to take place." Wait a minute, Jesus and his suffering, the greatest sin in all of humanity, to murder the Son of God.
[time=2059] You mean that God used that as a part of his plan for salvation?
[time=2062] Is that what that's saying?
[time=2064] Absolutely.
[time=2065] And if God can do that in eternal senses, what makes us think he can't do that in your suffering and my suffering?
[time=2072] Yet a lot of times I look at suffering and I'm like, well, this can't be something God could use.
[time=2076] This is just stupid.
[time=2077] But he wants to use even your suffering as an opportunity for his spirit to bring about some of this fruit, some of this gentleness in your life, because verse 18 looked there with me again, the last verse that we read to you, Christ suffered, for Christ also suffered.
[time=2093] Once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous that he may bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but being made alive in the spirit.
[time=2100] Why?
[time=2102] Why did Jesus model that suffering?
[time=2104] The righteous for the unrighteous.
[time=2106] So we could see our flesh put to death and the fruit of his spirit see us become alive in his spirit, just like that verse says.
[time=2114] Maybe you need some of that life today.
[time=2116] I got two questions I want you to go home with this week and think about, first of all, I just got three, I'm gonna add one.
[time=2121] How can you prioritize him over them this week?
[time=2124] What does that mean to you?
[time=2125] That's question one, it's not on the screen.
[time=2126] Two for the screen.
[time=2127] How can you represent heaven and your suffering this week?
[time=2134] Second question, how can you be fearlessly gentle in a suffering relationship this week?
[time=2141] I got real personal, you're like pastors, all up in my business today.
[time=2145] How can I be fearlessly gentle in a suffering relationship this week?
[time=2151] I challenge you to answer those questions this week and watch God work, watch the fruit of the spirit as you prioritize him above them, whatever it is that holds you back, watch him work this week.
[time=2159] I won't ask you to bow your heads, close your eyes and ponder, what does that mean for me today?
[time=2163] How can I walk in the fruit that I already have?
[time=2165] You notice a singular, the fruit of the spirit, it's a package deal with Jesus.
[time=2170] But you're here in the room and some of you as I ask you those questions, how do I prioritize him over them and display fearless gentleness and a suffering relationship and represent heaven this week?
[time=2180] How do I do that?
[time=2181] Already God's put something big on your heart.
[time=2183] If that is you right now in this room, I wanna pray for you in a moment, would you lift your hand?
[time=2186] So man, I've just gotta do something really specific this week, I already know the relationship, the thing that got, yeah, all over.
[time=2191] I see you, praise God for you, put your hands down.
[time=2194] Some of you are in the room today and you would say your fearless step is to trust Jesus instead of trusting you.
[time=2200] You realize the pedestal of your priorities is you've been prioritizing everything, but Jesus, you acknowledge Jesus in your head, you know who he is, but in your heart you haven't trusted him.
[time=2208] You haven't embodied the song that we sang where I surrender to you.
[time=2213] I surrender, that's salvation.
[time=2215] Salvation is acknowledging I need a savior because of my sin, but Jesus paid it all.
[time=2221] He did that for me, he paid the price, I couldn't pay after living the sinless life, I couldn't live.
[time=2226] And once he died to pay that price, he rose from the dead
[time=2232] and because he lives, I can have eternal life, both for the future, but starting right now can walk with him.
[time=2239] Maybe you need to take that step.
[time=2240] You're not saved by words, you're not saved by prayer, you're not saved because of pastors here leading you, you're saved because of your heart being fully surrendered to Jesus.
[time=2248] Putting him on the top shelf of your pedestal of priorities, maybe it's time for you to take that step and in your own words, we cry out to him and just do that.
[time=2255] I don't give you a moment to do that at home, here in the room, wherever you may be hearing this message today, take a moment and do that now.
[time=2284] (gentle music) - Thank God for these moments 'cause I think he's working.
[time=2289] Nobody's looking around, I just wanna pray for you.
[time=2291] Right now, first of all, if you said yes to Jesus, while believers are praying over all that list that God's put into your head of how he's gonna empower you this week, if you said yes to Jesus, I wanna give you some next steps and I just wanna pray for you, that's all.
[time=2303] If that's you right now, I wanna ask you, would you acknowledge that by just lifting your hand, even at home, I can't see you, but God does, but in the room, I can see you and I can pray for you.
[time=2310] If you said today, I gave my life to Jesus, anybody?
[time=2313] I just wanna pray for you.
[time=2315] Every week, we see God changing lives.
[time=2317] Maybe yours was today.
[time=2318] If you're at home, God sees you, lift your hand there too.
[time=2323] I want you to know that you're loved.
[time=2325] I want you to know that God cares for you and that his gentleness is gonna pour over you this week.
[time=2330] I wanna pray over you in all these next steps that God's planted in your heart this week and may we go out and be fearlessly gentle.
[time=2337] Displaying Jesus this week.
[time=2339] God, you're so good.
[time=2340] Thank you for your love, your grace, your mercy.
[time=2342] Thank you for being gentle and kind and faithful, full of love towards us so that we can now display those very things in our life.
[time=2351] God, some people are here and it's very, very difficult, even impossible it feels to display this kind of gentleness in their life, but God, may you empower them and may we God truly display this pedestal of priorities in our life in a way that only you could empower us to do.
[time=2367] For those who've said yes to Jesus, for those who are taking steps here, there and everywhere, God, I pray your blessings, I pray your grace.
[time=2373] I thank you for all that you're doing in our lives and through our lives.
[time=2376] We thank you for lives that are transformed in Jesus' name today and all God's people said.
[time=2381] Amen, can we celebrate God's Word, celebrate lives that are changed.
