[time=0] And all God's people said, "Hey, man, do you receive that today?" You know, I once heard it said that harboring unforgiveness and bitterness and resentment
[time=11] is a lot like drinking poison in hopes that it would harm the other person.
[time=17] And so I don't know what may be abroad today that you need to let go and lay at the foot of the cross, but we're here to do it together.
[time=23] We're here to do that as a church family, and I'm glad to be a part of such a family with all of you.
[time=28] What a powerful morning of worship.
[time=29] Can we give it up for Jesus and our worship team some more?
[time=32] Just so blessed with so many willing servants and so many people behind the scenes that just make everything move and happen in this place and our kids ministry kicking back off.
[time=42] There's so many great things happening, and I just want to say thank you to all of you who make it happen.
[time=47] It's good to see my Miss Sandy Wright sitting there too.
[time=50] I don't usually call people out too often, but Miss Sandy, she's the best hugging lady ever.
[time=54] I miss the hugs.
[time=55] COVID's just kind of blowing all that up for us, hasn't it?
[time=57] And maybe it has for you, and maybe you've been wondering, you know, where are we going as a church?
[time=62] How are we doing as a church?
[time=63] Listen, next Sunday, today I'm finishing the Fruit of the Spirit series.
[time=66] It's been 10 weeks.
[time=68] Can you believe that?
[time=69] We've been at this for 10 weeks now, but next Sunday, we just want to spend one Sunday doing three big things.
[time=75] We want to communicate clearly, transparently with you on just where we're at, where we're heading as a church.
[time=80] We want to biggest of all celebrate because in a world full of bad news, we need some good news.
[time=86] And Jesus, there's always good news that swallows up the bad.
[time=89] And then we also just want to be challenged as a church to continue leaning into this season.
[time=95] I want to thank all of you.
[time=96] I've watched several of you coming in and it's getting full in the room and we're still working really hard to keep you safe and just smiles.
[time=102] I just saw smiles, even when you didn't get to sit in the section you wanted to always back there watching.
[time=106] And I just want to tell you, thank you, church, for having that kind of a spirit, that kind of an attitude in the room.
[time=112] And for those of you online watching us right now, I just want to speak to you until you thank you wherever you're at for just letting us be a part of your life.
[time=120] So we're in a series called Refresh on the Fruit of the Spirit.
[time=123] This is week number 10.
[time=125] Today I want to talk to you about self-control.
[time=128] I don't know about you, but when I hear that, that's the one.
[time=131] It really touches everything that I do and it's often the one that I feel like I do the least at times because it takes discipline and it's hard to be a disciplined person.
[time=139] But today I want to talk to you about self-less self-control, self-less self-control.
[time=147] Like last week, fearless gentleness, those words maybe don't seem like they go real well together, but I believe they do when we look at scripture.
[time=154] So let's find out how we can live out a self-less self-control.
[time=157] And to start, let's go to Galatians 5 and it will be on the screen, but we're going to spend most of our time if you want to get ahead of me there in 2nd Peter, 2nd Peter chapter 1 verses 1 through 9, but let's start by reading the Fruit of the Spirit passage
[time=172] here in Galatians chapter 5.
[time=174] I will start in verse 22 and since this is our last week, let's go through the end of the chapter, shall we?
[time=178] You ready for the word today?
[time=181] Galatians chapter 5 verse 22, "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
[time=188] kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.
[time=193] And such things, there is no law.
[time=195] And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
[time=201] If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.
[time=206] Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another." All right, so in all what God's people said, because we need a lot of that in our life right now.
[time=217] We need some fruit from the Spirit.
[time=218] We need love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control in a world that displays quite the opposite all too often, so let's refresh ourselves on that.
[time=228] Today, in self-control, it is self-less to live in self-control, biblically speaking.
[time=233] I'm going to break that apart because the Word, I've been giving you the Word, it'll be on the screen if you want to take it down and study it further this week, it's incretia is the Greek Word, and what it means is self-control, that's how it's translated three times in
[time=246] the New Testament, but it means temperate.
[time=248] It means contentedness.
[time=251] It means even this concept of sufficiency.
[time=256] It's a sufficiency from which we internally operate externally.
[time=261] And so as we look at that today, we've been looking at where else those words in the original language have been used throughout Scripture.
[time=267] You find that it's used three times in the New Testament, once it's in Acts 24 and verse 25.
[time=272] And this is when Paul was before Felix, and it's an interesting context how he used it.
[time=276] It is toward the end of his life, he's on trial, and Paul is talking to Felix in teaching,
[time=282] it says, about righteousness and self-control.
[time=285] And Felix even was afraid and sent Paul away, but he kept bringing him back.
[time=289] It's a beautiful picture of the gospel and the good news that we see in Paul's life.
[time=294] And you also see it, of course, in Galatians 5, but then you find it two times in 2 Peter
[time=300] chapter 1, which is where I want to spend the rest of our time together today.
[time=304] In Peter chapter 1, you'll find it in verse 6, but hang on in there with me, because before we get to self-control, we've got to do some other stuff.
[time=312] And the reason for that is because our world today is a lot like the world to which Peter was writing.
[time=318] So Peter is writing to the first century people under the oppressive Roman Empire, and it's
[time=324] a lot like the America of its day.
[time=326] You could say biggest global footprint, biggest economy, biggest military, yet they're in
[time=332] a state of falling apart.
[time=333] They're in a state of infighting and division.
[time=336] They're in a state of somewhat imploding a self-destruction mode.
[time=340] Politically speaking, this demonic dictator named Nero was in charge.
[time=346] And you think we have had bad political leaders in our lifetime.
[time=349] We've never sat under a man quite like this guy, so politically things were quite the mess.
[time=354] Economically, there wasn't a pandemic, but this massive fire has caused huge economic
[time=360] ruin in this area.
[time=362] And so we're in a time of economic ruin.
[time=365] Politically things are awry, socially they're awry, it's looting, pillaging, fighting, racial tensions, political tensions, regional tensions.
[time=373] You name it, there were tensions everywhere, and probably most importantly, definitely biggest of all, spiritually speaking, the enemy was wreaking havoc.
[time=384] He was causing Christians to fight, he was causing people to fight, he was causing what looked like and felt like the church to lose.
[time=395] Sound familiar?
[time=396] Maybe you can draw some similarities in that context.
[time=399] And really what Peter is writing about, and first Peter, he's talking about how they're suffering various trials, and really his message is it's going to get worse before it gets better.
[time=408] Second Peter comes along, and guess what, it's gotten worse, and it keeps getting worse.
[time=413] And what his message is to the believers is that, listen guys, you can't go around this,
[time=419] you've got to go through this.
[time=421] And I want to tell you how, and listen to my friends, some of us are like, hey, 2020, and hey, I'm with you.
[time=427] I just want to tell you, 2020, just wow, what a weird year can I get an amen?
[time=433] We can all agree on that weird, I don't think weird's the right word.
[time=437] But a lot of us, I see it, it's almost like we think when the zero flips over to a one, and it's 2021, it's like, it'll all be better, tensions will go away, the pandemic's going
[time=447] to be gone, and all the divisions, and the heightened emotions, and all the stuff that the world's going through, just bring on 2021, to which I say, you know what, I agree, I look forward to it as well, any psychological edge we can feel like we get, I get those things, but listen to my friends, don't put your hope in some meaningless number.
[time=466] I've got bad news, and then I got good news.
[time=468] The bad news is, it's going to get worse before it gets better.
[time=471] The bad news is, we got to go through it, we can't go around this.
[time=475] The good news is, Jesus already won the victory, and he's not surprised, and he's still on his throne, and we have the Word of God to be a light for our path, and we're going to follow it together.
[time=487] Some of you came today just to hear that, because you've forgotten and gotten consumed by things that don't matter.
[time=492] Peter is helping us know how we get through it, and here's where he starts.
[time=495] You ready?
[time=496] God's work, God, and his work.
[time=499] We need a work from God today, and so let's go through three things about God's work today we learn from 2 Peter chapter 1.
[time=507] Verse 1, the first thing that we see is God's work for us, write that down.
[time=511] God's work for us.
[time=513] Did you know that God has worked for you?
[time=515] God has worked for you, he's done something for you on your behalf that you could never do in and of your own strength.
[time=522] That is the point of this series, refresh, is that there is a war between the flesh and the fruit, between self and spirit, and we're in this flesh suit, and in this flesh suit,
[time=532] we feel the tension of the victory of God but the sinfulness of our flesh every single day.
[time=538] And that levels the ground at the foot of the cross for all of us, no matter what walk of life or experiences you come into this room from today.
[time=545] And I'm glad that we're in this together, but more than I'm glad we're in this together, I'm glad Jesus has done a work for us on our behalf.
[time=552] And Paul talks, Peter rather talks about that old habits, 10 weeks with Paul, right?
[time=557] Now it's Peter, and guess what?
[time=558] They say the same message.
[time=560] Can you believe that?
[time=561] It's amazing how the harmony of the Scripture and all these different people and different backgrounds, they all preach the same message.
[time=568] It must be true.
[time=569] And my friends, I can tell you today, it is true, and let's dig into it together.
[time=572] Verse 1, 2 Peter, chapter 1, Simeon, my Bible says in the ESV, it's the same Simon, it's
[time=578] often translated as Simon.
[time=579] This is the Peter who denied Jesus, and so if you feel like your failures make you a failure and God can't use you, listen to this guy.
[time=586] He says, Simon, Peter, a servant, an apostle of Jesus Christ to those who have obtained
[time=594] a faith of equal standing with ours by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=601] You could preach a whole series on that one verse, there's so much more that he's building on, but we've got to start with verse 1 and talk about God's work for us, because verse 1, let's start with the word servant.
[time=611] Remember that this is Peter, remember that this is the same Peter to whom Jesus came and sought out intentionally to find and to restore after he had denied Jesus three times, after
[time=621] he had been resurrected from the dead, he went and found Peter, and he instituted him as the human leader in so many ways, shapes and forms of Christianity, this movement that would become the most powerful movement in the history of all of the world.
[time=636] This knucklehead fisherman with a big mouth, Jesus loved him so much, and he came and restored
[time=643] and sent him out and built his church.
[time=645] He preached at Pentecost, and thousands came to know Jesus, and we're here today on the shoulders of people like Peter who Jesus chose to use.
[time=654] Yet he introduces himself and says, "Servant." So this week, I don't know what your title is.
[time=660] It might be CEO, might be business owner, might be janitor, might be teacher, might be dad, might be mom, might be aunt, might be uncle, might be brother, might be sister.
[time=672] It could be all of these different titles, but they're all level at the foot of the cross.
[time=677] And this is my challenge to you this week.
[time=679] Let's do like Peter, proceed your title, whatever it may be.
[time=682] Proceed it with servant.
[time=684] For me, I'm a servant pastor.
[time=687] I'm a servant leader.
[time=688] I'm a servant husband.
[time=690] I'm a servant dad.
[time=692] I wanna be a servant like Peter.
[time=694] Why?
[time=695] Because Jesus himself didn't come to be served, but to serve.
[time=698] And I'm so glad that he did.
[time=699] He gave his life a ransom for many, which means he did something for us.
[time=703] This is God's work for us.
[time=704] And I love this phrase, a faith.
[time=706] He said to those of you who have obtained a faith that leads you to this equal standing with ours.
[time=713] An equal standing, wait a minute.
[time=715] The same Jesus that God used to launch the church, you mean when God looks at me, he sees a same standing as he sees through Peter.
[time=724] And Peter, by the way, in this book, he's writing his second book of the Bible.
[time=728] Have you written a book of the Bible that God instituted and put inside of his word?
[time=732] No, he's got a leg up on me, yet I have a faith that gives me an equal standing with Peter.
[time=737] I can tell you it's even better than that.
[time=739] When God looks at you as a child of God, if you've accepted him, what did God do for us?
[time=743] What's God's work for us?
[time=744] It's even better than an equal standing with Peter.
[time=747] It is that God sees you and he doesn't see the you, this there, the sin that characterizes you.
[time=752] He sees you through the shed blood of Jesus that paid a price for your sin.
[time=757] You could never pay for yourself.
[time=759] And so he sees the righteousness of Jesus himself.
[time=762] That, my friends, is God's work for us.
[time=765] Oh, this is in verse one.
[time=767] This must be a really good passage if we get this from verse one.
[time=769] And then there's the word obtained.
[time=771] We've obtained it.
[time=772] So many times we think we got to do something to get it.
[time=774] We've got to be the ones to achieve it.
[time=776] That's the tension of the fruit of the spirit.
[time=778] It doesn't say the fruit of Kevin.
[time=781] It's the fruit of the spirit.
[time=782] It's God's work for us that word obtained.
[time=785] We've obtained this faith.
[time=787] It means received or NLT new living translation even says given to you.
[time=792] It's a great translation because it's true.
[time=794] We can't earn it, but God has given it to us.
[time=797] So freely.
[time=798] Martin Luther even calls this the great exchange.
[time=800] It's our unrighteousness, exchange for the righteousness of Jesus himself.
[time=806] Write it down this way.
[time=807] We don't work for righteousness.
[time=808] We work from the righteousness of Jesus.
[time=811] It's the whole point of the fruit of the spirit, my friends.
[time=814] Maybe we walk in it.
[time=816] And hey, you know back when we used to go places.
[time=818] You remember those days?
[time=819] Way back in the day.
[time=821] We would go to places called bookstores and there'd be these sections.
[time=824] And there's one section called self-help.
[time=827] And I'm not saying there aren't good books in there.
[time=829] I've read self-help kind of books, but you know what I've found?
[time=832] The more I look to self-help kind of things in my life, I see that there's a self-problem.
[time=837] You know what I never do when it comes to the self side of this equation?
[time=843] I never get up in the morning, look myself in the mirror and go, I'm glad you're here.
[time=850] It's usually something like, there you are again.
[time=858] And I have to put up with myself every single day.
[time=861] So what I learn is that I don't need self-help.
[time=864] I've tried to help myself and I just don't get very far.
[time=867] I need some God help.
[time=869] And the most, listen, the most important necessity of today's time is the help that God did for us.
[time=876] It's the work that God did for us, that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us, that he who knew no sin became sin on my behalf so that I could become the righteousness of God.
[time=889] That is the most important necessity of today's time.
[time=893] It's not to have the right person in office.
[time=895] It's not to get that right job.
[time=898] It's not all of these things that we get so consumed by things that matter, things that are important in the temporary sense.
[time=904] But may we remember what is most important eternally and that is that God is on the throne and he did a work for us and the gospel, the good news is true and we live in a world that needs it so desperately and he sent us out to give it out to those who so needed.
[time=919] May we remember God's work for us.
[time=925] Now let's go to verse two.
[time=926] Verse two leads us into a section where we learn about God's work in us.
[time=931] Goes from this work he did for us to now this work he does in us, write that down.
[time=935] God's work in us, verses two through four.
[time=938] Let's read it together.
[time=940] Oh, and I gotta tell you, I've just been waiting to read the scripture, the whole series, all 10 weeks.
[time=945] I just love this passage.
[time=946] I would tell you that it's one of my favorites but you wouldn't believe me 'cause say that every week, but it really is.
[time=950] It's just an awesome passage.
[time=951] Verse two, make grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
[time=959] His divine power has granted to us all things.
[time=963] How many things say it again?
[time=965] All things that pertain to life and godliness through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature.
[time=983] That's what we're learning about.
[time=984] The fruit of the spirit, it's not my nature, it's his nature, it's the spirit's nature of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.
[time=995] This is God's work in us.
[time=997] He does something for us so he can do something in us and in verse two, we see grace and peace and the need for its multiplication in our lives.
[time=1004] I wanna tell you something, whatever you're going through in this life right now, you need more grace and peace and you need it to be multiplied and you can't multiply it yourself.
[time=1013] You need the fruit of the spirit to help you with that because if you've noticed, we're not seeing people very frequently go, hmm, times are tough.
[time=1022] Let's just all have a little more grace for each other.
[time=1024] Have you noticed the fruit of self, the fruit of the world?
[time=1028] Are we doing that really well right now?
[time=1030] Hey, let's just all have some more grace.
[time=1032] I'm seeing quite the opposite.
[time=1033] I'm seeing the fruit of self and it feels like, wow, where did all the grace go?
[time=1038] We can't even get through a sentence of a conversation in today's time, it seems, without yelling, screaming and fighting, we need grace and peace to be multiplied and God is gonna multiply his grace for you which will in turn multiply peace in you.
[time=1053] That's what my God wants to do.
[time=1055] That's his work in you and I pray that over you this week because Jesus get this, he doesn't just make me better, he makes me new.
[time=1062] Jesus doesn't just make me better, he's good at that too.
[time=1065] He doesn't just do that, he makes me new.
[time=1068] We need some newness in our lives today and maybe we give people more grace as we realize how much grace our God gives us and as he does this work in us.
[time=1077] And so from verses two through four, I just wanna give you seven things, it could probably be 17 things, but I'm gonna boil it down to seven things that Jesus does to make us new.
[time=1085] Seven new things that Jesus brings about in our life.
[time=1088] Starting with number one from verse number two, where we see at the end of verse two, all of this is coming from the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
[time=1099] Jesus our Lord, number one, Jesus gives us a new Lord.
[time=1103] Write that down.
[time=1104] A new Lord, that means he's the boss.
[time=1106] Whatever is the Lord over your life, you remember last week the pedestal of priorities, it's him over them, it's him over me.
[time=1113] He's gotta be supreme, he's gotta be hallowed, he's gotta be set apart, he's gotta be made holy.
[time=1118] Well, when Jesus comes in, he doesn't just get in your boat, he takes over the boat.
[time=1123] And some of us are going, ooh, I don't know if I like that.
[time=1126] And you know, I've been there, done that.
[time=1127] And there are days that I still go, ooh, I don't know if I like that, but I've never been steered wrong by Jesus.
[time=1133] Never, but I steer myself wrong all the time.
[time=1135] And I need a Lord and a Savior.
[time=1137] And the beauty of Christianity is that one day, get this my friends, every knee's gonna bow, every tongue is gonna confess that Jesus is Lord, to the glory of God our Father.
[time=1148] And I wanna bow now to him because the more he is Lord, the more love, the more fruit, the more of him that gets multiplied in my life, the more verse two is true where grace and peace are multiplied in me and for me and through me, I need a new Lord.
[time=1163] Maybe you do too, and Jesus is that Lord.
[time=1166] Number two is a new power.
[time=1168] In verse three, it says his divine power.
[time=1171] His divine power is the Holy Spirit.
[time=1174] It is not the dinky power of self.
[time=1177] It is the divine power of the spirit.
[time=1179] That's what we're talking about here.
[time=1181] Have you noticed that your power is pretty small compared to his, if you haven't noticed it, this season, this year has probably been a good reminder.
[time=1190] You thought you controlled a few things.
[time=1191] Speaking of self-control, you thought you controlled a few things in your life.
[time=1195] Can I get any man?
[time=1196] Then welcome 2020 and everything spun out of control and self-control and things are out of control is a pretty far-fetched idea but not with Jesus because he gives us a new Lord and he gives us this new power that's not our own power and I too often operate with self-power, not his power, not spirit power but it's available.
[time=1217] Speaking of number three is that he gives us a new life because what we see is that it's his divine power verse three has granted to us all things.
[time=1225] How many things say it with me?
[time=1227] All things, that Greek word is posse.
[time=1229] It's the same word that says that all scripture is that it's breathed out by God.
[time=1233] It means all, every ounce, every tiny bit, everything you need pertaining to what?
[time=1238] Life and godliness.
[time=1239] So you're given a new life by Jesus and that's gonna take some new things and you know I can't help but talk about this verse without remembering something back from 2005 and I think I shared it with you.
[time=1251] Last time probably was back in 2016 in the first sermon I ever preached from this stage on August 21st of 2016.
[time=1258] How many of you are here then by the way?
[time=1260] Just curious.
[time=1261] All right, praise God for you.
[time=1263] And a lot of you God has brought here because of the ministry of many others since then but there's a story about Dr. Stan Wilkins and so I was just a kid fresh out of high school and God called me to preach.
[time=1274] The one thing I always said I would never do is be a pastor like my dad and I had a list of reasons why that was to be true.
[time=1280] I had an aptitude test and on that test it said the thing's not to do it.
[time=1284] Number one on the not to do list was anything with public speaking.
[time=1287] And so I said see God can't do that but God called me to preach short version of the story as I eventually reluctantly said yes after telling God he was crazy don't suggest that he's always smarter than me and you.
[time=1298] But I went to seminary and I remember one of the early classes it was with Dr. Stan Wilkins.
[time=1303] He was this big six five like 250 guy he had the big booming preacher voice.
[time=1307] I'll never forget his voice.
[time=1309] I wish I could have his voice just power and authority and looked up to him and he did a class on pastoral care emergencies.
[time=1317] So he's teaching us how to shepherd people and how to respond in times of emergencies and crisis in people's lives.
[time=1323] And so we had to do a written and oral presentation on one.
[time=1328] So I'm a youth pastor and so I thought well hey if I got to do this I was reluctant enough 'cause it was let's just talk about teen suicide.
[time=1334] Way to go Kev.
[time=1336] Start your seminary with something like that right?
[time=1338] But I did and I wrote a paper on teen suicide how to walk through that with a family and then came to presentation day and I got up there and I'm not kidding it was like this.
[time=1348] My hands were shaking I was dripping sweat.
[time=1350] You couldn't tell that I was crying because all the sweat was dripping down and I actually probably wasn't that I had a little podium and it was more like this and I just held on.
[time=1359] And guys it was the worst presentation I've ever seen given in all of my life.
[time=1364] And you say well what a humble thing to say.
[time=1365] No it really wasn't because Dr. Wilkins as soon as that class was over I got out of the class I went out the door and I was leaving.
[time=1372] I wasn't just planning to leave the class I was planning to leave seminary.
[time=1376] It was it was like see I told you God I can't do this.
[time=1380] I was crushed I really was.
[time=1382] And then I heard Dr. Wilkins voice, Kevin.
[time=1386] And I'm like oh great he's gonna rub it in he's gonna go and give me the F.
[time=1389] I didn't know what he was gonna do but he said come here son come here.
[time=1393] He called me back to himself and he said so that didn't go very well did it.
[time=1398] See I told you it was that bad right?
[time=1401] It really was.
[time=1402] But I'll never forget what he did next.
[time=1405] Put his big hands on my shoulders and look down towards me and said son you've been given everything you need for life and godliness second Peter chapter one.
[time=1416] And even when life doesn't go well or go like you plan for it to go you have everything you need.
[time=1421] And then he said these words and I'll never forget this is the part I'll never forget.
[time=1424] He looked at me and he said you're the complete package.
[time=1429] That was November in 2005.
[time=1439] A year later November of 2006 Dr. Wilkins was cleaning out his gutters at his home and he fell off his ladder hit his head and passed away.
[time=1448] I never got to have another class with him.
[time=1452] Barely got to have any more conversations with him but I'll never forget I'm looking at me and saying you're the complete package.
[time=1462] Then he said now go live like it.
[time=1464] I got your back.
[time=1465] Look at me for a minute wherever you're at I want to be a Dr. Wilkins for your life for just a moment.
[time=1472] I want to tell you today stop believing the lies of the enemy.
[time=1476] You're the complete package.
[time=1480] Now go live like it.
[time=1483] Not only do I have your back not only does this church have your back but Jesus who is Lord has your back.
[time=1490] He's given you a new life.
[time=1492] May we go out and live like the complete package that we are because of Jesus and stop believing the lies of the enemy that say you're not enough.
[time=1500] With Jesus is all you need.
[time=1503] He's all you need 'cause he gives us a new life.
[time=1506] He's our new Lord.
[time=1507] He gives us a new power.
[time=1508] And number four he gives us a new mind.
[time=1510] He guys always make me cry when I tell that story.
[time=1514] So I don't tell it that often.
[time=1516] But praise God that you can live in that kind of life and I pray you'll believe it today.
[time=1520] And he'll give you a new mind because of it.
[time=1522] The knowledge of him is through the knowledge of him.
[time=1525] Did you know 1 Corinthians chapter number two verse 16?
[time=1528] You have the mind of Christ.
[time=1530] You have the mind of Christ as a follower of him.
[time=1532] You can think like him.
[time=1534] You can be like Jesus because of his power because of the new life that he gives to us.
[time=1539] And that word knowledge is not just this head knowledge.
[time=1542] There's the gnosis kind of knowledge in the Greek.
[time=1545] This is epic gnosis.
[time=1546] This is an experiential heart level kind of knowledge.
[time=1550] It's not the kind of knowledge that stays here in your head.
[time=1552] It's the kind of knowledge that starts in your heart and bubbles and boils out of you because it's an experience that you've had on the inside that shows up on the outside.
[time=1562] It's a heart level kind of knowledge.
[time=1564] And all of these precious promises that come about, come about because you have an experiential heart level knowledge of who Jesus is.
[time=1571] There are so many people that say, oh, I know Jesus.
[time=1573] And no, you know about Jesus.
[time=1575] You know who Jesus is.
[time=1577] But do you, I wanna ask you today, my friends, do you really know Jesus?
[time=1582] Do you know him from the heart level?
[time=1585] And how do I do that?
[time=1586] You surrender to him.
[time=1588] You surrender control to him.
[time=1589] You make him your Lord.
[time=1591] He gives you a new Lord.
[time=1594] He also gives you number five, a new calling.
[time=1597] Who called us, verse three says, who called us to his own glory and excellence.
[time=1601] Some of you've been looking for your calling.
[time=1603] So many people will ask, well, pastor, I'm trying to figure out what God's called me to do.
[time=1607] Maybe you're there right now.
[time=1609] And you know, I wanna preface by saying this, God may call you into a new season.
[time=1613] He's done that for me.
[time=1614] I wouldn't be in Indiana if that didn't happen.
[time=1616] So don't ignore those calls.
[time=1617] However, however, I've got the answer to everything you've been looking for.
[time=1621] I really do.
[time=1622] And you say, yeah, you're gonna say Jesus.
[time=1623] Well, yes, because of Jesus, but I've got a practical answer that's everything you've been looking for.
[time=1627] You ready for it?
[time=1628] If you've been looking for calling and you're like, well, I'll really dig in.
[time=1632] I'll really trust Jesus.
[time=1633] I'll really go all out when I get to the right spot.
[time=1636] When I get to the right calling.
[time=1638] The answer to that question is, it's right where you're planted.
[time=1642] Until God moves you.
[time=1644] He planted you there for a reason and he wants you to bloom.
[time=1647] He wants you to flourish.
[time=1649] Listen to the new calls, but even the mundane ones.
[time=1652] Don't miss the miracles that God wants to do in the mundane places he has you right now.
[time=1658] There are moms.
[time=1659] My wife is a homemaker.
[time=1660] She stays at home with the kids and I gotta tell you, moms that are out there, it's the hardest job on the planet.
[time=1666] And so I give a shout out to all the moms who are able to do that.
[time=1668] All the moms who work outside the home, just being a mom in general is tough enough.
[time=1672] So I give a shout out to all the mamas in the building today.
[time=1675] But listen, if you get tired of the diapers as an example, my wife and I've had this conversation.
[time=1680] It's a pretty tiring position that God called her into for that.
[time=1684] I believe with all of my heart that your greatest contribution to the kingdom of God might not be something you do or a role you find yourself in, but may just be someone you raise.
[time=1695] So may we raise them?
[time=1696] Well, CEOs that are just tired and you've owned your own business, maybe God still has you there because it's time to affect change and it's time to infuse Christ into the place where you're at, even while people are throwing rocks at you, even where you're weary and you wanna give up, every leader in America and beyond right now feels that way in any way, shape, or form.
[time=1714] And who does that include?
[time=1715] Oh, only the CEOs?
[time=1716] No, because you're a leader.
[time=1718] Wherever you're at, God has placed you there to be a leader that points people to Jesus.
[time=1722] We're all weary, but we all serve a God who is able.
[time=1725] May we follow Him, may we trust Him, may we bloom where we're planted as we discern the callings of God in our life.
[time=1732] He gives us a new calling.
[time=1734] He gives us a new nature.
[time=1735] Number six, all of this is about the divine nature by which He granted us His precious, very great promises so that through them, you might become partakers of the divine nature.
[time=1747] That's the Holy Spirit.
[time=1748] How many of you in the room are parents or you have been a parent, you've had kids?
[time=1753] That's a lot of us.
[time=1754] Those of you who are not, you can learn from this because guess what?
[time=1758] You were parented and influenced by someone and your day may come to how many of you that just raised your hand had to teach your kids to have a sinful nature, right?
[time=1770] No, I love my kids, one of them's in the room right now, but there are some days where I'm just like, where did you learn this?
[time=1778] You little sinner.
[time=1781] And then I go back to that mirror moment in the morning where I didn't go, I'm glad you're here.
[time=1787] And I go, oh no, you're here and you're the problem, right?
[time=1791] I probably taught them to do this.
[time=1792] We all have this sinful nature, but this is the beauty of being born again.
[time=1797] That's why scripture calls it, being born again.
[time=1799] We're born with this sinful nature.
[time=1801] You don't have to be taught it.
[time=1803] It just comes with this flesh suit.
[time=1805] Some of us have more of a flesh suit than others, but we all have one and it comes with it.
[time=1809] This sinful nature and with Jesus, it's the great exchange.
[time=1813] It's my fleshly sinfulness for the righteousness of God.
[time=1817] And with Jesus, I'm given a new nature, even when I don't feel that new nature taking over in my life.
[time=1823] It's still there, it's still my foundation.
[time=1825] And that leads to number seven, new desires.
[time=1828] New desires, at the end of verse four there, it's the divine nature having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desires.
[time=1839] I don't know about you, but I didn't start just loving church and Bible reading and prayer and all the things that go without that.
[time=1848] It used to be kind of like, oh, I don't have to do that.
[time=1851] You ever felt that way?
[time=1852] Some of you felt that way this morning and you pressed through.
[time=1855] Some of you tuned in online because you thought about coming here, but then said, you know, no, it's not gonna quite push through, but you're watching and you're here right now.
[time=1862] Some of you just have been home and you had to press through just to click play at home, to stream at home and watch this later wherever we're at.
[time=1869] There are oftentimes those days where God's work in us doesn't feel very prominent or very dominant in our lives.
[time=1876] We don't always say, I want to.
[time=1878] There's not every Sunday that I want to get up and come, to get up at 5 a.m. and do this thing here as much as I love it.
[time=1885] There's not every Sunday that comes where it's like, hey, let's do it.
[time=1889] You feel that too, don't you?
[time=1890] Can we be real in this room?
[time=1891] No church smiles here, but we smile through it together because even when we don't want to, we know us inside of us.
[time=1898] And when we trust it more, the have tos well up into the want tos and it gives us new desires.
[time=1903] And here's the thing, we say the corruption that's in the world because of sinful desire.
[time=1908] And have you noticed that the world points out each other's corruption quite a bit these days?
[time=1913] You know, let's go with the P word, politics for a minute.
[time=1915] People on the left say, well, the people on the right are corrupt.
[time=1922] And the people in this category say the people in that category are corrupt.
[time=1926] And we point out, we're good at pointing out everybody's corruption.
[time=1929] And so I've got the answer to this one too.
[time=1930] I'm just full of answers today, aren't I?
[time=1932] You ready for this answer?
[time=1934] You're right.
[time=1936] Everyone is right.
[time=1938] You're like, well, you're going to have to expound on that one for me, Pastor.
[time=1942] Do you agree?
[time=1943] Should I expound on that?
[time=1944] This means, yeah.
[time=1945] Okay, good.
[time=1946] I'm glad you asked.
[time=1947] What I mean by that is everybody's corrupt.
[time=1949] We are all born with this horrible sin nature.
[time=1952] And we all end up with these flawed viewpoints and we're all ending up so many times called up in temporary things and fighting for things that yes matter, but that won't matter for eternity.
[time=1963] Did you know that so many of the things, so many of the things that we desire, the desires that we fight for with all of our heart, so many of those things while
[time=1971] they matter in a temporary sense, when Jesus comes and we enter into eternity, they will be no more.
[time=1978] And I pray that our desires could shift to where we focus more on the gospel.
[time=1983] We focus more on being the light of the world.
[time=1985] We focus more on God's work for us and in us so that through us, God does something miraculous
[time=1991] in this temporary world we live in where we live in flesh suits and people see the eternal
[time=1997] kingdom of God that is to come and the good news of Jesus may he's shift our desires church so that we know him and walk in him and the world sees him through us.
[time=2007] God wants to do something in you.
[time=2010] I pray that over us, these things matter that we get so consumed in, but do they matter
[time=2016] eternal?
[time=2017] It's got to be him over them like we looked at last week.
[time=2021] Speaking of that, as parents, I want to help you parent from what I'm still figuring this parenting thing out, many of you have got it way more figured out than me, so I ask you to bring on the help and the love, all of it, it's hard being a parent.
[time=2032] Can I give a name, man?
[time=2033] But I want to challenge you with something that was on my heart as a parent this week.
[time=2037] Religion makes it hard for us to get to God.
[time=2041] But relationship reminds us that God came to us.
[time=2047] And religion that makes it hard to get to God makes it a have to.
[time=2051] But a relationship that realizes God came to me makes it a want to.
[time=2055] So I want to challenge you to parent in a want to kind of spirit.
[time=2060] When it comes to things of spirituality and faith, parent in a way that says, "I want to." And you say, "Well, I can't make my kids want to.
[time=2067] I can beat it over to the head or whatever it takes.
[time=2069] I can't make them do those things." You're right.
[time=2072] But I want to give you, while I don't have all the answers, the best way I've seen that foster a want to spirit in your kids.
[time=2078] You ready for it?
[time=2079] Goes back to the mirror is you want to.
[time=2083] You display every Sunday.
[time=2084] I can't wait to go to church.
[time=2086] Really, why, Dad?
[time=2088] Why, Mom?
[time=2089] Because I need as much Jesus as I can get and He's just done so much in me that I can't wait to worship with other believers and I can't wait to worship Him.
[time=2097] And even if you don't feel like it and you push through and do that, you're fostering a want to kind of spirit in your home and parents.
[time=2104] The world needs the want to kind of spirituality, the want to kind of faith, the want to kind
[time=2110] of Christianity more than ever before.
[time=2112] May we live it out in front of our kids and raise up little warriors in the next generation.
[time=2117] Who's with me?
[time=2118] We do that with me this week.
[time=2119] Let's want to together because God has worked in us.
[time=2122] Number three, God's worked through us.
[time=2124] God's worked for us.
[time=2125] God's work in us.
[time=2127] God's work through us.
[time=2128] Verses 5 through 9.
[time=2130] Peter writes about the work.
[time=2131] Some of you are saying, I thought this was a message about self-control.
[time=2135] It is.
[time=2136] I'm just now getting there.
[time=2137] You needed all of that before you could get to self-control.
[time=2141] And you have proven it with your life and I have proven it with my life.
[time=2144] Now we can get there.
[time=2145] Now we can get to God's work through us.
[time=2147] Peter shows us what that looks like.
[time=2149] For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue and virtue with knowledge and knowledge with here it is, self-control.
[time=2157] And self-control with steadfastness, instead fastness with godliness and godliness with brotherly affection and brotherly affection with love.
[time=2165] For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective.
[time=2170] And here's the opposite of where we're going for in our series.
[time=2172] They keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2177] For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind, having forgotten that he
[time=2183] was cleansed from his former sins.
[time=2186] So much there is God's work through us and in verse 5 it says, "Make every effort." I used to think that meant try harder, Kevin, but really I've learned that walking with the spirit is way less about trying than it is about relying.
[time=2199] It's about his strength not mine because if you read those first several verses, those first four verses, you realize it's all of him and not of me.
[time=2207] This is how we work out what God has worked in and I'm glad God works some things in and works some things out of me so he'll do something through me.
[time=2215] And he gives us these eight healthy habits, faith, virtue, knowledge, self-control, steadfastness,
[time=2221] godliness, brotherly affection and love.
[time=2223] And then in verse 8 he says, "If these qualities are yours and are increasing." So does that mean like they might not be?
[time=2231] They might not.
[time=2232] Was that because you hadn't been trying hard enough?
[time=2235] No.
[time=2236] You've tried before and you still didn't make it, did you?
[time=2239] How do we know that there are ours if we have Jesus as our Lord and Savior, if we have the
[time=2245] fruit of the Spirit, if we've trusted in him for salvation, if he is our Father and we've submitted and surrendered to him all of our life and stopped looking to self as the source of salvation and look to Jesus as the author and perfecter of our faith, that's when we know there are ours.
[time=2261] How many things are in this list?
[time=2262] Nine.
[time=2263] And as we look at this list, what have I told you, is it a plural list or a singular list?
[time=2268] Singular.
[time=2269] It's the fruit of the Spirit.
[time=2272] They're all yours in Christ Jesus.
[time=2275] And they increase the more we trust in and walk in him.
[time=2278] And here's the key to self-control, this is what you've been waiting for.
[time=2281] You ready?
[time=2282] Write this down.
[time=2283] Spirit-control is the only way to achieve self-control.
[time=2292] When we don't walk in those things, verse 9 happens, we become so near-sided that we become blind.
[time=2297] It means you're fixated on one thing at the expense of everything.
[time=2301] We forget that we were cleansed from our former sins.
[time=2304] We forget we lose sight of who God is making us and where God is taking us.
[time=2310] It's only by His strength that we can increase in self-control.
[time=2313] John chapter 3 and verse 30 says, "He must increase and I must decrease." Last week I showed you the pedestal, "Him above them, today I remind you, it's got to be He who is greater than we.
[time=2324] He has got to be greater than we." That's the key to self-control.
[time=2328] So do you want more self-control?
[time=2330] How many self-professing control freaks are in the room?
[time=2333] My hand's not raised just as an example, but to join those of you who will honestly raise your hands.
[time=2337] I like to be in control.
[time=2339] If you want more self-control, the control must be more self-less and spirit-more.
[time=2346] It's got to be self-less, spirit-more.
[time=2351] So I ask you in closing, "What area of control do you need to surrender to the spirit this week?" You've probably got a pretty big list, but let's start with one.
[time=2362] Surrender control, and I believe you've got to implant inside of you a self-control that takes you to all new levels.
[time=2367] I want to ask you just to bow your heads and ponder, "What does that mean?" To surrender control to Jesus and live out a self-less, self-control this week.
[time=2378] Some of you are here and you've got a pretty big list, I'm going to pray for that list.
[time=2381] Some of you are here and you just don't know that if you were to die today, you have trusted in Jesus that you've surrendered control of salvation and of eternity into the hands of Jesus.
[time=2390] You've been looking to yourself as the source of salvation more than you've been looking to the Spirit of God through Jesus Christ, who came and died a brutal death for you.
[time=2400] All of the sin of humanity placed on his shoulders.
[time=2403] He was beaten, he was spat upon, and he was nailed to a cross to pay a price for our sin we could never pay for ourselves.
[time=2410] That penalty was paid, it is finished.
[time=2413] He's won the battle and that battle was characterized and personified when Jesus rose from the dead.
[time=2419] Because he lives, we can have eternal life if we trust in him.
[time=2422] We surrender control.
[time=2423] I'm not going to lead you in a prayer because your heart's screaming it, but all that prayer is of salvation is a communication with God where you're surrendering to him saying, "Jesus, I do need you in your own words.
[time=2434] I know you died for me, and I ask you to save me." The Bible says, "You shall be saved." Anyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
[time=2444] Maybe today is that day's time for you to surrender to him.
[time=2448] I'm going to give you a moment to take those next steps with Jesus in this place, wherever you may be right now.
[time=2471] Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.
[time=2476] Just do some business with Jesus right now.
[time=2478] But I want to give you a chance to acknowledge those next steps that you're taking in your faith.
[time=2483] I want to pray for you.
[time=2484] We want to walk with you.
[time=2485] Even if you're at home right now, wherever that looks like, wherever you're watching this from, wherever you're hearing this message, I want to give you a chance to acknowledge what God has done.
[time=2492] Some of you said yes to Jesus, and I want to do two things.
[time=2494] I want to welcome you to God's family by simply praying for you, and I want to give you some next steps.
[time=2498] It's your journey, but we're here to go on that journey with you as a church and as a family.
[time=2502] So if that is you today, if you said yes to Jesus, you've nailed down your salvation.
[time=2506] Would you signify it?
[time=2507] Would you acknowledge it?
[time=2508] Would you praise God for it by lifting your hands so I can pray for you right now?
[time=2512] I see you.
[time=2513] God bless you.
[time=2514] Who else?
[time=2515] I see you.
[time=2516] God bless you.
[time=2517] Leave me down.
[time=2518] I see you.
[time=2519] God bless you.
[time=2520] Thank you, Jesus.
[time=2521] Who else?
[time=2522] Say today's that day.
[time=2523] Lift it, lift it high.
[time=2524] I want to pray for you at home.
[time=2525] Lift it.
[time=2526] God sees you.
[time=2527] I can't see you, but he sure does, and I'm going to pray for you.
[time=2528] You can put your hands down.
[time=2529] It's a list of things now, or you want to start with one where you know you've got to surrender some control to the spirit this week, and you know what you need to work on.
[time=2537] When you lift your hand, I'm going to pray for you all over the building.
[time=2540] Praise God for you.
[time=2542] Praise God for those of you who said yes to Jesus, and for those of you who continue saying yes to surrendering to his spirit.
[time=2548] Hands down.
[time=2549] God, I thank you for today.
[time=2550] I thank you that the angels in heaven are roaring.
[time=2552] I thank you that next steps are taken.
[time=2554] I thank you that eternities have been won, souls have been saved not because of me, not
[time=2561] because of this church, but because of Jesus, and Jesus alone, and we thank you for the surrendering of control that leads to a submission and a victory from the control that you still
[time=2572] have.
[time=2573] God, you are sovereign.
[time=2574] You are on the throne.
[time=2575] You are never surprised.
[time=2577] And today, God, you've won victories in a time where it seems the enemy is winning everywhere.
[time=2582] You've won eternal battles in this place and around the world wherever all of your friends and family, God, we get to be friends of God.
[time=2589] We get to be children of yours because of Jesus.
[time=2591] We praise you for it.
[time=2593] We thank you for the next steps.
[time=2594] I pray you would empower people to lay down control, empower me, empower us to lay down
[time=2600] control at the foot of the cross today.
[time=2602] We thank you.
[time=2603] We praise you.
[time=2604] We join the angels in heaven today in the name of Jesus who are celebrating.
[time=2608] And all God's people say, "Hey man, you know what to do next.
[time=2612] Let's celebrate.
[time=2613] Let's welcome these to the family of God."
