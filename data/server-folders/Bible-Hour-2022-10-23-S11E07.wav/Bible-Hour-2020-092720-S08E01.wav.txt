[time=0] Did you know Jesus is still on the throne today?
[time=4] Those aren't just words that we sing.
[time=5] Those are realities that we live by.
[time=8] And you know today, if you haven't heard, we're starting a new series and waiting into some potentially controversial things.
[time=15] But you know what I've learned is when we understand that Christ is on His throne and we go to His Word.
[time=22] Things that culturally seem very impossible become a whole lot more simple.
[time=28] And intentionally, we wanted to have communion, one of the two elements, the sacraments that we participate in on just such a day.
[time=36] And I want to start today by reading from 1 Corinthians chapter 10, just before where our elder Phil read from earlier.
[time=44] In verse 16 of 1 Corinthians 10, it says, "The cup of blessing that we bless.
[time=49] Is it not a participation in the blood of Christ?
[time=53] The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?
[time=57] Because there is one bread.
[time=60] We who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread."
[time=66] And really, my friends, today, we're starting a series called Pride and Politics today to speak into something that we are all affected by.
[time=74] But the truth is, it really runs directly into a lot of things Jesus said directly to us.
[time=79] And today, I want to invite you to John chapter 17.
[time=83] John chapter 17, this is the High Priestly Prayer, where we will be in verses 13 through 26 in just a couple of moments.
[time=91] But as we go into this series, we're really looking at the question today of what did Jesus say about politics?
[time=97] It's a good question for us to ask about any area of life that we're struggling with.
[time=101] And have you noticed that politics kind of affect life today?
[time=104] Have you noticed not if you have?
[time=106] It may be the last nod of the day, right?
[time=108] But we're going to nod on that.
[time=109] It affects everything.
[time=110] But Jesus has a lot to say about how we are to navigate, not just politics, but life in general.
[time=117] And so today, as we start, I want to start by telling you that no worries.
[time=120] I am an equal opportunity offender.
[time=125] And I can guarantee that probably everybody in the room will and probably should be offended to some level as we go through this.
[time=133] But I believe what you're going to find is we talk about politics and what Jesus had to say, that it may not be quite what you thought.
[time=139] So I'm going to start with a few things that I'm not doing in this series.
[time=142] Number one, I am not devaluing politics and the impact that it has on how we are to apply our Christian worldview to our faith and our walk of life today.
[time=152] I'm also not devaluing politicians.
[time=154] I was just on the phone with a very dear friend of mine who's a politician at so many levels, has been for many years.
[time=160] And I'm so thankful for people who are not like me, who are at a spot where God has called them to be a politician who is a believer, a believer rather, who is a politician to step into this world and to lead people to know Jesus and through those venues.
[time=177] So I'm not devaluing those things.
[time=179] And here's what I'm also not doing.
[time=180] And you're probably going to let a lot of you down already because you have expectations for me in this series that I can just want to tell you, I'm not going to meet them.
[time=188] But I'm also not asking you to change your political party or even who you vote for.
[time=193] I'm not here to do that.
[time=195] I'm not here to endorse anything.
[time=197] I am asking you though, to change perhaps how you love those who don't see things the way that you see things.
[time=203] In today's climate, if you don't feel some sense of conviction
[time=209] from this couple of weeks and the words of Jesus, then I believe, can I just be real with you guys?
[time=213] I believe you're just deceiving yourself.
[time=215] Because I think we can all grow in how we love because we're not Jesus.
[time=219] Had you look in the mirror this morning and say, "Hey, there's Jesus." I didn't.
[time=224] I look and I go, "There he is again, my biggest problem." And so because of that, I believe we can all learn.
[time=230] And I want you to know our church is a lot more politically diverse than a lot of us may think.
[time=234] We often think that we're just around people who think like us, but I can tell you as a pastor, I've talked with many of you and we're diverse in so many ways.
[time=241] And I think it's a great thing because that is what shows the unity of Jesus and the power of the Gospels we'll look at today.
[time=247] Our nation is set up today, my friends, to be divided, even with the way systems are set up.
[time=252] But Jesus instituted his church so that it would be united.
[time=257] Nothing divides us today like politics.
[time=260] Why?
[time=261] I believe it's because nothing really divides us better than fear does.
[time=264] And we're afraid and we walk in fear so much.
[time=268] When it comes to politics, we say things like, "All right, you ready for it?
[time=271] "Everybody do this." Now everybody do this.
[time=275] I'm gonna say some things that are gonna make you squirm and we're gonna receive it because it's from the Lord today.
[time=279] But we hear things like, "Hey, Republicans, "they're gonna take away our opportunity to vote.
[time=284] "Democrats are gonna take away the guns.
[time=286] "The list goes on and on and on." So let me ask you, what is it exactly that we fear?
[time=291] And I think the answer is losing something, it's loss.
[time=294] We're afraid we're gonna lose something, that something may be taken away like our freedom or progress or control or opportunity or culture or history.
[time=304] People who look like me who are white may fear what might happen while brown and black people fear what has already happened because it's been a reality and not just theory for them and their life.
[time=315] And here's what will happen if we go down this road of fearing what we might lose is that we'll not just become, you know, affected by fear, we will become divided by fear and it will divide God's church and it will cause an opportunity to be present where the enemy can wreak, have it, but Jesus set up his church to win and to be united even through times like this where fear drives us apart, love that is unconditional binds us together.
[time=342] So here's the question we're gonna try to answer for two weeks and I'm gonna give it my best shot but really I'm not so worried.
[time=347] I'm really at peace because I have this and what culturally feels impossible and difficult is really very much simplified by the word of God.
[time=357] And I pray that that is how you feel but here's the question that we're gonna answer is how do we disagree politically yet love unconditionally?
[time=364] How do we disagree, period?
[time=366] But let's talk about politics in this next couple of weeks.
[time=370] How do we disagree politically yet love unconditionally?
[time=372] And here's what I need you to hear.
[time=373] Everybody look at me for a minute, tons of grace.
[time=375] I'm gonna get some stuff wrong.
[time=377] I'm a human.
[time=379] I know some of you just thought I was way better than a human but I hate to break the news to you.
[time=383] I am so far from perfect.
[time=385] I probably won't do it all perfectly but I want us to all come with this posture and here's what I know about so many in these conversations is you think you've got it.
[time=394] It's like, well, it's them, that's the problem.
[time=397] I get it, I'm doing this.
[time=400] If they would just do it with me, everything would go away.
[time=403] But I would say to you do this because God's gotta work in your heart that he wants to do through this season as well.
[time=409] Whether you're at home, in the room, the tension will feel high but it's a good thing.
[time=413] God works through tensions.
[time=415] In fact, the tension between your flesh and the fruit of his spirit is what brought salvation into your life, the tension between your sin and the salvation that only comes from Christ is the beauty of what Jesus did for us, that he enters those tension points.
[time=429] So I'm not asking you again to change your party but I am asking you to think more as a Jesus follower in a time where most people are thinking more as a party follower.
[time=439] I'm gonna ask you to move from toleration to unification.
[time=443] Unity is not uniformity.
[time=444] Unity doesn't mean we all think exactly the same and we all have the same perspectives.
[time=449] Unity means we strive for peace with everyone.
[time=451] We do our part to be the body of Christ and to love unconditionally, even where disagreements abound and the things.
[time=457] There are things that we should divide over.
[time=459] Salvation issues, but what we often do is we take things that are not salvation issues.
[time=464] We zoom in and focus on those at the expense of the real salvation issues and the enemy laughs.
[time=470] And so may we not do that and move from tolerating those that we don't see eye to eye with, to unifying with those we don't see eye to eye with.
[time=477] I'm gonna give you two questions that are gonna help your posture.
[time=480] All right, you ready for them?
[time=481] Number one is this, and they're tough questions.
[time=483] Number one is will you evaluate your politics through the filter of your faith instead of, and here's what we so often do, instead of creating a version of your faith that fits your politics.
[time=496] A lot of times we look at faith through the lens of politics, but my friends, we're called to look at life, including politics through the lens of our faith first.
[time=507] And I know some of you think, well, I'm doing that, but be open to the fact that maybe you've got some ways to go.
[time=512] Second question, will you follow Jesus?
[time=515] Even if following him ends up putting some space in between you and your preferred platform, your preferred candidate or your party.
[time=524] Will you follow Jesus, even if it doesn't align with everything you once thought maybe it aligned with?
[time=531] I hope we can say yes to those questions and lean in together.
[time=533] And the beauty is Jesus saw this tension coming.
[time=536] Jesus saw our problems on the way.
[time=539] Jesus saw the divisions and the hurts that would come from seasons just like we live in today.
[time=544] And the division within, and even the church that's created by this current political climate and culture and context, here's the beauty.
[time=552] It intersects with, it runs directly into something Jesus very specifically talked about and prayed for.
[time=560] And that's where I wanna take us to join chapter 17.
[time=564] And here's the truth when it comes to this question of what did Jesus say about politics?
[time=568] The answer really is, the truth is Jesus didn't say much about politics at all, and that's the point.
[time=573] And so as we look at it today, understand that the world attempted to politicize Jesus throughout his entire life and ministry.
[time=584] His whole life and ministry, he was politicized, but he thought it was about something bigger.
[time=589] He talked about it and he prayed for it.
[time=591] In John 17, we're in the final moments of the life of Jesus before he's gonna give his life a ransom for many to pay a penalty for our sins.
[time=598] We couldn't pay for ourselves.
[time=599] And he prayed for some very specific things.
[time=601] In John 17, the first five verses, he prayed for himself.
[time=605] He prayed for his current disciples all the way through verse 19, and then in verses 20 through 26, he prayed for his future followers and raise your hand if you would fit a future category when Jesus prayed this.
[time=615] You should raise your hand, just check him to make sure you're awake.
[time=617] That's you, that's me, he prayed for you.
[time=619] And so what he prayed for is what intersects with directly where we're at as a nation and where we are as God's church today.
[time=626] And you can see his prayer kind of summarized in verse 11.
[time=629] So let's start there, then we'll jump to verse 13.
[time=632] I'll give you three things he prayed for in this series.
[time=635] Verse 11, "And I am no longer in the world." These are red letters coming from Jesus.
[time=640] "But they are in the world." This is the disciples, "And I am coming to you, Holy Father.
[time=644] "Keep them in your name, which you have given me, "that they may be one even as we are one." At the end of Jesus' mission, what he cared the most about, what he prayed the most for is our unity, is our unity.
[time=664] And I wanna give you today three things that he specifically prayed for.
[time=666] Number one comes from verses 13 through 19.
[time=669] And it's that Jesus prayed for our hurts, our hurts.
[time=672] Jesus knew that we would hurt each other.
[time=674] Jesus knew that we would get hurt.
[time=676] Jesus knew that we would be hated in the world versus 13 through 19.
[time=680] Read those with me as where we see this prayer for our hurts that Jesus prayed.
[time=684] He said, "But now I'm coming to you, "and these things I speak in the world, "that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves." Maybe you need some of that joy today.
[time=695] Jesus is praying for you, verse 14.
[time=697] "I have given them your word, and the world has hated them "because they are not of the world, "just as I am not of the world.
[time=704] "I do not ask that you take them out of the world, "but that you keep them from the evil one.
[time=709] "They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world." Second time, so here's what we're to do with that.
[time=714] Sanctify them, Jesus prays, set them apart, he's saying.
[time=717] "In the truth, your word is truth.
[time=719] "As you sent me into the world, "so I have sent them into the world, "and for their sake, I consecrate, or set apart, "or sanctify, I consecrate myself "that they also may be sanctified in truth." Everybody say those last two words, in truth, in truth.
[time=737] And so as we look at these things, let's look at a few things.
[time=740] Number one, from those first few verses, verses 13 through 16, Jesus is saying, "Hey, the world is gonna hate you.
[time=746] "You're not gonna be at home in the world, "just like I wasn't, and you're not of the world, "just like me." And really, everybody wanted a piece of Jesus.
[time=755] Everybody wanted to get him on their side.
[time=758] Everybody wanted to politicize Jesus in the first century.
[time=761] They wanted to do that, and in our 21st century, it looks kinda like, well, Jesus would be a Republican, for sure, because of his values, or Jesus would be a Democrat, for sure, because of his care for people.
[time=770] Or Jesus would be, and the list could go on and on, and we try to politicize Jesus.
[time=775] And people have asked, well, and this is what some of you came today, hoping I would do, and I'm probably going to disappoint you.
[time=781] Couldn't you do a sermon showing that Jesus was a Democrat?
[time=784] Couldn't you do a sermon showing that Jesus was a Republican, or a Libertarian, or a This, or a Thatarian, or whatever it is, and all the isms and Arians that are out there today?
[time=793] And the answer honestly is, yes, I could.
[time=796] Why? Because if you look at faith and the words of Jesus through the lens of politics, you can really make Jesus say about whatever you want him to.
[time=805] Let's be honest.
[time=805] And people are doing it everywhere.
[time=807] Different parties and platforms are peddling the fear to do that, even using the words of scripture.
[time=813] And ultimately, it would end up looking something like this.
[time=816] He's so red, he's so blue.
[time=818] Isn't it amazing how much he agrees with you?
[time=820] But now that you laugh with me for a moment, I'm glad we can laugh.
[time=826] Let me make a tough statement.
[time=828] And this is true of homelessness as a believer in the world period, but it also applies politically.
[time=833] I wanna say it to you this way.
[time=834] If you feel politically homeless, you're likely approaching where God wants you.
[time=838] I figured it'd be quiet.
[time=842] Let me explain.
[time=844] Matthew chapter eight, Luke chapter nine, or a couple of places you can see in the context of people trying to follow Jesus, that he says to them, you know, he says the foxes, they have their burrows and everybody, the world people have their home, but he says this about himself, but the son of man doesn't have anywhere to lay his head.
[time=860] Toss of his homelessness and how in verses 13 through 19, the world has hated him, so it will hate us.
[time=865] And so the world tried to politicize Jesus as a king that would overthrow the political systems of Rome, the empire of Rome.
[time=874] And in first John chapter number two, I wanna read this to you.
[time=878] This is a good way for us to look at life in general, especially in veins like this, things of the world.
[time=883] And I wanna remind you, my friends, that our political systems are things in the world.
[time=887] They matter and Christians should influence those and we should be light in those systems where God has called us, but they're all temporary.
[time=894] And so as you have that in mind, let's read first John two, 15 through 17, says do not love the world or the things of the world.
[time=901] If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him for all that is in the world, the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and the pride and possessions is not from the Father, but is from the world and the world, verse 17, is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.
[time=922] First John chapter five and verse 19, which is a few chapters later were reminded of similar things that, hey, your children of God, but the world lies in the hands of the evil one.
[time=931] Have you noticed that to be true lately?
[time=933] The enemy is wreaking havoc in the world and he's even wreaking havoc in the church, but the remedy to it is the words of Jesus that we're looking at today.
[time=943] He prayed for these hurts and these hates that often drive us.
[time=947] And I wanna give you an old testament example of this.
[time=949] This is, wow, just blew my mind as I saw this.
[time=952] Right before Joshua chapter five, chapter five is right before chapter six.
[time=957] And in chapter six, you're welcome.
[time=958] Chapter six is the fall of Jericho.
[time=961] The walls came tumbling down.
[time=963] It was one of the greatest victories in Joshua's life.
[time=965] You had many, this was one of the greatest ones.
[time=967] But at the end of chapter five versus 13 through 15, there's something that happened right before that one of the greatest victories of his life that may be applies to us in this idea of homelessness, not just politically, but in the world in general.
[time=981] And Joshua had a mindset a lot like what maybe you and I do, but the angel of the Lord helped correct it.
[time=987] So verse 13, when Joshua was by Jericho, Joshua chapter five, verse 13, he lifted his eyes and looked and behold, a man was standing before him with his sword drawn and in his hand.
[time=998] And Joshua went to him and said to him, are you for us or for our adversaries?
[time=1003] Does that sound familiar?
[time=1004] Verse 14 and he said, no.
[time=1008] But I am the commander of the army of the Lord.
[time=1012] Now I have come and Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped and said to him, what does my Lord say to his servant and the commander of the Lord's army said to Joshua, take off your sandals from your feet for the place where you are standing is holy and Joshua did so.
[time=1035] He started with this question.
[time=1039] Who were you for?
[time=1041] Us or them?
[time=1043] Me or my adversaries?
[time=1046] To which the angel of the Lord said, no.
[time=1048] I'm the commander of the army of the Lord.
[time=1050] And Joshua started with the question that many of us are asking today, but he ended with a world-changing question where he said, what does my Lord have for his servant?
[time=1062] I'm telling you from my friends, that question could change your world in mine.
[time=1070] Could change the climate of the church.
[time=1072] If we would just, as the angel of the Lord said, be obedient to God and say, Lord, what message do you have for your servant?
[time=1079] Not how can I fit this category or that category, but how can I align with the kingdom of God?
[time=1085] In a world full of hurts and harms, Jesus desires our humility.
[time=1089] That's what it'll take for you to be able to do what Joshua did.
[time=1093] Hurts, harms, they're everywhere, but Jesus wants your humility.
[time=1097] Verses 17 through 19 that we just read, he said, sanctify them by your truth and he sent us into the world as he was sanctified and consecrated and set apart himself in the truth.
[time=1107] He's just doing the same of us.
[time=1108] He's calling us to be set apart different, homeless, if you will, because of the truth of the word of God and to be sent into the world.
[time=1116] He said, God, I'm not praying that you take them out, I'm sending them in.
[time=1119] I'm sending in the army and we are that army and that is why my friends don't miss this.
[time=1124] On all issues, we are not called to think in terms of left and right.
[time=1128] We are called to think in terms of right and wrong.
[time=1131] Sanctify us, Lord, by your truth, not by systems.
[time=1136] One of the most, I'm gonna be honest with you for a minute.
[time=1138] Can I be real?
[time=1139] Here's where some of those phrases might make you tense up.
[time=1142] So everybody just do this again.
[time=1143] We're doing this together, God's got us.
[time=1145] I'll tell you one of the most difficult things about being a pastor or a leader in general is today.
[time=1149] It's that every word I use is politicized.
[time=1154] Every word, yours too.
[time=1156] If you didn't know what's happening, you're welcome.
[time=1158] Now you're gonna think differently about your words.
[time=1160] Well, hey, maybe we should.
[time=1162] And it's things like this.
[time=1163] If I say something about having compassion for women, oh, he leans left.
[time=1170] If I say something about compassion for minorities, oh, he leans left, compassion about first responders, oh, he leans right, compassion for immigrants, oh, he leans left, compassion for veterans, oh, he leans right, compassion for the poor, oh, he leans left, passion about a biblical definition of marriage, oh, he leans right.
[time=1186] But here's the thing, my friends, that mindset and that categorization leads us in results in people becoming discipled at times more by a party than by the kingdom of God.
[time=1198] And thinking more about sides than spirituality.
[time=1201] Then Christians who vote Republican won't speak against racism because, well, that's a left issue.
[time=1206] Or Christians who vote Democrat won't speak against the killing of the unborn because, well, that's a right issue.
[time=1212] But the truth is God speaks on any and all of these things and he does not stutter.
[time=1218] And so where God speaks, we are called to speak not through the lens of a party, but through the lens of the kingdom of God.
[time=1224] So what does that make God?
[time=1226] I think the angel of the Lord answered that.
[time=1228] No, I'm of the kingdom.
[time=1231] I'm a commander of the army of the Lord.
[time=1233] And when believers fight with believers in front of non-believers, everybody loses.
[time=1237] Write that down.
[time=1238] Said that to you many times.
[time=1240] When believers fight with believers in front of non-believers, everybody loses.
[time=1245] And I gotta be honest, my brothers and sisters, my heart is really burdened and grieved today because I see this being used of the enemy to rip God's church apart.
[time=1258] And as lovingly and as graciously as I can in a shepherding voice to you today, I implore you to stop being used by the enemy in this way.
[time=1269] Let us be used by God.
[time=1273] And next week, I know some of you are like, well, tell us how to vote.
[time=1275] Tell us how to apply it more deeply.
[time=1276] I'm gonna get there, not the way you think I am.
[time=1279] But next week, I'm gonna give you a quote, unquote, voters guide.
[time=1283] Yep, that's right, it's probably not the one you're wanting.
[time=1286] But I believe it's gonna help you.
[time=1287] So next week, we're gonna apply this more deeply.
[time=1289] So you gotta be here next Sunday, but we can't get there until we get this stuff right first.
[time=1295] This is the foundation of all of it as we look at Jesus' platform next week.
[time=1298] The bottom line is that our allegiance as Christians is not to a party, it's to a kingdom.
[time=1302] And don't miss this, that pledging allegiance primarily to a party, we often think it's gonna give us this great, well thought out political ideology.
[time=1310] Maybe it does.
[time=1311] But a lot of times it doesn't give us this solid political ideology.
[time=1316] Oftentimes it turns into a sinful political idolatry where we worship it more than the kingdom of God.
[time=1324] And that means where God's spoken, we've gotta speak.
[time=1327] And that's why I'm speaking today.
[time=1328] I think I've told you before.
[time=1329] I've asked God, you know, not now God.
[time=1333] And God said, no, now's the time.
[time=1334] Number one, He prayed for our hurts.
[time=1336] Number two, He prayed for our harmony.
[time=1338] Right that down.
[time=1339] Versus 20 through 23, let's pick up where we left off.
[time=1342] Jesus also prayed for our harmony.
[time=1344] He thought I was gonna land the plane there.
[time=1345] There's still so much more.
[time=1347] We could do this for a long time.
[time=1348] But I think two weeks is all we can handle, but we're gonna be blessed.
[time=1351] And we're gonna be different because Jesus prayed for our harmony.
[time=1355] Verse 20 says, and this is where He shifts and prays for us as future followers together.
[time=1360] So this is where it becomes very personal.
[time=1362] Verse 20, I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me, that's us through their word.
[time=1369] That they may all be one just as you father are in me and you that they may also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me, the glory that you have given me, I've given to them that they may be one even as we are one.
[time=1385] I in them and you and me that they may become perfectly one.
[time=1390] Wow, that seems far-fetched.
[time=1391] So that, why?
[time=1393] What's the why behind this, Jesus?
[time=1395] So that the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you have loved me.
[time=1402] And verse 20, Jesus prays for us, and we rarely ask God for the things that Jesus asked God sometimes, especially in such emotionally charged, heightened seasons like what we're in now.
[time=1412] But He says that all of them, all, you know what the word all means in the Greek?
[time=1417] All, no exclusions that all of them may be one.
[time=1422] And then He says perfectly one or completely one.
[time=1426] And in the first century, that may have looked like Jew, Gentile, rich, poor, slave, tax gatherers, tax people, educated, uneducated.
[time=1433] And the list just has built and continued into the 21st century.
[time=1436] Now it includes Democrats, Republicans, libertarians, librarians, red, yellow, black, brown, white, but they're all precious in His sight.
[time=1446] And Jesus prayed that they all, all of them, every list you could make would be one in Jesus Christ.
[time=1453] That's His prayer for us.
[time=1455] And that seems today impossible, but to Jesus it was imperative.
[time=1460] And that is why my brothers and sisters it's got to be intentional for us.
[time=1464] And that's why we're talking about it today.
[time=1467] Verse 21, why is first time He gives us the so that?
[time=1470] Why, why do we do this?
[time=1471] Well, so that the world, people outside the faith may believe that Jesus was who He said He was and that the world would see our unity despite and even through our diversity.
[time=1481] And be encouraged, and some of you feel discouraged by this, that we as a church are more politically diverse than you want to think we are.
[time=1488] And it's okay, it's the beauty of the gospel that could take a politically diverse group of people and have them focus on an internal truth in such a way that transcends all of the divides and brings people together.
[time=1503] The world will take note when that happens.
[time=1506] Jesus said it this way in John chapter 13, verse 34.
[time=1509] He says, "A new commandment I give you." And it's not a new suggestion.
[time=1513] It's a new commandment.
[time=1514] And what was new about it was the insertion of Jesus into it.
[time=1518] Let's read it together.
[time=1519] Verse 34, Jesus said, "A new commandment I give to you that you love one another." Here's the new part, "Just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.
[time=1528] By this, all people will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another." And Jesus, my brothers and sisters, loved people who we disagreed with.
[time=1539] Actually, that would be all of us.
[time=1541] He was truth and we weren't walking in the truth nor the people that he met with, the people that he healed, the people that he preached to.
[time=1548] But he loved them unconditionally and he made the main thing, the main thing.
[time=1552] He preached the kingdom of God while the world tried to take him all these different ways.
[time=1556] Yet when I look around today, maybe you can identify, I'm disheartened by what seems to be so many Christians hating those who don't vote like they do.
[time=1563] And this goes against the very command that Jesus gave and the very prayer that Jesus prayed.
[time=1572] And I pray for believers who would see their hearts grieved to love like Jesus loved.
[time=1578] That's the new command that he gave to us.
[time=1582] Versus 22 and 23, his prayer was that we would be brought to complete or perfect unity.
[time=1586] You'd be perfectly one, not partially one or politically one, but perfectly one, completely one.
[time=1592] That doesn't mean you're perfect.
[time=1593] That means that the unity that binds us together is perfect and that only comes from the spirit of God.
[time=1598] And that's what Jesus is praying over us today.
[time=1601] But the end of verse 23, don't miss it.
[time=1603] This is the key to being able to do it.
[time=1604] 'Cause all of you, if you're letting me, you feel so convicted, you feel so heavy right now, you feel like I can never do this.
[time=1609] Well, here's a verse, this for you.
[time=1611] Verse 23, all this is so that the world will know, but it's also to be reminded that you have loved them.
[time=1616] Jesus said this to the Father.
[time=1618] You've loved them like you've loved me.
[time=1620] Did you know that Jesus loves you as his kids like he loves Jesus?
[time=1625] And all God's people said, wow.
[time=1628] Everybody say, wow.
[time=1630] If that's not a wow moment, then what is?
[time=1634] That God loves me like he loves his son.
[time=1637] He loves me as one of his kids.
[time=1639] And it is only through that kind of love that we can love people with whom we disagree politically or otherwise in the way that Jesus loves and loved and will always love them.
[time=1650] May we take that to heart in a powerful way and don't miss this as well.
[time=1655] Verse 23, what Jesus is saying is that the message of Jesus, the mission of Jesus is authenticated by the unity of his church.
[time=1662] And so when what is divided everywhere else in the world is united through the church, the world will take note of the power of the gospel.
[time=1672] That is what Jesus is teaching us.
[time=1673] And when the world takes note of God's power through the power of the gospel, it happens when his church chooses, you ready for this?
[time=1680] Not to be divided over one person who will sit in an oval office for four to eight years, but instead choosing to be united under a king who will reign forever and forever and forever.
[time=1695] May we be reminded that Jesus is on his throne and does he care about these things who sits in these offices absolutely and should we vote and should we be a part of it absolutely, but should it consume us to the point where it divides and devours us and becomes a tool of the enemy?
[time=1711] Absolutely never.
[time=1714] And that's what Jesus is praying for in this prayer.
[time=1717] He says, then the world will know you have sent me.
[time=1719] It revolves around our unity.
[time=1721] And after the resurrection, don't miss this, that this kind of unity, it was rampant.
[time=1727] People were so focused on the message of Jesus and the mission of making disciples that they shared all that they had.
[time=1733] They were of one mind and one accord.
[time=1736] This has happened before.
[time=1737] And it's that Christianity that shaped Western civilization, the same civilization in world, the society in which we live today, the fruits that we benefit from today, Christianity has shaped it.
[time=1748] And it was all started with unity around a mission, around the way, the truth and the life and his name is Jesus.
[time=1756] It shaped Western civilization and God's call, my brothers and sisters, is that it would continue shaping it today, that we would be united around this mission.
[time=1765] It was the unity of the church that got the attention of a pagan war home.
[time=1769] And so think about it this way that your preferred candidate will be in office, will win or lose, based on what America does with a vote on one day in November.
[time=1780] But the church will win or lose based off of what Jesus has already done and is still doing every day.
[time=1790] As he said, I will build my church and even the gates of hell won't prevail against it.
[time=1793] But the church, as he has sent us out, will win or lose based off of how we live out his love for the world as his disciples every day.
[time=1802] So is your hope hinging on one day in November or the every day that Jesus has already won and the every day we get to be a part of as his church?
[time=1811] That's why we must not allow anything or anyone to divide us as God's people.
[time=1816] Here's a good question for us to remember, why would we as followers of an eternal king allow ourselves to be divided by temporary systems?
[time=1824] But yet we do sometimes, don't we?
[time=1828] Pray we'd be reunited, why would we allow ourselves to be divided by fear, fear of loss?
[time=1832] Jesus most repeated command was fear not and he's got a message for you with fear today.
[time=1837] You ready for it?
[time=1838] He says fear not, a king has come and that king is on the throne and that king cannot be overthrown from his throne.
[time=1847] So fear not, we'll talk more about that next week but today let's close that thought before I take you to the last point today of how do you label yourself?
[time=1858] Sometimes I hear I'm a Republican Christian, I'm a Democrat Christian, I'm a this Christian or I'm a that Christian.
[time=1864] I got a word for you, you ready for it?
[time=1867] Christian alone is enough.
[time=1870] Christian alone, Jesus follower alone is all it takes.
[time=1876] It's all it takes, everything else are temporary systems that matter, that matter that we should be Christian in and in two.
[time=1884] But may we label ourselves as followers of Jesus as builders of his kingdom before everything else in this life?
[time=1892] Jesus prayed for your hurts, your harmony and then he prayed for our hearts verses 24 through 26, let's read that together.
[time=1898] He prayed for your heart and mind because really with Jesus he takes everything to the heart as everything really is a heart issue.
[time=1903] Let's look at that together.
[time=1904] Verse 24, father I desire that they also whom you've given me may be with me where I am to see my glory that you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world.
[time=1916] O righteous father even though the world does not know you, I know you and these know you that you have sent me, I made known to them your name and I will continue to make it known.
[time=1926] Here's why, here's the heart part.
[time=1928] That the love with which you've loved me may be in them and I in them.
[time=1934] Verse 24, that they may be with me.
[time=1936] Verse 25, that they may know you.
[time=1938] Verse 26, that the love with which you've loved me may be in them and that I Jesus could be in us.
[time=1944] That's a heart thing and that's why Proverbs 4, 23 reminds us keep your heart with all diligence for out of it springs the issues of life.
[time=1953] So I ask you a personal question today, where is your heart?
[time=1956] What holds your heart?
[time=1958] Is it the love of the Father through Jesus Christ or is it a political party?
[time=1964] Or is it an election in November?
[time=1966] Or is it an ideology that you think you hold that is becoming an idolatry in your life?
[time=1972] Is it non issues or secondary issues that matter that you've elevated on the pedestal of your priorities?
[time=1979] How many of you remember that?
[time=1981] Where them gets elevated above him.
[time=1985] What or who holds your heart today?
[time=1989] Such an important question and I know some of you are saying well you didn't get into the meat.
[time=1994] You didn't get into the stuff you really should have gotten into and you know what next week I'm gonna get into some of that probably not all of it you want me to because really I want to stay focused on the simplicity of the gospel.
[time=2004] In a world that's becoming so divided over so many things that yes they matter but in the scope of eternity maybe they don't matter quite as much as we're making them so many times today.
[time=2014] And I hear phrases like this I'm gonna get personal as we land our plane here today.
[time=2018] People say things like I don't know how or I don't understand or I don't see how you could call yourself a Christian and be a Republican or call yourself a Christian and be a Democrat.
[time=2030] Maybe you've heard those things.
[time=2032] I'm gonna get up in your grill for just a moment if I may.
[time=2036] I'm gonna do it anyway.
[time=2037] Equal opportunity offender I told you.
[time=2040] But when you say things like I just don't know how you could blink.
[time=2043] You made a confession when you said that.
[time=2046] You said you know I don't know.
[time=2048] That's your confession.
[time=2049] There's something you don't know and next week we're gonna talk about how you can know and how we can understand as Jesus did.
[time=2055] He knew the truth, he was the truth.
[time=2057] But he chose to sit with people who didn't and who disagreed with him and who thought he was crazy that thought he was a lunatic.
[time=2064] And maybe we're called to do that as well.
[time=2066] So two challenges for you about your heart if you said or even heard those things or you're tempted to say those things like I know many of us are.
[time=2073] Number one guard your heart from judging someone else's salvation.
[time=2076] I sure am glad that only Jesus can judge mine.
[time=2080] And so may we never get to that kind of a level with our words, power of death and life is in your tongue.
[time=2086] So maybe we use it, well, it's a heart issue.
[time=2088] It flows out, the issues of life flow out.
[time=2090] Number two guard your heart from viewing the world through a political lens ahead of your faith lens.
[time=2096] Start with faith.
[time=2098] Politics will be impacted by it, but we can't start with a political lens.
[time=2102] Here's the point that politics should be an area of application for our Christian worldview, but it can easily become our worldview.
[time=2111] And that's what God wants us to guard our hearts against because when that happens, when politics shape our worldview, do they influence it?
[time=2117] Are they a venue for it?
[time=2119] 100%.
[time=2121] But if politics becomes our worldview, the lens we look through, our hearts get hard and hard and hearts lead to things like what I'm about to say is kind of a tough statement, but I got to say it to you, my brothers and sisters today.
[time=2134] And it's this that if a Christian's politically motivated actions are not intended towards the good of their enemies, then their political witness is not Christian in character.
[time=2145] I figured it'd be silent, but the truth is, and I'm going to read it again, is that Jesus said we've got to love even our enemies.
[time=2153] And so if we're to love our enemies, certainly we are to love people who disagree with us politically.
[time=2158] And I'll say it again, if a Christian's politically motivated actions and that could be what you're posting on social media, you want to know where your heart's at, what are you posting?
[time=2165] What's dominating your conversations?
[time=2167] What's driving your thoughts, your words and your life?
[time=2170] If a Christian's politically motivated actions are not intended towards the good of their enemies, then their political witness is not Christian in character.
[time=2177] Something else has consumed you.
[time=2179] And Christians should care about politics because politics are this forum, it's an essential forum in which we love our neighbor.
[time=2186] And that's why we're spending two weeks looking at how we engage in politics.
[time=2190] Not if I'm saying you should, but how we do it and how it consumes us is what concerns me, it's what breaks my heart as I look around today.
[time=2199] And I want to remind us of what truly matters.
[time=2201] Our responsibility as God's church is to show the divided world what unity looks like.
[time=2208] And so I want to give you three baby steps because Lord knows we need them to be baby steps on this topic.
[time=2212] Don't miss next week, we're going to dig deeper, probably not into everything you want me to say, but enough.
[time=2218] The things that Jesus said, Philippians chapter two verses one through 11, read ahead for next week.
[time=2222] But I want to give you three baby steps.
[time=2223] Number one, pray as Jesus prayed.
[time=2225] I want to ask you a personal question.
[time=2227] When was the last time you prayed for unity?
[time=2229] You may have been praying for a lot of other things, but what was the last time he just prayed for unity?
[time=2233] That's what Jesus prayed for at the end of his life and his mission.
[time=2236] And I believe we should pray for the same thing.
[time=2238] And here's an application prayer.
[time=2240] If you need a place to start 'cause some of you are like, man, I don't even know how to do that.
[time=2243] I'm glad you're honest, I'm glad you asked.
[time=2245] I'm going to share a prayer that I'm praying for myself.
[time=2248] Right now.
[time=2250] Jesus, I lay all of my party affiliation, all my political rights, all my social goals, and all my worldly identities at your feet.
[time=2259] Unite my heart to fear your name and submit every other allegiance to your throne.
[time=2266] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=2268] It's a great place for you to start.
[time=2269] Let's pray for unity.
[time=2270] Pray as Jesus, pray.
[time=2271] Number two, praise and fast.
[time=2273] Praise and fast.
[time=2274] We started the year with prayer and fasting 2020, and we're ending 2020, starting last week with praise and prayer and fasting.
[time=2281] And so we're looking for positives in the negative, and we're praising God for all these things that he's using that are negative to do positive gospel-centered things, good news-centered things.
[time=2291] So find reasons to praise God in this year.
[time=2293] And fasting looks like you're giving something up in order to spend the time you would have spent or the resources and energy you would have spent on that thing, spending it on your walk with Jesus.
[time=2302] And so that may mean you do a meal a week that you give up and you just spend time praying or meal a day or it may be, you ready for this?
[time=2308] You may be that you just get off social media so you can focus on Jesus during an election season.
[time=2313] Ask God to show you, and he'll show you.
[time=2316] Pray as Jesus prayed.
[time=2317] Praise and fast for 15 weeks that will carry us to the end of 2020.
[time=2321] And number three, find ways to love unconditionally, those with whom you disagree politically.
[time=2326] First of all, you need to be around some people you disagree with politically.
[time=2330] 'Cause sometimes we surround ourselves only with people that think and look and act and vote and do everything, just like us, and we say, like, see, everybody else is the problem.
[time=2336] We all agree, and group thinks, sets in, and you think nobody is diverse.
[time=2340] There's diversity in our church, my friends, so have conversations like Jesus did.
[time=2345] And find ways to love unconditionally even when you disagree politically.
[time=2348] That means carrying more about the people, God's called you to love than the party you want to represent.
[time=2353] And if I could give you a number four, it's not on the screen, it's don't miss week two.
[time=2357] 'Cause I'm gonna show you a little bit more from Philippians too on what that looks like.
[time=2363] Bow your heads with me.
[time=2365] Close your eyes, don't look around, just think about what God is doing inside of you in this moment.
[time=2370] I wanna pray for you, heavy stuff.
[time=2373] Tough days, but listen, the gospel is still good news.
[time=2377] It's still already happened.
[time=2379] Jesus is still on the throne.
[time=2382] And we can love unconditionally despite disagreements, politically or anywhere else in life.
[time=2386] We can pray like Jesus prayed.
[time=2388] We can find reasons to praise and fast in these 15 weeks to close 2020.
[time=2395] And so believers in the room, I wanna ask you to ask God for your first and most important step to take this week.
[time=2402] Maybe it's in the line of those three things I gave you.
[time=2404] Maybe it's something totally different.
[time=2405] Listen to him, not me.
[time=2407] He's the author and finisher of your faith.
[time=2409] So believers in the room, will you pray and ask God to show you what your next step is?
[time=2412] And in a moment, I'm gonna ask you if God gave you one and I'm gonna pray for you and I'm gonna ask you to lift your hand.
[time=2416] I hope the whole room has lifted hands.
[time=2418] But some of you, as believers pray for that would say today that I need to trust in Jesus as my savior.
[time=2424] That's my first step.
[time=2426] I can't be united by the kingdom of God because I'm not really a child of God because I haven't really trusted in Jesus and Jesus alone for salvation.
[time=2432] That the good news of the gospel is that Jesus died to pay a debt, a price, a penalty for my sin that I couldn't pay by dying that death on the cross.
[time=2439] His blood is my atonement.
[time=2441] It means it atones.
[time=2442] It takes my place.
[time=2444] I deserved it.
[time=2445] Jesus took it.
[time=2446] He was the only perfect sacrifice.
[time=2447] He paid it.
[time=2448] He rose again.
[time=2449] He's alive and because he lives, I can partake in the victory of her death hell in the grave.
[time=2455] I can be a child of God.
[time=2456] That's the gospel.
[time=2458] And you may say, I don't even know how to pray that.
[time=2460] I don't really believe in leading too many prayers because I think, you know, sometimes we think a prayer or words save us.
[time=2465] It's your heart.
[time=2466] Surrender it to God in your own words.
[time=2467] But let Jesus know that you believe he is who he said he was.
[time=2471] He did what he came to do and he's alive.
[time=2473] You believe that he's Lord and you surrender your life to him.
[time=2477] What does that even mean, pastor?
[time=2478] Glad you asked.
[time=2479] Surrendering means you start trusting in him and nothing else.
[time=2483] Because Jesus plus nothing equals everything.
[time=2485] That's the gospel.
[time=2486] If you haven't done that, take a moment and do that as believers are praying for our next steps right now.
[time=2509] How many of you in the room would say, nobody's looking around.
[time=2511] I just want to give you two next steps.
[time=2513] I want to pray for you, welcome you to God's family, and then I want to show you what's next.
[time=2516] We want to walk with you.
[time=2516] How many of you would say, you know what?
[time=2517] I trusted Jesus for salvation today.
[time=2519] Today is that day.
[time=2520] I nailed that now and I want to pray for you, but I want you to acknowledge that.
[time=2523] There's power in that acknowledgement.
[time=2525] Would you lift your hand right now?
[time=2526] Say, pastor, pray for me.
[time=2527] I gave my life to Jesus.
[time=2528] God bless you, sir.
[time=2529] I see you.
[time=2530] Who else?
[time=2532] I see you, ma'am.
[time=2533] God bless you.
[time=2534] Who else?
[time=2535] Thank you, Jesus.
[time=2537] This is what matters.
[time=2539] This is where it's at.
[time=2540] This is the kingdom stuff.
[time=2541] Thank you, Jesus.
[time=2543] Who in the room would say, I'm a believer?
[time=2545] And boy, I ask God for our next step and I know what it is.
[time=2548] Would you lift your hand?
[time=2549] I want to pray for you.
[time=2550] Oh, I thank God for all the honesty and the hands that are lifted.
[time=2553] Thank you, Jesus.
[time=2554] God, we thank you today for victories.
[time=2556] God, victories have been one where the enemy is constantly taking ground.
[time=2560] It seems from your kingdom, we're reminded by today that Jesus, you're on the throne and that nothing can overthrow you, that even death hell in the grave can't win against you.
[time=2569] Much less a political consumption.
[time=2572] Much less the direction, even of a nation.
[time=2574] God let us be believers who wade into those waters, who are light, who are salt, who are Jesus, who are believers that show the world what unity looks like.
[time=2585] But God, may we never get consumed to the point that we forget that things like what just happened in this room and at home.
[time=2592] God, I pray that we would never forget that this is what matters for eternity.
[time=2597] And I thank you for those who said yes to Jesus, those at home, that I couldn't see, but you could see, and those in the room who said yes to Jesus, and those who said I got a next step, got in power, and equipped them to take that step.
[time=2609] And may we as a church walk together as we trust Jesus in this place, through this place, but God not as a place, as a body, as a family, as a people of God, we're united while the world around us is divided.
[time=2622] Thank you, that you love us.
[time=2626] Help us live it out this week, in Jesus' name.
[time=2629] We celebrate with the angels in heaven today, and all God's people said, hey man, can we give it up for Jesus?
