[time=0] Today I want to talk to you about what is Jesus' platform?
[time=4] What is Jesus' platform?
[time=5] Important question for today.
[time=7] And, you know, as we started this series, a lot of questions swirled through a lot of heads, things like, well, who's the pastor going to endorse?
[time=14] Which way is he going to lean?
[time=16] And you've been looking for some of those things perhaps, but I've tried to point us to some really important questions.
[time=22] Last week from John 17, looking at what would Jesus have to say?
[time=26] What did Jesus say about politics?
[time=28] And today, what is Jesus' platform?
[time=31] And as we saw last week, I believe I can answer that question.
[time=34] You can word it a lot of different ways, but I would tell you that Jesus' platform is a kingdom platform.
[time=40] It's not a temporary system.
[time=42] It's not a political system.
[time=43] It's the kingdom of God.
[time=45] Everybody tried to politicize Jesus all of his life, but he was all about the kingdom.
[time=49] So I would tell you that I want to go and start by answering this question from the beginning.
[time=52] Usually I'd save it for a little later, but you've got a promise to hang in there with me as I unpack why I'm answering it this way.
[time=58] His platform is kingdom humility.
[time=61] It's kingdom humility.
[time=63] And I can prove it to you from Philippians two and from the life and ministry of Jesus.
[time=68] And so last week, I really talked to you about the need for us to change our glasses, to change the lens through which we look at life.
[time=77] It's got to start with faith in a time where everybody's looking through the lens of politics with everything.
[time=83] Isn't everything politicized today?
[time=85] Can I get an amen?
[time=86] But we're going to kingdomize.
[time=87] Yeah, I made it up.
[time=88] We're going to kingdomize everything as God's church.
[time=92] And where there's no love, there's not going to be any godly handling of truth.
[time=95] And so we're looking at truth and love.
[time=97] Jesus is the full embodiment of both truth and of love.
[time=101] We looked at love last week from John chapter 17.
[time=104] He said, why should they be unified?
[time=106] Why is my prayer that they would be one as we are one?
[time=108] Is so that the world may know that you have sent me, Father, Jesus said to his Father.
[time=113] So it's the love, the unity, the togetherness that becomes the foundation for godly truth to be held to.
[time=120] Because let's be honest, everybody who holds any stand that you would fight over in a political season, we do so in the name of truth.
[time=128] Because we believe we're fighting for the right thing.
[time=130] And I commend you for the motive, but sometimes the method we need a little help with.
[time=133] Can I get an amen?
[time=134] And Jesus helped us with that in John 17.
[time=137] But Philippians two, our challenge is to in humility, proclaim and practice truth in love.
[time=144] It's all in that foundation of love that we get to stand for truth.
[time=146] So let's read the first eight verses of Philippians chapter two.
[time=150] You ready for the word today, black car?
[time=152] And I gotta welcome my online family.
[time=154] All of you who are scattered everywhere, you just saw a beautiful picture, Consuela getting baptized her first actual Sunday on the property, it proves to us that we are one, like Jesus prayed for even when everything sends us apart.
[time=167] And the word of God is what holds us together.
[time=168] So let's read it together.
[time=169] Philippians two, one through eight.
[time=171] So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the spirit, any affection and sympathy, complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love and being in full accord and of one mind.
[time=188] Verse three, do nothing from rivalry or conceit, boy, that's our world, but in humility, count others more significant than yourselves.
[time=197] Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.
[time=202] Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours, which is yours, everybody look at me for a second, which is yours, which is yours in Christ Jesus.
[time=212] Who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men and being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
[time=232] Father, I pray that that humility, that kingdom humility would drive, our focus would drive, our actions, God would drive our hearts, would drive our minds as we just read in your word.
[time=242] May it be a seed that just springs forth a lot of fruit in our life in Jesus' name and all God's people said.
[time=247] Amen, I wanna give you two things today that that passage gives us, two things that kingdom humility, this platform of kingdom humility that Jesus stood for, two things it'll produce.
[time=258] Number one is a clear head, a clear head.
[time=262] How many of you believe, like I do, that a clear head, a clear mind, a clear way of thinking would just help our climate and our culture and our society greatly today?
[time=273] But there's so much irrational thinking going on, and everyone like you and me thinks, "Well, I've got it figured out." They just don't have it figured out.
[time=282] But we need a clear mind, and three times in these five verses you see the word mind and the way that we think and how much it matters.
[time=290] And so understanding Jesus' platform's gonna shift us from pride to humility.
[time=293] And in verse one we get four reminders and we all need these reminders, four reminders of the blessing of living in Christian unity.
[time=300] And verse one, it starts with, if there's any encouragement in Christ, this is this common experiential exhortation.
[time=308] And church, I just gotta tell you, we need to bring it back.
[time=311] As Paul wrote this, it was common to exhort and to encourage and to show grace and to love loudly.
[time=318] But in today's climate, it's become a foreign concept, even in a lot of churches.
[time=322] So may we find encouragement in Christ and it would be this common experiential exhortation among us as a body.
[time=329] If there's any comfort in love as a second reminder, there's nothing much more comforting than the love of God.
[time=334] And I've come today to comfort you with the love of God.
[time=337] You are loved today.
[time=339] Some of you haven't felt loved in a while and you don't see a lot of love in the world around you, but you are loved today.
[time=343] There's any participation in the spirit.
[time=345] The third thing is fellowship with God.
[time=347] It's His presence in our life through the Holy Spirit.
[time=349] And we need that presence now more than ever.
[time=352] And affection and sympathy.
[time=354] And this is really the original language points to really this receiving act of mercy from God.
[time=360] We receive His grace and sympathy and love and compassion.
[time=364] And that's what spills out to each other.
[time=368] And that's what we need today.
[time=370] And so all of this refers to and reminds us of what God has done for us.
[time=374] So today, if you want a clear head, you got to start by remembering the love of God.
[time=379] Seems simple, but it's something that we often forget.
[time=382] And in verse two, Paul wrote about what this is going to produce, that it's going to produce this unity amidst and in spite of and through diverse opinions and people and platforms and all of the kingdoms of the world.
[time=397] And in verse two, there's two times in verse two that the word mind is used, look there with me again.
[time=403] He says, complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love being full of accord and of one mind that must be pretty important.
[time=410] And a lot like Jesus prayed in John 17, if you were with us last Sunday, Paul saying the same thing, that his joy, his prayer requests, his joy would be complete if people would avoid dissension.
[time=423] And so as a church leader, Paul is saying, my joy is complete just like Jesus said, my biggest prayer requests in these last hours of my life, Paul followed the model of Jesus.
[time=433] It said my joy will be complete if everybody would be unified, if they would become one like Jesus prayed for.
[time=439] And as a church leader today, I agree with Jesus and Paul.
[time=443] There's no greater joy than when we as a church are one.
[time=447] And then verse three, he gives us a formula for joy.
[time=450] You need some joy, not if you need some joy.
[time=453] I need some joy.
[time=454] If you need some joy, some of you don't think you need joy, that is too early for joy, whatever it is.
[time=458] But I believe you need joy.
[time=459] There's faces all around the world that remind us of that.
[time=461] And he says in verse three, that the formula for joy is humility.
[time=464] Don't do anything from rivalry or conceit, which characterizes the world around us today.
[time=468] But in humility, count others as more significant than yourselves.
[time=472] The formula for joy is humility.
[time=475] And if you wanna spell out humility in the form of joys, J.O.Y, I've shared this with you before, is Jesus others yourself.
[time=482] You can't spell joy with the Y coming first.
[time=484] And in the same way, you can't have joy if you put yourself first.
[time=489] And Paul tells us that in verse three.
[time=492] And as we look at this today, here's a good illustration and thought for you.
[time=495] Write this down that people take stands today based on what they have seen.
[time=500] You've seen different things from me.
[time=502] You've seen different things than the person seated next to you.
[time=505] You've sat in different places.
[time=509] You've had different experiences.
[time=511] And the stands we take come from the places we've sat, the things we've seen.
[time=517] And I wanna illustrate that for you for a minute.
[time=518] So everybody look at this, I'm gonna get to the camera here.
[time=520] How's that?
[time=521] All right, can you guys see me on the screen?
[time=523] I want you to tell me what, I'll hold it up just a little more there.
[time=526] What does that say?
[time=527] No, it doesn't.
[time=530] Well, what are you looking at?
[time=533] Does it say tomato sauce?
[time=535] It says, let's say tomato, it says puree, water, guarantee, nutrition facts, 15 calories per serving.
[time=545] I see it's a can, can we agree?
[time=547] It's a can.
[time=548] Yes, this means, yes, this means no.
[time=550] It's like, I don't know what to agree on.
[time=553] I feel like I'm getting it all wrong these days, right?
[time=555] Yeah, exactly.
[time=557] It's a can, I mean, but it does not say tomato sauce.
[time=561] I'm sorry, you got it wrong.
[time=563] But what could happen if I do this?
[time=569] It does say tomato sauce.
[time=571] You know what it takes for us to see?
[time=573] We're all, here's the thing, don't miss this.
[time=574] We're all looking at the same stuff in this world.
[time=578] It's all a can, but we're looking at it from different seats.
[time=582] We're looking at it from different perspectives.
[time=585] And if we like verse three would consider others as more important than ourselves and say, you know what, I'm tired of trying to convince you to come around to my side of the can.
[time=593] I'm just gonna get up and walk around and sit down with you on your side of the can and look at it from your perspective, then guess what might happen?
[time=600] We might start living and looking a lot more like Jesus and his platform of kingdom, humility and go, I could see where you see that tomato sauce.
[time=609] But hey, walk around here with me.
[time=611] Look at all these ingredients.
[time=612] Can you see how I saw it differently?
[time=614] We sat in different places so we see it differently and our stands look different.
[time=619] And listen, this week, just yesterday actually, I was walking through some of today's message and my sweet seven year old daughter, Callie, was helping me and I told her how I was gonna use this can 'cause she saw it and she said, why do you have a Bible and a can of tomato sauce, dad?
[time=632] Fair question.
[time=634] And so I attempted to answer it for her and she said, oh, you know what, you should tell the church?
[time=638] You should tell them that they can do it.
[time=641] (congregation laughing) She is now gonna help me with every sermon, henceforth and forever more.
[time=648] I love my little girl.
[time=649] So remember, I'm gonna sit there right there so you can see it.
[time=651] Remember to walk around to the other side of the can and you might just find that you can see things you've been missing all along, even with those knuckleheads you never thought you'd agree with.
[time=661] People's perspectives govern their politics, don't they?
[time=665] It looks like looking at the can and consider their perspectives and experiences as the point of verse three that Paul's writing about.
[time=670] But verse four, I love verse four.
[time=672] Something hit me that I've never really dug into and noticed very much before.
[time=674] Verse four, he says, look, not only.
[time=677] Look, not only am I brother and I discussed this recently and I started looking and it's like, wow, I don't know that I've ever considered this verse in this context.
[time=685] Look, not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.
[time=689] Here's what that means.
[time=690] It means your interests matter.
[time=692] It means God cares about the stands that you take based on the sides of the can that you've looked at it from, your seats, your perspectives, your experiences, the convictions of your heart.
[time=703] Those things matter a lot, but also look at the interests of others that continues from where we are.
[time=709] So we've got to ask this question.
[time=711] This is where I want to spend most of our time today is answering this question, what informs your interests then?
[time=716] What informs your interests?
[time=717] What informs the stands that you take?
[time=719] Write it down this way that as Christians, here's what I believe and some of you may not totally agree with this, but walk with me for a few.
[time=725] As Christians, our political divisions, often in my experience are less about what the Bible says than about how we accomplish what the Bible says.
[time=734] Here's what I mean.
[time=735] That the question of how does government and legislature apply to the biblical things, the biblical truths that we as believers have to hold to, that's where we start to really do this.
[time=746] But oftentimes we actually agree as Christians, I've talked to people on the left and the right and everything in between it seems as a pastor.
[time=754] And what I find that as believers, we actually agree on most biblical issues and we start to divide on what the role of government is and how it is to play a role in the legislature in our nation of how those things play out.
[time=767] And so, let's not, here's my challenge before we walk through some of that, let's not allow those things to divide us and pull us apart from the prayer Jesus prayed and the challenge Paul has just given us.
[time=780] Write this down, as kingdom people, we've got to approach civil government as God prescribes it not as we prefer it.
[time=785] And you say, all right, now we're getting into the issues.
[time=789] Here we go, but listen, God talks a lot about government.
[time=792] And I want to give you a framework through which we can look at some issues as I know you want me to dig into the issues.
[time=797] I'm getting there, but you got to get this framework of humility and love and unity first.
[time=801] And so let's talk about God and government.
[time=803] I don't have time to preach all of Romans 13 to you, but you can write it down a great study tells you a lot about what we are to do with governing authorities.
[time=809] Romans chapter 13 and in verse one, it reminds us to be subject to our governing authorities, be subject to our governing authorities.
[time=817] Because listen, there is no authority except that which is from God in your life.
[time=821] So that means God endorses the left or the right.
[time=823] No, it means God's in charge.
[time=826] And everything under him, he can use, however he so chooses.
[time=831] That's what it means for us as we look at this.
[time=833] So the Bible describes for us really four key relationships, these covenantal relationships that we learn from scripture.
[time=841] Covenant is a covering, it's a coming together.
[time=844] It's what binds us together.
[time=845] And they're also the same kinds of government that we are to adhere to according to Romans 13.
[time=851] Here they are, there's a personal covenant, a family covenant, a church covenant, and even a national covenant.
[time=858] You see all of those things about Israel and about the nations throughout scripture, but it's certainly true of us in a personal sense because God makes a covenant and a relationship with us personally.
[time=868] He does the same thing through our family system and he uses that family system to describe the third thing which is the church system.
[time=875] Now, the same is true, it hit me studying that.
[time=877] That's a commonly known biblical fact, but what hit me this week is that that's the same system and structure for governments that you see in the Bible as well.
[time=886] There's a personal government, you govern yourself.
[time=890] According to something, everybody does.
[time=892] Christians, it's the word of God, it's the truth of scripture.
[time=895] There's personal government, there's family government, you govern your family one way or another.
[time=899] There's church government, we're structured, we have church governance documents and elders and deacons and leadership structures and all of those things because they're biblical and there's even biblical truth about national government.
[time=911] Now, I think we miss a lot of what that is supposed to look like and so if there is a kingdom view of those things, let me answer three things.
[time=919] If there's a kingdom view, let's talk about national identity, government, and then what the problem is today.
[time=925] First of all, can we agree there's a problem?
[time=927] Not if, okay, your laughter tells me yes, but not if you agree, we got problems.
[time=932] Look at your neighbor and say we got problems.
[time=935] Yeah, we do, you're right, they're right.
[time=936] Look at the one you left out and tell them that too, we got problems.
[time=939] But a kingdom view of a national identity goes something like this, I jotted some notes down as I studied these four covenant governmental relationships in scripture is that we can love our country, we should love our country, but our identity and our loyalty to Jesus must always transcend our national allegiance.
[time=958] The church is God's venue to shine light on what that allegiance really looks like.
[time=965] So let that be our national identity viewpoint, government.
[time=969] Government is temporary, it's a temporary system.
[time=972] It's deeply flawed because it's human, because it's a human system.
[time=976] It's a temporary, deeply flawed human system.
[time=980] And it's one, this is the most important part, we all agree on that.
[time=983] It's one that God has used, is using, and will continue to use to do his will on earth, even through all the flaws.
[time=993] And I'll impact that more in a moment.
[time=994] And then let's talk about the problem.
[time=996] And I wanna tell you, it's not the people on the other side.
[time=999] It's sin, the problem is sinfulness.
[time=1003] The problem is that every human system is corrupted by sin and sin causes us to place our hope in earthly leaders, parties in which no final eternal hope exists.
[time=1014] And if we can start with that view together as one in love and in truth, then the platform of Jesus will become what powers your life and my life.
[time=1025] Can I get a name in?
[time=1027] Some of you can't say amen yet, and that's okay.
[time=1029] We're gonna dig through it together.
[time=1031] But let's unpack that further, 'cause now let's dig into some of the issues.
[time=1033] I wanna give you a framework for voting and making decisions and looking at the issues because boy, they matter.
[time=1039] And boy, they start to get really messy, especially when we get to the legislature of them.
[time=1043] But when it comes to these personal, family, church, national relationships, here's a good biblical decision-making process, it goes like this.
[time=1051] It starts with truth and it ends with trusting God with the results, but let's fill in the middle.
[time=1055] There's three C-words.
[time=1056] It starts with the truth of God and it's the truth of God through his Holy Spirit that informs our conscience.
[time=1061] And I believe that the church, God's church, should always be the conscience for the world and even for our nation.
[time=1068] And so it matters.
[time=1068] The truth informs our conscience through the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit brings conviction into our life.
[time=1074] And this is where we start to disagree because everybody's convictions on issues don't always look the same, but here's what's gotta happen.
[time=1081] The truth leads to our conscience being informed, leads to us having conviction in our life from the Holy Spirit, and then here's the hard part.
[time=1089] We change our life to fit the truth and the conviction that came from the conscience that the Holy Spirit has now informed.
[time=1097] But a lot of us are going, I won't change.
[time=1100] I was raised that way.
[time=1102] I won't bend, I won't walk around the can.
[time=1105] But today God wants his truth through his Holy Spirit to be illuminated and such a way it informs our conscience, leads us to convictions that will often look different because we sat on different parts, different sides of the can.
[time=1118] So that we change our life according to his truth and then the last part is trust him with the results.
[time=1124] Charles Stanley, I was always said it this way that we are called to obey God and leave all the consequences to him.
[time=1130] And so we can get there together, we can.
[time=1133] It is possible.
[time=1134] I came to tell you that it's possible today.
[time=1136] And so last week, here's the deal.
[time=1137] I went through a list of issues and I talked about how we politicize everything.
[time=1141] You remember that?
[time=1141] That if you say this, you're on the left.
[time=1143] If you say this, you're on the right.
[time=1144] And isn't that so true?
[time=1145] But I want to kind of bring all that together.
[time=1147] And most of us have at least one of those issues that makes us really kind of a single issue voter.
[time=1152] And some of them matter that much.
[time=1153] I agree, I agree that all the issues matter and I want to prove it to you.
[time=1156] But I want to help you to stop dividing the issues and to look at them through that process of truth that leads to conscience, that leads to conviction, that leads us to change and then to trust God with the results.
[time=1167] I want to help you with that.
[time=1168] And here's an overview of some of them, not all of them, but here we go.
[time=1172] And here's the thing, these issues, they're not issues of the left or right and scripture, they're issues of right and wrong.
[time=1178] And so let me give you an overview.
[time=1179] God is, he's for women and he's for the unborn because he's for people.
[time=1184] God is against abortion because he's for life as he created it.
[time=1188] God is for my black and brown brothers and sisters because we're all created in God's image and we are called to bear one another's burdens.
[time=1195] And that does not mean that God or we endorse institutions that are earthly and temporary like, black lives matter that go against God's truth, but that we are for black lives, every life, people because God has created black, red, yellow, black, and white, they're precious in his sight because he made them in his image and we're to love and we're to bear one another's burdens and equally so God and we are for our policemen and for all of our first responders and our veterans and we believe we are called to care for refugees and for immigrants and for the poor and for holding to the biblical definition of marriage of a man and a woman.
[time=1233] Oh, just to name a few.
[time=1234] And here's the thing, can I implore us for a moment?
[time=1242] Stop trying to make those issues about a side,
[time=1248] make them about the spiritual truth of God and then you will equally care for all of the issues that God has spoken to and listen to my friends, God has spoken to all of those issues and he didn't stutter and it's through that that we can find unity as we build our life and our choices and our votes on the truth of God as the Spirit of God illuminates it in our life, informs our conscience, convicts our hearts, leads us to change what we do and then we do what God says with obedience and trust God with the rest.
[time=1282] It really can be that simple.
[time=1284] I know it doesn't feel that simple but I pray that we could live it out in that kind of way.
[time=1290] No doubt, here's the thing, I acknowledge, no doubt we're gonna have in this room and online wherever you are, we're all gonna have disagreements about the legislature of those things.
[time=1300] What's the role of government in those things?
[time=1302] There's a lot of gray areas and all that, I get it.
[time=1304] But what's not gray is that God's spoken to these issues and I wanna give you a guide even further now, hopefully you've been helped already.
[time=1311] I may have not informed every issue the way you wanted me to but I've given you some biblical truth about them.
[time=1315] Now I wanna help you with what do we do about voting?
[time=1318] I wanna talk about that for a minute.
[time=1319] But here's the thing, before I do that, as we disagree on legislature and governmental roles on all of those kinds of things that God has spoken clearly to, write this down, clear headed humility, that's what I'm teaching you about.
[time=1330] So one of the things that Jesus will produce in your life, this kingdom platform will produce in your life, clear headed humility won't let you, I wanna say it again, it won't let you demonize or dehumanize those who don't agree with you.
[time=1345] We must love our enemies and if we love our enemies, certainly we love brothers and sisters in Christ who don't see eye to eye with us because they've seen the can from a different side to let us do that together.
[time=1357] Now let me give you a voter's guide.
[time=1358] This sounds dangerous, doesn't it?
[time=1359] Everybody go, whoo.
[time=1362] You can let it out.
[time=1363] And you're not even willing to do it, right?
[time=1364] 'Cause I said I did it for you.
[time=1365] I wanna give you a voter's guide.
[time=1367] And here's what I wanna tell you.
[time=1367] I do believe the church should be the nation's conscience.
[time=1370] I do believe that we have the truth and so we should stand on it.
[time=1373] So let's do it together and voting, it matters.
[time=1375] And so today I challenge you to consider three things, the platform, the person and the policies.
[time=1381] That's pretty much all of the politics stuff, right?
[time=1384] Consider all three of those things.
[time=1385] They all three matter.
[time=1386] The candidate, the character of the candidate, the platforms, the policies that go with all of those things.
[time=1392] Consider those things, but consider them in light of God's truth and how he informs your conscience, leads you to convictions in your heart and leads you to change what you do or do not do and how you move forward and then trust God with a resource.
[time=1405] That's what I wanna challenge you to do.
[time=1406] But here's your voter's guide and it's probably not what you expected.
[time=1409] It's two words, I can simplify it for you.
[time=1412] Wouldn't that be great if somebody could just give you a voter's guide that only has two words?
[time=1416] I believe I can and build it off scripture.
[time=1418] Write these two words down, vote and vote and.
[time=1421] Somebody needs to ask me, what's the end?
[time=1425] Somebody ask me.
[time=1426] Oh, you do wanna know or you're not ready to go?
[time=1429] Yeah, okay, good, just checking.
[time=1430] Let's talk about the end.
[time=1431] What am I talking about?
[time=1432] Vote and vote and what?
[time=1434] I'm glad you asked.
[time=1435] I believe we are called to vote biblically informed consciences based on the truth that the Holy Spirit illuminates and live out the biblical values that informed our vote.
[time=1445] I wanna talk to you about that for a moment 'cause listen, my friends, if you think your responsibility in all of this begins and ends at a ballot box, you're sadly mistaken when it comes to Christianity, our biggest call, vote.
[time=1457] I encourage you, vote, it matters, definitely.
[time=1460] But it really could be and vote.
[time=1462] I could really flip those around.
[time=1463] It should be what we're doing, how we live out the truth of God and yes, go vote.
[time=1468] But our platform has gotta be this kingdom humility.
[time=1472] And so what is the end?
[time=1472] I wanna give you at least two things.
[time=1473] We could do a list of 20 things, but I wanna give you two.
[time=1476] Number one, get proximate to your passions.
[time=1478] Micah chapter six and verse eight tells us, do justice, love, mercy, walk humbly with our God.
[time=1484] So what do I mean by that?
[time=1486] Get proximate, get close to, get in the face of, get involved with what you're passionate about.
[time=1491] When I look around today, I say a lot of people screaming about issues, but I would encourage you way better than screaming about issues would be doing something to change the issues about which you're passionate.
[time=1502] As an example, if you're passionate about abortion, then vote and go care for widows and orphans.
[time=1507] Get involved in foster care and adoption ministries.
[time=1510] Consider adopting, consider being a part of the safe family's ministry that we support here at Black Hawk.
[time=1515] Do things that would change the trajectory of what's causing it.
[time=1518] Be a part of the solution.
[time=1519] That's what God's call for his church is, is that we are the light that enters the darkness.
[time=1524] John one five, Jesus is that light.
[time=1526] But then he said, I'm gonna build my church and even the gates of hell can't prevail against it.
[time=1530] So vote and be that light.
[time=1532] If you're passionate about social issues, first of all, I tell you, justice is in the Bible some 450 times.
[time=1538] I think it matters.
[time=1539] You should be.
[time=1540] If God has led you into being passionate about social issues, then talk about it.
[time=1545] Vote for sure.
[time=1546] And go infuse Jesus into the conversation.
[time=1550] Sit on the other side of the can.
[time=1552] Learn from people that don't look like act like, think like or vote like you and work together for the common good of humanity.
[time=1559] Because as we do, we'll point to the only hope for humanity.
[time=1563] And that is Jesus Christ.
[time=1565] We must pray for God to heal our land and then and and.
[time=1569] Everybody say and.
[time=1571] And then partner with God in that process of healing.
[time=1574] Pray, absolutely.
[time=1576] But partner with God to get somewhere on it.
[time=1578] The second thing I wanna tell you comes from Galatians 6-2 and it's simply from scripture bear, one another's burdens.
[time=1584] Sit on the other side of the can with brothers and sisters and even unbelievers who don't think like or even vote like you do.
[time=1591] Because when we carry one another's burdens, what divides us gets minimized and what unites us gets maximized.
[time=1598] I'll probably we can do that as a church.
[time=1599] And then verse five, that was all verse four by the way.
[time=1602] Everybody say, whoo.
[time=1603] Verse five tells us, have this mind, this mind, have this mind, it's the mind of Christ.
[time=1609] Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus.
[time=1613] And then you can have a clear head even in this cloudy season.
[time=1617] So you get a clear head and we need a clear head.
[time=1620] And second thing that you'll get comes from verses six through eight and it's a Christ like heart.
[time=1624] And it's the Christ like heart really that gives you the platform you need to have the humility it takes to have a clear head.
[time=1631] So let's talk about a Christ like heart.
[time=1632] I'm convinced that we can't have a clear head in this politically clouded season, primarily due to our clouded heart.
[time=1640] Our heart gets hard.
[time=1642] Our heart gets so clouded by hate and rage and slander and bitterness towards each other.
[time=1651] And listen, I got a message for you from God.
[time=1654] I'm not the prophet, I'm not writing scriptures, but listen, this is a message for God's church and it's in God's word.
[time=1660] It is time for a heart check.
[time=1668] My friend, my brother, my sister, it is time for a heart check.
[time=1673] So how do we do that, pastor?
[time=1675] I'm glad you asked.
[time=1676] I think verses six through eight gives us a beautiful picture of the heart of Jesus.
[time=1679] If you wanna have a Christ like heart, then you gotta check your heart against the heart of Jesus.
[time=1683] And so let's look at the heart of Jesus.
[time=1684] And I don't know of anywhere in scripture that captures the heart of Jesus more than verses six through eight that reminds us of these things about Jesus, who Jesus, who verse six, who though he was in the form of God did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the form of a servant being born in the likeness of men and being found in human form.
[time=1703] He humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
[time=1710] That's the heart of Jesus.
[time=1711] So let's look at those things.
[time=1713] First of all, verse six, we see that Jesus didn't count equality with God, a thing to be grasped.
[time=1717] That's a hot button word.
[time=1720] And Jesus says it this way.
[time=1722] God's word promises and tells us that with God, there's no partiality.
[time=1725] So it's a good word.
[time=1727] We're all made in God's image and we should care about those things, but that's what Jesus laid down.
[time=1732] Jesus said, I don't count equality with God.
[time=1734] He is God.
[time=1735] He's the way, the truth and the life.
[time=1736] He is truth and grace.
[time=1738] He's the full embodiment of truth and love.
[time=1740] And he laid down his positional equality with God as a kingdom, humility platform for his ministry.
[time=1750] And his ministry is why we have hope today.
[time=1752] Jesus, here's what it means for us in a political season.
[time=1755] I'll say it in the political terms.
[time=1757] Jesus laid down his rights for the good of people.
[time=1760] He made his right secondary to the mission of God.
[time=1764] Verse seven, he made himself nothing.
[time=1766] And it says it took the form of a servant, that Greek word is duos and that word is really not even as much servant as it is slave.
[time=1773] It's the lowest of forms.
[time=1774] That's why it says he made himself nothing.
[time=1776] He took on the form of a slave.
[time=1778] And verse eight, he humbled himself to obedience, in obedience to God, even to the point of death, even death on a cross, which I'll end by talking about in a minute.
[time=1787] But here's what you should know.
[time=1788] Humility always starts with the heart.
[time=1790] Write that down.
[time=1791] Humility always starts in the heart.
[time=1794] The only way we can have a clear head is to start with a Christ like heart.
[time=1799] And here's what will happen.
[time=1800] When you do those things, when you go back through the list of stuff and you sit on the other side of the can, you bear one another's burdens, you get proximate to the passions that God has placed you in.
[time=1808] And you let his truth guide your conscience and your convictions and your changes that you make in life and trust God with results.
[time=1815] That's how you have a Christ like heart.
[time=1816] When you do what Jesus did in those ways and put them to action in your life, when you do that, here's what you'll become.
[time=1822] You'll become a thermostat, not a thermometer.
[time=1825] I've used this illustration before in a lot of ways, but listen, we've got a ton of thermometers running around the world right now.
[time=1831] People checking everybody's temperature for COVID, but also for political anger.
[time=1835] And we're judging like, well, you're too hot or too cold on this and we throw storms that we judge.
[time=1841] But listen, as Christians, we're called not to be a thermometer, we're called to be a thermostat.
[time=1845] And today, my friends, if we would love each other in unity and make decisions based off of truth through the messages that I'm walking you through today from God's Word, with a clear head that comes from a Christ like heart, then we as Christians would turn down the temperature.
[time=1860] And the world could use us to turn down this temperature so that we can hear.
[time=1864] It's like turning down the volume and then we can work together.
[time=1867] And so my friends, let's do that together.
[time=1870] Let's walk through that together because here's what will happen.
[time=1873] Your fog will subside and you'll see clearly.
[time=1875] And let's tie all this together because we can't do all this without a foundation to build off of.
[time=1882] And I preached it last week.
[time=1882] I'm gonna preach it again for a few moments.
[time=1884] Humility reigns and Jesus is humility.
[time=1888] He's the humble servant, but he reigns.
[time=1890] He's on the throne.
[time=1891] The last several verses of this passage, Philippians 2, nine through 11.
[time=1896] Therefore, God has highly exalted him.
[time=1898] Love this part of scripture.
[time=1900] And bestowed on him the name that is above every name so that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow and heaven and on earth and under the earth.
[time=1907] And every tongue confessed that Jesus is Lord to the glory of God, the Father.
[time=1913] Clear heads come from Christ like hearts that are built on humility.
[time=1918] And humility like this is always exalted.
[time=1921] That's why Jesus is on the throne.
[time=1923] He was on the throne yesterday.
[time=1925] He is today and he will be tomorrow, henceforth, and forever more.
[time=1929] Jesus didn't come to be some footnote in our earthly temporary systems.
[time=1934] Jesus came to rule and reign and establish his kingdom and it's established and he will reign forever.
[time=1941] I wanna give you four Old Testament pictures in case Paul didn't convince you well enough in Philippians 2 in the Old Testament Psalm 22, 28.
[time=1949] Kingship belongs to the Lord and he rules over the nations.
[time=1952] Psalm 103, 19.
[time=1954] The Lord has established his throne in the heavens and his kingdom rules over all.
[time=1959] Daniel 2, 21.
[time=1961] He removes kings and sets up kings.
[time=1964] And my personal favorite, Proverbs 21 and verse one.
[time=1967] The king's heart is a stream of water in the hand of the Lord.
[time=1972] He turns it wherever he will.
[time=1975] Another great example of this Galatians 4, 4, and 5 tells us that at the proper time God sent forth his son.
[time=1983] It's a great Christmas passage, but it's a great for this political season as well.
[time=1987] At the right time God sent forth his son, but how he sent forth his son is pretty interesting because Caesar who's ruling under the dominating, domineering authority of this world power of the Roman Empire thought he ruled the known world.
[time=2000] He thought so and you know what?
[time=2001] Everybody around him really did too.
[time=2003] That's why people politicized Jesus 'cause they wanted him to be overthrown, right?
[time=2007] Later in his life in this same empire in that political tension continued and people tried to politicize Jesus, but the same Caesar made a decree that a census should be taken.
[time=2017] And it sent everybody to their hometowns.
[time=2020] You've heard the story perhaps.
[time=2021] And that is what led, listen, that is what led Joseph and Mary as she bore Jesus to Bethlehem to fulfill the prophecies by which the son of God would come into the world.
[time=2034] So don't miss what just happened.
[time=2036] At the right time God who sat on a much bigger throne, used the decrees of this world-dominating leader to accomplish his purposes and he's still doing it today.
[time=2049] He's calm, he's in control, he's confident.
[time=2058] So I believe we can be too, no matter what happens in this life.
[time=2062] And listen, the fastest way for us to go under as a nation, as a people, as a church, the fastest way to go under is to stop operating under God.
[time=2069] In 2 Chronicles 7, 14, we're called to seek God's face, humble ourselves.
[time=2074] We're called to pray and God says, an repent turned from our sin and he will heal our land.
[time=2079] And it comes from praying and then partnering as we've looked at today.
[time=2082] And even if our nation doesn't, my friends, look at me for a minute 'cause we're afraid of that.
[time=2086] What if our nation doesn't operate under God like we think it should?
[time=2090] Even if it doesn't, we can and we're called to and we have to.
[time=2095] I wanna give you three applications of this to close our series and our focus for a little while.
[time=2100] Number one is dig deeper, dig deeper.
[time=2104] We've done series of digging deeper on several series in the past and we wanna give you some ways to do that.
[time=2109] Here we offer you life group questions, good discussion questions for your family and everywhere else in your life to be utilized.
[time=2115] And so we wanna keep doing that.
[time=2116] So no doubt, here's the thing, a series like this has left a lot of you, probably most of you wanting a little more.
[time=2123] Maybe you feel satisfied, but probably you're saying, well, he didn't talk about that issue.
[time=2127] I want a little bit more.
[time=2128] Here's the deal, we think that's a good thing.
[time=2131] In fact, it's one of our goals in this series to help people desire to keep pursuing God's heart and hopefully to pursue God's heart with a platform of kingdom humility that's different from the heart you pursued it with when this whole series started.
[time=2143] We wanna help you dig deeper by giving you all kinds of good resources.
[time=2146] And so look for those on our website, but listen, a ton of good resources is also going into this series.
[time=2151] I told you from the get go, I wasn't really a big fan of getting up at church and talking about politics, but God said that's what our nation and our world and our church needs.
[time=2159] And so a lot of good resources have gone to supplement the word of God as we formed this series.
[time=2163] And as an example, last Sunday, last week, I preached on John 17 and I was heavily influenced by a ton of great insights that were given in a sermon series done by Andy Stanley in my hometown area, Atlanta, Georgia, and North Point Community Church.
[time=2178] And so listen, this last week, our elders and I became aware that there were several who had expressed some deep offense to my lack of properly citing Andy Stanley's work.
[time=2189] And so after discussing with the elders, I wanna offer you two things, church.
[time=2192] Number one, I should have properly cited that resource last Sunday in addition to these digging deeper resources that I'll tell you how you can access now that we plan to provide for you.
[time=2202] And I wanna humbly apologize to you and to North Point Community Church for not properly citing that last week because every one of our messages here has to stand alone.
[time=2210] So ask for your forgiveness for that.
[time=2212] And secondly, I wanna supply you with not just that, but a ton of other resources that have gone to supplement the Word of God in this series.
[time=2219] And there've been a lot of them we've dug into many together.
[time=2222] Why?
[time=2222] So you can dig deeper into the Word of God and into this important subject.
[time=2226] So here's how you can access those resources in your sermon notes.
[time=2230] And that's on your app, that is on the website.
[time=2232] We use a great platform for sermon notes.
[time=2235] You can access all of those resources by clicking the link at the very bottom of both of these message notes that says sermon resources.
[time=2242] So look there, find those.
[time=2244] And listen church, we desire so much to operate around here with trust and transparency.
[time=2248] And so you got questions about this or sermon preparation processes, our teaching team, what we use anytime, contact me directly, contact our board chairman, elder chairman, which is Doug Crane, our information's found on our website under church leadership.
[time=2263] So feel free to do that.
[time=2265] So dig deeper, let us help you dig deeper.
[time=2267] One of the best ways you can dig deeper is find a life group.
[time=2270] They're discussing all of this, many of them even now.
[time=2272] Number two, pray, praise, and fast.
[time=2276] Pray, praise, and fast.
[time=2277] We started the year with 15 weeks of prayer and fasting.
[time=2281] We wanna end the year, when we're in the middle of it now, 15 weeks of prayer and fasting.
[time=2285] But we added a word to this 15 weeks and it's praise.
[time=2288] Now we're all filled with bad news.
[time=2289] Please look for some good news, it's there.
[time=2292] God's doing a good thing in your life.
[time=2293] And number three, pursue a humble Christ-like heart that leads to a clear head.
[time=2301] Our hope for this series.
[time=2303] I don't wanna illustrate it.
[time=2304] Look on the screen here.
[time=2305] Our hope for this series, as we've gone through this, is that the anger, the elephants and donkeys, the pride and the politics that gets so informed by all of our hatred would be overtaken by an eternal kingdom that is headed by the king of kings and the Lord of lords, the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world.
[time=2323] And you'll see postures change.
[time=2324] And you'll see unification happen, and red and blue becomes purple.
[time=2327] And then pride and politics may just turn into humility and harmony.
[time=2334] That's our prayer for you.
[time=2335] That's my prayer for us.
[time=2337] And I believe it's totally possible if we trust in the king of kings and the Lord of lords.
[time=2342] I wanna ask you just to bow your heads, close your eyes.
[time=2346] Consider what God wants to teach.
[time=2348] You consider what God wants to do in your heart and life.
[time=2350] Listen, the point of the cross and the death on a cross is that Jesus was abandoned.
[time=2355] Think about this with your eyes closed and at home wherever you're at, ponder this thought for a moment.
[time=2359] Death on a cross.
[time=2360] Jesus had been abandoned by all of his friends.
[time=2364] The father turned his back and he hung there.
[time=2368] Listen, the loneliest man in the history of the universe.
[time=2373] He bore that for you and for me.
[time=2377] And while he hung there, he thought of this moment.
[time=2381] He thought of you.
[time=2382] He thought of the changes that you need to make in your life.
[time=2384] He thought of your salvation need that you have.
[time=2388] He became the loneliest man in the history of the universe.
[time=2390] Why?
[time=2392] Get this, so you could become friends of God.
[time=2395] He bore your shame, he paid your price.
[time=2402] He lived a life that was devoid of sin that you could never live to pay a price.
[time=2409] You could never pay.
[time=2411] And I pray today you're trusting in that.
[time=2413] You've never trusted in that and give you a moment to do just that.
[time=2417] If you have trusted in that, what's God teaching you today?
[time=2420] About this process of having a Christ-like heart and a clear head built on the humility, a kingdom-humility platform of Jesus.
[time=2429] So I'm gonna give you a chance for a moment believers to pray over those things, but if you're not a believer, will you trust in Jesus?
[time=2435] I don't need to lead you in a prayer.
[time=2436] You don't have to pray with words.
[time=2437] The words don't save you as your heart being turned over to Jesus, trusting that he died to pay that price for you, that he rose from the dead, that he is alive, he is on his throne, trusting in him to save you and not in you to save you.
[time=2450] If that's you today in your own words, ask him to save you.
[time=2452] Anyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
[time=2455] We do it right now.
