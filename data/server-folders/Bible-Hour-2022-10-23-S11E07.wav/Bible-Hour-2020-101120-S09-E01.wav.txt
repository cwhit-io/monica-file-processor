[time=0] We've just finished two weeks on pride and politics.
[time=3] And I want to commend you because none of you threw anything at me.
[time=6] Those of you at home, if you broke your television, because you did throw something at me, I apologize for that.
[time=11] But we made it through that together.
[time=12] And I've talked to you about being unified and the importance of unity.
[time=16] But get this, now we're going to spend nine weeks, all of these next couple of months looking at what we can be unified about.
[time=22] And so today I want to talk to you about a journey worth taking and it's the journey of discipleship, making disciples.
[time=28] And then next week will be the authority of scripture and we'll go through our statement of faith and give you a look at things we can hold on to tightly in a world that's trying to rip us apart and tear us down.
[time=40] I think that's a journey worth taking.
[time=41] Can I get a name in?
[time=43] Let's go on that journey together because my friends, God didn't just save you from something.
[time=47] God saved you for something.
[time=49] And that for something is making disciples and being a disciple of Jesus.
[time=54] And if you have no idea what those churchy terms mean, this is a great Sunday for you to be here 'cause I want us to unpack it straight from the words and ministry of Jesus.
[time=62] I'm gonna give you three things about this discipleship journey that is a journey worth taking.
[time=66] First one comes from Matthew chapter four verses 18 through 22.
[time=70] Look there with me and it is the definition of discipleship because get this, now the definitions that we hold will determine the disciples that we make.
[time=80] And so if we don't have a common definition, then we'll be making things that don't align with what God wants us to make.
[time=85] And I would argue that the church has done that for centuries in a lot of different ways where we turn people into things that weren't quite what Jesus had in mind.
[time=95] You ever noticed that in church that is filled with a bunch of knuckleheads like you and me?
[time=98] And there's messiness and there's people and there's meanness and there's problems?
[time=102] Well, a lot of times and every time the root of that is we miss the mark of what Jesus is calling us to make.
[time=108] If I surveyed everybody in the room and at home all around the world right now, we would have a lot of really good, really biblical definitions to answer the question of what is a disciple?
[time=117] It'd probably be great.
[time=118] But if we can't have a unified answer, then maybe we're making different things.
[time=121] And so here at Black Hawk for years, we've decided to adopt, there's a lot of different good ways of doing.
[time=126] This is not the only way, but for Matthew 4 19, the words of Jesus, we see a definition of who he's calling as he's calling disciples.
[time=133] So for years, we've held to this definition of a disciple.
[time=136] So I wanna share it with you.
[time=137] But let's first read Matthew 4 18 through 20.
[time=141] Let's read through verse 22.
[time=145] Matthew 4 18 through 22.
[time=148] While walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea for they were fishermen.
[time=156] Verse 19, and he said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men." Immediately they left their nets and followed him and going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James, the son of Zebedee and John, his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father.
[time=172] Mending their nets, and he called them.
[time=174] Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.
[time=179] May God just take the reading of his word and multiply it as seeds of discipleship in your life this week.
[time=185] But you notice two times immediately, they just left their stuff and followed Jesus.
[time=189] That is what disciples do.
[time=191] And so I wanna give you this definition from Matthew 4 19.
[time=194] A disciple is one who is three things.
[time=197] Number one, following Jesus.
[time=199] Notice Jesus said, "Follow me." And I gotta tell you, say, "Well, yeah, and I get that check done with that, hold on." You gotta understand that following someone, if you are following, that means you're not in charge.
[time=213] That means he's the boss.
[time=215] And so with that in mind, know that a disciple is one who is following Jesus.
[time=218] Jesus said, "Follow me." The second thing he said was, "And I will make you," which is the second part of this definition.
[time=224] The disciple's one who's following Jesus.
[time=226] And one, number two, who is being changed by Jesus.
[time=230] Notice that it is present tense, ongoing.
[time=233] I-N-G, being changed.
[time=235] It doesn't say have been changed because it doesn't all happen at once.
[time=239] Can I get a name in?
[time=240] He's still working on me, right?
[time=243] He's still working on you to make us who we ought to be.
[time=245] It's a process of sanctification, becoming more and more like Jesus on a day-to-day basis.
[time=250] So disciple is one who is following Jesus, being changed by Jesus because he meets us where we are, but he never leaves us there.
[time=257] He changes us.
[time=258] And thirdly, a disciple is one who is committed to the mission of Jesus.
[time=263] Jesus said, "Follow me.
[time=265] "I will make you." He didn't say, "You will make you.
[time=267] "I will make you," being changed by Jesus.
[time=268] And then he said, "I'm gonna make you what?" Fishers of men.
[time=272] That's the mission of Jesus.
[time=273] He's called you to, you ready?
[time=274] Start reeling them in.
[time=277] He's called you to go fishing.
[time=279] He's called you to be a part of his mission to seek and to save that which is lost, to go therefore into all nations, making disciples.
[time=287] So let's, with that common definition, move to the second thing that comes from Matthew chapter 28.
[time=292] I'm gonna flip over with me several chapters to Matthew 28.
[time=295] Preached this text, he is the great commission.
[time=297] Matthew 28, 16 through 20.
[time=299] The second thing is the commission of discipleship.
[time=302] We have a definition.
[time=303] Let's talk about the commission.
[time=305] It's what Jesus sent us out to do.
[time=307] This is after Jesus has risen from the dead, defeating death hell in the grave on our behalf.
[time=312] He's appeared to the disciples on at least three different occasions at this point.
[time=315] And he's about to ascend.
[time=317] And before he ascends, he gives us the great commission.
[time=320] He gives us our marching orders for what we are called to do.
[time=323] And I preached this to you in our annual, "This is Us" series back in May this last year.
[time=328] And I gave you five different things that just really stood out and they became prayers for us for this year, even during COVID.
[time=335] Because the mission of God doesn't stop in the middle of COVID.
[time=337] No pandemic can slow down the mission of my God.
[time=340] I talked about how we want to pray that God's people would be unified.
[time=343] His power would be multiplied.
[time=345] His purpose would be clarified.
[time=347] His plan would be magnified and his presence would be glorified in us.
[time=352] And in this passage you see God's people, his power, his purpose, his plan, and his presence.
[time=357] And it's all still just as real for you and for me today as it was back then.
[time=362] Let's read this commission together.
[time=363] Matthew 28 starting in verse 16.
[time=366] Now the 11 disciples, this is minus Judas at this point, went to Galilee, the mountain to which Jesus had directed them.
[time=373] And when they saw him, they worshiped him.
[time=376] But some doubted, verse 18.
[time=379] And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[time=384] "Go therefore and make disciples." Say those two words with me.
[time=388] "And make disciples of all nations, "baptizing them in the name of the Father "and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, "teaching them to observe all I've commanded you.
[time=399] "And behold, I am with you always "to the end of the age." And all God's people said.
[time=405] I'm glad that's still true today and we need to get back to those basics.
[time=408] So to break that apart a little bit for us today, starting in verse 16, notice the response that they went to the mountain Jesus had sent them to.
[time=415] That's because, and remember, this is important, Jesus had already appeared to them.
[time=419] And I'll talk more about that in a second here, but so he sent them to a mountain.
[time=423] They go to this mountain and they did, you saw two things.
[time=426] Some worshiped, pretty good response.
[time=428] But then some doubted, that's always puzzled me.
[time=433] What were they doubting?
[time=434] Because you got to remember, this is the fourth time, at least, that we know Jesus has appeared to them in his bodily resurrected form as the risen savior.
[time=444] He's, okay, get this.
[time=446] They've locked themselves behind a door.
[time=448] They were behind a locked door hiding in fear.
[time=450] That's a whole other sermon.
[time=451] That's what fear will do to you.
[time=453] It'll lock you in a prison.
[time=454] And some of you are locked in a prison by your fear today.
[time=456] And what Jesus did is what he wants to do in your life today.
[time=458] Jesus didn't kick the door down.
[time=460] He just walked right in.
[time=461] He just showed right up behind your locked doors of prisons.
[time=464] But boy, I don't have time to preach that one today.
[time=466] Save that one for another one.
[time=467] But Jesus has already shown up there.
[time=469] He showed up again behind their locked door.
[time=471] This time with Thomas there.
[time=472] And Thomas said, "Unless I see the scars and touch them, "I'm not gonna believe." So Jesus went and he touched his scars.
[time=482] And so they knew they had encountered the risen savior.
[time=486] And yet here they are at the time of the Great Commission doubting.
[time=490] I wonder what they're doubting.
[time=492] The Bible doesn't really make that really clear.
[time=495] And there's probably a lot of really good and true answers.
[time=497] And it probably varied at different levels with the different disciples.
[time=500] However, I think their baggage may have gotten away.
[time=502] I think that they remembered the words of Jesus where he said, "Hey, it's better for you." They knew he was gonna conquer death, rise from the dead.
[time=508] He told them that and he did it.
[time=509] And he proved that it was him.
[time=511] They saw the scars.
[time=512] But then he said, "Hey, it's better for you that I go away "because when I do, my Holy Spirit is gonna come "and it's gonna empower you.
[time=518] "And you're gonna go make disciples." And I think their baggage started getting in the way and they doubted less who Jesus was and doubted more who they were.
[time=526] They doubted more is my baggage gonna let me do that.
[time=529] I'm just a fisherman.
[time=531] Can I really do all of the stuff that Jesus is wanting me to do if he's really about to leave me here by myself?
[time=538] And I believe some of you are stuck in that same mindset in your faith today.
[time=544] Some of you are in a doubting spot.
[time=545] You know what Jesus did write this down?
[time=547] Jesus shifted them from a mindset of doubt to the mission of discipleship.
[time=554] And that's exactly what he wants to do in your life today.
[time=557] It was a pit stop.
[time=558] You'll hear more about pit stops on the 101 and 201 journey.
[time=562] We gotta take some pit stops.
[time=563] Have you ever been on a road trip with kids before?
[time=565] I got three and road trips can be pretty interesting and they always require an unexpected pit stop.
[time=571] Somebody's gotta go potty.
[time=573] Somebody's gotta get some snack or we gotta stop and re-navigate or recalibrate something or refuel.
[time=579] And that's what Jesus is doing with the disciples here.
[time=582] He shifted that mindset of doubt that they had to this mission of discipleship that they needed.
[time=587] Jesus was reminding them of his victory and his plan of action.
[time=591] Remember, he says, all authority, how much authority?
[time=595] All, and that's a good reminder for us today for those of you who came here with doubts.
[time=598] All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.
[time=601] That means Jesus has already demonstrated that it's his authority over creation, over people, over nature, over sin, over the forgiveness of sin, over the church, over demons, over the enemy, over teaching, over the Sabbath, over hell, over death, over authority itself.
[time=618] There is no authority except for that which comes from and through the Son of the living God, Jesus Christ.
[time=625] Jesus is in charge.
[time=628] And he reminds them of that and then he authorizes them and four uses of the word all is seen in this passage that we just read, first of all, all authority.
[time=636] And then he says, so go make disciples of all nations.
[time=641] Baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I've commanded you.
[time=648] My favorite all is the always because he says, and always I'm going to be with you, even to the end of the age.
[time=658] So here's what I believe about discipleship.
[time=661] I believe that when it comes to making disciples, I think the church in general, the big sea church, the global church has been in a bit of a discipleship coma for a little while.
[time=669] I think it's time for us to return to our roots.
[time=671] And I believe that this pandemic, I believe that this season is something that God wants to use.
[time=676] He takes that which is intended for evil and uses it for good.
[time=679] He wants to do that in and through this pandemic in your life and mind to re-center us on our roots and get us back to making disciples, which is what he sent us out to do to begin with.
[time=689] There's several contributing factors.
[time=690] I've studied so many different angles of discipleship and I think there's a ton of contributing factors to why we kind of start getting distracted from the mission of discipleship.
[time=699] But one of them is you'll find even that we get some definitions wrong.
[time=703] There are earlier translations of the Bible.
[time=706] Next week, I'm going to talk to you about the authority of scripture.
[time=709] You don't want to miss that.
[time=710] And sometimes people ask me, "Well, pastor, which version of the Bible should I read?" And if you've asked me that, you know what I'm about to say.
[time=716] I always answer the same, the one you'll read.
[time=719] It's a good starting place.
[time=721] But there are good, different, better translations.
[time=725] And I'm so thankful that we have the real living, true word of God and that we have the original manuscripts and the original languages, which they were written so that we can hold to the truth of the inerit, unchanging word of God.
[time=741] And I'm thankful for that today.
[time=742] But as we translate that word, early translations, some of your translations may read this way as well.
[time=748] I encourage you to look some of them up.
[time=750] Your translation probably says, "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations." Not if that's what your says.
[time=756] Some versions, earlier versions will read, "Go therefore and teach all nations." And while teaching is good, that's not where the story stops.
[time=768] That's just a good beginning point.
[time=771] And I think what has happened in a lot of churches is that we've gone into all nations and taught.
[time=778] And teaching is good, I'm doing it right now.
[time=779] So don't leave saying, "Well, the pastor said, "teaching's bad." I prepare every week to teach.
[time=784] It's a great starting place, but it's not the finish line.
[time=786] Making disciples is a lot bigger than just teaching.
[time=789] So we go into all nations and teach sometimes and we miss the making of disciples that God has intended for us because get this, discipleship is not a curriculum or a class, discipleship is all of that and then some.
[time=801] It is a both and and then some.
[time=803] I always say it this way, write it down.
[time=805] Discipleship is not a course.
[time=807] It is instead the course of your life.
[time=809] The literal translation and the original language of go therefore is actually as you are going.
[time=816] Now here's what a lot of us think that means.
[time=818] We get our bags and as we're going, we just stumble upon a disciple, boom, there they are.
[time=826] And we accidentally made a disciple.
[time=828] And so as you're going, there's a discipleship opportunity.
[time=832] And yes, there's sometimes it's accidental.
[time=834] So what Jesus called us to is to grab our bags and as we are going, as we are discipling our family and parents, if you're not looking at your kids as your biggest and most important discipleship opportunity, you're missing the point of discipleship.
[time=847] So in your home, in your workplaces and in your world, not just accidentally stumbling upon discipleship but intentionally as I am going in a consuming way in my life, not a course that I graduate from, but as I go on the course of my life, I intentionally look for ways to look like Jesus and make disciples as I am going.
[time=870] That's what Jesus has called us to.
[time=872] And so many times we miss the picture here.
[time=875] And our definitions have to be true even for Christian versus disciple.
[time=878] Christian is a good word, but did you know that Christian is only used in the New Testament?
[time=883] I think it's about three times.
[time=884] And some of that's even in a little bit of a not so positive connotation.
[time=887] It's a good descriptive word.
[time=889] I'm glad to be a Christian because I follow Christ.
[time=891] Can I get a name yet?
[time=892] All right, so, but there's another word, disciple.
[time=896] Christian is in the New Testament some three times.
[time=898] It's a great descriptive word, but disciple is in the Bible some 269 times.
[time=904] 238 of those times are in the gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John alone.
[time=910] And that word I wanna break it apart for you in a minute is less of a descriptive word like Christian is.
[time=916] And it is a dynamic word that gets us moving.
[time=920] It makes us do something.
[time=921] It encompasses us as the course of our life unfolds even through your baggage.
[time=926] And listen, don't miss this.
[time=928] That's why information so many times Christianity becomes this descriptive information book filling faith.
[time=936] But information without application leads to stagnation.
[time=942] Some of you came today for a while now.
[time=946] You've been very stagnant in your faith.
[time=949] You've been very stuck.
[time=951] I've already talked to several people today who said I have been stuck for years.
[time=956] Some of you are there today.
[time=959] Your Savior cares about you and your stuckness.
[time=964] He's not giving up on you and it's time to get moving, but it could be that you've had this descriptive view of Christianity.
[time=971] Well, it's a label for me.
[time=973] It's a descriptive thing, but you've been missing the disciple part.
[time=976] And it's led to you focusing on the information.
[time=978] Well, I know who Jesus is.
[time=980] I know the right answers.
[time=981] I've been to Sunday school, but without the application, without it infiltrating the course of my life, it's always gonna equal stagnation.
[time=990] You're gonna get stuck.
[time=991] And God is ready to help you get moving.
[time=994] So how do we measure success in faith?
[time=998] How do we measure success in discipleships?
[time=1000] An age old question that pastors and church leaders have been digging into for a long time.
[time=1004] What are the metrics?
[time=1005] You know what I've learned?
[time=1006] I'm kind of a business-minded black and white, kind of guy.
[time=1009] I love seeing success.
[time=1010] I love the metrics.
[time=1011] I love being a measure.
[time=1012] A lot of businessmen I see in the room and ladies in the room, but you just live this every single day.
[time=1017] But what I've just determined about real biblical maturity is we can't use business metrics to accurately measure biblical maturity.
[time=1025] You wanna know why?
[time=1026] You.
[time=1027] You wanna know why?
[time=1029] Me, because we are people and we are messy and messiness is a hard thing to put metrics to.
[time=1036] So how do we measure success?
[time=1037] And the word for disciples is mathotao in the Greek.
[time=1041] Everybody say that so you can say it at lunch.
[time=1042] Everybody will think you're so smart.
[time=1044] You ready?
[time=1044] Let's say it.
[time=1045] Mathotao.
[time=1046] Mathotao is disciples.
[time=1048] We're called to make mathotao disciples.
[time=1051] And it's the same word from which we get our English word, mathematics.
[time=1055] Mathotao, mathematics.
[time=1058] It's a metric, it's a measurement, mathematics.
[time=1061] And so I believe that the metric we are to use for biblical maturity is discipleship.
[time=1066] And no, you cannot always measure that in a quantifiable kind of way.
[time=1070] It's more qualitative in that sense, isn't it?
[time=1072] It's a deep walk with Jesus, but it's people who come to know Him.
[time=1075] It's people who are baptized.
[time=1076] It's the people who in your circle of influence, know about Jesus because you refuse to be silent about Him.
[time=1082] There's all of these things that come together.
[time=1085] And today my friends, Jesus says go make disciples, not decisions.
[time=1090] I'm all about helping people find Jesus Christ.
[time=1093] But Jesus didn't say go make decisions.
[time=1095] Jesus didn't say just get people to raise their hand and we do that and you'll have a chance to do that.
[time=1099] A lot of times we think if people make a decision for Jesus, I've decided to follow Jesus that that's the end.
[time=1104] That's the finish line.
[time=1105] No, that's the starting block.
[time=1106] That's where discipleship begins.
[time=1108] Jesus said go make disciples.
[time=1109] And it starts with a decision, but then it grows and goes from there.
[time=1114] We're not just called to share the good news, we are called to share our life.
[time=1119] And Jesus didn't say go make baptists.
[time=1121] He didn't say go make Methodists.
[time=1125] He didn't say go make Presbyterians.
[time=1127] He didn't say go make Pentecostals.
[time=1128] The list could go on and on.
[time=1129] He said go make disciples.
[time=1132] And we already defined what that looks like.
[time=1134] And so I think a key distinctive of this metric, Matheteo, mathematics of your Christian growth.
[time=1141] I think a key distinctive of this mathematics view, of this metric view, of how we measure our faith, is sacrifice.
[time=1150] I really do.
[time=1151] I think a key distinctive of disciple making is a willingness to sacrifice.
[time=1155] A lot of times, we'll talk about how, well some, I'm the product of somebody planting a seed.
[time=1159] And I plant seeds all the time in people.
[time=1162] And I can think of so many moments where somebody sowed a seed.
[time=1165] They sent me a text.
[time=1166] They sent me a devotion.
[time=1168] They handed me a book.
[time=1169] Those things are great.
[time=1170] And I hope you're doing those things in the lives of the people in your life.
[time=1174] But I pray that it doesn't stop there.
[time=1176] I think a key distinctive of true discipleship is moving, is you ready for this?
[time=1180] From seeds, which we should plant because God does the watering and does the growing.
[time=1184] We plant, we water, God brings the growth, for sure.
[time=1187] But God wants to move our level of intentionality through all of the baggage and the mess of your life from just planting seeds to sacrificially, intentionally sharing life with people.
[time=1199] I'm the product of people who have done that.
[time=1201] There have been people in my life who, it's not like they came up and said, "Hey, you wanna be my disciple?" That would be weird.
[time=1208] Though sometimes maybe that's needed.
[time=1209] I've had people say, "Hey, will you disciple me?" And it's like, "What'd you say?" You don't hear that question very much, but what a beautiful question.
[time=1217] Most of the time it doesn't look like that though.
[time=1218] Those are extreme cases.
[time=1220] I think sacrificial staring of our life looks more like, so what someone has done for me.
[time=1224] And I can think of several people I hope you can too, where they went, "Ah, that Kevin, mmm." That Kevin, what a knucklehead.
[time=1234] The boy needs some help.
[time=1236] And I'm not gonna tell him he needs some help.
[time=1239] I'm not gonna go slap him upside the head.
[time=1241] But I'm just gonna invest in him.
[time=1243] And I'm gonna do it to the point where I sacrifice time with my family or time that in my hobbies to pour into him.
[time=1251] He may not ever even know or realize or even say thank you, but I'm just gonna love Kevin.
[time=1256] And I'm gonna help him in his journey of faith.
[time=1258] I'm gonna offer myself to go meet with him for coffee when he's got questions.
[time=1262] And boy, I had a lot of questions.
[time=1263] I've got one of the people in the room right now.
[time=1265] My father is in the room, and he's answered and fielded more questions than I cared to even admit for that poor man.
[time=1271] But he's done it graciously, and he sacrificed things that he would have wanted to do to care about where I was at in my faith.
[time=1278] And it was because of that, that he led me to Jesus in his red pickup truck.
[time=1283] And I was saved at the age of five.
[time=1286] And yes, a five-year-old can ask a lot of questions.
[time=1288] If you don't believe me, have one, (laughs) I was one.
[time=1293] So I think the key distinctive of discipleship is when we're willing to sacrifice and share our lives.
[time=1299] And that leads me to the last thing I wanna talk to you about, flip over to the book of Mark.
[time=1302] And this will tie it all together with the ignition of discipleship, the ignition.
[time=1307] Jesus didn't just wanna define discipleship and give a commission, that's just words.
[time=1311] He wants there to be some ignition.
[time=1313] He wants the key to go into the starter, to turn the switch and for the engine to fire and the wheels to get moving.
[time=1319] And that's what he wants in your life.
[time=1320] And so before I read you Mark chapter number three, and verses 13 and 14, I've done some study lately of the kingdom of God, getting ready for the pride and politics series, the earthly kingdoms, the eternal kingdoms.
[time=1334] And I stumbled across something as I was studying the kingdoms of God, preparing for politics of all things.
[time=1340] And I started looking at how Jesus spoke about the kingdom of God.
[time=1343] You know, he did that quite a bit.
[time=1344] Did you know that?
[time=1345] You should read the Bible.
[time=1346] It's pretty awesome.
[time=1347] It's full of the kingdom stuff that we need.
[time=1349] And a lot of times I don't say that sarcastically, though I have this not a spiritual gift.
[time=1354] I used to say it's a hidden spiritual gift of sarcasm.
[time=1356] It ain't.
[time=1357] It gets me in more trouble than it helps me.
[time=1359] Can I get an amen?
[time=1360] My fellow sarcastic people.
[time=1361] But the kingdom of God is throughout scripture.
[time=1364] And you know what I found in my estimation, at least everything that I looked at, is some 90% ish.
[time=1371] Is some nine times out of 10 that when Jesus talks about the kingdom of God, that he's not talking about some future kingdom after death.
[time=1382] Instead, he's talking about a present power now.
[time=1387] 90% of the time.
[time=1389] Jesus is ready to light a fire under you, my friends.
[time=1393] He's ready for some ignition to happen in your disciple making journey this week.
[time=1399] So let's read Mark chapter three versus 13 and 14.
[time=1403] And again, we see Jesus calling disciples and how he ignites them.
[time=1406] It's gather, connect, and go.
[time=1407] You thought that was a cool idea that Blackhawk had.
[time=1410] Nope, it was Jesus idea.
[time=1411] It turns out all along.
[time=1412] We just put some words to it.
[time=1413] And we see it very clearly in these two verses.
[time=1415] Mark three, 13.
[time=1416] And he went up on a mountain and called to him those whom he desired.
[time=1421] And they came to him and he appointed the 12, whom he also named.
[time=1425] I love that God gives us a name.
[time=1426] I could preach that sermon too, but I'll save it.
[time=1428] So that he might be with them and he might send them out to preach.
[time=1434] Look at your neighbor and tell them you are a preacher.
[time=1444] It wasn't just for Matthew.
[time=1445] It wasn't just for Peter.
[time=1447] He meant this for us.
[time=1449] We see gather, connect, go in this.
[time=1452] You ready for this?
[time=1452] Let's look at it together, gather.
[time=1454] You see in this passage, he called to him those whom he desired and they came to him.
[time=1458] They gather.
[time=1459] It's like we gather today, connect.
[time=1460] Why?
[time=1461] That they might be with him.
[time=1463] Have relationship with him.
[time=1464] So that why?
[time=1465] Number three, go, gather, connect, go.
[time=1467] He might send them out to preach.
[time=1471] And here's the thing.
[time=1472] Seems clear, seems simple, but I believe in a room this size and in a viewership the size of what this message is going to and will go to.
[time=1480] Many of you, like me, have become disillusioned by the church at times.
[time=1484] I'll tell you my best and worst experiences in my life have happened in the church.
[time=1490] The deepest hurts, but the greatest joys.
[time=1495] But some of you, the baggage of the deepest hurts
[time=1501] are holding you back.
[time=1503] And it's really clear and you can give a clear mental ascent to the things that I'm talking to you about today.
[time=1509] But the bags of your life are holding you back.
[time=1514] I pray God, I pray it all week that God would set you free from that this week.
[time=1518] Because listen, the true definition of the church does not lie in the hands of the people that make up the church.
[time=1524] The true definition of the church lie in the hands of the one who started it.
[time=1529] The one who said, I will build my church.
[time=1532] It's not their church and it's not your church.
[time=1535] He said, I will build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it.
[time=1541] And so today, if you're held back by the baggage of past hurts and leariness and weariness of plugging in to God's church, I pray.
[time=1549] I plead with you to start defining God's church by the Jesus who made it not by the knuckleheads that may distract you from time to time.
[time=1559] God's got some ignitions that he wants to do in your life.
[time=1562] He wants to ignite something inside of you to rekindle a fire.
[time=1566] And listen, this kind of ministry is not achieved.
[time=1569] It is received.
[time=1570] This kind of ministry is not something you achieve in your own power.
[time=1573] You receive it because who you are to God.
[time=1575] And that's what Jesus reminded his disciples of as he called them.
[time=1579] Who you are to God is way more important than what you do for God.
[time=1584] Jesus called the disciples and you.
[time=1586] It's not the other way around.
[time=1587] You didn't call him.
[time=1588] He called you and he loves you.
[time=1591] And he's ready to ignite and rekindle a passion that you didn't think you could have anymore.
[time=1594] And this is why we say what we say at Black Hawk often that we're called to do what Jesus did, not just talk about what Jesus said.
[time=1604] We're called to do what Jesus did, not just talk about what he said.
[time=1607] He showed us the way.
[time=1608] He modeled it.
[time=1609] We don't have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with us in our weaknesses.
[time=1612] Can I get an amen?
[time=1613] He's walked where we've walked and he's done it without sin and he does it today with love.
[time=1618] And he walks with you on your journey.
[time=1621] Jesus invites us to follow him so we can go out and invest in them.
[time=1626] Even those people that drive you the craziest.
[time=1628] And here's one way you can start with that.
[time=1630] And then I'll give you some application steps and we're gonna go out and live this together.
[time=1634] Side by side, write this down though.
[time=1636] Own your story for God's glory.
[time=1641] I believe with all of my heart that the greatest tool that God has given you to share the good news of Jesus is your story.
[time=1650] It is not your ability to find that Bible verse.
[time=1655] It is not your ability to teach a systematic theology course although those things are amazing and a big part of our journey.
[time=1661] It is the story he's uniquely giving to you to use to share with other people.
[time=1669] I'm gonna give you three things to apply this.
[time=1671] Try to do that every week.
[time=1671] Number one, I wanna challenge you this week to write down and share your story.
[time=1677] Now, here's what I'm not saying.
[time=1678] It's not a book.
[time=1679] A lot of people when we say share your story, write it down.
[time=1682] It's not a book, it's a short paragraph.
[time=1684] I always give you an outline of three things.
[time=1686] We do this for baptisms, we do it for you today.
[time=1688] It's number one, talk about your life before meeting Jesus.
[time=1692] Number two, talk about how you ran into Jesus.
[time=1695] How did he change your life?
[time=1696] And number three, how has he changed your life since?
[time=1698] It's a pretty good outline to share your story.
[time=1700] It's an elevator speech.
[time=1701] And in fact, I'll go and give you a sneak peek of number three I'm about to give you when you take the journey, 'cause that's gonna be number three, in just a second.
[time=1708] When you take the journey, your story is an integral, integral part of the journey you're gonna go on.
[time=1714] We believe it's that important.
[time=1716] So this week, write it down, have it ready, even have it in your pocket, but ask God, I dare you.
[time=1721] I double dog dare you to ask God for an opportunity to share your story with one person this week.
[time=1730] And then look out and look for it and step into it.
[time=1733] So look, write it down, share it.
[time=1735] Number two, read our statement of faith scripture references on our website.
[time=1739] You go to blackhawkministries.org, the top right up there, learn about blackhawk.
[time=1742] You'll find links to our foundational documents.
[time=1744] We're gonna go through for the next eight weeks, this lineup, starting with the authority of scripture next week, I love the Bible.
[time=1751] Can't wait to share with you about that next Sunday.
[time=1753] We're gonna go through our statement of faith, one tenant at a time, looking at the whole of God's word and what it has to say for these truths, we can hold on to it starts with discipleship and then the how of it and the things that unify us or those things.
[time=1764] So go read each week these scriptures and it will help you be ready as we dig into the word of God each week.
[time=1769] And then number three already told you is take the journey.
[time=1772] Go to blackhawkministries.org, go to the app and start your journey today.
[time=1775] Log in, you can do it at your own pace, takes about two hours if you wanna power through it or just do it at your own pace, take your time and we will walk with you.
[time=1783] But I believe as you go on this journey, whatever your bags look like, I believe it is a journey worth taking.
[time=1790] When I see you bag your heads, close your eyes, nobody look around, just do some business with God.
[time=1794] Ask him to work on your heart, to speak to you in your spirit in this moment, right now.
[time=1800] Whatever your baggage may look like, believers that are in the room, I gave you three action steps, but maybe God is stirring a fourth, maybe a fifth.
[time=1808] And some of you are in the room right now and you would say that I just don't know that if I were to die today, that I would spend eternity with God.
[time=1816] I just don't know that I have fully surrendered my life to him, believed in my heart, confessed with my mouth that Jesus is Lord.
[time=1824] I wanna help you with that, not because it's me, not because I can do anything about it, but because Jesus already did.
[time=1830] You already won that battle, won that victory.
[time=1833] And because he lives, you can have eternal life right now.
[time=1836] I'm not gonna lead you in a prayer because I think your heart's screaming in that prayer.
[time=1839] It's not about words, prayer doesn't save you.
[time=1842] It's that surrender of your heart is confessing with your mouth, believing Jesus is Lord that he's raised from the dead, trusting in him and not you, not in you being good enough, not in just hoping that maybe sort of kinda I can get there, but knowing that Jesus paid that price after living the sinless life we couldn't live.
[time=1861] That he died for you, he thought of you, he thought of this moment.
[time=1866] He paid the price you couldn't pay and he rose from the dead and he is alive.
[time=1869] Do you believe it?
[time=1870] Let him know and he'll save you right now.
[time=1873] Whatever business you need to do, take a moment and do it now.
