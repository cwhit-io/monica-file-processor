[time=0] I'm gonna give you five words today that will help you and with a bunch of different scriptures will be in John chapter one first.
[time=6] So you can meet me there.
[time=7] John chapter one in your New Testament.
[time=10] But what I wanna do is give you five words that have to do with the authority of scripture that I believe will provide a good framework for you to be able to study scripture, to be able to dig into this question of can I rely on scripture?
[time=24] Can I believe that it is true?
[time=26] And so let's start with the first word coming from John chapter one.
[time=29] And that word is revelation.
[time=31] Write that down, revelation.
[time=32] John chapter one will read the first five verses and then we will read down at verse 14.
[time=38] You guys ready for the word this morning?
[time=41] It's interesting what we're about to read.
[time=42] The word word is the Greek word logos which we're gonna dig into because it has a hundred different meanings to a hundred different people but it's all summed up in the word of God that became flesh and his name is Jesus.
[time=58] Let's read about it together.
[time=59] John chapter one, verses one through five.
[time=62] In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God.
[time=67] He was in the beginning with God.
[time=68] All things were made through him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life.
[time=75] And the life was the light of men.
[time=77] The light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it.
[time=80] That's our vision statement verse, the light the one five verse.
[time=84] It starts in our zip code, the four six eight one five goes to 15 regions around the world here, there and everywhere.
[time=90] But read down further with me in verse 14 because the word, same word, logos.
[time=95] The word became flesh and dwelt among us and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only son from the Father full of grace and truth, revelation.
[time=107] We see a picture of how God wants to reveal himself to you.
[time=112] Did you know that God wants to speak to you?
[time=114] As we go through all this, the main point that you need to hold on to, if you don't care about the history, if you're already in the spot where you're comfortable and believe those things, don't forget, wherever you're at today, don't forget God's word is to you and for you to show you who he is because he deeply loves you.
[time=131] That's what revelation is all about.
[time=133] And this Greek term logos is the word from which we get our English word logic.
[time=138] And it means word as it's translated.
[time=140] It means speech, principle or thought.
[time=143] In Greek philosophy, if you're a big philosopher, you know what I'm about to say because so much of philosophy flows from this kind of a concept in early Greek philosophy, the meaning of this word is like meaning, it's purpose, it's rationale, it's logic, it's the meaning of life and the purpose that we all look for.
[time=163] And the Greeks get this, tell me if this doesn't sound a little familiar with today's time.
[time=167] The Greeks concluded that there was no such thing as the logos, that we couldn't attain a clear, overarching, well-defined, universal, timeless, authoritative logos, purpose, meaning in our lives.
[time=181] So what should we do?
[time=182] We should just all find our own logos, we should all find our own meaning and our own rationale.
[time=187] And then comes John and he writes, it says, oh no, no, no, no, no, there is a such thing as the logos, this meaning, this purpose that everybody in the whole universe is looking for.
[time=197] There is such a thing and here's the thing, it's real and it's God and God became a man and he walked among us, his name is Jesus and even better, he loves you.
[time=210] He's entered your darkness and he cares about you.
[time=215] God wants to reveal himself to you, that's the message of John, that's the message of the word that is the written word of God, but the word became flesh, the word put on flesh, the word on its bones and on its structure became a man and that man was Jesus Christ, why?
[time=230] So that God could reveal himself to you.
[time=233] You can write it down this way, that the word of God reveals the God of the word.
[time=237] A lot of times we think it's just about, well, I gotta just know the word and so you should, but that's not God's ultimate goal that you fill your head with the knowledge of what the word says.
[time=246] God gave you his word so that you would look at the word of God and then reveal to you the God of the word, the one who wrote it, it's a love letter to you.
[time=257] People call it basic instructions before leaving earth, B-I-B-L-E, but it's God's love letter to you, it gives you everything that you need to understand, everything you need to know about a God who deeply, deeply loves you.
[time=269] Theologians and scholars will talk about God's revelation in two terms generally and one of them is general, general revelation and then special revelation.
[time=277] General revelation is that the heavens declare, the rocks are gonna cry out, God generally is seen because we have an intelligent creator, can I get an amen?
[time=285] Even though everything in the world doesn't always look that intelligent, can I get another amen?
[time=290] It's still clear that we have an intelligent creator and he has created the entire universe and he is generally revealed through his creation, but the best part is that there's a special revelation, there's a specific revelation, there's a unique revelation that the best part about it is that it is a personal revelation and it comes from the word of God and it's revealed in the people of God and our hearts and our stories and so we see his general and his special revelation and then secondly we see this personal God who reveals himself, the word inspiration, let's talk about inspiration and let's go to Second Timothy, if you'll meet me there, Second Timothy chapter number three, Second Timothy chapter three, this is perhaps one of the most common passages about the inspiration of the Bible, so where did it come from?
[time=338] Didn't humans write it down, we would say, absolutely, but what was the source, was that the humans that wrote it or were they carried along by something bigger than them?
[time=347] The word here is God breathed, it's inspired, it's Theo Nuestos in the Greek in the original language, we'll break that apart in just a minute.
[time=354] Second Timothy chapter three, verse 14, but as for you, good word for us today, continue in what you've learned and have firmly believed knowing from whom you've learned it, that's the source.
[time=366] Verse 15 and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus, verse 16.
[time=376] All scripture, Greek word past, it's the same word that's used everywhere and guess what it means, all, it's all of the universe, it's all people that God desires to come to a saving knowledge of him, it's all scripture.
[time=387] All scripture is breathed out, Theo Nuestos, some of the translations will read inspired, this is the inspiration, all scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for four things, teaching for reproof, for correction and training in righteousness that the man of God may be competent, equipped for every good work.
[time=406] Theo Nuestos, Theo is God, Nuestos is air, it's breathed out, it's what we're not supposed to do on each other during COVID season, God did to give us and reveal to us his word, it's God breathed, God didn't listen, God didn't just breathe into scripture, God literally physically breathed out scripture, but he did it through imperfect people and we're gonna look at that more in just a few moments.
[time=431] So here's what we know, God inspired it, if inspiration is that it is inspired and breathed out by God, that means that in its original form, it is without error, it is inerrant and that means it is infallible in its application to our life, back to our statement of faith, that's why we know it's inerrant, it's without error, it's inspired by God, it's infallible in its application, meaning that it governs our life, it has total authority over me, if God said it and it's directly from his heart, I'll do this, I hit my knee, that hurt a little bit.
[time=462] And so that's a good illustration, I didn't plan that, sometimes it hurts, doesn't it?
[time=467] When you submit and you're obedient, but that is what we're called to do because God wants to reveal himself to us and he inspired and breathed out his word and therefore it governs everything in our life because it's totally true, it's totally trustworthy and we are to be governed by what it says, because we're governed by what God tells us.
[time=486] Inspiration, there's so much more we could talk there but I wanna spend more time than anything on number three.
[time=492] Talked about revelation, talked about inspiration, now go to second Peter, I'm gonna take you to two chapters and second Peter, I'm gonna get you ready for sword drills, how many of you did sword drills growing up in scripture?
[time=503] Yeah, I was on the Awana JV team and I gotta say, I did pretty well, everybody wanted me on their team but then we went digital and now we just click it and we kind of forget how to get there, right?
[time=513] So I'm gonna help you with your sword drills, if you don't know what that is, it's where you race to get to a certain place in the Bible and so I'm helping you do that today.
[time=519] Second Peter, second Peter is a beautiful picture of the third word I wanna walk you through and that is authentication, authentication.
[time=526] How can we know that this is true?
[time=528] How can we know that it's totally true and trustworthy?
[time=530] How can we know it's without error?
[time=532] How can we know that we can trust it?
[time=534] How can we know that God really did inspire this and it wasn't just some concoction of humanity?
[time=539] How can we know that there wasn't some conspiracy that people just put together?
[time=543] How can we know that it is authentic?
[time=546] I'm gonna give you two words that'll help you with that before we read from second Peter.
[time=550] Word number one with authentication is canonization and if you don't know what that is, you can take that to lunch and people will be like, man, what'd they teach you at church today, right?
[time=559] You're a real smart canonization.
[time=561] The word canon is the word by which we look at what made it into our scripture.
[time=565] So again, why is there 66 books?
[time=567] Why is there not 67 books?
[time=571] So the canon, the word itself means like a read or a measurement stick, like a ruler that's used as a metric, a tool by which we decide what makes it in, what doesn't make it in, what is true, what's a part of it, what's not, what makes the cut?
[time=583] That's a good question.
[time=584] So the canonization has a lot to do with the authentication of the Bible.
[time=588] And I don't have time to do a great treatment of all the history of the canon of scripture, what made it into what you hold in your hands or through your phones today.
[time=597] But you should study the history.
[time=598] Back when I questioned all these things, I wanted to know the whole story of every step of what happens.
[time=603] So what I'm gonna do for you today is peak your interest and hopefully you can go look at how that measuring stick was applied throughout history.
[time=610] And we've got courses and classes and tools to help you do that here at Blackhawk.
[time=613] But I wanna give you three key attributes that were often used as a part of this canonization or what makes it into the Bible.
[time=620] Three key things, there was a divine nature.
[time=623] There was something divine about it.
[time=625] And you say, well, how do we know if something's divine about it?
[time=627] These other two things help you with that, that it has divine nature, that it has authoritative authorship, meaning it came from someone who actually knew what they were talking about, meaning they actually walked with Jesus.
[time=637] They saw these things or they walked and talked with someone who did.
[time=640] We'll talk about that eyewitness account in a minute.
[time=642] And then thirdly, there's a corporate receptiveness or recognition, if you will, that throughout history, history, and we're gonna dig into it some more, history confirms over and over and over and over and over and over and over how God has preserved his word and how people have wanted to rip it apart, burn it down, but God has made it live because it's alive and active as we're gonna look at today.
[time=663] And so this canonization, divine nature, authoritative authorship, corporate reception, at least to the second word about authentication and that is confirmation.
[time=671] Canonization, confirmation, how can we confirm it?
[time=673] How can we know it?
[time=674] These 66 books of scripture get this, have been confirmed by acts of God throughout history and most of which, and so many of which, are recorded so powerfully for us through the actual words of scripture in their original forms where it was all written down for us.
[time=690] And the Old Testament is quoted in the New Testament, get this some 300 times, around 300 AD.
[time=697] Let's just go with that number.
[time=698] There's so many of these stories I could tell you that there's a Roman emperor and Christianity was deeply assassinated or so one would think through the Roman Empire.
[time=707] It was wanted to just be done away with, it's under that same empire that Jesus was crucified.
[time=713] But the Roman Emperor Diocletian ordered that all Christian scriptures, but also all of their worship books, all of their places of worship, be burned.
[time=720] But it was just a few years later that another Roman Emperor Constantine ordered that more copies be made.
[time=727] And you see that story throughout history over and over and over.
[time=730] God has even used people, used places that were used to get rid of the word of God and through his strength, authority, and power, has preserved the word of God.
[time=740] It's still the best-selling book in all of history and it always will be because God's not going to let it fail.
[time=746] And that just, if that doesn't get you there, then I got more for you.
[time=752] You're in luck because it's story just keeps going.
[time=754] We see this authentication over and over and what we see is that the words of Jesus are true.
[time=759] He said in Matthew 24 verse 35, "Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not." And it is so true.
[time=767] And in what it is in this authentication, we see the preservation, the preservation of God's word.
[time=774] It even had a third word, there's the canonization, the confirmation, and you see it most clearly through the preservation of God's word.
[time=780] People try to get rid of it, yet have not succeeded.
[time=782] Second Peter told you I'd get there.
[time=785] That gives you a setup for Second Peter.
[time=786] I love Peter.
[time=787] Peter's the knucklehead fisherman.
[time=789] The loudmouth, boisterous, mean, old, grumpy guy that cuts people's ears off that Jesus chose to use.
[time=796] And so maybe you can relate to Peter.
[time=798] He's writing and you gotta understand, this is at the end of Peter's life.
[time=801] And at the end of Peter's life, one of his dying wishes is that people would trust the word of God.
[time=810] And I share his passion.
[time=813] I'm not planning on going anywhere just yet, but if God wants to take me, I'm ready.
[time=817] But Peter knew his life was coming to an end and he wanted us to trust the word of God.
[time=821] Let's look at Second Peter chapter one, let's re-verses 16 through 21.
[time=825] You guys are waking with me today?
[time=827] How 'bout at home, you guys with me?
[time=828] Just nod, God sees you, he knows.
[time=831] Let's dig in together, Second Peter chapter one, verse 16.
[time=834] For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=843] But we were eyewitnesses, we're gonna talk about that in a moment.
[time=846] Of his majesty, for when he received honor and glory from God, the Father, and the voice was born to him by the majestic glory, this is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.
[time=857] We are cells heard, this very voice born from heaven, for we were with him on the holy mountain and we have something more sure, the prophetic word, to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place.
[time=875] Until the day dawns and the morning star, that's Jesus, I'll show you in just a moment, the morning star rises in your hearts.
[time=882] Knowing this, first of all, that no prophecy of scripture comes from someone's own interpretation.
[time=888] For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
[time=898] Oh my goodness, so much there, I love Peter's writing.
[time=900] Let's go through this for a moment, starting with this idea of an eyewitness.
[time=903] Think about the time in which Peter, Paul, all these people wrote.
[time=907] We'll see that Peter talks about Paul's writings in chapter three of Second Peter in a moment.
[time=911] But during this time, there was no digital, there was no audio, and there was no video evidence.
[time=917] And today, that would be the most sure way that we would prove that something is true.
[time=922] We, video where it didn't happen, right?
[time=925] Is what we'll say.
[time=926] You gotta prove it and show it.
[time=927] Well, back then, the video where it didn't happen, step, evidence, was eyewitness accounts.
[time=933] If someone was physically there and saw it with their own eyes, that's how stories, that's how true things were passed from time to time, from generation to generation, before we had all of this technology.
[time=943] And Peter get this, is saying that God speaking through Scripture, that God speaking through the prophetic nature of Scripture, that I'll show you in just a moment here, is even greater evidence.
[time=954] It's even more sure than what he saw.
[time=957] And so let's go through that for a minute.
[time=958] He starts with verse 16 saying, "There's this tension between myth and truth." He said, "We didn't follow cleverly devised myths." And there's good news, the gospel, true news, and there's fake news.
[time=969] Boy, is that not still true today?
[time=971] Do you feel that tension today?
[time=972] God, if you do in this world.
[time=973] We feel that tension just like Peter did, and there were all of these false narratives going on, but Peter's saying, "We didn't follow the false stuff.
[time=980] "We stayed with the true stuff, "and he proves it to us by walking us through." Verses 17 and 18, he then says, he's talking of the mount of transfiguration.
[time=988] And this is where Jesus and his glory was shown, and the prophets of old were there.
[time=994] And I can't preach that passage to you.
[time=995] But Peter, James, and John were there, and they saw with their own eyes, the face of Jesus glowing.
[time=1001] They saw with their own eyes, and heard with their own ears, the voice of God.
[time=1006] If you've been wanting to hear from God lately, can you imagine what kind of day 17 and 18 would be?
[time=1011] And you look back, and you hear the voice of God saying, this is my son, a person that you are looking at with your own eyes, hearing with your own ears.
[time=1021] This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.
[time=1025] First of all, I'd be going.
[time=1027] Can you imagine what that would look like?
[time=1030] Some of you are looking for a word from God today.
[time=1032] I'm gonna help you be able to find that.
[time=1033] But Peter, get what he's saying, that he's saying I with an eyewitness account saw these things, but verse 19.
[time=1040] But the prophecies that are fulfilled through scripture make it even more sure than what I'm telling you that I saw with my own eyes.
[time=1048] So let's break that apart for just a moment.
[time=1051] Because we see the morning star there.
[time=1053] I told you that was Jesus.
[time=1054] Let me show you how I know it's Jesus, in the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[time=1057] Numbers 24 and verse 17.
[time=1059] I'm gonna show you this verse.
[time=1061] Numbers 24, verse 17.
[time=1063] We see it.
[time=1064] I see him, but not now.
[time=1065] I behold him, but not near.
[time=1067] A star shall come out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel.
[time=1072] It shall crush the forehead of Moab and break down all the sons of Sheth.
[time=1075] But the part I want you to see is the star imagery.
[time=1077] You think about Christmas and the prophecies.
[time=1080] We're gonna spend, listen, I believe our world today is just craving truth.
[time=1083] Can I get an amen?
[time=1085] There's so many lies.
[time=1086] We just need some truth.
[time=1088] So while we're digging in today, but over Christmas, we're gonna look at the prophecies that were fulfilled by the coming of Christ.
[time=1093] And you think of a star in Bethlehem that guided them.
[time=1096] But there's an even bigger imagery in numbers, but also in Revelation 22 and verse 16.
[time=1101] Look at this verse.
[time=1102] I Jesus, these are red letters coming straight from Jesus himself.
[time=1105] Have sent my angel to testify to you about these things for the churches.
[time=1109] I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.
[time=1116] The same bright morning star that Peter talks about and all this story just keeps going.
[time=1121] Did you know that at the time your Bible, over a span of a couple of thousand-ish years, as it was written and put together, did you know that roughly a quarter of it, roughly 25% of your Bible when it was written, was prophetic in nature.
[time=1135] Meaning it was predicting and talking about future events that had not yet happened.
[time=1139] That's an incredible statistic.
[time=1142] And many of those things have been fulfilled because Christ has come.
[time=1145] The Old Testament ones, they're all pointing to Jesus.
[time=1147] I'm gonna talk more about that at the end of today's message, but about 25%.
[time=1152] Scholars point to over 300 messianic prophecies, talking about Jesus, the coming Messiah.
[time=1158] And they're all fulfilled in Jesus and the probability.
[time=1160] And when we get to Christmas, I'm gonna do some math.
[time=1162] I like math.
[time=1164] And I'm not as good at it as some as some of our teachers here in our school, but there was some stuff written that I can't wait to share with you that shows some probabilities of little tiny portions of these prophecies coming true.
[time=1175] And we see all of them coming true in Jesus Christ.
[time=1178] I believe in the authority of scripture.
[time=1180] And verse 20, no prophecy comes from human interpretation.
[time=1183] It's a dual authorship.
[time=1185] It's the gospel.
[time=1187] It's a perfect spirit of God communicating a perfect word through imperfect people.
[time=1193] That's the gospel, a perfect spirit of God, a perfect word communicating it through imperfect people.
[time=1199] That's the God of the gospel.
[time=1201] That's the good news.
[time=1202] That's what Jesus does.
[time=1203] He uses knuckleheads like Peter and like Kevin Rivers and like you to do his perfect work, even though we are so imperfect.
[time=1212] And Peter reminds us of that.
[time=1213] Verse 21, he says, men are carried along by the Holy Spirit.
[time=1216] That the original language for carried along is kind of like a ship going out to sea.
[time=1221] You know, there's a current and you know, sometimes you can have the sails, you can have the rotors, you can have this, you can have the engines.
[time=1225] But sometimes the current of the sea is just gonna carry you wherever it will.
[time=1229] It's that kind of imagery that Peter is talking about.
[time=1232] It carried them out to sea.
[time=1234] It carried them.
[time=1235] They couldn't control it.
[time=1236] It was dictated by God.
[time=1238] They were just the messengers.
[time=1239] And that's why we're not called to have editors of God's word today.
[time=1242] We're called to have messengers, carriers of God's word as we too are carried along by his spirit and by his more sure word as Paul puts in.
[time=1252] Hundreds of times in the Bible you see, thus says the Lord.
[time=1254] 3,800 times in the Old Testament alone, there's God said or the Lord said or thus says the Lord.
[time=1259] It's just over and over and over again.
[time=1262] And that's why the biblical authors like Peter remind us that this information is coming through me, but it's coming from him.
[time=1269] That's a picture of what Peter is talking to us about.
[time=1273] And today let's make it personal.
[time=1275] I want you to know that if you're ready, look at me for a minute, so important, don't miss it.
[time=1278] If you're ready to hear a word from God, so I'm even looking for that for a long time.
[time=1283] If you want a word from God, I wanna point you today to the word of God because he has revealed himself through an inspired word that is authentic and real and true and trustworthy without error so that we can dig in it.
[time=1298] Second Peter chapter three, let's continue with what Peter has to say about this.
[time=1302] He talks about Paul's writings in chapter three.
[time=1305] Let's go to verse 14 of second Peter chapter three, we'll read through verse 17.
[time=1311] Peter says, therefore beloved, since you or watch are waiting for these, be diligent to be found in him without spot or blemish and at peace.
[time=1319] And count the patience of our Lord as salvation just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given to him as he does in all his letters.
[time=1331] And when he speaks in them of these matters, there are some things in them, I love this part, that are hard to understand.
[time=1337] Don't you love that the Bible itself is just real about the humanity of the people that God used for us to capture it and have it today?
[time=1344] He's saying, okay, Paul wrote these things and you're gonna see in a moment that they're scriptures.
[time=1349] He counts them as scriptures and he's gonna talk about what people do with the scriptures in a moment.
[time=1353] So he's counting what Paul wrote as scriptures without all the information we have already which is something in and of itself.
[time=1359] But then he even points to the fact that you know, they're kind of hard to understand sometimes, right?
[time=1363] And you ever feel that way as you read God's word?
[time=1365] Well, Peter's even pointing to that in Paul's writings.
[time=1367] I love the realness of the word of God and he continues.
[time=1371] There's some things in them that are hard to understand which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction.
[time=1377] Oh my goodness, this is happening so much.
[time=1380] Today everybody quotes Jesus, everybody quotes the Bible and they twist and use it for their own messages.
[time=1384] As they do the other scriptures, you see that confirmation there, verse 17.
[time=1388] You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, take care that you are not carried away, same imagery here again, that you're not carried away with the error of lawless people and lose your own stability.
[time=1402] But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to him, be the glory, both now to the day of eternity, amen.
[time=1411] What a beautiful picture from Paul.
[time=1412] I wanna unpack that for a moment.
[time=1414] He's calling Paul's writing scripture and he reminds us to stay grounded in that truth.
[time=1418] Growing in the grace and knowledge of Jesus, write it down this way that the Bible's authenticity, I'm teaching you about authenticity for a moment 'cause some of you just need to be able to trust it and God wants you to trust and follow him.
[time=1429] The Bible's authenticity means I've got to submit to its authority, it's got to have authority in my life.
[time=1435] But verse 17 is so true of today's era and here's what we see happening.
[time=1439] So many are being deceived and carried away like that current out into the ocean by all these things that others are doing, carried away with the error of lawless people and therefore losing our own stability.
[time=1450] And so as we see that today, here's what happens.
[time=1453] We often end up using what God has used his word to authorize and then we end up taking it and politicizing it and secularizing it.
[time=1464] And I got to speak for just a moment on terms and how we are doing that in some ways I see it.
[time=1469] We've taught recently on a lot of the big terms and the institutions and the movements of society, things like Black Lives Matter.
[time=1476] We affirm and we wrote about this that every person is created in the image of God.
[time=1480] We are image bearers and so the statement itself is a true statement and we're called to, as Jesus, you can't tell me Jesus wouldn't be engaging conversations today to point, to get this, to point to the truth, but that the organization and the earthly institutions and the terminologies and the worldviews that come out of that is not something that we endorse when it goes contrary to Scripture.
[time=1501] We've talked about the differences in those things.
[time=1503] There are terms now like, and I'm just gonna be honest with you guys, you guys email me about every other day and I'm not saying stop, I've tried to help and I'm just gonna be honest, I can't keep up with all the terms.
[time=1513] There's a new term almost every day.
[time=1516] There's things like intersectionality and critical race theory and where do we stand on that?
[time=1521] There's politics and there's this and there's that and the list just goes on and on and on and I can't keep up with the terms.
[time=1526] I really can't and what I wanna challenge you is that we as Jesus would do.
[time=1530] Jesus did this in culture over and over.
[time=1532] He stepped into the messes of culture, the places where everybody intersected and drove each other crazy and ended up killing each other.
[time=1540] Jesus was there to engage the conversation and be present to be light in the darkness, but he did it to reveal the truth of the word, which he was, he's the word made flesh and he dwelt among us, that means he had the conversations and he looked for avenues, he looked for venues to be able to talk about the real truth, using whatever tools that are earthly, using whatever opportunities were available.
[time=1564] He stepped into them and he was the same yesterday, today and forever and my friends, today I see so many people getting so caught up in the transient terms that change every single day and we get more consumed by those things than by the authority of the word of God.
[time=1580] But if we would come together as God's church and follow the model of Jesus, applying the word of truth, the authority of scripture, the love of Jesus into every one of these avenues that keeps dividing us then this world would look different today.
[time=1597] That is what the authority of scripture can bring about in our life.
[time=1603] I wanna say it to you this way, if you say, what did it even say?
[time=1605] It was a big rant, Pastor.
[time=1607] What are we even saying?
[time=1608] Sorry, I get a little excited sometimes, but I wanna say it to you this way, write it down this way.
[time=1612] What are you saying, Pastor?
[time=1614] I'm saying that as disciples of Jesus, we must hold to the authoritative truths of scripture above the fluctuating terms of society.
[time=1622] That's what we're saying twice.
[time=1624] As disciples of Jesus, we must hold to the authoritative truths of scripture above the fluctuating terms of society.
[time=1632] They're changing every single day, but may we hold to the truth of scripture, but here's what'll happen.
[time=1637] Don't get too excited if you're like, see I knew that thing, that thing, whatever that thing is for you, we all have things.
[time=1642] We all got things that we're super passionate about.
[time=1644] Don't use that and don't do what Peter talked about and twist it for your own agenda, because write this down, I'm not gonna read it 'cause it's almost lunchtime.
[time=1651] Second Corinthians chapter five versus 14 through 21.
[time=1654] Write that down.
[time=1655] Second Corinthians chapter five versus 14 through 21.
[time=1657] It calls us ministers of reconciliation that we are ambassadors for Christ to carry the message of reconciliation.
[time=1666] So just like Jesus, if we hold to the authoritative truths of scripture above the fluctuating trends of society, then the fluctuating trends of society then become this avenue, this road, this venue for us to step into and engage, not hide from, we're called to be in the world and not of the world, we see that in scripture, but that does mean you're in the world.
[time=1688] Jesus showed us what it looks like to be in the world.
[time=1690] So the fluctuating trends of society, if you look at it through the lens of being a minister and a messenger of reconciliation, is you bring that message through the avenues that the world affords you, but you never embrace the worldviews, the solutions that maybe those avenues afford you because we know what the solution is, don't we?
[time=1709] His name is Jesus.
[time=1710] The problem is sin, the solution is Jesus, but as Jesus did, may we carry his truth through all of these avenues, all of these discussions to be Jesus in our world.
[time=1719] We're gonna be giving you ways to do that, especially in the areas of racial tensions and political divides in the weeks and months ahead after the first of the year, with some other churches here in our area, just to peak your appetite.
[time=1732] So from terms to truth, two more quick things, translation is number four.
[time=1736] Look at first Corinthians chapter 15, first Corinthians chapter 15, I wanna read to you verse three.
[time=1743] This is the Paul that Peter was talking about, and in chapter 15 of first Corinthians, he's talking about the resurrection, but in verse three he says, "For I delivered to you as a first importance "what I also received that Christ died for our sins "in accordance with the scriptures, "that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day, "and accordance with the scriptures.
[time=1763] "Just like God inspired his word, revealing himself, "speaking it through human authors, "and it was handed down through centuries, "then it's now been translated.
[time=1772] "The Bible is the most, the original manuscripts "of the Bible in their original language "is the most translated set of documents "in all of human history.
[time=1781] "It's now, and by the time I say this, "if you're watching online down the road, "this is probably even grown.
[time=1785] "This number constantly grows, almost daily, "that 1400 plus languages the Bible is translated into, "and that number's probably even outdated by the time.
[time=1793] "I say it, and it's not gonna stop.
[time=1795] "It's being translated, and so people often ask me "what version of the Bible is best, pastor?" And I always kind of jokingly say the one you'll read.
[time=1803] And it's true, I do feel that way.
[time=1805] However, I wanna give a little bit more of an in-depth answer because that is a common question.
[time=1809] I'll give you four categories of translations of scripture.
[time=1812] Number one is perversions.
[time=1814] There are perversions that are translated in a way with nefarious intent to accomplish an agenda that is not what the original language is, is not what the original documents, is not what the manuscripts intended.
[time=1826] As an example, the new world translation does not depict the Jesus of the original documents.
[time=1832] Jesus is not the son of God.
[time=1834] Jesus is not a deified man who was word and flesh, who was fully God and fully man in that translation.
[time=1841] So it has bad intent.
[time=1842] It's got personal agendas, so perversions, as an example.
[time=1846] Number two, paraphrases.
[time=1848] Paraphrases, this will be things like the living Bible or the message.
[time=1852] And I wanna go on and say, because some of you are gonna come out of this looking for me to say, "Don't read that "wouldn't read this one." Listen, I do read the one you'll read, but I wanna give you a way to kind of funnel through this to understand what you're reading.
[time=1863] And so this is an example of the message, the living Bible.
[time=1867] Just like you would use a devotional book, a devotional material or commentaries to study the Bible, these are excellent tools to help you study the word of God.
[time=1876] It goes verse by verse and paraphrases things so that you can apply them in powerful ways in your life.
[time=1880] There's perversions, there's paraphrases, there's thought for thought.
[time=1884] And that's things like, and I love these, I use them in my own study every single week.
[time=1889] The new living translation, the new international version or examples of thought for thought, or it takes the thoughts of scripture.
[time=1895] And you gotta remember that when you're translating scripture, there are phrases in the Greek that have so much more meaning than we even have English words for.
[time=1903] And so this is always gonna be a part of translation to a degree as a whole other lesson or message, but there's thought for thought.
[time=1910] And then there's word for word, things like the English Standard Version, the new American Standard Bible, the New King James Version, those are a few of those.
[time=1918] I preach from the English Standard Version.
[time=1920] I would suggest to you that when you're studying the truth of God's word, find a word for word translation as your starting point.
[time=1926] But definitely look for thoughts for thought translations.
[time=1930] And if you come with those in the messages today, great, bring 'em, it's great, there's no problem with that.
[time=1935] Keep digging deeper and expounding upon your study of God's word from looking kind of word to word to go to thought for thought.
[time=1941] And then even to go in and paraphrases and studying commentaries and looking at devotional materials, is that helpful?
[time=1949] But don't read the perversions.
[time=1950] If you don't know what those are, you're welcome to reach out to our staff, our elders, our leaders anytime it will help you know what they look like, translation.
[time=1958] Number five, illumination.
[time=1960] And I know it's late.
[time=1962] I know it's at the end of the day, but you can't miss this part.
[time=1966] 'Cause even if you checked out on any of the rest, illumination is what God wants you to hear.
[time=1970] Psalm 19, verses seven through 11, reminds us of how perfect the law of the Lord is, the word of God is, and God wants to illuminate it in your life.
[time=1979] He wants to show you something that you've been missing that'll help you practically in your life.
[time=1984] Psalm 19, seven through 11, the law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul.
[time=1988] The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.
[time=1992] That's good news for people like me.
[time=1994] Verse eight, the precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart.
[time=1997] The commandment of the Lord is pure enlightening the eyes.
[time=2000] That's the illumination.
[time=2002] The fear of the Lord is clean and during forever, the rules of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.
[time=2007] More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold.
[time=2011] Sweet are also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb.
[time=2014] Moreover by them, your servant is worn in keeping them, there is great reward.
[time=2020] Verse seven reminds us that the only perfect thing left on earth is the word of God.
[time=2025] The only perfect thing left on earth is the word of God.
[time=2028] We have a perfect God who dwells in perfect people, but he's left us his perfect word.
[time=2031] The law of the Lord is perfect, verse seven.
[time=2034] The Bible's the only book that reads you as you read it.
[time=2037] Did you know that?
[time=2039] The word calls itself a mirror.
[time=2040] You see yourself and if you're like me, you look and you go, ooh, I need the word of God when I see in that mirror.
[time=2047] In Hebrews chapter four, verses 12 through 13, we see that the word of God is living and acted sharper than any two-edged sword.
[time=2055] It pierces to our hearts and reminds us of who we are, how much we need him.
[time=2061] And even the verse goes on verse 13, Hebrews four, that we end up naked in the eyes of the one who wrote this word, it reveals who we are.
[time=2069] The Bible's the only book where the author meets with you when you read it.
[time=2073] You ever read a book and said, "Man, I'd really like to meet that author one day." So true of the Bible, yet he meets with you every time you open it.
[time=2082] Psalm 119, 105 says your word is a lamp to our feet and a light to our path and the spirit of God desires to use the word of God to renew, restore, and illuminate the people of God.
[time=2096] Deuteronomy 29, 29, if you struggle with the gray areas of Scripture.
[time=2100] Did you know God didn't reveal everything to you?
[time=2102] You don't know why?
[time=2103] I know why because I'm a human.
[time=2105] I couldn't handle it.
[time=2107] I couldn't keep up with all this stuff God keeps up with.
[time=2109] Deuteronomy 29, 29 says the secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and our children forever.
[time=2116] That we may do all the words of this law.
[time=2119] That means there are secret things that your brain can't quite comprehend, but the things reveal belong to us and our kids forever.
[time=2125] And that means, that means that we have all we need to know, all that we need to know about a God who loves all of us with all of his heart.
[time=2134] Last thing I wanna do, spend a few minutes, I just wanna read something over you because the last point I'll make is that Jesus is the theme of every book of the Bible.
[time=2142] Jesus is the theme of every book of the Bible.
[time=2145] And I wanna read to you this list from Old Testament, all 66 books, and if you wanna close your eyes, do that.
[time=2150] But let the spirit move in you because the name of Jesus is powerful and he's the author and finisher of our faith and he's the theme of every book of the Bible.

[time=2247] In Zechariah, the pierced son.

[time=2255] In Mark, he's the miracle worker.
[time=2258] In Luke, he's the son of man.
[time=2260] In John, he's the son of God.
[time=2262] The living word.
[time=2263] In Acts, he's the ascended Lord seated at God's right hand.
[time=2266] In Romans, he's the justifier of the lost.
[time=2270] In 1st and 2nd Corinthians, he's the resurrection.
[time=2272] And our comfort.
[time=2273] In Galatians, Jesus is the key to freedom.
[time=2276] In Ephesians, the head of the church.

[time=2315] In Jude, he is God our Savior.
[time=2317] And in Revelation, he's the king of kings and the lord of lords.
[time=2321] Bow your heads and reflect on what that means for you.
[time=2332] Jesus is everything that you've been looking for.
[time=2337] How will you pursue him?
[time=2340] Connect with him through his word this week.
[time=2344] If you're in the room or if you're at home, you've been given some next steps, obviously, by God.
[time=2350] Ponder, what does God want you to do with this information?
[time=2353] If you're at home or in this room and you would say, "I just don't know that I've trusted in that Jesus." Wow, what a mouthful.
[time=2360] And that just barely scratches the surface of whom I Jesus is.
[time=2366] Maybe today it's time for you to trust in him for salvation.
[time=2369] You've been putting it off.
[time=2370] You've been saying, when I get this fried or get this squared, I would know.
[time=2372] It's time to trust Jesus now for salvation.
[time=2375] I'm not going to lead you in a prayer because the Holy Spirit is prompting it in your heart.
[time=2378] You're being carried out into his truth and into his love right now.
[time=2382] And that means you, Romans 10 and 9, remembering that anyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
[time=2389] That if you believe in your heart, that Jesus was raised from the dead, that he is Lord, confess it with your mouth, you will be saved, admitting that you need him to save you because you're not good enough to save yourself.
[time=2400] Jesus lived the sinless life you couldn't live.
[time=2402] To die that perfect death would be the perfect sacrifice through his blood that we could never be for ourselves.
[time=2408] And then he defeated death hell in the grave by rising from the dead and he is alive.
[time=2413] Will you trust in him?
[time=2415] He's not just revealing himself through his word today.
[time=2418] He's revealing himself in your heart.
[time=2420] Wherever you're at, will you call out to him?
[time=2422] Trust in him right now.
