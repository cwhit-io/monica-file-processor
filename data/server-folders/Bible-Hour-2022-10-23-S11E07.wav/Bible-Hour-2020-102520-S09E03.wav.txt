[time=0] And whether you're at home or in the room, I know that it's just a joy to worship Jesus together.
[time=5] And it's a joy to go on this journey of the Christian faith together.
[time=8] And it's still a joy to do so.
[time=10] Even in 2020, can I get an amen?
[time=13] We are so glad that you're with us.
[time=15] We're gonna continue this series that we're just calling Take the Journey with us.
[time=18] And there is a discipleship journey that's your discipleship journey.
[time=22] We wanna invite you into, you can go to takethejourneywithus.com.
[time=26] It'll take you to all of our websites and all of the information where really what you'll find is this spiritual roadmap with coaches and guides to come alongside you 'cause we believe in relationships to help you take your next step in your walk with Jesus.
[time=41] And we're doing through this as a series, looking at some of the core tenets of our faith, the things that are not only in the statement of faith that you'll find on our website and our foundational documents, but things, listen, things that in this divided season will remind us of the eternal truths that really matter.
[time=58] Last week I talked to you about the authority of scripture after we looked at discipleship and what it means to have this mission of making disciples.
[time=65] And I neglected to give some of you and some of our services.
[time=69] I know my roadmap for how I read the Bible, four things I do and I challenge you to do these this week if you didn't already last week, as we dig into today's topic as well, is read, reflect, rejoice, respond.
[time=82] Read, reflect, rejoice, respond.
[time=85] And that's what we're gonna do in today's message is we look at the deity of Christ.
[time=89] The deity of Christ is the fact that he has a divine nature, that Jesus is God, he's fully God and he's fully man.
[time=96] How does all of that work together?
[time=98] We're gonna read, we're gonna reflect, we're gonna rejoice over what we find.
[time=101] And then this week we're gonna respond in Jesus' name as God's church.
[time=105] If you're with me, say, "I'm in." Let's dig in together.
[time=108] I invite you to Colossians chapter one.
[time=109] Colossians chapter one cannot wait to share this passage of scripture with you from the apostle Paul on the deity of Christ.
[time=117] Looking at how he is God, this Jesus that we serve.
[time=121] And I wanna read to you our statement of faith straight from our foundational documents like we're doing each week.
[time=126] And so here's what we believe about Jesus.
[time=128] And there's a lot, but this gets us started.
[time=130] Let's dig in together.
[time=131] So we believe that Jesus Christ is the eternal God who entered humanity through the virgin birth and lived a sinless life.
[time=140] He died to pay the price for the sins of the world and rose from the dead to conquer death.
[time=147] We believe that in this place.
[time=149] We believe Jesus is who he says he is.
[time=151] And there is a dear friend of mine who as we talk about this series of taking the journey, taking your next step, being a disciple who makes disciples, just so happens to be his birthday.
[time=162] He was here earlier today, but he knows who he is if he catches this later.
[time=165] Sent me this great quote written by John Wimber in his writing on utter obedience.
[time=170] And I think it captures so well the heart behind why we're in this series.
[time=174] If you're new with us, you're coming at a great time.
[time=177] But listen to this, I think it captures well what God wants to do in us.
[time=180] The economy of the kingdom of God is quite simple.
[time=184] Every new step in the kingdom costs us everything that we've gained to date.
[time=190] Every new step may cost us all the reputation and security we have accumulated to that point, get this part.
[time=197] The disciple is always ready to take the next step.
[time=201] If there is anything that characterizes Christian maturity, it is the willingness to become a beginner again in Jesus Christ.
[time=211] It is the willingness to put our hand in his hand and say, I'm scared half to death, but I'll go with you, Lord.
[time=218] I'll risk everything to go with you.
[time=221] You're the pearl of great price.
[time=224] And that is exactly why we're doing this series that we could become a beginner again, that we could go back to the basics, back to the things that maybe you've heard many times before, but maybe just maybe you've forgotten and gotten distracted from by all the noise and all the distractions in the world around us.
[time=240] We wanna become a beginner again in Jesus because every day we walk with him is a sweet new journey where we get to take a next step and he's ready for you to take yours.
[time=250] Today, I wanna take you to Colossians.
[time=253] I talked to you last week about the authority of scripture and the Bible has a lot of different genres of writing, one of which is the epistles.
[time=259] It's the letters that were written to the churches and most of those were written by the Apostle Paul.
[time=265] The church of Colossae is where he's writing the book of Colossians that we'll read from in chapter one in a moment, but really what he's doing is what we're trying to do in this whole series.
[time=274] How many of you lately have had your car worked on?
[time=277] Where's your hand?
[time=278] All right, some of you need to get some work done.
[time=280] All right, so I don't know, waking you up.
[time=281] I've recently had an alignment done on mine.
[time=283] How many of you've done that recently?
[time=285] Mine was pulling to the left, and some of yours may have pulled to the right, and that's really what Paul is doing as a master mechanic in the gospel.
[time=293] He's writing to these churches, some of which are starting to veer to the left, some of which are starting to veer to the right.
[time=298] An example would be the church at Galatia.
[time=300] They're starting to veer towards legalism.
[time=303] We all tend to do the same things in churches that the churches in Paul's era did.
[time=308] We still do those same things today.
[time=309] They were veering towards legalism.
[time=311] They were saying, "Hey God, you made all these great rules.
[time=314] "Good start, but we're gonna add to 'em and make 'em better." And Paul was saying, "No, no, no, no.
[time=319] "Don't add to what God has done.
[time=321] "Jesus is enough.
[time=322] "Go back to Jesus." And then he wrote to the churches at Corinth, and they were veering off not towards legalism, but towards liberalism.
[time=330] And Paul was literally writing to them to say, "Stop getting drunk on the communion, "why you take communion and sleeping with family members." I figured it'd be quiet.
[time=339] You didn't know that was in the Bible, did you?
[time=340] It is, it's true.
[time=342] This is the kind of thing that's happening in churches.
[time=345] And Paul is saying, here's what he's saying.
[time=347] Let's get an alignment.
[time=348] Let's get an adjustment.
[time=350] Whether you're veering towards legalism or liberalism, I wanna get us back to true center.
[time=355] And you can write it down.
[time=356] This is Paul's mission.
[time=357] It's our mission through this series.
[time=358] It's to remind us to stay true north.
[time=361] And it is simply this.
[time=363] Write it down.
[time=364] It's all about Jesus.
[time=367] And I came to remind somebody today and encourage somebody today that it's all about Jesus.
[time=373] But maybe it's time for you to get an alignment in your spiritual journey.
[time=377] Maybe it's time for an adjustment to get back to true center and stop veering off to the left, to the right towards legalism or liberalism or whatever ism is grabbing you today.
[time=386] All churches need this constant alignment.
[time=388] And that's why we're doing this series.
[time=390] But Paul's writing, get this from prison to this newer church plant in Colossae.
[time=396] And he's writing from prison to give this same adjustment that we're talking about.
[time=401] But the first thing that he does is what we're gonna do today as we look at the deity of Christ.
[time=405] He wants to remind us of who Jesus is.
[time=408] And when I think of, so I'm just so excited today.
[time=411] I just love getting to preach.
[time=412] All I'm gonna do today is tell you about Jesus.
[time=415] It's my favorite thing to do.
[time=417] Jesus, did you know that there's been more books written about him, more songs sung about him than about any other figure in all of human history?
[time=425] Did you know that today he cares about you?
[time=429] Did you know that the same Jesus who spoke to Paul wants to speak to you?
[time=433] Billions of people are gonna worship him today and this week.
[time=437] And everyone has tried to kill him and shut down the name of Jesus for centuries, but he's still the name above every name.
[time=444] And his word is still the best-selling book that ever was, that ever is, that ever will be because it will not be blotted out because he is on the throne and he is still reigning as our eternal king today.
[time=459] Some of you came today just to be reminded of that thing as we look at the deity of Christ.
[time=463] Even our calendar, our holidays, AD, BC are all organized around the name and the history and the life of Jesus Christ.
[time=472] And Paul writes about him the same Jesus once asked, "Who do you say that I am?" And your answer to that question will determine your eternity, it will determine your destiny.
[time=484] And so today I wanna explore that question with you and Paul does the same thing in his letter to the churches in Colossae.
[time=491] And this is really one of the most densely packed, theologically rich passages of scripture and all the Bible.
[time=498] I can't wait to share it with you in Colossians chapter one.
[time=501] But you need to understand who it's written by and who it's written to.
[time=503] It's written by Paul from prison.
[time=506] But it's written by Paul who hated Christians.
[time=509] This is the same Paul who was killing Christians, trying to wipe Christianity in this following of Jesus the way as it was known.
[time=518] He was trying to wipe it off the history of the earth.
[time=521] He was trying to wipe it off the planet until he met Jesus.
[time=525] And now he's writing to churches that he planted from prison.
[time=529] Why is he in prison, you ask?
[time=530] I'm glad you ask.
[time=531] He's in prison because he won't shut up about this Jesus that he used to kill people to get rid of.
[time=536] That is the power of the name of Jesus.
[time=541] And today, last week I shared with you how Jesus is the theme of every book of the Bible.
[time=545] I emailed that out to you.
[time=546] Many of you asked for the list that I read over us last week.
[time=549] And I remind you today that he's still the theme and he is still in control.
[time=553] And Paul writes about him, this Paul that hated him, he fell in love with him and wrote about him too.
[time=559] So I wanna give you five things from Colossians one, 13 through 20 about Jesus and his nature and his divine nature.
[time=566] And number one is this, that Jesus is our savior.
[time=569] Jesus is our savior.
[time=570] Can I get an amen?
[time=572] I'm glad we have a savior and his name is Jesus.
[time=574] And we see that very clearly in the first couple of verses we'll read, Colossians one, verses 13 and 14.
[time=579] If you're ready for the word, say amen.
[time=582] Verse 13 of Colossians chapter number one.
[time=587] He Jesus has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved son in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
[time=597] God may you as our savior, pour your word into our hearts and souls as a seed that just sprouts into our life, God and takes over everything that we do this week that all we can do is see Jesus be consumed by Jesus and ultimately be Jesus in our lives.
[time=611] We pray it all in Jesus name, amen.
[time=614] Jesus is our savior.
[time=616] And in these verses we see the why that Jesus came to be our savior, to transfer us from one kingdom to the other, from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of light, from the kingdom of our sin to the kingdom of his salvation.
[time=628] And for the next two weeks as we look at the sinfulness of humanity and salvation by grace through faith we're gonna unpack this transfer of kingdoms for two weeks.
[time=636] So don't miss the upcoming weeks, but I gotta give you a sneak preview as we look at these verses today.
[time=641] And it starts with just the name of Jesus.
[time=644] Did you know what the name Jesus Christ even means?
[time=647] Jesus in its original form just means God is our savior.
[time=651] So by his name alone we see the deity, we see the divine nature, we see that he is God.
[time=656] Jesus means God is our savior.
[time=658] Christ is the chosen or anointed one of God.
[time=661] And so you see even in his name Jesus Christ he is God, but he's the one anointed of God to walk amongst us.
[time=667] So he is the word made flesh.
[time=669] He is fully God and he's fully man.
[time=672] And he came for one reason and it is to be our savior.
[time=676] This is the why behind the coming of Jesus.
[time=679] And how many of you love Christmas?
[time=681] A little quick poll, all right.
[time=682] Good, you guys are even more excited than the previous group.
[time=685] All right, so Christmas poll.
[time=687] How many of you have already started Christmas shopping?
[time=688] I gotta know, man.
[time=691] Is it even okay to say from the poll pit you guys just make me so mad?
[time=695] How do you plan that well, right?
[time=698] How many of you hadn't even thought about Christmas being just, I don't know what Sarah said earlier, like 60 something days away?
[time=704] Like, all right, yeah, all right, there's a lot of us, but I love Christmas and listen at Christmas we're gonna be going through the fulfillment of prophecy by the birth of Christ.
[time=712] I can't wait, we're gonna spend three weeks because I believe our world is just craving some truth.
[time=717] So we're gonna look at fulfilled, we're gonna look at how Jesus fulfilled prophecy.
[time=721] And to understand though, how Jesus is our savior to set the tone for these next couple of weeks, I gotta tell you this, that you can't appreciate Jesus as your savior.
[time=729] If you don't first remember how he was sent.
[time=732] And so Matthew chapter one, verse 18 talks about the birth of Jesus, we'll get a little Christmas sneak peek here.
[time=738] Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way, Matthew writes, when his mother Mary, here's the human part of his birth, had been betrothed to Joseph before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit.
[time=751] That's the divine part, Matthew one 18.
[time=754] Then Luke chapter two, verse 11, for unto you is born this day in the city of David, another fulfilled prophecy that we'll look at by the way, about the place and the lineage.
[time=764] A savior, a what?
[time=765] A savior, Jesus is our savior.
[time=768] Unto you is born this day in the city of David, a savior who is Christ the Lord.
[time=773] And I unpack John's writing about this in John chapter one, verse 14 last week, tells us the word became flesh, John one 14.
[time=779] The word became flesh and dwelt among us.
[time=782] And we have seen his glory, glory as of the only son from the Father full of grace and truth.
[time=790] We're gonna unpack this thought of Jesus being our savior, our sin, his salvation for two weeks, starting next week.
[time=796] But before he became our savior, we gotta understand what Paul writes about in verses 15 and 16, it's the second thing.
[time=803] Jesus is our savior, number two, Jesus is our source.
[time=806] Jesus is our source.
[time=808] What is he the source of?
[time=809] Glad you asked, let's read what Paul says in verses 15 and 16.
[time=814] Talking of Jesus, Paul says he is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation, for by him all things were created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities, all things.
[time=830] How many things say it with me?
[time=832] All things were created through him and for him.
[time=836] Jesus is our source.
[time=838] What is he the source of?
[time=840] Yes, Jesus is the source of everything, of creation, of life, of authority, of heaven, of earth.
[time=848] Before there was a savior sent to the earth, there was a savior who created the earth.
[time=853] Before the savior created the earth, there was a savior who was God and his name is Jesus, and I get this, I get that you like me, you're like me and my mind just can't grasp how Jesus was never born, he was never created.
[time=864] I just can't figure that out, to which I say me either.
[time=868] My mind's not big enough, and I remind you of what I told you last week, Deuteronomy 29-29.
[time=872] Tells us that the secret things belong to the Lord, but the things revealed belong to us and our sons forever.
[time=878] Means there are things that are way bigger than our little brains, sorry to offend you, can comprehend.
[time=883] There's secret things that we can't quite grasp, the things revealed are enough.
[time=886] That's all we need to know, and Jesus is the source of all those things.
[time=891] The first part of verse 15 tells us that he's the image of the invisible God.
[time=896] Has God ever felt invisible to you?
[time=898] All of us really should nod.
[time=900] There's the time, at least before you were spiritually reborn by knowing Jesus as your savior, but even since then, there are times where God just seems invisible, but Paul reminds us that Jesus is the image of the invisible God.
[time=912] The unseen goes to scene as soon as you meet Jesus.
[time=917] Jesus himself talked about that when he said to Philip, John chapter 14 and verse 9, Philip is talking to Jesus.
[time=924] Let's read it together.
[time=926] Jesus said to him to Philip, "Have I been with you so long and you still don't know me, Philip?
[time=930] I wonder how many times God may say that.
[time=932] Jesus may say that to me.
[time=933] Have I been with you so long, Kevin?
[time=935] You still don't know me?" He says that to Philip, and then he reminds us of how we can know God.
[time=940] Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.
[time=943] How can you say, show us the Father?
[time=946] When you see Jesus, you see the Father.
[time=949] Some of you may say, "Well, I haven't seen Jesus.
[time=951] Have you seen Jesus, pastor?" I have not seen him with my eyes, but I want to tell you today with my heart and with my life, I have seen Jesus in ways that far exceed what my eyes can comprehend or what my eyes could ever begin to do.
[time=963] And he wants to meet you in just such a way, and that same Jesus became flesh, and he was seen by eyewitnesses, and he did die a brutal death, and his body is not in a tomb, and I'm getting a little ahead of myself because that's at the end of the message, but I get excited to know that Jesus is alive.
[time=978] He is our source, and philosophy, and all the ossophies and isms of the world today try to comprehend God.
[time=985] But ultimately, and those things are good, but ultimately they come back to one word, really speculation.
[time=991] And so how do we go from speculation to something more serious?
[time=994] And it's by the word of God, and the word who was made flesh, the deity of Christ, the person of Jesus who walked and talked among us that we go from speculation to revelation.
[time=1005] God has revealed himself in the flesh through Jesus, and we have his word, and Jesus is his word.
[time=1011] We get all of the fullness of God through the word of God, and through the person who is Jesus Christ.
[time=1018] I'm so glad God loves me enough to show himself to me in that way.
[time=1022] Philippians chapter two, verses five through seven, I preached you at the end of the series where we talked about how to engage in politics, the P word today.
[time=1029] Have you noticed that still going on today?
[time=1031] And this is the answer is to look like Jesus.
[time=1034] And here's what we learn, and there's so much about the deity of Christ in that passage, Philippians two, five, three, seven.
[time=1039] Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but instead he emptied himself by taking the form of a servant or a slave being born in the likeness of men.
[time=1055] You see the human, you see the divine, that's who Jesus is, he is our source.
[time=1060] He is the image of the invisible God.
[time=1062] The Greek word for image is the word from which we get our English word icon, like a logo.
[time=1068] And so the logo of God, the icon of God, the image of God, the visible, tangible representation of God is Jesus.
[time=1077] We can look to him and see who God is.
[time=1080] And so everything you need to know about God is found in Jesus.
[time=1083] And then we see he's the first born of all creation in verse 15.
[time=1087] It's the image of the invisible guys, the first born of all creation.
[time=1090] And a lot of people have taken that to mean that, oh, see, there's proof that Jesus was born.
[time=1094] He was the first that was created, right?
[time=1097] You could read it that way, but that's not at all what the passage means.
[time=1100] It's not even what the words mean.
[time=1101] And we'll see that through the rest of the passages we go.
[time=1103] First born doesn't mean that he was born as a part of creation.
[time=1106] It means that he had first rank.
[time=1108] He was overall creation.
[time=1109] He is at the beginning of.
[time=1111] He was a part of it, was done through him.
[time=1113] He is supreme above creation.
[time=1116] And we'll see that further expounded upon as we go.
[time=1119] He's the first rank of creation.
[time=1121] He's not created, he's the creator.
[time=1124] He made us and he is the source of life itself.
[time=1127] And then verse 16 reminds us what he ranks first above.
[time=1130] And what's the answer?
[time=1131] Yep, everything.
[time=1133] You, me, all authorities, heaven, earth, spiritual, physical, you name it, seen and unseen.
[time=1140] All comes from him.
[time=1142] All belongs to him and all will give an account before him because he is in control.
[time=1148] He is our source.
[time=1151] He's our savior, he's our source.
[time=1152] Number three is he is our sustainer.
[time=1154] Here's where it's gonna get personal.
[time=1156] Verse 17, he is our sustainer.
[time=1158] This verse has ministered to me so many times in my life when things around me feel like they're broken.
[time=1163] Do you feel like things are broken in your life today?
[time=1166] Feel like you got some pieces you need to put back together?
[time=1168] Well, this verse is just for you today.
[time=1170] God wants to remind you of verse 17.
[time=1172] And he is before all things.
[time=1174] And in him, all things hold together.
[time=1178] Some versions will say in him, all things consist.
[time=1181] Jesus is the glue of eternity.
[time=1184] Jesus is the glue of your life.
[time=1187] He is the glue of the universe.
[time=1189] And he always has been.
[time=1190] He is eternal.
[time=1191] Verse 17, he's before all things.
[time=1194] This is one of the clearest scriptures that you'll find in all of the Bible about the deity of Jesus.
[time=1199] He's before all things.
[time=1200] That means he was physically, chronologically before them.
[time=1204] But that means in rank and supremacy, he is before all things.
[time=1208] I wanna give you another one from first Peter chapter one.
[time=1211] First Peter one, 20 and 21 says this.
[time=1214] He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was made manifest.
[time=1219] You see the deity of Jesus, divinity and then his humanity.
[time=1223] He was made manifest in the last times, why?
[time=1226] For the sake of you.
[time=1231] Who through him are believers in God who raised him from the dead and gave him glory so that your faith and hope are in God.
[time=1240] I'm so glad that he was foreknown before, that he's always been, that he always will be that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever.
[time=1248] But there are things in our world today that would remind us that in him all things hold together, he's got the whole world in his hands.
[time=1254] How many of you know that song?
[time=1255] He's got the whole world in his hands.
[time=1259] He's got the whole world.
[time=1261] I'll stop there but you get the rest.
[time=1262] Now you're gonna sing it all the rest of the day.
[time=1263] You're welcome.
[time=1265] He does have the whole world in his hands.
[time=1268] That's a great song and this verse proves it.
[time=1270] But there are things out there in the intellectual world that we live in today that would claim differently, that he doesn't really have the whole world in his hands.
[time=1277] There are things like deism that would claim that there is an intelligent creator, that God did create but basically God created and went, yeah, I'm kind of done with them.
[time=1286] I'm bored with them now.
[time=1287] I'm created them, I'm their boss.
[time=1289] I could do whatever I want but I kind of don't want to.
[time=1291] So, shoe.
[time=1292] It's kind of like kick you out of the nest, fly little birdies, don't really care if you die or not.
[time=1297] And that's the deistic viewpoint of the world that God created but he doesn't sustain.
[time=1302] But I came to tell you today and this passage reminds us today that Jesus as our savior is also our source but he's also our sustainer.
[time=1309] Jesus is our creator and he is our sustainer.
[time=1313] Jesus is the foundation of human life but he's also the formation that makes up the very substance of human life.
[time=1320] And he cares about human life.
[time=1322] And when you feel like your life is falling apart, if you look around right now and all you see is pieces, you maybe you see a sea of pieces and you drug a bag full of pieces with you to church today, Jesus doesn't just go, well, I created you, I gave you life, that's all I've got.
[time=1337] He says, I love you and I care about you.
[time=1340] And when your life is falling apart, I'll be here to hold you together.
[time=1344] In him, all things hold together.
[time=1347] Maybe you've got to marriage this falling apart, a relationship or a parenting.
[time=1351] And it just seems like it's in shambles.
[time=1353] You don't know with the uncertainty of a pandemic in this crazy world that we live in if you've got a job tomorrow so your career feels like it's falling apart.
[time=1360] Maybe your own life feels like it's falling apart.
[time=1362] Maybe you have helped this falling apart.
[time=1365] I challenge you today to put it into the hands of Jesus not just because he's capable, not just because he created you, but because he cares and he's ready to sustain you today.
[time=1377] Jesus loves you.
[time=1381] And I look around and I see people in the room who've fought cancer.
[time=1386] I know people are watching us online right now and you're at home because you're afraid to be out right now and we support your decision and that is some of your at home because you're recovering from surgeries.
[time=1395] I prayed with people over the last several weeks.
[time=1397] Mike's aren't over here.
[time=1398] I pray with people all the time are care pastor because so many people are hurting and maybe you're at home and you feel discouraged.
[time=1405] The most encouraging thing you can have wherever you may be physically, spiritually, emotionally or mentally is in the hands of Jesus.
[time=1414] You may say, well, that's a very pastoral, super spiritualized thing to say and it sounds good in theory but it doesn't feel like very good practically in my life.
[time=1422] I wish I could take away the pain but I can point you to the Jesus who holds the world in his hands.
[time=1426] The same Jesus who in John 1633 says, listen, these things I'm speaking to you so that in me, you can have peace.
[time=1433] In the world, you will have tribulation.
[time=1436] Means the pain's gonna happen but then he says this, but take heart, I have overcome the world.
[time=1443] Got the whole thing in my hands and those of you who are battling illnesses, whether they are physically or relationally or whatever it looks like.
[time=1451] I don't know when God will heal your ailment but I do know that he will.
[time=1458] It may not be in this life.
[time=1460] It probably won't be with your timing but in eternity, God's gonna make everything right and I can't wait for that date.
[time=1467] In the meantime, we can trust the one who holds the world in his hands.
[time=1471] He is our sustainer today.
[time=1474] So what this week do you need to place in the hands of your savior?
[time=1479] He's your savior, he's your source, he's your sustainer.
[time=1482] Fourthly, he is our supremacy.
[time=1484] Jesus is our supremacy, first place.
[time=1487] He is supreme above everything else.
[time=1490] Put simply, he's the boss.
[time=1493] He's in charge and that's the beginning of discipleship.
[time=1496] Let's read verses 18 and 19 where we see this spelled out for us by the writing of Paul.
[time=1501] And he is the head of the body, the church.
[time=1504] He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead.
[time=1507] It used to be creation, firstborn of creation, now it's firstborn of the dead, beginning and end, it's a beautiful picture.
[time=1512] Then in everything, that in what, say it with me, that in everything, he might be preeminent.
[time=1518] For in him, all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell.
[time=1523] Let's take that apart.
[time=1524] The beginning of verse 18, I find it interesting that the church is in this passage about Jesus.
[time=1529] I thought it was a passage about Jesus.
[time=1531] Well, it is, but he says he is the head of the body, the church.
[time=1534] And you often don't talk about Jesus without talking about his bride.
[time=1538] And the beautiful picture of marriage is seen in the relationship of Christ and his church.
[time=1542] And the church, if we've learned nothing else from pandemic 2020 hashtag, whatever it is these days, is that the church is not a building, it is a body.
[time=1552] It is not a facility, it is a family.
[time=1555] It is not this concrete construction, it's a community.
[time=1559] And you're watching us perhaps online as a part of that.
[time=1561] And though we long to be together in the room, we know that we're a body that's way bigger than a place.
[time=1567] And that's the body of Christ that makes us that way.
[time=1569] His bride.
[time=1570] Now, you can say a lot of things about me.
[time=1572] And sometimes people do.
[time=1573] I say mean things about me all the time.
[time=1575] But one of the things that will push me over the edge is if you start talking trash about my wife.
[time=1581] You don't wanna do that.
[time=1583] See the mean side of a pastor.
[time=1584] Like don't mess with my family.
[time=1585] And guys, am I right?
[time=1587] You talk about me, but don't talk about mama.
[time=1589] Mm-hmm.
[time=1590] But so many times I've noticed today that there's so many great things that have happened through the pandemic, really.
[time=1597] That God has done, that he could only do through a crazy season like this.
[time=1600] One of the things that the enemy has taken and twisted and used against the kingdom of God is a comparison culture.
[time=1607] You know, there's all the online church and we look at this church and that church and we start to compare.
[time=1612] And I've noticed that it's almost become trendy to have a critical spirit about the bride of Christ and to talk down about the bride of Christ.
[time=1619] And I wanna warn us today, church, that I don't wanna ever have any part of talking trash to the bride of Jesus Christ.
[time=1628] Because I have to answer to the bridegroom.
[time=1630] And that doesn't mean that there are things wrong.
[time=1632] Have you noticed that there are things wrong in the church?
[time=1634] Raise your hand if you notice that there are things that are wrong in the church.
[time=1637] If you're not raising your hand, you haven't been to church before.
[time=1639] Because you're looking at one of them right now.
[time=1641] We're all full of mess.
[time=1643] And things happen in churches that hurt our feelings, but listen, church, the best way you can be a part of what the bride of Christ is supposed to look like is to speak well of the bride of Christ, not just with your words and what you don't say.
[time=1655] That's a good start.
[time=1656] But speak well of the bride of Christ by living out unity in a world that's full of division, by being characterized by our love.
[time=1663] The world will know that we are his disciples if we love one another.
[time=1667] But if we're lapping each other's heads off and having critical spirits about everything in the world, then we're missing the point of being a disciple of Jesus.
[time=1675] And we're missing the opportunity to live out the love of God in a world that'll see Jesus for who he truly, truly is.
[time=1684] And a lot of times these things come from a consumer mindset where we live in a world where the customer's always right.
[time=1690] Have you noticed that?
[time=1692] Customer's always right.
[time=1693] I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I've got to be today.
[time=1696] The customer's not always right in God's church because it's not about the customer.
[time=1702] I hate to break it to us, but if you thought church was about you or me, it's not.
[time=1707] He is the head of the body, the church.
[time=1710] And a lot of times, if you've grown up in church like me, you've seen a lot of power struggles in church.
[time=1715] I've seen power struggles over everything from the brand of toilet paper used in the bathrooms to the color of pain on the walls to doctrinal things.
[time=1722] I've seen all kinds of stuff and never ceases to amaze me sometimes what the stuff that we get into.
[time=1729] But I came to remind us today that while we think and all those struggles came from what people perceive to be a power struggle, you know, my way, this way, that way, I came to remind us today as our lead under shepherd.
[time=1743] And I do say under shepherd.
[time=1744] I'm the lead shepherd that God has called to be a part of the leadership of this church.
[time=1748] There are so many people, it's not just me.
[time=1750] It ain't about me.
[time=1751] This church is not mine.
[time=1753] This church is not yours.
[time=1755] This church belongs to Jesus.
[time=1757] He is the chief shepherd.
[time=1758] And with Jesus, there is no nor will there ever be a power struggle in God's church because only one person holds the power and his name is Jesus Christ.
[time=1769] And how could I best put this for us?
[time=1771] Write it down this way that we cannot church.
[time=1773] We cannot allow consumerism to supplant Christ in his church.
[time=1786] in his church.
[time=1787] This is why I and we lead, not with a menu mentality.
[time=1790] I learned a long time ago, listen, if the source of life, the Savior and Son of God who is supreme could not please everybody during his time on earth, I learned a long time ago that nor will I and nor will you.
[time=1804] And that's why we don't lead with a menu mentality of trying to meet every person's need and fill every preference, but instead with a mission mentality of how can we mobilize people to be own mission to make disciples the way that Jesus has called us to make disciples.
[time=1819] Verse 18b reminds us, he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead.
[time=1824] I already lost my voice and now I'm getting to the shouting stuff here.
[time=1826] The firstborn from the dead is that in everything he may be preeminent.
[time=1831] Have you ever asked anybody where the body of Jesus is?
[time=1835] I'm guessing not because there's not really much of a question to ask.
[time=1837] If you do, they're gonna have to tell you I don't know.
[time=1840] Every other religion, this is one of the two key differentiating factors about Christianity.
[time=1844] There's two, number one is grace because you don't find that anywhere else.
[time=1848] It's all about works.
[time=1848] It's all about us being good enough.
[time=1850] Number two is the resurrection.
[time=1852] Jesus is the firstborn of creation we've learned, but now we see he's the firstborn of the dead.
[time=1856] That means he's first place.
[time=1858] He's first rank even over death.
[time=1860] He defeated it, why?
[time=1861] Because he rose from the dead.
[time=1864] He is alive.
[time=1865] I came to remind somebody today, Jesus is alive.
[time=1869] He is not in a tomb.
[time=1871] Every other religion will point you to a grave to commemorate somebody and their memory and their impact, but Jesus, his impact lives on not just as a memory, not through going to a tomb, but through a risen, safer.
[time=1884] He is alive today, he is firstborn over the dead.
[time=1888] And the reason, write this down, the reason that we can know he's supreme for his supremacy of Christ is his resurrection.
[time=1895] The reason for the supremacy of Christ is his resurrection.
[time=1899] I don't know about you, but anybody who can predict and tell us that he's going to die, that he's gonna live a sinless life, then die, do that, and then say, and then I'm gonna be raised from the dead in three days, and then he pulls it off and does it exactly in a way that fulfills all kinds, hundreds of scriptures and prophecies.
[time=1917] I would say he's the boss.
[time=1920] I don't know about you, but I haven't risen from the dead.
[time=1923] And I don't know anybody who can pull that off, but Jesus and Jesus alone, and it's for that reason.
[time=1928] That's the number one reason we worship him, and he is supreme.
[time=1931] First Corinthians 15 and verse 14, Paul says, "And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith is in vain, but it's not in vain because he has won the victory over death." And you know, I've noticed, a lot of times, especially if you're in church a long time, we'll say things like, you know, that's good, pastor, preach on, but I've heard that before.
[time=1954] Tell me something new.
[time=1956] You ever heard that?
[time=1957] Tell me something new, and I think it's C.S. Lewis that talks about how a lot of times we want new truths, but it's those old proven truths that we need the most.
[time=1964] And this is the same one.
[time=1965] So if you say, pastor, you talk about how Jesus has risen every Sunday, will you talk about something new?
[time=1972] Then I've got one word to answer you.
[time=1975] No, I will never do that because there's never gonna be a greater truth.
[time=1980] Jesus is alive, and because he lives, I can't just face tomorrow, I got eternal life today.
[time=1987] Because he lives, I have hope.
[time=1989] Because he lives in a world that's crumbling, all things can be held together by a God who has the whole world in his hands.
[time=1996] And he is supreme, give him some praise in this place today, if you believe it.
[time=2000] (congregation applauding) Verse 19, "For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell." How much of the fullness of God?
[time=2012] All of it.
[time=2012] That's the same word that's used to say all scripture is God breathed, that God desires that all sinners come to repentance.
[time=2018] It's the same word that means all throughout scripture.
[time=2020] It means every bit of who God is, is who Jesus is.
[time=2024] And the deity claim of Christ, that claim that he is God is what ultimately led him to be killed by humanity.
[time=2030] That's what led him to the cross.
[time=2032] That's why they killed him.
[time=2033] And today I've come to remind us, I've got to compass here.
[time=2037] I want to ask you, today Jesus is your true north.
[time=2040] And I want to point us back to true north.
[time=2042] Point where you think north is, by the way, right now.
[time=2043] Go ahead and just point where you think north is.
[time=2046] I've done this once before, and those of you who've been here, you know, some of you are getting all, you can't point up.
[time=2050] But yeah, most of you got it right.
[time=2052] North is that way, you go down to Neymar, you're going north, right?
[time=2055] But in this world, there's so many detours and distractions.
[time=2058] This is also a whistle.
[time=2059] And so today I came to blow the whistle and remind us today
[time=2066] to stay true north, to stop taking detours.
[time=2070] It's time for an alignment.
[time=2071] It's time for an adjustment.
[time=2072] I'll teach you to go to sleep in my sermon.
[time=2075] It's time for an alignment and an adjustment.
[time=2078] And it's time we go true north and focus on the deity and the person of Jesus, because maybe you've been distracted for a little while.
[time=2085] And it's time to refocus.
[time=2087] Number five is that Jesus is our sacrifice.
[time=2090] First 20, we see this, our last verse.
[time=2093] Jesus is our sacrifice.
[time=2094] First 20, Paul says, "And through him to reconcile to himself all things," and what does that mean?
[time=2101] It means everything that's wrong, everything that's broken, he's going to make it right.
[time=2105] He's in control of it all, and he's going to take back control of all those things that maybe you feel like he's lost control of.
[time=2111] He's still in control, and he'll make it all right.
[time=2114] All things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross.
[time=2121] The most important relationship you have that you need to make peace with today is your relationship with God, and it's only possible through Jesus.
[time=2129] We don't have peace with God or the peace of God due to our sin.
[time=2132] We're going to look at it next week.
[time=2133] Sin, many scholars would call is really something like a declaration of war against God.
[time=2139] But Jesus already won that war, and he overcame the sin that takes us under.
[time=2144] His name is Jesus.
[time=2145] And I want to remind you of a few verses that prove it to be so. Romans 5, 8, and 9.
[time=2149] But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
[time=2154] Since, therefore, we have now been justified.
[time=2157] How do you remember if you're justified, what did Jesus come to do?
[time=2159] Make it justified, never sinned.
[time=2161] You're justified by what?
[time=2162] You're justified by his blood.
[time=2164] Much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God.
[time=2168] First John chapter three and verse five.
[time=2171] It's one thing to know why he came, but was he really capable of doing it?
[time=2174] It's not just his virgin birth, his fully God, fully man state, but he had to do it without sin.
[time=2179] First John three, five.
[time=2181] You know that he appeared in order to take away sins, and in him, there is no sin.
[time=2185] Hebrews 4, 15, reminds us, we don't have a high priest who's unable to sympathize with us in our weakness.
[time=2190] Instead, no, he was tempted as we are yet without sin.
[time=2196] And then in second Corinthians chapter five, verse 21, I quote it to you often.
[time=2200] It's for our sake that God made him to be sin who knew no sin, why?
[time=2207] So we could become the righteousness of God.
[time=2211] Quick illustration of this this week that took place with my son.
[time=2213] He'll be 10 years old next month.
[time=2216] Just celebrated an eighth birthday yesterday.
[time=2218] The kids, those kids just don't stop growing, my goodness.
[time=2222] But my son Caleb, I've battled some pain in my throat this week.
[time=2227] And it made it kind of difficult to eat, made it difficult to speak, and you may have heard it some today, but so as we were sitting at the tables eating with the family, he saw that I was kind of struggling to swallow.
[time=2237] And he said, "Dad, I'm really sorry, you don't feel good." I said, "Thanks buddy, I appreciate that." But what he said next, I won't soon forget.
[time=2245] He said, "Dad, I really wish I could just take the pain for you." I'm serious.
[time=2254] I mean, and with the tears in my eyes, I looked at him and I said, "Son, I would never, ever, ever want you to take pain for me, but it means so much that you would say that." And as I read 2 Corinthians chapter five and verse 21, I'm reminded of what my God did.
[time=2270] Because here's the thing, I wouldn't let my son take pain for me, and I really love all of you, but I really wouldn't let him take pain for you either.
[time=2277] But my God, as his son looked at him and said, "Dad, I'll take the pain.
[time=2286] God, the Father, made him, God the Son, to be sin,
[time=2292] who knew no sin.
[time=2294] Why?" So that you could become the righteousness of God.
[time=2300] That's the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2303] That's the God that we serve.
[time=2304] We bow your heads today, close your eyes.
[time=2306] And what does it mean for you to have that kind of a father, that kind of a son, that kind of a love, that would say, "I'll take the pain.
[time=2316] I'll take their punishment." May we hold to him as our true north this week, where there are so many distractions.
[time=2323] May we look to the author and finisher of our faith, who is only Jesus Christ.
[time=2328] He's the only one who will remain the same today and forever, more.
[time=2332] Wherever you're at today, believers that are in the room, maybe there's a step you need to take to re-center, to find true north again, because you've gotten so distracted, and you've taken all these detours, it's time for an adjustment, it's time for an alignment.
[time=2344] Couple of things I'd take to do, read the scriptures this week on the sinfulness of humanity.
[time=2348] That'll remind you how much you need Jesus.
[time=2350] It'll prepare you for what we're doing next week.
[time=2351] But secondly, look for a way to shine the light of Jesus in your world this week.
[time=2356] What does that look like for you to do that?
[time=2358] Believers, as you're praying for that, some are hearing you would say, "I just don't know if I were to die today.
[time=2362] I just don't know that I've trusted in that Jesus, that you've talked about as my Lord and Savior.
[time=2366] I just don't know that I've truly surrendered my life to him, that I'm trusting in him more than I'm trusting in me, and I'm trusting in him and him alone for salvation.
[time=2376] I want to give you a chance to respond to that.
[time=2378] There's no special prayer that saves you.
[time=2380] It's asking in to save you, acknowledging that you're a sinner, and you need Jesus.
[time=2384] We're a mess, but Jesus lived the sinless life we couldn't live, to pay a price by dying on that cross by his blood.
[time=2391] There's peace and reconciliation.
[time=2392] We just read it by the blood of his cross, and then he rose from the dead.
[time=2397] He said, "I'll take that pain," and he did, and he won the victory.
[time=2402] And if you ask him to save you right now, he'll do just that.
[time=2405] Take a moment and ask him to save you.
