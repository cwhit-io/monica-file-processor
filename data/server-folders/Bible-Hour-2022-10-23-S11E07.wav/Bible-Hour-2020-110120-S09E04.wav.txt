[time=0] I wanna talk to you about the sinfulness of humanity.
[time=4] We've looked at our call to make disciples that make disciples the authority of scripture.
[time=8] Last week, the deity of Jesus, that he's fully God, but he's also a fully man.
[time=12] And this is why he became fully man, the sinfulness of humanity.
[time=16] And I thought I'd bring somebody on stage with me to be my illustration for this week's sermon.
[time=21] Then I realized I am all of the illustration that I will ever need for the sinfulness of humanity.
[time=26] And I gotta tell you though, that a part of today's message is to tell you that you are two.
[time=32] So look at your neighbor, let's just break that ice and say he said, you're the illustration.
[time=37] Go on and tell him that and then meet me in Ephesians chapter two.
[time=40] You're the illustration and that we are, and I'll be honest with you, I'll tell you one of the goals that I have of today is if you say, oh, I'm not really the illustration is that we would realize really quickly today that we all need a savior because he lives I can face tomorrow because I know he holds the future.
[time=58] And all of that is possible because he lives, because he came.
[time=62] And I'm gonna tell you if that truth was not a true truth, then today's message would leave you going home, going into whatever is next in your life, a very depressed and condemned person.
[time=74] But because he lives, what I'm gonna share with you today is overcome by the name of Jesus.
[time=79] The sinfulness of humanity, I'm gonna be in Ephesians chapter two, the first three verses today.
[time=84] So I wanna do two things over the course of this week and next week, next Sunday.
[time=88] Today I wanna answer the question on the sinfulness of humanity saved from what?
[time=94] Saved from what?
[time=95] And then next week we'll go into verses four through 10 of Ephesians two.
[time=100] So this is a little bit of a mini series within our series where we look at the sinfulness of humanity and then salvation by grace through faith.
[time=107] Next week I'll answer the question saved by what and for what?
[time=111] And so this week we'll start in verses one through three, then we'll go to verses four through 10.
[time=115] But let's start this week as we have done every week reading our statement of faith in all of our foundational documents about the sinfulness of humanity.
[time=122] We believe that although lovingly created by God in his image, all people sin and fall short of God's holy standard.
[time=131] Left to ourselves, and I'm so glad we're not.
[time=134] Left to ourselves, we are destined to eternal separation from God.
[time=139] We believe at Black Hawk that heaven is real, that hell is real and that the only way we can enter into the presence of God, overcoming this sinfulness that has trapped us is by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[time=152] I'm glad he made a way.
[time=154] And so let's dig into that together today.
[time=156] Today I'll talk to you about saved from what?
[time=160] And we'll be in Ephesians chapter two, verses one through three.
[time=163] And I'm gonna give you a lot of extra verses.
[time=166] And so if your note takers, I might point you to our app or to our sermon notes on the website.
[time=171] We've got all of those verses listed.
[time=173] I'm gonna give you a lot of them as we go word for word, straight through, verses one through three of Ephesians two.
[time=178] So what are we saved from?
[time=181] Why do we need to be rescued?
[time=183] What are we rescued for?
[time=184] Why are we rescued?
[time=185] What do we need to be rescued from?
[time=187] I can't take you to Ephesians without first telling you the beginning of the story.
[time=191] Genesis chapter one, verses 26 and 27 shows how we were created.
[time=196] And so Genesis chapter one, starting in verse 26, we say, then God said, let us make man in our image after our likeness.
[time=204] And we'll be in week six, after next week, looking at the Trinity, the nature of God.
[time=209] And you see, this is a very clear picture of the father, son and Holy Spirit, even from the beginning.
[time=214] But that's a whole other sermon.
[time=215] He says, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, verse 27.
[time=226] So God created man in his own image.
[time=229] In the image of God, he created him, male and female.
[time=233] He created them.
[time=235] Then go to verse 31 of Genesis one.
[time=237] And we'll see what God saw.
[time=239] And God saw everything that he had made.
[time=241] And behold, it was very good.
[time=244] And there was evening and there was morning the sixth day.
[time=246] So what we're looking at is we say a perfect creation in which there's no sin.
[time=251] There is no sickness.
[time=252] There is no suffering.
[time=254] There is no disease.
[time=255] There is no decay.
[time=258] There is no problems.
[time=260] But then comes Genesis chapter three.
[time=262] And if you want to do a deep dive into how it started, read the first three chapters of the first book of your Bible in Genesis.
[time=268] And you'll find that God's perfect creation was marred by sin.
[time=273] Sin entered the world through one man, Adam, that we will break apart in a few moments.
[time=277] But Genesis three, here's what happened ultimately.
[time=279] You can write it down this way.
[time=280] Sin infects and affects everything.
[time=285] And today my friends, the bad news that we have to begin with to get to the good news is that sin infects and affects everything yet still today.
[time=294] Can I get an amen if you believe it?
[time=296] If you needed a reminder, I would just say today, just watch the news.
[time=301] Just look on social media.
[time=302] Look around you and we're reminded of how infected and affected we are by the sinfulness of humanity.
[time=309] And we are walking illustrations of that.
[time=312] So I take you now to Ephesians chapter two, and we'll read the first three verses, and I'll give you today seven things, seven things that we are saved from, from these three verses.
[time=323] So are you ready for the word today, Black Hawk?
[time=326] Let's read Ephesians chapter two, verses one through three.
[time=330] And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience, verse three.
[time=346] Among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature, children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.
[time=361] And God, as we read those words, God, their heavy words and their condemning words, but we thank you that verse four continues.
[time=368] And today as we dig into verses one through three, I pray your word would just be a light to our path.
[time=373] I pray that your word would be a seed in the reading and studying of it today would be something that becomes a seed that grows fruit in our life this week.
[time=381] Let us be hearers, of course, but not only hearers, but also doers of your word today, in Jesus' name.
[time=387] And everybody said, seven things you're saved from today.
[time=391] Number one comes from the first part of verse one where we see, and you were dead, and it is death.
[time=397] Write that down.
[time=397] We're saved from death, and you were dead in thee, and we'll stop there.
[time=402] The first part simply stated, and you were, shows us that Paul is writing to Christians who used to be captured, who used to be consumed, who used to be doomed by these things, but now you have believers who are following Jesus because Jesus came, it's a past tense.
[time=421] And aren't you glad that Paul could write it in a past tense, and you were dead.
[time=426] You were dead, and so believers in the room, I wanna tell you this, if you're a follower of Jesus today, my prayer for you is that you would remember what you're saved from.
[time=435] If you're here today and you're skeptical, and I want you to know, if you're watching today and somebody forced you to come, or somebody force fed you this link, and you're clicking it and watching it now, and you're skeptical, you wonder, can I really believe that Jesus is who he says he is?
[time=448] Is all this stuff really true?
[time=449] And you would say, I'm not a believer, I'm not a follower of Jesus.
[time=452] I believe God sent you here for a reason, and my challenge and my prayer for you is while we all remember what we're saved from, that you and we could all come together and realize what we're saved from.
[time=463] That's my prayer for you as we dig into this, because if we don't recognize the bad news, we don't see that we need to be saved from something, then what are we saved for?
[time=473] Then what is it that even saves us?
[time=474] We won't even look to it.
[time=475] So that's what we'll dig into with these three verses, but it starts with dead.
[time=479] And the word dead here is important to know that it is sin that leads to death.
[time=484] James writes about this in the New Testament in James chapter one, verses 14 through 15, where he says, but each person is tempted when he is lured.
[time=494] You ever felt lured and enticed?
[time=496] When he is lured and enticed by his own desire, then desire, when it has conceived, gives birth to sin.
[time=504] And here's the part I want you to see.
[time=505] And sin, when it is fully grown, brings forth death.
[time=509] It is sin that leads to death.
[time=511] There was no death on the earth until sin entered the picture.
[time=516] And when we sin against our loving creator who created us in the very image of God, into this perfect creation, here's what we do.
[time=523] We really unplug from our source of life.
[time=527] To illustrate this, I brought my trusty phone.
[time=530] I happen to have an apple.
[time=531] Maybe you got an android and you'll get saved one day, but I'm just kidding, it's just a phone.
[time=536] They're just tools and may they not consume us.
[time=538] And you talk about sinfulness of humanity, boy, we could talk about how the enemy uses technology.
[time=543] Couldn't we, that's a whole other message, but it's a good tool for us as well.
[time=546] We use it right now.
[time=547] I mean, if you're listening right now because of the great tool that technology is, but I hold in my hand my phone and here's the reality.
[time=555] It works because I plugged it in and I plugged it into a power source.
[time=559] But the truth is that by design, battery life's a big deal, right?
[time=564] And so that's why we pick phones.
[time=565] One of the things we look for is how long does it last?
[time=567] After I unplug it, how long will it last?
[time=570] And the same is true of us spiritually that is true of this phone physically because the reality is this phone, look, it comes on.
[time=578] It will last for a while, but eventually, and it started with life that came from being plugged in, but then I unplugged the phone and it is gonna last for a while.
[time=588] But if it doesn't get plugged in and stay connected to the source of power, it's ultimately going to die, true or false?
[time=595] True.
[time=596] And the same thing is true of us in our own life, just like this phone, we were given life and many of us because this phone, as it is disconnected right now from its power source, we think that, hey, I'm doing fine, I'm living and I'm breathing, but the same thing is true, this phone can be true of us physically and spiritually, that physically we can have life, but one day we're gonna run out of juice.
[time=618] We're gonna run out of battery.
[time=620] And in that time, if we are not connected to the right source of power and of life, we will spiritually be dead.
[time=628] And today my friends, many people walk around thinking they have life because physically I have breath in my lungs, but we're walking dead people when we're not connected to the true source of life that is none other than Jesus and Jesus alone.
[time=643] He is before all things.
[time=644] And in him, all things hold together.
[time=647] Nothing that was created was created without him.
[time=650] He is the source of everything.
[time=652] So today my friends, I ask you what source are you plugging into?
[time=657] Sometimes I fear that many people think they have true life, but really you're like a phone that's walking around with physical life, but spiritual life, you're walking around spiritually dead.
[time=668] So what are you plugging into in your life?
[time=671] And religion, and so many times we're so bad about this as Christians and as the church, we will plug into religion.
[time=678] And religion is like giving CPR endlessly to a corpse.
[time=682] It's dead and it's lifeless and we're giving CPR to it.
[time=686] That's what religion works based faith where you think, get this, what's works based religion, pastor?
[time=691] What is religion?
[time=692] What do you mean by that?
[time=693] I'm glad you asked.
[time=694] It's when we think we have any part in it at all.
[time=697] When it's Jesus plus anything, that's religion.
[time=700] And that's us trying to plug into a source that makes us feel like we're alive for a little while, but the battery's going to run dead and we will be spiritually dead without plugging into relationship that only comes from Jesus.
[time=713] Where religion is like breathing life endlessly into a corpse, Jesus is the giver of life.
[time=718] He's the creator and sustainer of life.
[time=721] So may we plug into him.
[time=724] That is where all of this starts.
[time=726] So I'm spending a lot of time on dead that we're saved from being dead because that is where it all starts.
[time=731] And I wanna show you in the word dead, by the way, in the Greek, it literally means it's used some 128 times in the New Testament.
[time=739] It's very frequently used and every time it's used to mean, you ready for this?
[time=742] It's pretty deep, dead.
[time=744] Lifeless, it means corpse.
[time=747] It means there's nothing there.
[time=749] There's zero life there.
[time=752] And so that's what we're trying to breathe into.
[time=754] So what are you plugging into?
[time=755] I wanna show you this progression.
[time=757] As we train leaders here at Black Hawk Life Group leaders, we always talk about the physical stages of growth and then that leads us into the spiritual stages of growth because they really overlap.
[time=766] But look at this picture, it all starts with death.
[time=768] Before you were born, you were not alive.
[time=770] Is that a true statement?
[time=772] Okay, I'm gonna say it again just to make sure you wait.
[time=773] Before you were born, you were not alive, right?
[time=776] Okay, now you're alive.
[time=777] And so you go from not being created, not being alive, and you're created by God.
[time=782] You're formed in your mother's womb before you were even born, God knew you.
[time=786] But before that, you weren't here.
[time=788] And then you enter into infancy.
[time=790] We go from not having life to being born.
[time=792] Spiritually speaking, we're born again.
[time=794] Spiritually speaking, we go from what Paul's writing about in verse one, to being a new creation born again as Jesus talked to Nicodemus about in John three.
[time=802] And we go into infancy and little infants, what do we know about infants?
[time=806] Physically speaking, they take over life.
[time=809] Can I get a name in?
[time=810] And if they aren't fed and if they aren't happy, everybody in the house is gonna know about it.
[time=815] And the same thing is true of a spiritually.
[time=818] Spiritual infants are the same way.
[time=820] It's all about me.
[time=821] Feed me, clean me up, you know, make sure that I have everything I need.
[time=826] It's all about me.
[time=826] And then we grow from an infant to a child.
[time=829] We go from dead with no life to life as an infant and then to a child.
[time=832] And it's still pretty much about me as a child.
[time=835] I've got an almost three year old still in my house and you know, it's still about her.
[time=840] She's still a child and she still says feed me.
[time=843] And if she's not happy, we're gonna know about that.
[time=845] But there's a difference though from an infant.
[time=846] She's not rolling around when I happen to roll her over and change her as much.
[time=851] Well, actually that still happens.
[time=852] Potty training is kind of a bear too, right?
[time=854] But she's walking now and she's running.
[time=856] So she's starting to understand what it's like to be a little bit more independent as a child, physically speaking.
[time=862] Spiritually the same thing happens to us when we run into Jesus.
[time=865] We start to walk and we start to do more things on our own and then we become a young adult.
[time=870] And young adult and we graduate.
[time=872] And we, at that point we start to go, hmm, what am I gonna do with my life?
[time=876] I think there's more purpose to my life than just childhood and infancy, certainly than death.
[time=881] And we start to realize, hey, life's not all about me.
[time=884] I've thought it was, but it's really not all about me.
[time=886] What can I do for others?
[time=887] And then eventually we become parents.
[time=890] And this is the ultimate goal of spiritual life, not necessarily in the physical life.
[time=895] Some of you say, I don't think I wanna do that.
[time=896] I've heard all the horror stories.
[time=898] It's a beautiful thing.
[time=899] It really is.
[time=900] Nothing more rewarding or fulfilling than being a parent.
[time=903] And nothing much more challenging either.
[time=904] Can I get an amen parents and grandparents in the room?
[time=908] But the goal of spiritual life is that we will become parents.
[time=910] One of the most treasured times in my life has been, and in this room are a few that I've had the privilege of walking just such a journey of when I've had any role, and let me remind you, I didn't have much of a role.
[time=921] I was just a big mouth that God chose to use.
[time=924] I was just a sinful wretch that God saved and used in the lives of other people.
[time=929] So any impact I've had in anybody's life is all because of Jesus, but my favorite moments have been when that impact happens.
[time=936] And I get to be a part of leading somebody to Jesus, and then they get to lead somebody else to Jesus.
[time=941] I've baptized fathers who've now baptized sons who are in the room who are sharing with other people.
[time=946] It's just a beautiful thing, and you start to realize what spiritual parenthood is like.
[time=950] And then you become a spiritual grandparent as the person that you led to Jesus, leads somebody to Jesus, and they baptize them.
[time=956] And then they lead somebody to Jesus, and their lives trickle out and ripple out and affect the lives of others.
[time=961] And you become a spiritual grandparent and great grandparent and so on and so forth.
[time=966] But look at this whole progression.
[time=970] What does it start with?
[time=971] You can speak in that black hawk, it's okay.
[time=975] What does it start with?
[time=977] Death, you've got to start by realizing you are dead and your trespasses and sins.
[time=983] And without Jesus, the rest of the process does not happen.
[time=987] Physically, you wouldn't be here.
[time=989] Can I tell you today, if you didn't think you needed God, you wouldn't have breath in your lungs without Him physically today.
[time=994] But even more, even more importantly, even more crucial in your life, is that spiritually you would have no hope at life at all, except through Jesus.
[time=1001] Yet He loves you.
[time=1004] And I'm so glad of that.
[time=1004] Jesus saves us from death.
[time=1006] It's number one.
[time=1008] Number two, you guys listen faster and I'll go quicker on the other ones.
[time=1011] This is the foundation.
[time=1012] Number two is sin.
[time=1013] All right, that down.
[time=1014] Paul continues, and you are dead in the, and then he says, "Tress passes and sins." So you're saved from sin.
[time=1021] And this is the deeds, thoughts, words, motives, actions.
[time=1024] We are all sinners.
[time=1026] Look at your neighbor and say, He's talking about you.
[time=1028] Some of you've been waiting for that opportunity.
[time=1031] And the preacher gave you a chance to tell somebody that they're a sinner.
[time=1035] You are.
[time=1036] And this includes the commission of sins, things that we do that go contrary to the word of God and the law of the Lord that is perfect and the sins of omission that we don't do the things that we're supposed to do, that God's word commands in our life.
[time=1050] By now, are you convinced that you're a sinner?
[time=1051] Not if you are.
[time=1053] Because I don't think any of us can do that the way that God prescribes, except for Jesus.
[time=1057] And that's why we spent last week looking at the deity of Christ, the virgin birth and the sinless savior that walked and talked with us, yet did it all without sin.
[time=1066] Only Jesus could accomplish this in our life.
[time=1069] And trespassing, he says, "Tress passes and sins." So if you have property, you have property lines.
[time=1074] And many of you have signs on your property that say, "No trespassing." If someone trespasses, that means there's a line there and somebody steps across that line.
[time=1082] It's a violation.
[time=1083] And the line, spiritually speaking, is the word of God.
[time=1086] It's the perfect law of God that we cannot help but cross the line.
[time=1092] Have you crossed the line?
[time=1092] Raise your hand if you've crossed the line.
[time=1094] Those of you who didn't raise your hand yet, you'll be convinced by the end of the sermon.
[time=1097] I'm just getting started.
[time=1098] We've crossed the line.
[time=1099] We are sinners.
[time=1100] We are broken.
[time=1102] We are messy people who need a savior because without Jesus, we're destined for death and to live a life of sin and trespasses.
[time=1111] Romans three, verses 21 through 24, captures this well.
[time=1115] And notice that the sinfulness is sandwiched in the grace and the mercy of God as I read this passage.
[time=1120] Romans three, starting in verse 21.
[time=1122] But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the law and prophets bear witness to it, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe.
[time=1134] For there's no distinction, why?
[time=1135] What makes it level, the playing field, verse 23, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God and are justified by his grace as a gift through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.
[time=1149] And before I'm meant to read to you, Romans five, 12, that tells you therefore just as through one man, that's Adam's sin entered the world and death through sin and thus death spread to all men by because all sinned.
[time=1163] So who's in that boat?
[time=1164] All of us and all of us are on the level playing field that the ground is the same at the foot of the cross.
[time=1171] We all need Jesus.
[time=1174] And as we read this, here's what I know about sin that for all of us, we're naturally kind of inwardly focused and it's a lot easier for us to see their sin than my sin.
[time=1186] True or no?
[time=1187] It's really, if I were to ask you, hey, make a list for me of all of the offenses done to you, you would probably run out of paper.
[time=1199] But if I said to you, make a list of all the offenses done by you, for some of us, we would say, I don't think I need the pen.
[time=1205] Because it's real easy and listen, this is what leads to pharisaical, hypocritical church-driven and yes, I say church-driven, religion-driven in the church.
[time=1217] It's not God's intent for the church.
[time=1218] It leads to critical spirits and it leads to us not seeing in our own eye this log that is slapping people upside the head because we are focused on the speck and our brother and sisters, I, and listen church, please hear me.
[time=1231] When it comes to the sinfulness, it is a detriment to the kingdom of God.
[time=1236] It is a detriment and it destroys God's work that he wants to do through his church when we have that kind of a spirit where we're quick to point out the faults of others without first looking at ourselves.
[time=1247] God wants his church to be a place characterized by grace.
[time=1251] And if we are not a church and not a people, not a body that is characterized by the grace of God by which we are saved and listen church, we are not a church that characterizes Christ in the world.
[time=1263] But may we be a place that's characterized by grace,
[time=1269] why pastor, because you need it and I need it.
[time=1274] And when we realize how much we need grace, we become givers of that very grace by which we are saved.
[time=1280] But may we never become hypocritical, pharisaical, self-righteous in thinking we don't need that grace and instead pointing out all the things in the lives of others.
[time=1291] It's easy to see theirs, but may we see ours and as part of what we're digging into today.
[time=1295] Number three is our past.
[time=1297] Paul says, and you were dead in the trespasses and sins.
[time=1300] Death sin, our past is number three, where Paul says, in which you once walked, in which you once walked.
[time=1307] I believe one of the greatest tools the enemy is still using today, the lies that he's convincing you of have to do with your past.
[time=1316] We all have skeletons in our closet and look at me for a minute.
[time=1320] God knows about every skeleton in your closet.
[time=1323] It's like we live this life thinking, well, God doesn't know and I'm even gonna kind of keep it, no, he knows.
[time=1328] He is well aware and yet he loves you.
[time=1331] He's never given up on you and he knows everything about you really that you don't even know about yourself.
[time=1335] Do you think you remember every sin you've ever committed?
[time=1338] Well, he does, he knows, but not according to scripture because what happened with Jesus and the blood of Christ?
[time=1343] He remembers those things no more.
[time=1345] It's far as the east is from the west.
[time=1347] So far are our sins from the memory of God.
[time=1350] When God looks at us as followers of Jesus, he sees the perfect pure blood of Jesus.
[time=1356] He knew you yet he loved you.
[time=1358] While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[time=1361] Write it down this way.
[time=1362] Some of you came to be liberated, set free from your past today.
[time=1365] As believers, our past refines us, but it no longer defines us.
[time=1370] I'm not defined by what was.
[time=1372] I'm defined by Jesus Christ and what he's doing in me now.
[time=1375] It refines me.
[time=1376] I remember it, but boy, I'm not defined by it anymore.
[time=1379] And some of you need to stop walking around condemned because in Christ there is no condemnation.
[time=1384] Why?
[time=1385] Because Jesus sets you free even from your past.
[time=1389] And as the enemy throws up your past in your face, I think the best defense against the enemy.
[time=1393] We're gonna talk about him in just a moment.
[time=1395] Is for us, as he reminds us of our past, we remind him of his future.
[time=1399] If you read the end, I remind you this all the time.
[time=1403] Because you need to remember the end.
[time=1405] You need to remember his future.
[time=1409] Right now he's ruling and reigning.
[time=1410] I'm getting ahead because Paul goes there next.
[time=1412] But as he rules and reigns, it's easy for us to feel like we're condemned and we don't have a victory.
[time=1417] But I've read the end and I know the future of myself and of you and of God's church and of Jesus ruling and reigning, even when it feels like he's not on the throne.
[time=1427] As day of 43, God reminds us, don't remember the former things.
[time=1431] I'm gonna do a new thing.
[time=1433] God's ready to do that in your life.
[time=1435] Number four is our world's pattern.
[time=1438] Paul continues and says following the course of this world.
[time=1441] The Bible uses the word world in at least seven different senses or ways.
[time=1446] And in this sense, the word world, it's talking of this worldliness that opposes and clashes with the kingdom of God.
[time=1455] It's something that goes completely against God's standards.
[time=1458] Something goes completely against God's perspective.
[time=1461] First Corinthians chapter one and verse 21 in the new international version says, "The world through its wisdom did not know him." And that is what is true of our world.
[time=1471] Have you noticed that there's a pattern in this world and it doesn't typically, the course doesn't typically take you to the foot of the cross?
[time=1478] And I would say that the pattern of the world's kind of like the current of a river.
[time=1481] If you notice in a river, anything that's in that river is gonna flow almost everything with the current, with the direction, with that force that is the direction of the river.
[time=1490] But have you noticed that being a Christian and following Jesus is a lot like swimming upstream in a river?
[time=1496] And I'm gonna tell you why.
[time=1497] It's because we're not called to follow the pattern of this world and we've been set free from and we've been saved from the world's course, the pattern of the world.
[time=1507] And that's why, listen, that dynamic, that it feels like swimming upstream, not if you feel like you're swimming upstream today.
[time=1512] I do, in so many ways.
[time=1514] This is why so many people give up on marriages.
[time=1522] This is why so many people give up on a career that you were called to or the calling.
[time=1526] This is why so many pastors are leaving the ministry either through sin or pure exhaustion.
[time=1531] I get it, I live it.
[time=1532] It feels like swimming upstream.
[time=1534] And if you do it in your own strength, you'll get swallowed up by the current.
[time=1537] And somebody today, I'm speaking straight to your heart.
[time=1540] You're about to quit on something that God doesn't want you to give up on yet.
[time=1544] So I say to you today, don't give up.
[time=1548] God has set you free from and God has saved you for what he's called you to.
[time=1552] And God doesn't equip you because you're called, but God calls you whenever he will equip you.
[time=1557] God equips you whenever you're called.
[time=1559] He doesn't call you because you're already equipped.
[time=1562] Did you know that?
[time=1563] He didn't call you because you're good enough.
[time=1565] He's gonna equip you, make you good enough to do whatever he's called you to.
[time=1568] So don't quit, don't give up, don't follow, don't give in to the current, the pattern of the world.
[time=1574] Remember Romans chapter 12 and verse two, that reminds us, do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, the renewing of your mind.
[time=1586] Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is, his good, pleasing and perfect will.
[time=1593] Then you'll be able to do that.
[time=1594] After what, after your mind is renewed, you have the mind of Christ today.
[time=1598] He's given it to you.
[time=1599] Why?
[time=1600] Because he has set you free from the pattern of the world.
[time=1603] The majority of things go with the course of the world, but the majority doesn't determine the morality.
[time=1609] The majority doesn't determine what's right and what's wrong.
[time=1613] God has, God did, and God does.
[time=1616] And when we follow him, it will be like swimming upstream, but when we follow his patterns, his rules, as we read the word of God, he's like a parent.
[time=1623] How many of you have rules for your kids that aren't always that fun to enforce?
[time=1627] Well, God's given us directives and rules that we can follow, why?
[time=1630] Because he loves us.
[time=1632] When my son plays sports, we have three things we say every time he goes.
[time=1636] Maybe you've got a list that's even better than mine.
[time=1638] You can email it to me and I'll probably use yours.
[time=1640] But here's the one that we'll say.
[time=1641] I'll say, Caleb, he's playing basketball right now.
[time=1644] And I'll say, what's our three rules?
[time=1646] And they are to love and respect everyone, do your best, and have fun.
[time=1649] We say it every time, and sometimes it's kind of like this.
[time=1652] Caleb, what are we gonna do today?
[time=1653] Are you know, Dad?
[time=1654] You know, it's like, what are we gonna do today, Caleb?
[time=1658] We're gonna love and respect everyone, do our best, and have fun, right?
[time=1662] And aren't we that way as believers sometimes?
[time=1664] But there are so many times that that's fulfilling where he'll come out and we'll say, "Hey, what do we do?" And he'll say, "I respected my coach," and maybe that friend of mine was being a knucklehead, but I chose to love him and respect him anyway.
[time=1676] Did you do your best?
[time=1677] Yeah, I felt like quitting, but I just did my best anyway.
[time=1680] And what did that do?
[time=1681] I had a good time, it was fun.
[time=1683] And that's good rules for us as Christians.
[time=1685] And listen, a little tangent, a little side tangent.
[time=1687] I'll make it real fast.
[time=1688] Christianity, following Jesus, it should be fun.
[time=1693] So many times today, we sit in church and we're so stoic and we're so focused on whatever it may be that we miss the joy of following Jesus.
[time=1704] Sometimes as believers, can I just be honest, I'm sorry to offend us, no offense, but offense, right?
[time=1709] As I share this, but sometimes we need to tell our face what we know in our heart.
[time=1715] Sometimes we need to let the joy of the Lord show and how we interact at the grocery store, or better yet, even when we interact at church.
[time=1723] And it's okay to not come with your church smile on, but it's never okay to miss the joy that comes from knowing Jesus.
[time=1731] Less love and respect everybody.
[time=1733] Give our best doing everything that we do as unto the Lord and less have fun because the joy of the Lord is our strength.
[time=1741] God sets us free from death.
[time=1744] He sets us free from sin.
[time=1745] He sets us free from this world's crazy pattern.
[time=1749] He sets us free from our past.
[time=1750] Number five, number five is our enemy.
[time=1753] Paul continues following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience.
[time=1760] Sin, many theologians and scholars would say it this way, that sin is really a declaration of war against God.
[time=1766] And that's why it's so important that Jesus won the victory over sin.
[time=1772] And we believe that heaven is real, we believe that hell is real, we believe that Satan is real, we believe that his demons are real.
[time=1778] There are God's people, there are Satan's people.
[time=1781] We believe that Satan was an angel created by God.
[time=1784] And this angel decided that he wanted to oppose God.
[time=1787] He wanted to be as big and as strong and as powerful as God.
[time=1791] And he led this rebellion against God.
[time=1793] And boy, doesn't it feel like he's leading it well and winning in this world?
[time=1797] Well, the Bible tells us that that's gonna be the case.
[time=1800] He's the ruler of the prince of the air.
[time=1802] And that's why in a political season, have you heard there's an election coming up?
[time=1805] Just in case you haven't, there is.
[time=1806] But in this season, it's important for us to be reminded that every earthly office, every political system, and even, listen, all of those things are nowhere near as powerful as what Paul is writing about.
[time=1818] The ruler of the prince of the air, this influencing all these sons of disobedience and all the terrible things in our world, he's more powerful than all of these other temporary systems.
[time=1827] But be reminded today that Satan, his army, his demons, every political system, every government, every earthly throne, it will one day fade away.
[time=1838] But what will never go away is the fact that Jesus is the king of kings and the lord of lords.
[time=1845] He has won the victory and it's even over an enemy when it feels like he's winning all around you.
[time=1851] Go ahead, give it up for Jesus if you believe that in this place.
[time=1854] Even when he feels like he's winning, God's on the throne, we have a victory over our enemy.
[time=1860] And some of you have to say it's become almost trendy and popular to get interested in and invest in what you could call a cultic activity, things like witchcraft and sorcery and all the different things that are like that.
[time=1873] It is interesting because in a world like this, we're intrigued by the supernatural.
[time=1877] And sometimes our being intrigued by the supernatural leads us down these paths and I wanna remind you, if you go down those paths on your own without the strength of Jesus, you're gonna be overtaken and consumed by the ruler of the prince of the power of the heir in this world.
[time=1891] And he's going to win, we're no match for him.
[time=1894] And if you know Jesus, why would we dabble in those things that are already overcome?
[time=1899] Why wouldn't we just focus on the name of Jesus, the name of above every name, the name at which every knee's going to bow and every tongue is going to confess and my challenge to you is focus on Jesus with all that you've got, even when there are things in the world that seem like they're overcoming.
[time=1915] God has won the victory and we're saved from our enemy.
[time=1918] Number six, from our old desires.
[time=1920] Paul continues, among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind.
[time=1928] I wanna remind you today that you're in a war.
[time=1930] This war is between your flesh and the fruit of the spirit, your sin and the spirit of God and the salvation of God.
[time=1938] Have you noticed that they bump heads?
[time=1940] Every day when I look in the mirror, I realize this because I think in my mind and I realize the things that I have thought or didn't think and realize that wow, there's a war that's going on and we're all in the war, whether you choose to engage and fight or not, you are in that war.
[time=1954] But we get to take part in a victory this won by Jesus.
[time=1958] And Isaiah 64 and verse six in the new living translation says it this way.
[time=1963] We are all infected and impure with sin.
[time=1967] When we display our righteous deeds, they are nothing but filthy rags.
[time=1972] Like autumn leaves, we wither and fall and our sin sweep us away like the wind.
[time=1978] It's kind of like parenting.
[time=1979] The best illustration of those desires is parenting.
[time=1982] I've picked on parents a lot today, but boy, such a beautiful thing.
[time=1986] But we realize really quickly as parents that you don't have to teach your kids to sin.
[time=1990] Can I get a name, man?
[time=1992] They kind of pick up this stuff on their own.
[time=1994] And then the more I parented, I've realized that, you know, there's a sin nature, and I'll talk about that in just a moment, but I start to realize they've actually got a pretty good model of sinfulness.
[time=2005] They're called parents because we all sin and for sure the glory of God is we're models of that.
[time=2011] But may we in the midst of that be models of pointing to a Jesus who's bigger than our sin.
[time=2016] As parents, we see the sinful desires every single day.
[time=2021] And I want to challenge you as parents, don't turn the get-tos into half-tos.
[time=2025] When it comes to going to church or praying or studying the word of God.
[time=2029] And you say, well, how can I do that?
[time=2030] How can I make sure those things are not half-tos for my kids?
[time=2033] And I found the most powerful way to do that is to realize and to live in the fact that it is a get-to for me and to celebrate that I get to pray.
[time=2041] I get to boldly approach the throne of God and tell my kids that as we pray.
[time=2045] Don't say, well, we gotta say our prayers.
[time=2046] No, we don't got to, we get to.
[time=2048] It's like, God wants to hear from us tonight, kids.
[time=2051] Let's approach him.
[time=2052] The Bible says we can boldly approach the throne of God.
[time=2055] Let's do that together.
[time=2056] We get to do that.
[time=2057] Hey, we get to go to church today.
[time=2058] Don't get up and it's like, we gonna go today, oh no.
[time=2063] You know, it's like, hey, kids, we get to go, get up.
[time=2065] Let's go, we get to worship Jesus.
[time=2067] We get to study the word of God.
[time=2069] When it becomes a get-to for you, then you're gonna exude the get-to in others, including your kids in your life.
[time=2074] They'll start to pick up on that.
[time=2076] And may this, I'm gonna go to politics for a minute.
[time=2079] Everybody take a breath.
[time=2080] It's okay.
[time=2081] This is what we do with all these desires.
[time=2083] We talk about, well, the desires are the left.
[time=2085] They're so evil and corrupted.
[time=2086] The desires are the right.
[time=2088] They're so corrupted and they're so evil.
[time=2089] Or even outside of politics, anything we oppose.
[time=2092] Well, they, remember, it's so easy to see their sin, but we often don't look at our own.
[time=2096] Well, they are so corrupted and they are so sinful.
[time=2099] And it's like, well, no, they're so corrupted and sinful.
[time=2101] And we go back and forth and we point out each other's sins and I wanna solve the issue today.
[time=2105] You ready for it?
[time=2106] You're all right.
[time=2108] Everybody's corrupted.
[time=2110] Everybody's sinful.
[time=2111] And when we realize how sinful and corrupted we are as humanity, we start to realize that the ground is level at the foot of the cross.
[time=2119] We're all in the same spot.
[time=2120] We all see things differently.
[time=2122] We all sin differently and we like picking on their sin because it's not my sin, but my sin's just as bad.
[time=2127] And we all need to save your equally.
[time=2129] This is the beginning of unity.
[time=2131] We can't have unity without realizing what we need to be saved from.
[time=2134] And when we realize how bad we are as humans, but how good my Jesus is and that He is the way, the truth and the life, we realize that that's the only way we can be unified, but when we become self-righteous, we can't see straight to love other people the way that Jesus loves us.
[time=2150] Remember, He is the way.
[time=2151] He was sinless, yet He loved us and He made Himself nothing so that we could then love one another.
[time=2158] And the world will know we are His disciples if we will love one another.
[time=2162] My prayer is that we can do that.
[time=2164] Well, religion works to make it hard to come to God, that's the I have to.
[time=2168] Relationship says, He came to me, I get to.
[time=2171] Psalm 37 and verse four has been something very personally impactful in my life where, it says delight yourself in the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart, the desires of your heart.
[time=2182] Here's what that verse is not saying.
[time=2183] That verse is not saying you get everything you want if you follow Jesus.
[time=2186] Bank account's gonna be full and job that you want, your relationships will be printable.
[time=2190] No, what it's saying is that your delights that lead to your desires.
[time=2194] What you delight in is what you're consumed by, what you're focused on.
[time=2198] And when you delight in the Lord and you're focused on Him and you're consumed by Jesus in your life, it doesn't mean that He gives you what you want, it's that He makes what you want look more like what He wants for you.
[time=2210] Your desires for your own life as you delight in Him, as you trust in Him, as you look to Him, your desires start to look more like the desires of God for you.
[time=2218] And I don't know about you, but my personal Kevin desires, a lot of times don't look like what God's desires are for me.
[time=2225] And so may that be a blessing to you.
[time=2226] Let our delights lead us to our desires and our desires look more like what God wants for my life.
[time=2233] Number seven is your old nature.
[time=2235] We've talked about death, sin, our past, the world's pattern, our enemy, our old desires, but also our old nature.
[time=2242] Paul ends this part by saying, and we were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.
[time=2248] Wrath is used some 600 plus times throughout scripture because God hates sin.
[time=2253] He hates sin, but He loves people, even though we've become such terrible sinners.
[time=2259] While we were yet sinners, Christ loved us and died for us.
[time=2263] So does children of wrath, does that describe your kids sometimes?
[time=2266] Let me ask you, does it describe you sometimes?
[time=2270] It does me, and we realize like the rest of humanity.
[time=2274] Jeremiah 17, verses nine and 10, says the heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure.
[time=2280] That's where we are, who can understand it?
[time=2282] I, the Lord, search the heart and examine the mind to reward each person according to their conduct, according to what their deeds deserve.
[time=2288] And if Jeremiah stopped there, then we'd be in a mess, wouldn't it?
[time=2292] But even Jeremiah points to this coming savior, and we see him pictured again in Ezekiel, Ezekiel 36 verses 25 through 27.
[time=2301] He says, I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean.
[time=2305] I will cleanse you from all your impurities, from all your idols.
[time=2308] I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you.
[time=2313] I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh, get verse 27, and I will put my spirit in you.
[time=2320] And here's how we start to look more like Jesus, our desires line up, our actions line up.
[time=2324] I'll put my spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.
[time=2332] God will give you a new nature.
[time=2333] We have the sinful nature, but God gives us a spirit nature, and it's all possible through the person of Jesus.
[time=2339] And next week we're gonna look at salvation in depth, but a lot of people think that Christianity doesn't start until you die.
[time=2344] We think it's all a future thing.
[time=2346] But today I wanna remind you of past, present, and future when it comes to sin and salvation.
[time=2350] First of all, in the past, we're saved from the penalty of sin.
[time=2354] Theologians would call this justification.
[time=2356] We're justified by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[time=2359] It means you wanna remember what it means.
[time=2361] Justified.
[time=2362] It's justified, never sinned.
[time=2364] He washes it all away.
[time=2365] We are set free from.
[time=2366] We are saved from the penalty of sin in the past.
[time=2370] In the present, we are saved from the power of sin.
[time=2372] This is sanctification.
[time=2374] This is our process of becoming more and more like Jesus in this life.
[time=2378] The power of sin is real.
[time=2379] There's a real war that happens, but we are set free from, and we're saved from the power of sin in the present.
[time=2385] Just like we're saved from the penalty of sin in the past.
[time=2388] And in the future, and oh, what a future.
[time=2390] It will be in the future.
[time=2391] We are saved from the presence of sin.
[time=2394] In the future, we're saved from the presence of sin because glorification happens.
[time=2399] And we become like Christ, and we live in a world, live in a heaven where there's no sin, therefore there's no death.
[time=2404] And all these problems you face, they're gonna be no more.
[time=2408] Come Lord Jesus.
[time=2409] But in the meantime, may we thank God, may we thank God that He entered our sinfulness, lived a sinless life, paying a price for your sin and mine, that He rose from the dead to defeat death hell in the grave.
[time=2421] So that in the past, the penalty of sin, it's overcome.
[time=2424] In the present, the power of sin, it's no more.
[time=2427] In the future, the presence of sin will be gone forever.
[time=2430] I wanna ask you to buy your heads and close your eyes.
[time=2433] We as believers, we've been saved, our being saved, we'll be saved, not by, I'm a good person, not by, I'm a spiritual person, not by, I'm religious, not by, I'm doing my best, but by Jesus and Jesus alone.
[time=2447] And we're gonna look at that in depth next week.
[time=2450] Next week, I challenge you, read the scriptures in our statement of faith about salvation and look for a way to be thankful, to thank God, find ways to thank God for who He is in your life this week.
[time=2461] So believers right now, as your heads are bowed and your eyes are closed, do that right now.
[time=2464] Thank God that while you are such a center, Jesus paid it all and because He lives, I can face tomorrow, because He lives.
[time=2474] My past, my present, and my future is consumed by Jesus.
[time=2479] Maybe you're here today though, as believers are praying, you would say, I need to surrender my life to that.
[time=2483] I've been playing games with that, or I've been thinking about doing that, or I've been skeptical about truly surrendering my life, and I've realized that this salvation thing, I've been making it Jesus plus something, but today I realize that it's Jesus plus nothing that leads to salvation.
[time=2496] And I wanna trust in Jesus and Jesus alone, not in myself, not in my works, not in my church, not in my parents' faith or my grandparents' faith.
[time=2504] I'm gonna trust in Jesus to save me.
[time=2507] I'm gonna ask Him to forgive me.
[time=2509] I believe He died and I believe He rose again.
[time=2511] The Bible says, "Anyone who calls on the name of the Lord, "not might be saved, but shall be saved." In your own words, will you please call out to Him right now at home, around the world, in the room, wherever you are.
