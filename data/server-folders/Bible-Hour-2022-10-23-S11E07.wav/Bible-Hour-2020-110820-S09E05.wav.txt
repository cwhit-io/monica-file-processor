[time=0] "Day, I take you to Ephesians 2, 4 through 10.
[time=3] "We'll pick back up where we left off.
[time=5] "And I get to talk to you today about salvation "by grace through faith in Jesus Christ." My favorite subject, this subject of studying salvation for theologians is called soteriology.
[time=18] If you didn't know if that's a new word for you, I'll boil it down to one word that you will remember.
[time=22] And it's all you need to know about salvation.
[time=24] You ready for it?
[time=25] You probably won't even have to write it down.
[time=27] It's J-E-S-U-S.
[time=30] Jesus is all you need to know about salvation.
[time=33] But I wanna unpack that as Paul does so well in Ephesians 2, 4 through 10.
[time=38] Let's read our statement of faith about salvation by grace through faith in Christ.
[time=43] We say this, we believe salvation is by grace through faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=47] Trusting in Jesus' death and resurrection is the only way we can be forgiven of our sin and live in a right relationship with God.
[time=56] So last week I answered a very important question and it was saved from what?
[time=61] What are we saved from?
[time=62] Saved from what?
[time=63] If you missed last week, you can go to black-halk.fii or our website or our app and you can find last week's sermon.
[time=69] This is part two of that.
[time=70] But don't worry if you're new with us or first time here.
[time=73] This will stand alone, but you do need to look at last week because I talked about saved from what?
[time=78] Today, I talked to you about saved by what and for what?
[time=82] When it comes to being saved, we use that phraseology a lot in church, but we often will hone in on one of these questions, maybe without honing in on the other.
[time=91] And so we believe in the whole picture of salvation that all comes from Jesus.
[time=95] So let's talk today about being saved by what and for what.
[time=98] And I start with this quote from C.S. Lewis and his writing in mere Christianity.
[time=103] It captures so well where we're at in between these two questions.
[time=106] He says fallen man is not simply an imperfect creature who needs improvement.
[time=112] He is a rebel who must lay down his arms.
[time=116] And for some of you, as we looked at the sinfulness of humanity, our sin is this declaration of war against God.
[time=123] And we have to realize that I am an enemy of God because of my sin, but God loved his enemy so much that he came in the midst of our sin, took it upon himself.
[time=133] And as we lay down our arms and trust in him and him alone, we can have salvation.
[time=138] We're saved from death, hell, sin, and the destruction that comes, but we're saved by grace through faith in Christ and Christ alone, but for some very specific reasons.
[time=150] And so today I wanna give you, as last week I gave you seven things we're saved from.
[time=154] I wanna give you this week, straight from verses four through 10, seven things were saved by and four.
[time=160] And there's both very clearly listed in this passage.
[time=163] You ready for the word today, Black Hong?
[time=165] Let's dig in.
[time=166] Number one is this, we are saved by a loving God.
[time=169] Write that down.
[time=170] We're saved by a loving God, comes from verse number four.
[time=174] If you remember, verses one through three remind us what we need to be saved from.
[time=178] A little bit depressing if the story stopped there, then comes verse four.
[time=183] But God, that's about all you need to know.
[time=187] But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, pause, two of the most powerful words ever known in the history of mankind come at the beginning of verse four.
[time=202] But God, we were dead, verse one, but God.
[time=207] Because of his rich mercy and this great love with which he loved us, he showed up and changed everything.
[time=216] So we're saved number one by a loving God.
[time=219] I am wrong, but God makes everything right.
[time=224] I am lost, but God came and found me.
[time=229] I am dead, but God through Christ makes me alive.
[time=234] I am unrighteous, my righteousness is as filthy rags as we looked at last week, but God made me the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.
[time=244] I am an enemy of God, but God calls me friend.
[time=250] I deserve hell, but God came through Jesus Christ to give me heaven.
[time=256] I don't know about you, but I just need to be reminded that I'm loved sometimes.
[time=261] 'Cause it's not a real loving world out there.
[time=262] Have you noticed?
[time=263] And maybe you've been a part of that, but today, just as true as the statement is where we would say things like hurt people, hurt people, if you heard that before?
[time=273] Have you found it to be true?
[time=274] There's a lot of hurting people, hurting people outside of our walls and dare I say it even inside of our walls and inside the walls of our own homes, even in the church, but as true as that statement and as challenging as that statement is, I think a more powerful statement is something like this that loved people, loved people.
[time=293] And if ever that truth has been needed and necessary and crucial, it is right now church.
[time=300] May we realize how much our loving father loves us.
[time=304] Look at me for a minute, God loves you.
[time=308] He really deeply loves you.
[time=311] And if you could get that down into the heart of your hearts, you would find that you're more able, you have more capacity to love people like Christ has loved you.
[time=321] We're saved by a loving God.
[time=322] Number two, we're saved by a living grace.
[time=325] This comes from verse five, go to the next verse there.
[time=328] And we see even when we were dead in our trespasses, He made us alive together with Christ.
[time=336] By what?
[time=337] By grace, say that with me.
[time=339] It's by grace you have been saved.
[time=343] And grace is not a thing that we attain.
[time=346] It is a person that we get to know.
[time=348] Grace is personified in Jesus.
[time=351] So a loving God made Himself known to us through living grace.
[time=356] And His name is Jesus Christ.
[time=357] We're saved by this loving God, but by the living grace that He displayed.
[time=362] Verse five shows this great transformation that we all have to have.
[time=366] And it's the transformation from death to life.
[time=369] We saw it in Ephesians 2.1.
[time=370] We see it now again in Ephesians 2.5.
[time=373] We are dead without Jesus.
[time=376] We must remember that.
[time=378] And a lot of times we try to breathe CPR, breathe life into a dead corpse, because we try to do it through our own merit without the love and grace of God through Jesus Christ.
[time=389] So today may we remember where we've come from and what God has done for us through His living grace.
[time=396] This great transformation happens because we were dead.
[time=398] Now we can be alive.
[time=399] Did you know, did you know quiz time?
[time=401] Make sure, wait, did you know dead people can't make decisions?
[time=404] I've never seen a dead person make a decision.
[time=409] And that's why it's important to realize that salvation comes only from God because without Him we are dead.
[time=415] He showed up and He changed everything.
[time=418] He makes us alive.
[time=419] We don't make us alive, He did that.
[time=421] Paul says it this way in 2 Corinthians 5, 17.
[time=424] He says, therefore, if anyone is in Christ, this is that salvation we're talking about.
[time=427] He is what a new creation.
[time=430] He's a new creation.
[time=431] The oldest passed away, behold, the new has come.
[time=434] It's from death to life.
[time=436] It's the old to the new.
[time=438] And it comes from this living grace of God.
[time=440] It means that we have a new identity.
[time=443] It means who we once were, which is dead, we're now alive.
[time=446] The old has gone, the new has come.
[time=448] It means you put on a new jersey.
[time=450] It means your identity has changed.
[time=451] It means whose team your own has changed.
[time=454] And here's the thing about the jersey that we're talking about.
[time=457] It's not reversible.
[time=459] You don't get to take it off, flip it inside out to the other color and say, well, I'm on the sin team, the flesh team again now.
[time=466] Once you are in the family of God, He holds you tight.
[time=470] Now, that doesn't mean you don't sin.
[time=472] How many of you sinned this morning before you came to church?
[time=475] We'd just like to be honest here.
[time=476] Those of you who didn't raise your hand, you can kind of give them a nice elbow 'cause it's, I just don't believe them.
[time=481] 'Cause we just do that all the time, don't we?
[time=482] It doesn't mean that we're not still in a flesh suit.
[time=485] We're still in a flesh suit.
[time=486] Some of us have more of it than others.
[time=488] Can I give them any of them?
[time=489] But we're in a flesh suit.
[time=491] And because of that, we're in a war constantly between the flesh and the fruit of the spirit, between our sinfulness and humanity, because we're still wearing it now.
[time=500] One day it'll be gone, but right now, there's this war that's being waged and you're in it whether you like it or not.
[time=507] And so let us take part in the winning side.
[time=511] Let us remember who it is that saves us and let us not try to reverse our jersey.
[time=515] And here's the thing about that jersey, that identity.
[time=518] You don't need a tied pen with it either because it's already washed clean permanently by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[time=526] So let's remember what jersey that we wear today.
[time=529] And last week, I reminded you that when we're saved by grace, that means we live with grace.
[time=536] If you're saved by grace, that means you live with grace.
[time=539] You can write it down this way.
[time=540] In a Holy Spirit rant, I went on last week, this statement came out and I tried to articulate it even more clearly for you this week.
[time=548] So write it down this way that a church not characterized by grace is a church not characterized by Christ.
[time=555] May we never think that we can be a place not characterized by grace, a person, a home, a leader, a follower, a disciple, a disciple maker who doesn't display grace and think for one second that we look anything like Jesus Christ.
[time=573] If we're not living in a way that displays grace, we don't live in a way that exemplifies Christ in our own character and in our own life.
[time=581] So church, let us be a church.
[time=584] Let us be a family that is characterized by grace so that we show the world what it looks like to be characterized by Christ.
[time=591] We're saved by a loving God, a living grace.
[time=594] And number three, we're saved for an elevated purpose.
[time=597] This is the first four.
[time=598] Paul mixes them in together.
[time=600] We're saved for this elevated, excuse me, position.
[time=604] So important, it's for an elevated position.
[time=607] Look at verse six where we see this position.
[time=610] Says, "And raised us up with him and seated us with him in heavenly places in Christ Jesus." That's a pretty good place to be seated with Christ, to be raised up and to be seated with him.
[time=623] And the word raised in the Greek original language, it's interesting, it's the only time in the New Testament you see this word used for the word raised.
[time=633] The word raised is all throughout the New Testament, it's all throughout scripture, but this is the only place where you see this specific word.
[time=639] Why do you say?
[time=639] I think it's because it's such a specifically, uniquely, intentionally elevated position.
[time=646] It's such an important place that there really aren't English, Greek, Hebrew, any kind of words and any kind of language that can describe what God has planned for those of us who love God.
[time=657] No eye is seen, no ear has heard.
[time=659] We can't even begin to imagine the position that God has saved for us.
[time=663] Listen, did you know God has saved a seat for you beside him in heaven?
[time=668] That's the kind of elevated position that we read about in verse six.
[time=673] That's what you're saved for.
[time=674] You're saved by grace through faith, but for this elevated position.
[time=678] And I don't know about you, but I need some help keeping my eyes on where I'm heading.
[time=683] In a world that constantly fills us with all these things that we fix our eyes on what's around us, I need to be reminded of where I'm going.
[time=691] I need to be reminded of the end of the story.
[time=694] I mean, my friends, if there's ever a day and an age and a time where we've got to be reminded of the end of the story, it's today.
[time=702] Fix your eyes on what God has saved you for, this elevated position.
[time=707] And a question comes about, when we talk about salvation, I can't address it without talking about this question.
[time=712] It is, can I lose my salvation?
[time=717] Maybe you've asked that.
[time=718] I went through several years of asking that where it made me miserable.
[time=722] It's all I thought about because if I can lose my salvation, well, how many bad things do I need to do to lose it?
[time=729] And what do I need to do?
[time=730] What if I send right before I died and you start asking these questions and what if I didn't say certain prayer, do it a certain way or how good is good enough, how bad is bad enough that I could lose my...
[time=743] It's a miserable life.
[time=744] Some of you are living it right now.
[time=746] And God sent me to be a big mouth that's a representative of His truth to show you what true salvation looks like.
[time=752] And I've got two passages to do it.
[time=754] But before I'd give you those passages, Ephesians two reminds us who were saved by.
[time=759] So here's the truth of the matter.
[time=760] And I'm gonna give you my answer.
[time=761] If you're truly saved, if you've truly believed in Jesus, if you've truly trusted in Him for salvation, no, you cannot lose your salvation.
[time=769] And here's why.
[time=770] If salvation was something that I could achieve on my own, then I could lose it because I don't know about you, but I'm like this.
[time=778] But since salvation is not something and we'll see it even more deeply in a moment that I can achieve on my own, then that means somebody else has to achieve it.
[time=785] His name is Jesus.
[time=786] So the question becomes, is He powerful enough to keep me saved?
[time=790] It really has nothing to do with whether or not I can be good enough to keep me safe.
[time=793] Can He do that?
[time=794] And so with that question in mind, I wanna answer it.
[time=797] John chapter 10, the words of Jesus, John 10, 27 through 30.
[time=801] Jesus said, my sheep hear my voice and I know them.
[time=804] And they follow me.
[time=805] I give them eternal life.
[time=807] Who gives it to them?
[time=808] I give them eternal life and they will never perish and no one will snatch them out of my hand.
[time=816] Pretty clear, isn't it?
[time=817] Verse 29, my father who has given them to me is greater than all.
[time=822] Sorry, is he powerful enough?
[time=823] Are you convinced yet?
[time=824] Is greater than all?
[time=825] And no one is able to snatch them out of the father's hand.
[time=828] I and the father are one.
[time=830] And I preach through verse by verse, through first John earlier this year.
[time=833] And John says it this way in first John 5, 11 through 13.
[time=837] He says, and this is the testimony that God, say that with me, that God gave us eternal life.
[time=844] And this life is in His Son.
[time=847] It's not in me, it's not in you, it's in His Son.
[time=849] And this life is in His Son.
[time=850] Whoever has the Son has life, whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.
[time=855] Pretty clear description of salvation.
[time=857] But then get verse 13.
[time=858] I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God that you may know you have eternal life.
[time=867] I said it to you this way in that series and the series is called Developing.
[time=870] You can find it on our app, you can find it on our website.
[time=873] If you want to hear more and more about this, but I gave you this statement I want to give to you again that assurance when it comes to salvation, assurance is not found in our perfection, but in God's pull.
[time=883] Let me explain what I mean.
[time=885] Did you know, first of all, we've got to clarify something.
[time=887] Did you know you're not perfect?
[time=890] Look at your neighbor and say, you're not perfect.
[time=892] Let them know.
[time=893] Let's just be clear, you're not perfect.
[time=896] Most of you went, I already knew that.
[time=898] All right, I definitely know you're not perfect.
[time=900] You can look back and say, you either.
[time=902] Go on and tell them, we're not perfect.
[time=905] And yet so many times we look at keeping our salvation and being assured of our salvation as something that we have to assure ourselves of.
[time=913] The pull of God is where He has entered you and dwelled you with His Holy Spirit of promise.
[time=919] He stamped you, He sealed you, He claimed you.
[time=922] Ephesians chapter one reminds us of this, just one chapter before Ephesians two, but we're reading today.
[time=928] He reminds us of that very truth.
[time=930] And when the Holy Spirit enters in, He claims you.
[time=933] You are a part of the family of God.
[time=936] You couldn't save yourself and you can't keep yourself safe.
[time=939] And we're not assured of salvation because we're perfect enough.
[time=943] We're assured of salvation because the Holy Spirit that indwelled us took over us doesn't mean that we're perfect, but it means that when we're not, we're pulled away from the darkness and to the light and that conviction of His Spirit inside of us reminds us that something has changed.
[time=957] I don't know about you, but in my flesh, myself, I don't self-correct real well.
[time=962] I don't convict myself real well, but the Holy Spirit of God, when I misstep, He goes, that's not who you are.
[time=970] Remember your jersey, it's not reversible.
[time=974] And that's the pull of God.
[time=975] And that is what assures us of salvation.
[time=978] I think I set somebody free.
[time=980] You've been wrestling with that.
[time=981] And it's time to be free and to live free in Christ.
[time=984] There's therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[time=988] And He who the sun sets free is free indeed.
[time=991] So live as a free child of God.
[time=994] 'Cause you are saved by a loving God, by a living grace, you're saved for this elevated position that takes you beyond self-righteousness to His righteousness.
[time=1003] Self-righteous is why legalism is so dangerous and we're so bad about it in Christianity and churches or we think we contribute to it.
[time=1011] Like God's laws are so good, let's go add to them now.
[time=1013] No, no, we can't do that.
[time=1015] It's His law, He is perfect.
[time=1017] We can't add to Jesus.
[time=1019] That self-righteousness is His righteousness that saves us.
[time=1023] Number four is that we're saved for an eternal purpose.
[time=1027] Comes from verse number seven, let's read it together.
[time=1031] So that, here's purpose.
[time=1032] So that in the coming ages, He might show the immeasurable riches of His grace and kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
[time=1043] I'm glad that I have a purpose that I'm saved for.
[time=1046] I'm not just saved from hell and sin.
[time=1048] I'm not just saved by grace through faith.
[time=1050] I'm saved for an elevated position and I'm saved for an eternal purpose.
[time=1055] Your life matters to God so much that even though He doesn't need you at all, He wants you because He loves you and He saved you for an eternal purpose.
[time=1066] Romans chapter two and verse four mirrors the talk of God's kindness.
[time=1070] I wanna read it to you, Romans two four, or do you presume on the riches of His kindness and forbearance and patience?
[time=1077] Not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance.
[time=1081] Now let's clarify what is repentance.
[time=1083] Repentance throughout scripture, repent and be baptized.
[time=1086] Repentance is what leads us to salvation.
[time=1088] It's a change of mind, it's a change of heart.
[time=1091] It's I'm going this way, but instead of going this way, I turn and I go the other way.
[time=1097] Instead of going towards self-righteousness, instead of going towards me saving me, I'm going towards Jesus because only Jesus can save me by grace through faith alone in Christ, can I be saved?
[time=1108] And I turn from trusting in anything but Jesus and totally trusting in Him, acknowledging I am such a sinner that I need a perfect Savior and He is Jesus Christ.
[time=1118] But so many times in the church settings especially, we're so bad about trying to help people in the right heart with the right motive so many times.
[time=1125] Reach repentance by going and popping people in the face with truth and kicking them in the knee.
[time=1131] Have you ever been kicked in the knee or popped in the face or beat over the head with the Bible?
[time=1135] What did that do for you?
[time=1137] Let's say to us, why don't we do what first of all, the word of God says, but especially what Jesus did.
[time=1142] Jesus didn't walk up to sinners and punch them in the mouth.
[time=1146] Jesus walked up to sinners and sat down with them, looked in my eye to eye and showed them how valued they are, how much He loved them.
[time=1153] And Romans chapter two and verse four reminds us that it is the kindness of a God that leads to repentance.
[time=1159] And in the same way, if we want to show people what it looks like and why they should turn to Jesus, then may we display the kindness of God in our life.
[time=1169] Be kind this week.
[time=1171] And you thought I forgot the election.
[time=1172] This is a good week to be kind.
[time=1175] It's a good week to try it out, right?
[time=1177] Let's be kind and that'll point people to Jesus.
[time=1180] And when it comes to God's purpose, be reminded that God's purpose often comes packaged as problems.
[time=1186] Problems are often the best ways that God points you to His purpose.
[time=1190] So don't neglect the problems that you're facing now.
[time=1192] Don't just ask Him to get rid of them.
[time=1193] Say, God, show me what your purpose is in the midst of these problems.
[time=1197] God has an important eternal purpose for you.
[time=1200] Number five is that we're saved by.
[time=1202] We did two things that were saved by, two things were saved for.
[time=1205] Number five, we're saved by God's gift.
[time=1207] This is a powerful verse that I use just about every Sunday and you'll see why as we read Him.
[time=1212] Verse eight, we see that we are saved by God's gift.
[time=1216] For by grace, you have been saved through faith.
[time=1219] That's your only role, remember that.
[time=1221] You have the faith, but it's God's grace that saved us.
[time=1224] For by grace, you've been saved through faith.
[time=1226] This is not your own doing.
[time=1228] It is the gift of God.
[time=1231] It is God's gift.
[time=1233] Romans 10, 9 says, because if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.
[time=1243] And some of you've been making that so complicated.
[time=1246] Aren't we good, aren't we good at making complicated that which God has made so simple?
[time=1252] It really is that simple.
[time=1253] So for some of you, I don't know who this is for, stop complicating what God has made so simple.
[time=1259] That's the message maybe you came to hear today.
[time=1262] Salvation really is that simple, but we add so many layers that God didn't intend.
[time=1266] It's the gift of God.
[time=1268] He gives it freely.
[time=1269] That means salvation is, get this, it's received.
[time=1273] It is not achieved.
[time=1275] It's received, it's not achieved.
[time=1277] You're not good enough to get it there.
[time=1278] And that's why a lot of times we'll say, I decided to be saved.
[time=1283] And there is a decision component where you decide, what do you decide to do though?
[time=1286] You decide to receive the gift.
[time=1289] But outside of that, you didn't do anything to contribute to your salvation.
[time=1292] You made the need for salvation.
[time=1294] That's about all we can contribute.
[time=1297] Can I get a name in?
[time=1299] It's a gift and so your decision, you will say things, and it's not all bad.
[time=1302] I say things like this.
[time=1303] Well, we decided to give our life to Christ.
[time=1306] It's a good decision to me.
[time=1307] But I think maybe a better way to say it is that not I got saved, it's that God saved me.
[time=1314] He saved me.
[time=1315] He reached into the depths of my sin and met me there, the sinfulness that I put in place.
[time=1321] It's not of him at all.
[time=1322] He met me in that place.
[time=1324] We're saved by God's gift and by his gift alone.
[time=1328] The acronym that you see used so many times is GRACE.
[time=1332] It is God's riches at Christ's expense.
[time=1338] Think of your favorite gift that you've ever been given at Christmas.
[time=1342] Soon we'll celebrate Christmas and we'll do that on December 13th by giving our greatest gift to Jesus because that is the greatest gift that God has ever given to humanity.
[time=1350] It's his son.
[time=1351] He gave himself to us through his son.
[time=1355] And when you think of your greatest gift, if it pales in a comparison to God's greatest gift, it was the gift of his son.
[time=1361] And that's why at Christmas we're gonna go through a series the first three weeks in December called Fulfilled.
[time=1365] And we'll look at this gift.
[time=1367] We're gonna look at the prophecies that Jesus fulfilled about where he was born, the location, about the lordship of who he is and about the lineage that he came from.
[time=1376] There's so much there we can barely even scratch the surface in three weeks, but we're gonna give it a shot at Christmas because we need to be reminded of that truth and it is the truth of God's gift.
[time=1386] Number six in verse nine, we're saved by God's work because get this, there is a gift we're saved by the gift of God, but somebody had to pay for it.
[time=1395] Freedom is not free, you've heard that said, right?
[time=1398] Well, this gift wasn't free either.
[time=1399] It calls God everything, which is a reminder of how much he loves us.
[time=1403] It's a loving God that gives us this living grace.
[time=1406] It's by his work to pay at Christ's expense.
[time=1408] God's riches at Christ's expense.
[time=1410] He paid for it.
[time=1411] It's the work of God.
[time=1413] Verse nine is where we see this.
[time=1414] Not a result of works, that's your works in mind.
[time=1417] Not a result of works so that no one may boast.
[time=1421] Let's be honest, if I could do it, I'd boast about it.
[time=1424] If you could do it, I'd boast about it.
[time=1427] I'd be like, you know, I got saved because, you know, that Eric guy, yeah, I topped him.
[time=1436] He was here, you know, he set a high bar, but I passed the bar.
[time=1439] And you're looking at me like, no, I wouldn't do that.
[time=1445] I wouldn't compare myself.
[time=1446] I wouldn't be that haughty.
[time=1448] I wouldn't be that prideful.
[time=1450] Look at your neighbor and say, yeah, you would.
[time=1453] The Bible says it, it's true.
[time=1455] It's not of works, it's not of what we can achieve or we would boast about it.
[time=1460] We become prideful about it because we're just kind of like that, aren't we?
[time=1464] But it's all of his work, not of our work, so that we won't boast, so that we can be humble about it.
[time=1471] It's a work of God.
[time=1474] And today, I wanna remind you of this way, that we're not saved by achieving works, but by receiving the work of Jesus.
[time=1483] It's only by the finished work of Jesus on the cross.
[time=1486] It's only by his blood that we can be saved.
[time=1490] Salvation is Jesus plus nothing that gives us everything.
[time=1495] But so often we say it's Jesus plus something, but Jesus plus something gets you nothing.
[time=1500] It's Jesus plus nothing that gives us salvation, that gives us everything today.
[time=1505] Jesus took your place so you could have his.
[time=1508] And that place is a reconciled place.
[time=1510] That place is a rescued place because of our sinfulness.
[time=1514] And there are two distinctives.
[time=1516] I've always boiled them down to two distinctives of Christianity.
[time=1519] People ask things like, well, what makes Christianity so different than all of the other religions?
[time=1525] I don't think there are a lot of ways to God.
[time=1527] And I think that there are really two distinctives that set Christianity apart.
[time=1531] Number one is the resurrection.
[time=1532] We're gonna talk about this at length so you guys have gotta stop me.
[time=1535] I can't preach it now 'cause you got a lunch to get to, but we're gonna do that a little later on in this series.
[time=1540] It's the resurrection.
[time=1541] Every other religion commemorates their leader by going to a tomb, by going to a place where somebody is laid there and they go to remember.
[time=1549] We go to a tomb that we believe was the place Jesus' body was laid, but not because it smells bad in there, not because it's closed off, because it's empty, because he is risen, and because he lives, we have a savior, and we have someone to follow, and we have a faith that cannot be shaken.
[time=1568] He's alive today.
[time=1570] And it's a distinctive of Christianity.
[time=1572] Number two, that's right, it's worth celebrating.
[time=1575] We'll save the rest of that sermon for a little later in the series.
[time=1578] But number two is grace.
[time=1580] Every other religion ultimately comes back down to works, a works-based religion where we have to do something to get there.
[time=1587] And today I wanna remind you that Christianity is the only path to God.
[time=1592] Jesus is the only way to God that isn't built, that isn't built off of something that I do.
[time=1598] John 14 and verse six, Jesus said it this way.
[time=1601] He said, I'm the way, the truth and the life.
[time=1604] No one comes to the Father except through me.
[time=1607] That's grace.
[time=1608] It's not because you got there, but all these other religions, there's two categories for salvation.
[time=1613] It's works or grace.
[time=1614] It's one or the other.
[time=1615] Either I'm good enough to get there or I'm gonna need some help.
[time=1618] And I'm gonna submit to you that we've made it really clear that we need a lot of help.
[time=1621] We don't need some help.
[time=1622] We need a lot of help.
[time=1623] And that's where grace comes in.
[time=1624] A ton of isms are out there.
[time=1626] A ton of religions, a few of them.
[time=1627] Buddhism talks about ceasing desires.
[time=1630] Confucianism is about education, self-reflection, cultivation, morality, Hinduism.
[time=1635] It's about losing your ego, making an effort to live in unity with the divine.
[time=1639] These are good works, right?
[time=1640] I'm not terrible pursuits, but they're about me.
[time=1644] Islam is about living a holy life and good deeds that makes a cut.
[time=1649] Orthodox Judaism even is about things that we read about repentance and prayer and keeping the law of the Lord.
[time=1654] But how good is good enough?
[time=1655] New ageism is gaining this new perspective of divine one as all these isms.
[time=1659] I had to read a list.
[time=1660] I can't keep up with them.
[time=1661] There's like 12 new ones every single day, but only one will last and his name is Jesus.
[time=1667] The resurrection and grace is what sets this path of faith apart.
[time=1671] It's salvation by grace through faith along Christianity says this, that the, listen, that the longing to be saved by works is not necessarily bad until doing the works becomes anyone other than Jesus.
[time=1687] We're saved by the work of Jesus, His finished work on the cross, not by us.
[time=1692] And number seven, number six is that we're saved by God's work, number seven is we're saved for God's work.
[time=1698] Like, wait a minute, I thought it was about His work, it is, but then now because you're saved by His work, because of this gift, you're saved for the purpose of carrying out His work in the world.
[time=1710] Verse number 10, Paul says it this way, for we are His workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.
[time=1721] You are God's workmanship, my friend.
[time=1724] Say it this way, God did the work of salvation so we could display His work to the world.
[time=1729] You are saved for a purpose.
[time=1732] You are saved for the work of God in your life.
[time=1735] He works in us and He becomes this working out of our worship as the world watches.
[time=1740] God works in you, on you, and through you to do works through you as an act of worship and the world notices.
[time=1748] The world will see that we have love, that we are His disciples by our love for one another by this worship inside of us.
[time=1755] Galatians 2.20, Paul says I've been crucified with Christ, it's no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.
[time=1761] And the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith.
[time=1765] I live by what?
[time=1766] I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave Himself for me.
[time=1774] It's not I who lives, Christ who lives through me.
[time=1777] And because He lives, I have a purpose.
[time=1780] Because He lives, I'm saved for God's work.
[time=1783] And so I boil this down to asking you this one question this week and that is how can you display God's work in your life?
[time=1791] Jesus always meets me where I'm at, but He never leaves me there.
[time=1795] And God changes who you are so that He can change what you do.
[time=1799] So how can you display God's work in your life?
[time=1803] I wanna give you a couple of specific areas of application.
[time=1806] He thought you got off easy with it being election week, but I wanna talk about that for a moment.
[time=1809] You have a great opportunity this week to display the work of God as believers, as followers of Jesus.
[time=1817] You know what God has not told me?
[time=1818] God has not told me what we are gonna know on Tuesday night or Wednesday morning or whenever, whatever all that's gonna look like.
[time=1826] He hasn't told me who's gonna win the election, but He has told me several other things.
[time=1831] He has told me to be kind, that it's His kindness that leads people to repentance.
[time=1835] He has told me that we are to love one another and that by our love for one another, the world will know where your His disciples.
[time=1842] He has told me that He's the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.
[time=1845] He has told me, Proverbs 21 and one, that the King, earthly King, that the King's heart is but a stream of water in the hand of the Lord.
[time=1853] He directs it wherever He will, meaning that all of these, He has told me to have my hope and my eyes fixed on Jesus, the author and perfecter of my faith.
[time=1863] He has told me that no matter what happens in this world at all, no matter what governmental systems that they are all temporary and He has told me what is not temporary and it is the kingdom of God that when everything of this world passes away, including elections, including government seats, including nations that the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords will still be reigning and His name is Jesus and that His kingdom is the only one that will last.
[time=1891] So may we this week display the work of God by keeping our eyes on the only stuff that is eternal.
[time=1898] To make it a little more personal, go ahead, let's celebrate that, let's commit, let's clap in celebration, but in commitment that we're gonna do that together this week.
[time=1908] I'll make it a little more personal before we move forward and give you a chance to go live this stuff out.
[time=1914] How can you display the work of God in your house?
[time=1918] How can you display the work of God in your marriage this week?
[time=1922] How can you display the work of God as a mom or a dad or a grandparent or an influencer and a young person's life this week?
[time=1929] How can you display the work of God in your workplace this week?
[time=1938] It's a great question for us to go into not just because it's an election week because it's another week.
[time=1942] And in case you haven't noticed, 2020 has been quite a year and we've got minute by minute, moment by moment opportunities to display the work of God.
[time=1951] So what is it that God wants to display through you this week?
[time=1954] Let's figure that out and let's live it out together and the world will know we are His disciples as we love one another, as we do this in unity.
[time=1961] I want to ask you, dispel your heads.
[time=1963] Ask God what work He wants to display through you this week.
[time=1967] I praise God for you.
[time=1969] I praise God for what He's teaching you.
[time=1970] And if you're a believer and you've trusted in Jesus, you already know about this sinfulness of humanity.
[time=1975] You're well aware of salvation by grace through faith.
[time=1978] You know those things you have been saved because of Jesus and Jesus alone.
[time=1983] But today I challenge you, I plead with you.
[time=1986] Ask God how He wants to display His work.
[time=1988] You're saved by His work but for His work to now go out and live it out.
[time=1992] Ask Him and He will show you the way.
[time=1994] Some of you are here though, at home, watching online all around the world in the room.
[time=1999] And you have not yet trusted in a very clear picture of the gospel that we have painted for you these last couple of weeks and even today.
[time=2007] And it's time to stop trusting in you.
[time=2009] It's time to turn around, stop running towards you being good enough and run to the arms of Jesus, a loving God who became a living grace who you can be saved by His gift that He paid for with His work so that He can then do His work in you and through you.
[time=2025] Why?
[time=2026] Because you have this elevated position that He'll lead you into an eternal purpose.
[time=2029] But it all starts with this one question.
[time=2031] What am I gonna do with Jesus?
[time=2034] Have you trusted Him?
[time=2035] Totally trusted Him.
[time=2036] Have you laid down you being a source of salvation in your life completely, surrendering to Him, saying I'm yours.
[time=2044] In your own words, ask Him to save you.
[time=2046] Ask Him to forgive you.
[time=2048] Tell Him you believe that He died, that He rose again, that He is that perfect sacrifice.
[time=2052] And He will meet you right where you are.
[time=2054] Pause right now, reflect, ask God to save you, ask Him to show you what's next and He'll meet you right there.
