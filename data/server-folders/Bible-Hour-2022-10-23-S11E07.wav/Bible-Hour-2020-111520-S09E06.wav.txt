[time=0] We're gonna be all over the place in our Bibles this morning, so get ready.
[time=4] Get your scrolling thumbs ready on your devices.
[time=6] We're gonna be busy today.
[time=8] There are notes available in the app, so I look forward to walking you through these things this morning.
[time=13] We have, as a church, been working through, six pillars of our doctrinal statement as a church.
[time=22] One of those, the one for this morning, is the nature of God, the Trinity.
[time=28] That there is one God in three persons.
[time=30] Can we please take a moment and thank our worship team again for preparing us to hear from God's word this morning?
[time=37] (audience applauding) Wow.
[time=38] I couldn't get some of the words out.
[time=41] Just so beautiful, so overwhelming.
[time=43] So you're so ready to hear from God's word because all that we've sung so far this morning has been soaked in scripture.
[time=51] Soaked in who God is.
[time=55] We are here this morning, friends.
[time=57] We are gathered together.
[time=59] I will do my very best to proclaim to you this morning the scripture's witness regarding who God is.
[time=66] Now, talking about the Trinity is not like talking about math.
[time=70] There is no math that makes one equal three or three equal one.
[time=75] It's beyond math.
[time=76] I'm kind of grateful that it's beyond math 'cause math itself is beyond me.
[time=80] But anyway, this goes beyond the ability of something that is rational.
[time=85] And I'm not threatened by that and you shouldn't be either this morning.
[time=89] Would you please go in your Bibles to the very, very beginning to Genesis chapter one.
[time=93] And as you are turning, this is what's in our church doctrinal statement regarding God and his nature.
[time=100] We believe that there is one God who exists in three eternal persons.
[time=108] God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.
[time=111] He is the creator, sustainer, redeemer, and ruler of the universe and all it contains.
[time=121] So did you see that?
[time=122] It's still on the screen, or it was a moment ago.
[time=125] It's still on the screen before you.
[time=127] It's one God three persons.
[time=129] And then the next sentence says he is one God three persons.
[time=134] In Genesis chapter one, we read some remarkable pronouns about God from the very, very, very beginning.
[time=143] If you have not, by the way, taken the journey with us, you can go to takethejourneywithus.com and we at the church have prepared a discipleship curriculum for you, walking you through who we are as a church, our mission, our vision, our values, our objectives.
[time=159] And the 201 is more information about these six pillars of our church doctrinal statement.
[time=166] One of them, we go into a lot more detail, or some more detail about these things.
[time=170] Genesis chapter one, starting in verse 26.
[time=173] Then God said, let us make man in our image
[time=179] after our likeness, and let them have dominion
[time=185] over the fish of the sea, the birds of the heavens, the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.
[time=193] So God created man in his own image.
[time=196] In the image of God, he created him.
[time=198] Male and female, he created them even in these verses.
[time=203] God is singular, but there's plural pronouns attached to God.
[time=208] Did you see it in verse 26?
[time=210] Let us make man in our image.
[time=215] Remarkable stuff, remarkable, mysterious, beautiful, wonderful, and I would say to you this morning friends, you'll see on this journey with us this morning incredibly practical.
[time=225] There is a very real sense, and I have born this way, this week, I've talked to a lot of you about this, as you prayed for me regarding this message.
[time=234] The more you talk about the Trinity, the more problems you can get into you, because it is mysterious and trying to make something mysterious, not mysterious, is hard.
[time=242] So I'm comforted by this before we pray as we just get started.
[time=246] In Romans eight, there's a remarkable set of verses that say something like this.
[time=251] When we pray, our prayers are carried off to God the Father, by the Holy Spirit.
[time=257] I can't get over this, it's absolutely amazing.
[time=260] Our prayers are carried off to God the Father, by the Holy Spirit.
[time=263] The only way that I can pray to God is based on the finished work of Jesus Christ, God's Son.
[time=270] All three persons of the Trinity are involved every time that we pray, and we're about to do that right now.
[time=278] So I know the Spirit intercedes with me, we praise the Father, He carries off to my Father, the prayers I should have prayed according to God's will.
[time=287] How marvelous is that?
[time=289] How wonderful is that?
[time=290] So let's pray and ask God to be with us as we travel through His Word and discover more about who He is.
[time=295] Would you please pray with me?
[time=297] Oh God, I pray that those words that we sang just a few minutes ago would be confessions of our hearts and souls.
[time=304] We believe God the Father, we believe in Christ the Son, we believe in the Holy Spirit.
[time=309] Our God, you, God are three in one.
[time=312] May it be so.
[time=313] God, go before us as we travel through your Word this morning.
[time=316] Give us your grace to listen and to hear from you, and go before us and all these things.
[time=321] I pray in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=324] The mystery of the Trinity is indeed a mystery, but what is not a mystery is the clear testimony of Scripture from the very earliest page, like the verse that we just read.
[time=336] That's not tucked away somewhere, pages and pages and pages and so the first two pages of Scripture is that language regarding who God is.
[time=345] The doctrine of the Trinity is utterly unique among all world religions.
[time=351] Our Muslim neighbors who merely have a chance to minister to you in the days to come do not believe in the Trinity.
[time=357] If you guys ever seen that sticker that says coexist, it has like a crescent and a star of David and a crash, you guys ever seen that before?
[time=366] I don't know what it means.
[time=368] I think I know what it means.
[time=369] If it means that all religions are basically the same, they're all really just variations on a theme, then that's not true.
[time=376] Five minutes and any one of them will tell you that that's not the case.
[time=380] That I have, there are lots of things that my Muslim neighbors believe that I don't believe.
[time=385] One of them is the nature of God.
[time=387] If coexist means let's live together and not harm each other or not kill each other, then I'm all in.
[time=393] But if it means that we're all the same, I can't be there.
[time=397] And neither can any of us.
[time=399] I heard one time someone say this way.
[time=402] All religions are basically the same.
[time=404] The only difference on matters of sin, salvation, heaven, hell, God, and salvation.
[time=408] But they're all basically the same.
[time=410] And that is true.
[time=412] In this case, it is absolutely true that what you must affirm to be a part of another world religion, to be a part of Christianity, for example, you cannot affirm and be, anyway.
[time=424] This morning I'm gonna focus on four key places.
[time=426] We already read the first one.
[time=427] Four key places where the language used to describe God in his nature paints this remarkably practical and exciting picture of who God is and how we understand and relate to him.
[time=437] So, Genesis one.
[time=439] In those verses, back to Genesis one, 26, if you still have your Bibles of him.
[time=443] In those verses, God is singular, but there's a plural pronoun, our pronouns.
[time=448] Our, let us make man in our image.
[time=452] What's going on there?
[time=453] Twice in those two verses, he says, let's make man in our image.
[time=457] Twice.
[time=458] So, whatever that means, it means a lot of things I can't get into this morning, but it does mean that God has created us in and for community.
[time=467] As God is in community with himself, more on that in a minute, as God's in community with himself, he made us also for community.
[time=477] God has always been in community with himself from before the foundation of the world.
[time=482] Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[time=485] In Genesis chapter three, go ahead and turn there, please.
[time=487] Genesis three, there's more.
[time=490] This, of course, is tragically after the sin of our first parents and entering the sin enters into the world.
[time=498] And here's the response of God.
[time=499] Genesis three, 22.
[time=502] Then the Lord God said, behold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil.
[time=511] Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever, therefore the Lord God sent him out for the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken.
[time=521] The man has become like one of us, us.
[time=526] God understands and speaks about himself from the earliest part of the scriptures in this way.
[time=532] The Lord God, and then he uses words like us.
[time=536] Genesis chapter 11, go ahead and turn there if you would, please.
[time=539] We're gonna pogo stick a lot this morning.
[time=541] Genesis chapter 11.
[time=543] This, of course, is in the context of the Tower of Babel and the confusing of languages there.
[time=549] Genesis chapter 11 starting in verse six.
[time=552] The Lord said, behold, they are one people and they all have one language.
[time=556] This is only the beginning of what they will do.
[time=559] That's for sure.
[time=561] And nothing they propose to do will now be impossible for them.
[time=564] Come, let us go down and they're confused their language so that they may not understand one another's speech.
[time=573] In the first 11 chapters of the Bible, God refers to himself as a singular plurality three times.
[time=581] Over and over and over again.
[time=584] I teach a class called apologetics.
[time=586] And apologetics is about making an intelligent defense of the things that you believe.
[time=589] This is not proof, friends.
[time=591] It's just really good evidence.
[time=593] It's really good evidence that what God says about himself exhibits A, B, and C, if you will, here it is.
[time=599] There's a lot more where that came from.
[time=600] So in your notes, here's how I would summarize this particular part of our discussion this morning.
[time=607] God has existed community.
[time=609] God has existed in community with himself since before the foundation of the world.
[time=616] Made in his image, people need to exist.
[time=621] Also in relationship with each other and the God who made them.
[time=626] I'll say that again.
[time=627] God has existed in community with himself since before the foundation of the world.
[time=633] Made in his image, people need to exist also in relationship with one another and the God who made them.
[time=643] Trinity is a made up word.
[time=644] It's made up word like tri unity.
[time=647] It's a way to communicate the tri unity of God.
[time=650] My daughter is going away to college.
[time=652] I can't stop it, I'm trying, but I can't stop it.
[time=655] She's going away to college and she should.
[time=657] It's good and I'll be fine.
[time=659] But in colleges in Europe, going back centuries of time, universities in Europe, the word university is a combination of two words, unity and diversity.
[time=671] People in centuries gone by thought the fundamental elements of the world were earth, air, fire, and water.
[time=677] And the fifth one, the quintessence, the fifth essence, what ties all those things together?
[time=683] They went to university to figure it out.
[time=686] What brings unity in diversity?
[time=689] The trinity is like that.
[time=690] The one God in three persons lives in perfect eternal harmony with himself, in community with himself, in self-glorifying and loving community.
[time=701] Let him become like us.
[time=705] Let us make man in our image.
[time=708] How marvelous.
[time=711] In Christianity, God is not an impersonal thing or a static thing, not even just one person, but a dynamic pulsating activity.
[time=720] This is Tim Keller from The Reason for God.
[time=723] A life, a kind of drama almost, if you will.
[time=727] A kind of dance.
[time=728] C.S. Lewis.
[time=729] The pattern of this three personal life is the great fountain of energy and beauty spurting up at the very center of reality.
[time=738] Well, that's a lot to take in, but that's all there.
[time=740] And I find that to be marvelous.
[time=742] Go with me to first John.
[time=744] Thanks for listening fast.
[time=745] First John, chapter four.
[time=748] Here we go.
[time=748] From community friends to the character of God.
[time=753] What is it about God in his character that helps us to see him as he is?
[time=757] So these are very important words on that front.
[time=760] First John, chapter four.
[time=762] All the way in any revival, if you go to Revelation at the very end, then you go left, Revelation, a little book of Jude, then three letters from John.
[time=769] That's where we are.
[time=769] So for Genesis, now all the way to close to the end, to first John, chapter four.
[time=774] First John comes with four, a second John.
[time=776] In case you're welcome.
[time=779] Okay.
[time=780] First John, chapter four, verse one.
[time=781] Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God.
[time=787] For many false prophets have gone into the world.
[time=790] A post or one second.
[time=792] There would not be what we would call a New Testament if it wasn't for problems in the church.
[time=800] In the first century, we are now 21 centuries out.
[time=804] In the first century, there were problems everywhere.
[time=807] People were teaching things that were plainly against the testimony of Scripture.
[time=812] And John had to write about those things.
[time=814] So there's nothing new under the sun, friends.
[time=816] We all had the same problems.
[time=817] By this you know the spirit of God.
[time=820] Every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God.
[time=826] Every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God.
[time=830] This is the spirit of the Antichrist which you heard was coming and is now in the world already.
[time=835] Already, 2,000 years ago.
[time=838] Little children, you are from God and have overcome them for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.
[time=844] They are from the world.
[time=845] Therefore they speak from the world.
[time=847] The world listens to them.
[time=849] We are from God.
[time=850] Whoever knows God listens to us.
[time=852] Whoever is not from God does not listen to us by this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
[time=861] John makes it clear in these verses the way to know false teachers is what they do with Jesus.
[time=867] They have the authority of the Holy Spirit based on what they do with Jesus.
[time=873] That's what tests the spirits in verse one means.
[time=877] It means have discernment.
[time=879] Listen carefully.
[time=880] There were people that were troubling the church 20 centuries ago along these lines.
[time=885] And the litmus test that John gives them is what do they do with Jesus?
[time=891] The incarnation, we are so close to Christmas.
[time=894] It's coming down the pike.
[time=895] Hallmark channel is on it.
[time=897] You probably know that already.
[time=898] We'll talk about Christmas in a little bit.
[time=901] But the incarnation, the appearance of Jesus Christ in the flesh, God the son in flesh, please hear me dear friends, is the most important thing that has ever happened or ever will happen.
[time=914] His appearance in the world is the thing that makes everything else make sense before it and after it.
[time=920] So when our pastor goes through a series of Sundays in December about prophecies concerning his arrival, that's why.
[time=928] The most important event in the history of the world was promised over and over and over again as you would expect.
[time=935] Notice all three persons in verse two.
[time=937] Did you see it?
[time=938] The spirit of God, every spirit of the Christ, Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God.
[time=944] That is the Father.
[time=945] If you pull at this thread, that God the Father isn't really divine and Jesus isn't really divine and the spirit isn't divine, then it all falls apart.
[time=955] It all falls apart.
[time=957] The phrase from God in verses two and three is key here for John.
[time=962] There is a way to know whether teaching is from God or not.
[time=966] It's related to the interconnection of the three persons of the Trinity.
[time=972] Go down in chapter four verse 13.
[time=975] Same chapter, first on four 13.
[time=978] This has to do with you and I.
[time=980] So now it's more teaching, it's more theological.
[time=983] Now it's personal.
[time=985] By this we know that we abide in him and he and us because he has given us of his spirit.
[time=990] And we have seen and testified the Father has sent his son to be the savior of the world.
[time=995] Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him and he and God.
[time=1002] So we have come to know and to believe that the love that God has for us, God is love.
[time=1011] And whoever abides in love abides in God and God abides in him by this is love perfected with us that we may have confidence for the day of judgment because as he is so also we are in this world, there is no fear in love, perfect love casts out fear.
[time=1033] Fear has to do with punishment and whoever fears has that been perfected in love.
[time=1038] We love because he first loved us.
[time=1041] So John tells us here, there is also a way to know whether we are spirit connected or not.
[time=1047] Like there's a way to know teaching, but also a way to know whether you and I are spirit connected too.
[time=1052] The Father has given us of his spirit.
[time=1055] The Father has sent the Son.
[time=1058] So our confession, our confession in this room about a half an hour ago of the eternal sonship of Jesus is the evidence of our abiding in him.
[time=1068] What welled up inside you when you're saying those words, what a beautiful name it is, what a wonderful name it is, what a powerful name it is that is evidence of the spirit's presence in your life when you're saying it from a place of faith and confession.
[time=1084] Abiding, talked about abiding back in August 14 years ago, August of this past year, it wasn't, it feels like it was 14 years ago.
[time=1092] August of this past summer, are you guys there?
[time=1094] You with me, okay?
[time=1095] All right, so abiding is a function of who, that's what I said on August, I still believe it.
[time=1100] Abiding is a function of who and what I love the most.
[time=1103] It's what abiding is.
[time=1104] Abiding is our reflection of our deepest desires.
[time=1109] It's the things that we can't escape and we wouldn't and we couldn't if we wanted to even.
[time=1114] If we are connected to him in that way, we will love as he has loved, God is love.
[time=1120] So, here's something marvelous.
[time=1126] God is love and he has always been love before the foundation of the world.
[time=1132] God created you and me, not because he needed someone to love because God was thinking, can anybody find me?
[time=1139] Somebody to love.
[time=1140] I was never singing that song because God's always been in community with himself.
[time=1144] Father, Son and Holy Spirit have always been in community, loving and glorifying each other from before the foundation of the world.
[time=1154] And God didn't need to make you to have someone to love because you already was love.
[time=1160] Isn't that amazing?
[time=1161] So God creates the universe and that circle of love expands out to include you and to include me.
[time=1167] And I get to be involved in that music of the trinity loving and glorifying each other.
[time=1173] That's what God created you for because he loves you, not because he needs you, but because God is love.
[time=1178] That's pretty amazing.
[time=1180] Tim Keller, when people say that God is love, I think they mean that love is extremely important or that God really wants us to love.
[time=1188] But in the Christian conception, God really has love as his essence.
[time=1194] Ultimate reality is a community of persons who know and love each other.
[time=1201] I'll let you look that simmer for a second.
[time=1204] Ultimate reality is a community of persons who know and love each other and God invites you into that community by the person and the person of his son, Jesus.
[time=1215] That's what God is like.
[time=1216] It's very exciting.
[time=1219] So here's what I would say in conclusion, in summing up all that.
[time=1222] God is love, character, the character of God.
[time=1225] God is love and has always existed in loving relationship with himself, in community with himself.
[time=1235] This love was ultimately and finally expressed in the self-sacrificing love of Christ.
[time=1243] Incredible, it's incredible.
[time=1247] Tim Keller says, we believe the world was made by a God who is a community of persons who have loved each other for all eternity.
[time=1255] You were made for mutually self-giving, others directed love.
[time=1262] Self-centeredness destroys the fabric of what God has made.
[time=1267] You were made for community.
[time=1268] God himself is a community.
[time=1270] How marvelous.
[time=1271] So we aren't just making this stuff up.
[time=1273] We're trying to keep in step with who God is.
[time=1276] Right out those doors, there are balloons in the hallway and we're gonna invite you after the service to go down to the gymnasium, we have the connect and go fair going on and all of our churches, ministries are represented there and please go.
[time=1287] If you're already involved, go.
[time=1288] If you wanna be involved, go.
[time=1290] If you're here, go.
[time=1292] We have giveaways.
[time=1293] We want you to go and be connected to our church.
[time=1295] To be in community because you're trying to put feet to this.
[time=1298] This isn't just 'cause we say so.
[time=1300] We wanna actually have feet to it.
[time=1301] We wanna be involved in a life group.
[time=1303] Help with kids.
[time=1304] Learn about what's available for your students.
[time=1306] Learn more about our admissions opportunities locally and globally.
[time=1310] Just go, go and check out what's going on in the gymnasium, you won't regret it, I promise.
[time=1314] Go to the Gospel of John, chapter 14, please.
[time=1317] Gospel of John.
[time=1318] Same person.
[time=1320] John wrote these letters, he also wrote a gospel that bears his name.
[time=1325] In John, chapter 14, in verse eight, we read this, this interaction.
[time=1331] John 14, in verse eight.
[time=1334] Philip said to Jesus, Lord, show us the Father.
[time=1338] It's enough for us, that's a reasonable question.
[time=1340] We wanna see God.
[time=1342] Jesus said to him, I love it with you so long and you still don't know me, Philip.
[time=1347] Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.
[time=1350] How can you say, show us the Father?
[time=1353] Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me?
[time=1355] The words I say to you, I don't speak in my own authority, but the Father who dwells in me does his works.
[time=1362] Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me or else believe in account of the works themselves.
[time=1368] Truly, truly, amen, amen.
[time=1372] I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do.
[time=1377] And greater works than these will he do because I am going to the Father.
[time=1381] Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do that the Father be glorified in the Son.
[time=1386] If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.
[time=1389] Verse 15, here we go.
[time=1393] If you love me, you will keep my commandments.
[time=1395] And I will ask the Father and he will give you another helper.
[time=1400] I, Jesus, the Son, will ask the Father and he will give you another helper, the Spirit, to be with you forever.
[time=1406] Even the Spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it neither sees him nor knows him, you know him for he dwells with you and will be in you, in you, wow.
[time=1419] The closest relationship with the Father and the Son leads Jesus to say, whoever has seen me, has seen the Father.
[time=1429] To know and see Jesus is to know and see God.
[time=1433] Side note, that is the exact reason why the authorities wanted to kill Jesus because they knew what he was saying exactly.
[time=1441] To see me is to see God.
[time=1443] If he's not God, then he should have been, he was guilty of blasphemy.
[time=1446] And they knew it, they knew it right away and they were right that what he was saying was that serious.
[time=1453] Jesus is in the Father and the Father is in Jesus,
[time=1459] all three persons in verse 16, all together.
[time=1464] Father, I, the Son, will ask the Father, he will give you a helper, the Holy Spirit, the one who comes alongside.
[time=1471] Jesus will ask the Father and he will send the Spirit, he will be in you.
[time=1477] Friends, the Trinity is not simply something that you need to put in your pocket or a box to check off and say, I believe that truth, good, done.
[time=1486] The Spirit comes to take residence within a person who knows Jesus Christ, who knows God through his son, Jesus.
[time=1493] The Spirit comes to live within that person, not to orbit around that person, to live in that person.
[time=1501] It's not marvelous.
[time=1502] So the Trinity isn't a doctrine to say, yep, got that.
[time=1506] My idea is better than your idea is out there.
[time=1509] All y'all's ideas, whoever's out there.
[time=1511] My ideas are better than yours.
[time=1513] No, you're invited into the life of God, Father, Son and Spirit.
[time=1517] John 14, 25, John, verse 25, John 14, 25.
[time=1522] These things I have spoken to you while I am still with you, but the helper, the Holy Spirit and the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance, all that I have said to you.
[time=1534] Peace I lead with you, my peace I give to you, not as the world gives, do I give to you?
[time=1540] Let not your hearts be troubled, let the mother be afraid.
[time=1544] You heard me say to you, I'm going away, I will come to you.
[time=1547] If you loved me, you would have rejoiced because I am going to the Father, Father is greater than I.
[time=1553] Verse 26, all three persons, the helper, the Holy Spirit, the Father sending in Jesus name, extraordinary.
[time=1563] What John says, oh, by the way, what John says here and in his letters is the fulfillment of what Jesus just said.
[time=1571] The great truth of the authority and the reliability of scriptures is the Holy Spirit, the very words that you are reading with me at this very moment are breathed out by the Holy Spirit, by God himself and they are reliable and they are trustworthy.
[time=1588] And Jesus promised they would be.
[time=1589] He said, John isn't out there just saying, oh, I wish I could remember what Jesus said, someone told me after the first service that I talked to you fast, shocker, I couldn't take notes, Steve, I couldn't do it.
[time=1601] And I'm not happy about that, I can't help it, I'm sorry, I'm doing the best I can.
[time=1607] But when Jesus says the Spirit will come after me and he will help you, he will bring to your mind everything that I said, so you will have an account, so you will have an account, an accurate and reliable account.
[time=1623] Doesn't that give you joy?
[time=1624] The scriptures aren't simply just somebody's best approximation, what might have been said.
[time=1630] That's not what we believe, thanks be to God.
[time=1633] The Spirit brought to John's remembrance and Peter's and Matthews and James and on and on it goes.
[time=1640] All that Jesus said, this is what we are currently reading.
[time=1644] Second Corinthians chapter one, if you're in the gospel of John, turn right, pass the book of Acts, pass the book of Romans.
[time=1651] First Corinthians comes up for second Corinthians.
[time=1654] Second Corinthians chapter one, I love these verses.
[time=1659] I'd say they were a favorite, but you wouldn't believe me, so it's fine.
[time=1662] Second Corinthians chapter one, verse 20.
[time=1666] Take a minute this week and meditate on these verses
[time=1672] and meditation isn't like a mystical thing, it's just time, it's time and pressure, just sit with these verses, read them over and over again.
[time=1681] All the promises of God find their yes in him, that is in Jesus, that is why through him we utter our amen to God for his glory.
[time=1691] It is God who establishes us with you in Christ and has anointed us and who has put his seal on us and given us his spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.
[time=1703] If any other person in Trinity are not God then all those verses fall apart too.
[time=1707] It all falls apart.
[time=1709] Jesus is the final word of God to men.
[time=1713] He is the way into knowing who God is.
[time=1716] Without him we can't know God.
[time=1718] Paul focuses all of history on Christ.
[time=1722] More Christmas in November, here we go.
[time=1724] My grandfather used to make plaques and one of them hangs in my classroom right over there and it says the hinge of history was on the door of a Bethlehem stable and it's true.
[time=1737] The Bible speaks to that truth.
[time=1739] God establishes us in Christ and gives us his spirit as a guarantee that you are in him.
[time=1748] All three persons working together, all three persons working together.
[time=1753] So I'm just simply praying friends, laying out what God says about himself and those that knew Jesus best what they said to.
[time=1760] Go to Hebrews chapter nine, turn right quite a bit.
[time=1764] If you go to James you went too far, Hebrews chapter nine.
[time=1767] If the blood of goats and bulls
[time=1773] and the sprinkling of defiled persons with the ashes of a heifer sanctified for the purification of the flesh, how much more will the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without blemish to God purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
[time=1794] Jesus' blood through the spirit makes us clean before God in the former times.
[time=1801] It was bulls and goats and heifers and stuff.
[time=1803] It never lasted.
[time=1805] It was always partial and it was always temporary.
[time=1808] Not so is Jesus, how much more?
[time=1811] The author of Hebrews says, "His death is the only way to reconcile to God forever." That's good news.
[time=1817] Confessing and believing friends is entering into that.
[time=1821] He is the entrance for all people everywhere into relationship with the three person of God.
[time=1829] The way to know God, the Father, Son and Spirit is through Jesus Christ.
[time=1833] And so the third point of your outline is simply Christ.
[time=1837] Christ, the only way to know God is through the Son who is both submissive to the Father and the Spirit.
[time=1848] His death offered salvation through the Spirit acceptable to the Father.
[time=1854] The only way to know God is through the Son is through the Son who is both submissive to the Father and the Spirit.
[time=1860] His death offered salvation through the Spirit acceptable to the Father.
[time=1867] If there were many people that could save you, if there were many people that were qualified to introduce you to God, to qualify you to get into God's presence, it would be arrogant of Christians to say, Jesus is the only way.
[time=1880] If there were many of them, but there aren't, there is only one person who has ever existed in the world as God in flesh, and his name was Jesus Christ.
[time=1890] So only he can qualify you to enter God's presence.
[time=1894] If others had done that, then we would say, "Take your pick." But there aren't a bunch of people in that category.
[time=1899] There's only one person in that category.
[time=1901] He's the only way, and that's how we believe those things.
[time=1903] Only he's qualified to offer a sacrifice to God that was acceptable to him.
[time=1910] I'll end this morning with Luke chapter 1 and pre-Christmas.
[time=1915] Take that Hallmark channel.
[time=1917] Pre-Christmas, Luke chapter 1.
[time=1920] None of this makes any sense
[time=1927] if God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are not each individually divine.
[time=1934] In the six month, the angel Gabriel, Luke 1, 26, was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David.
[time=1947] Notice how many times Luke insists that Mary is a virgin in these verses.
[time=1952] The virgin's name is Mary, he came to her verse 28 and said, "Greetings O favored one, the Lord is with you." But she was greatly troubled as at the saying and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be.
[time=1963] And the angel said to her, "Don't be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
[time=1966] And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus.
[time=1972] He will be great, and will be called the son of the most high.
[time=1975] And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father, David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom, there will be no end." And Mary said to the angel, "How will this be?
[time=1987] Since I'm a virgin?" And the angel answered her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the most high will overshadow you.
[time=1996] Therefore, the child to be born will be called holy, the son of God." Just verse 35 is enough for me to be persuaded.
[time=2007] In the whole testimony of Scripture, there it is.
[time=2011] The Holy Spirit overshadowed Mary, she's pregnant, who's the baby, the son of God?
[time=2018] That's compelling evidence.
[time=2020] So the fourth one in your notes, as we conclude this morning, is Christmas, pre-Christmas, really.
[time=2026] But Jesus is the son of God, conceived by the Holy Spirit.
[time=2031] The most high God sent the Spirit, the Holy Spirit,
[time=2037] in power to bring his son into the world.
[time=2042] What a marvelous mystery, the incarnation,
[time=2049] the person of God, the nature of God in three persons.
[time=2052] Friends, it has been my great joy this morning to just put on display for you what God says about himself.
[time=2059] Let me pray with you this morning, I wanna pray.
