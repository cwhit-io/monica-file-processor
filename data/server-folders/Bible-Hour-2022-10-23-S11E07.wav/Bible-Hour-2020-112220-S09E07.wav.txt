[time=0] We're going through our statement of faith and looking at the core tenets of what we believe.
[time=6] And we're in week seven today. Today, I want to talk to you about the resurrection of Christ.
[time=11] You know what we need in a time like 2020 church? You say, you don't know me. You don't know what I need. But I know we need this. What we need in a time like 2020 and COVID-19 is we need an Easter
[time=24] Sunday. We need Resurrection Sunday. And the good news is, even though we celebrate it specifically,
[time=30] on certain dates, once a year, every day is Resurrection Sunday when we know Jesus, because he's still alive. And I get the honor and joy and privilege of just walking in through 1 Corinthians 15 today as we look at something that we believe and hold to so tightly. And it's
[time=45] the foundation of everything. And it is the Resurrection of Christ. 1 Corinthians chapter 15, let's meet there today. And as we've been doing through this series, we've looked at the authority of Scripture. We've looked at how Christ is deified. He is all God. And he became fully man for us.
[time=61] We've looked at how all of this applies to us in the sinfulness of our humanity, salvation by grace through faith. And then last week, thanks to Pastor Steve for walking us through the nature of God, the Trinity. I gave him a real easy one for you to look at. And he did an outstanding job as we looked at the character of God. And today, I want to talk to you about the resurrection.
[time=80] And every week we're looking at our statement of faith to start. So let's do that together.
[time=84] We believe the literal bodily resurrection of Jesus is the foundation of our faith.
[time=90] Following His resurrection, Jesus ascended to heaven and will return someday to make all things
[time=97] new. And now let's go to 1 Corinthians 15. I'll read the first two verses just to set the tone for several statements about the resurrection that I believe will be a blessing to you today. And so whether you're in the room, you're on a screen, you can write it in the chat. If you're ready for the word, say I believe. Say it out loud. I believe. Write it in the chat. If you
[time=116] believe what I just said, and now I'm going to give you reasons to hold to it today. Let's dig into God's word. 1 Corinthians 15, the first two verses, the Apostle Paul says, "Now I would remind you
[time=126] brothers of the gospel I preach to you which you received in which you stand, and by which you're
[time=133] being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preach to you unless you believed in vain." And so let's
[time=139] start with this introductory couple of sentences here. First of all that verse 1, Paul says, "I want to remind you." And really that's why we're doing this series, take the journey with us, and digging into the core tenets of what we believe. These are, listen, eternal things that you can hold on to
[time=154] in an earthly world that's going like this, they stay the same. And Paul is doing the same thing.
[time=159] He wants to remind us of the gospel he preached in which you received. That's my prayer for all of us. My prayers that you would not just hear the good news, but that you would receive it, that you would take it to heart, that you would be able to live it out. And then the latter part of verse 1, what would you do then in which you now stand? That you wouldn't just hear it, you would receive it and take it to heart, and then you would plant your life on these truths,
[time=183] these eternal truths that will never ever go away. They'll never fade while the earth comes and goes
[time=189] and governments come and go. And while all these things, they're so uncertain in our life, these things stay the same. I've prayed for you that you would be able to stand on them as Paul writes about. By which verse 2 you're being saved? We're saved from hell, we're saved from sin,
[time=204] we're saved from wrath, we're saved from separation from God, we're saved from death, and aren't you glad of that? It's not possible in and of ourselves but Jesus. But God, Ephesians
[time=214] chapter 2, we spent two weeks going through it, looking at what we're saved from and even what we're saved for. And I'm glad that we have a God who meant us there. And as we get into verse 3,
[time=224] there's really an answer to the most existential question any of us could ever ask,
[time=230] meaning the most existence driven. Why am I here? A purpose-filled question that we could ever ask that was most important in life. But I was thinking about that this week and I remember a time my son who's now 10 years old, which is crazy how fast time goes by. He was, I don't know, three or four and I was a big stack of books at home. I was in seminary and reading stuff and studying and he came up as a three or four year old would do. And I still remember him saying, "Wow, did you read all that, Dad?" And I was like, "Yep." And I said, "Yeah, I did." And I told him,
[time=260] which just did this to him, but it was just for my own good that, you know, I was the kid who didn't like to read in high school. And so now God's made me read all these. So if you don't like to read, you should start reading now. God might just bring it back, just a little tip for those of you who know extra charge for that. But then he asked the question, did my little three or four year old son. He said, "So you got to know all that?" And I said, "Well, yeah, some of that." And he
[time=282] said, "Well, what's the biggest thing you got to know?" Best question that any of us could ever ask.
[time=289] It's the same question that in 1 Corinthians 15 that Paul is seeking to answer it. And I'll tell you, you want to know what I said to him? It's a good answer, by the way. If you don't know what to say, and it's a big question, this is a good one-word answer. I said, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus is
[time=302] the most important thing that I've got to know." And he went, "Okay." And he ran away. I remember that,
[time=308] but this is what Paul is walking us into. Look at verse 3, and we'll see that this is what's most
[time=315] important, my friends. Listen, what's the most important thing we could know? Paul tells us, verse 3, "For I delivered to you as of first importance, as of first importance, what I also
[time=325] received, that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures." Of first importance, listen, when we don't know what's going to happen with the election, we don't know what has or hasn't, we'll want how we look at it. We don't know a lot of things right now, right? We don't know what coronavirus is going to look like next week. Listen, we don't even know what church is going to look like next week, right? Everything's constantly shifting and changing. And listen, God wants you to stay focused in a time where everything around you is seeking to divide and distract you. God is wanting you to hear today. He sent me to be a big mouth in your life, to just scream to you that of first importance is the fact that
[time=364] Jesus died, was buried, and rose again. All of this other stuff will go away, but that is of first
[time=371] importance. And so may we hold on to that, and what does it look like to hold on to that is what we'll dig into today as we dig through. This is the most crucial news of all time, and to give us this news, what Paul does in verses three through eight is he summarizes an early church creed,
[time=387] we sang parts of that even earlier in the service, but there was an early church creed that they would recite and say over and over to remind them of the essence of their faith, of the things that they've got to hold on to. And today we still are reading about studying and believing the same
[time=402] thing some 2000 plus years later. Why? Because it's still true, and we can still hold on to it. And
[time=410] it's beautifully written as Paul says in verse three and verse four, in accordance with the scriptures.
[time=415] Everything around you has changed, but the word of God has not. The word of God has not changed nor
[time=421] will it ever change. Jesus has not changed nor will he ever change. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And the Old Testament told us, I just wrote down a few of the things. We're going to look at prophecy as we go into the Christmas season, but just to give you a sneak peek, wrote down a few. The Old Testament, hundreds of years, and in some cases, even thousands of years before the events actually happened, told us that these things were going to happen. Things like the fact that Jesus would be a man born of a virgin woman in a place called Bethlehem,
[time=449] that he would live a life without sin, that he would be betrayed by a close friend for 30 pieces
[time=455] of silver. And these are not things that we read about after the fact they're before. And it's just amazing, astounding that he'd be crucified as the method of his execution, that he'd be laid in the tomb of a rich man, that he would rise from the dead after three days. He'd take away sin and conquer death once and for all. And it all happened. And I praise God that we can hold on to that today.
[time=476] So the most important thing of first importance is that Jesus died was buried and rose again.
[time=481] And Paul gives us five important statements about the resurrection that I want to walk us through.
[time=485] The first one's in verse three. Write this down. Jesus died. Jesus died. Really complex stuff here
[time=491] this morning. So hang in there with me. But listen, we got to remember the essence of our faith. Number one is that Jesus died. Verse three, for I delivered you as a first importance, that which I also received.
[time=501] That Christ died for our sins and accordance with the Scriptures. I know for some of us, we take for granted the fact that Jesus died. But I can tell you that there are popular books, films, articles, and even components of religions like Islam that would claim that Jesus never
[time=517] died. And if he didn't die, he couldn't be raised from the dead. So this is an important fact that we must hold on to. Jesus, I want to remind you though, historically, biblically all of the above.
[time=528] I'm going to speak to those of you who the Bible is sufficient for you. It is for us at Black Hawk.
[time=532] We believe it. Hold to the inerrant word of God. It's totally true and trustworthy in all that it affirms and everything in our lives should be governed by its contents every day.
[time=539] But some of you listen in our ever-growing online family. There are many of you who don't believe that. So I'm going to speak to you from both the biblical and the historical extra-biblical evidence today. And I pray that it'll be a blessing to you. And you should know that historically,
[time=554] Jesus underwent, think about this, a severe flogging that would have killed most men and did kill a lot of men throughout history. And all of this, he found himself in shock bleeding
[time=564] to death. He was hungry. He was dehydrated. And he had a sleepless night. And then he was tasked to carry a Roman crossbar to which he was nailed by a professional Roman executioner
[time=575] through his hands and his feet. After which he breathed his last, they stuck a spear into his
[time=582] side under his ribcage, piercing his heart. And out of his body flowed blood and water, verifying beyond any shadow of a doubt that my Jesus died for me. He died. And if the story
[time=594] ended there, my tears would start and they wouldn't stop. But the story didn't stop there. My Jesus
[time=600] died for us. Why did he have to die? Paul tells us in verse three, four sins. The penalty of sin
[time=606] is death. We have all sinned and fall short of the glory of God. The penalty of sin is death.
[time=612] And Jesus died for my sin. He was the sinless substitute and sacrifice for my sin and the sin
[time=618] of the world. The historical fact is that Jesus died. The theological implication for me
[time=624] is that it was for me and for you and our sin. Jesus took my place so I could have his. Jesus
[time=632] died. Verse three. Number two, Jesus was buried in verse four. Look at verse four with me. Jesus
[time=638] was buried. That he was buried, verse four, Paul writes, that he was raised on the third day in
[time=644] accordance with the Scriptures. That he was buried. So let's talk about that. This process, for us, we would call it something like a mummification process. When they would bury people in Jesus' time, there would be some hundred-ish pounds of spices and linens that were involved in the process.
[time=659] It was a significant kind of process that they went through. And so he was buried. And it's important to remember Jesus was homeless. He didn't have a place to lay his head. So he didn't have, it was really the rich people that had a tomb predetermined for themselves. So Jesus didn't have that. So a very rich, very prominent public figure named Joseph of Arimathea said,
[time=679] I will give my tomb because he could have a tomb. I'll give my tomb to Jesus, probably more like a private, maybe secret disciple of his, would he have been? Who knows exactly all the details. But
[time=690] he gave to him his tomb. And Jesus was laid there. And that's so important for us for a number of
[time=696] different reasons. It reminds us of what Jesus walked through. Number one reminds us also that this would have been a very easily verified public tomb. And boy, that tomb was going to get a lot
[time=708] more public three days later. And if you know the end of the story, can I get a name in? You know why. So it was an easily identified, verified tomb, but secondly and even more importantly, verified the prophecy that was spoken in Isaiah 53 hundreds and hundreds of years before Jesus
[time=723] even came that Jesus would be buried among the rich. And it even happened. So even in his burial,
[time=729] we see the prophecies that Jesus died. Number two, Jesus was buried. Same verse verse four that number three, Jesus rose. Write that down. Here's where it gets good. The story stopped there. We'd
[time=740] be in a mess, but it didn't stop there. Verse four, the end of it, he says, he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures, Jesus rose. This makes Jesus unlike anyone who's ever lived. This makes, think about it, this makes Jesus distinct from and superior to any other
[time=756] religious teacher, any other leader, any other world dominator. No one can hold a candle to my
[time=763] Jesus because he said, I will rise again and conquer death and he pulled it off.
[time=769] That's my God. And he's superior to every other figure. And all of Christianity hinges on this
[time=775] one fact. The resurrection is not true. First Corinthians 15, we won't get to these verses today, but read the rest of chapter 15. Paul says, if the resurrection is not true, then not only is our preaching in vain, so is your faith. You're living all this for nothing. It's a lie.
[time=788] C.S. Lewis said, Jesus is either a lunatic, a lie, or a Lord. There's not really other choices.
[time=794] And I believe he's Lord. And I believe he proved it. And I'm going to walk you through some reasons why we can have a lot of disagreements, church over a lot of different secondary issues. Not this
[time=804] one, though. Everything hinges on the resurrection. That's why we're spending our time on it today.
[time=809] And Jesus and Paul and Peter and so many other writers of the New Testament and people throughout history worked really hard to provide us with verifiable evidence of the literal physical bodily
[time=820] resurrection of Jesus. And we believe in that resurrection with no apologies here at Blackhawk.
[time=825] And our hope is hinging on it. And I would say to those of you who would say, you know, I don't hold to the Bible like Blackhawk does, but you're listening. And this is a place you can belong, even before you believe like we do. We are so glad you're listening. If you're watching this online, thank you for giving us a few moments. So today, what I want to do, I'm going to give you plenty of biblical evidence. But I also want to give you some extra biblical evidence as well. I want to show you some things practically. I want to show you some things in history, a little bit of an apologetics kind of sermon that will help you and equip you to both believe what you believe, but then be able to articulate it and give you some more research opportunities for those of you who want to dig even deeper. But we don't ostracize anybody who would say, you know, I just, I can't get there. That's why I want to share with you for both believers, non-believers, anybody who's digging in and listening to this today, a lot of evidence because listen, the evidence abounds.
[time=872] I'm so thankful for that. So let's dig in. I want to give you a few things today. Number one, some objections. I want to give you four objections to the resurrection. There are many. And I'd start by saying that as lovingly as I can, if you do object to the resurrection, the burden of proof is
[time=887] on you because the evidence is massive. And I want to walk you through what some of the evidence
[time=893] would look like. The swoon theory is one that Jesus didn't actually die. He passed out. He swooned.
[time=899] So he didn't really die. Therefore, he didn't really come back to life. And really, it's not physically plausible because of the previous facts and even the history that will show you some of that. And I'll address some more of that in a few moments coming up. Number two, and this is the most popular one, perhaps, is that there was a stolen body, that the disciples stole his body.
[time=916] I want to pause and say, I'm going to go real fast on these. And you may not catch them all.
[time=920] And that's okay. They're in your app. So you go to Black Hawk Church app. All of these are written down for you there. I know sometimes you're like, slow down. I just got a lot of what I tell you. It's exciting. So I do want to go through it fast for you to do a swoon theory. The disciples stole his body. In fact, Matthew 28, verses 13 through 15, tells us that this was a theory that
[time=939] was concocted by the Romans and others even right after the resurrection. Just go tell people the disciples stole his body. The last I checked there was Roman guards, a big huge stone and doesn't seem
[time=951] real plausible that that would even happen. And I'll give you more reasons. I believe that in a moment. A third one is a new one to me as I kind of re-researched some of this this week is that there was a lookalike, whether it was a twin. And this has gotten a lot of traction throughout the years that Jesus himself didn't actually die, but a substitute died in his place. Find that very
[time=969] difficult to believe knowing that his own mother was there at the further cross, his brothers, his disciples, and people were around that saw him. I'm pretty sure that would have gotten squashed quickly. The fourth one is hallucinations that a lot of people they think they saw Jesus, but they really were hallucinating. That's the essence and kind of a lot of the theories and objections
[time=988] come back to that. There are others. There are plenty of others, but I want to start with those.
[time=991] And I want to give you some practical evidence. These are all extra biblical things. Not in the Bible, just things that you can look to in research and then we'll dig into Paul's biblical evidence.
[time=1000] Some practical evidence. Number one is there was a change in worship times. For thousands of years, God's people worship on Saturday until the resurrection. It wasn't until the resurrection
[time=1011] that that shifted to Sunday. This is documented throughout history, even in some sources that I'll give to you in just a moment you can dig into and look at on your own, but that changed to Sundays. And what day is it again today? Oh, it's Sunday. We're still doing the same thing today.
[time=1025] Imagine that. It's a beautiful picture of practically how the resurrection was a defining moment that
[time=1031] has changed everything in a practical sense. And number two would be the transformation of the disciples of Jesus. These are knuckleheads, you guys. They were cowards and they became fearless,
[time=1044] courageous leaders of God's church who were martyred for their faith. That alone, historically
[time=1050] proven, tells me that there's something to the resurrection and it all changed at the resurrection.
[time=1055] The loyalty of Jesus' disciples is another practical evidence in that there are, get this modern-day Messiahs. There were in Jesus' day, in Paul's day as he wrote this, there are in our day, modern-day
[time=1067] Messiahs are things that claim to be Lord, claim to be our deliverer, claim to be the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords that take our focus in our life, modern-day Messiahs. If you notice a few of those things that people hang their hat on this other than Jesus, there were back in history, there are today, yet his disciples stayed truly loyal to Jesus and people still are doing it. Today,
[time=1086] people are still being martyred for their faith. Lastly, and this is my favorite one of the practical evidence, is that Christianity has exploded for centuries. People have tried to shut Christianity
[time=1096] down following Jesus down for a long time to no avail. And we're still here today, even in coronavirus as a result. And you're still hearing this message even during perilous times because of
[time=1108] that fact. Let me give you some historical evidence. I'm just going to give you mainly some names that you can research throughout this upcoming week. Number one is Jewish and world history. You'll find mainly only these not plausible evidences that the resurrection is not true,
[time=1124] but history constantly comes back to a reality of a resurrection. And I go, by the way, this week to get you resurrection ready. You feel in resurrection ready? It didn't feel like a resurrection season, but I believe you're going to feel it when you leave this place today. Number two is Josephus. It's an extra biblical early source where you find a lot of credence given to.
[time=1143] There's a lot of things that are quoted and misquoted even about him, but there's plenty there that you can find where he alone pointed to the resurrection and the historicity of it. He acknowledged Christ
[time=1154] as risen in Messiah. Pliny the Younger as well. He wrote a letter around 111 AD to Emperor Trajan
[time=1162] about Christians, and he's stating how their worship time had changed, how they're worshiping on a Sunday, but he also references, you guessed it, the resurrection. And these people, they don't say, and I believe it, but they reference it as this historical fact, and you're going to see why as we go into some of the biblical evidence as we move forward. Sootonius is another one.
[time=1182] It's a Roman historian. He wrote a biography on Emperor Nero, one of the cruelest emperors ever, and he mentions the persecutions of Christians that came with that, but also, you guessed it, a risen Savior that they were worshiping. Tacitus, who was a Roman senator, you can write his name
[time=1199] down, Tacitus, Roman senator and historian, so much comes from him as well. Then modern
[time=1205] day apologists, I'll give you a few names, I'll quote from a couple of them in a moment, Lee Strobel, I'm about to read a quote from him. Frank Turek, who is in Fort Wayne, Mr. Bob's back
[time=1215] here, was a part of that. I was so thankful he was here in our city, a great well-renowned apologist at William Lane Craig. These are a few names you can research and dig into, and they'll give you some great resources. But Lee Strobel was an atheist until he saw his wife come to Christ, and this atheist then said, "Well, I'm going to set out to disprove it. I'm going to do all the research to show what I'm seeing him alive," but he admitted later that I saw such a
[time=1240] change in her that he was intrigued. He said this about this evidence, this extra biblical evidence.
[time=1245] He said it was the evidence from science and history. Didn't say the Bible. Science and history that prompted me to abandon my atheism and become a Christian. And I'm so thankful that even outside
[time=1257] of the Bible we see that Jesus is risen. But now let me take you to number four. Jesus died, Jesus was buried, Jesus rose. Number four, Jesus appeared. Verses five through eight. Jesus appeared.
[time=1269] Let's read verses five through eight. You guys doing okay? You're going to be in the resurrection ready by the time I'm done with you today. Let's dig in. I'm about to preach now.
[time=1277] This is my favorite section of the sermon today. Verses five through eight. You ready on line? I hope so. Let's do it. Write it in the chat. I'm ready. Verse five, that he appeared. Say it with me, that he appeared to Cephas. This is Simon Peter then to the 12, verse six. Then he appeared
[time=1293] to more than 500 brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive though some have fallen asleep.
[time=1299] Then he appeared to James then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born,
[time=1305] he appeared also to me. Then verse nine, Paul reminds us, but I'm the least of the apostles.
[time=1312] It's only by his grace that I'm even on these lists. But let's go through this because in verses five through eight, we have four categories of eyewitness evidence. I want to give it to you.
[time=1320] Ready for it? Number one comes from verse five is Peter and the disciples. He appeared to Cephas,
[time=1326] Peter and the disciples. Now this shows us, do these appearances, these four appearances of eyewitnesses, that this was public news. This wasn't some private conspiracy theory. This was
[time=1337] Facebook worthy. This was front page of the newspaper. This is worldwide kind of news that spread like
[time=1343] wildfire because how could it be that a man could call his own death and resurrection and pull it
[time=1349] off? Yet it seems it may have happened. And so it spread like wildfire, especially when he appeared and he appeared to Peter and think about Peter. Peter was a coward. Peter was this loudmouth
[time=1360] fisherman knucklehead coward, but he became the courageous leader of God's church. Two books of
[time=1366] the Bible are written by him. He preached Jesus at Pentecost. He preached the resurrection message
[time=1372] until he was killed for it and crucified upside down for doing so many scholars believe. Now listen,
[time=1379] let me ask you, do you think that someone would be crucified in such a manner, giving his life in such a manner for a lie? I would probably squeal before I got to that point. Can I get an amen?
[time=1388] But he didn't. This coward was transformed into the courageous leader of God's church
[time=1395] because of the resurrection. Everything changed at the resurrection and the disciples like Thomas doubted until they saw the scars, till they saw him. They were eyewitness people. And people who
[time=1406] were in criminology and have the background, they'll typically tell you that there's three things or a combination thereof that would cause conspiracy or crime and it's usually money, sex, and power.
[time=1417] And I want to ask you, when you think of the disciples, think of people like Peter, first of all, it's pretty clear that scripture and history tells us they didn't get a lot of ladies for their life choices. They certainly didn't get a lot of money. They lost and quit their jobs to follow
[time=1431] Jesus and the power was totally stripped away. They were excommunicated from the synagogues and the temples and ultimately martyred and killed for their faith. So what is it that motivated them to live in this way? And do you realize, I want you to think about this, a journey through history, that there were thousands of Christians, thousands of Christians before a line of the New Testament
[time=1451] was written, recorded for us. Did you know that? And so a lot of times when we look at this, we think,
[time=1457] well, the New Testament shows that there's a resurrection. No, there would be no New Testament if there was no resurrection. It's the people who saw it with their eyes that recorded what happened, that the resurrection was a reality that led to the New Testament. We had the Old Testament
[time=1472] then and they were building their lives and looking for the Messiah that was prophesied, but then He came and get this when you think about the New Testament. The New Testament did not create the resurrection. For those of you who would say that, well, I can't just believe it because the Bible says it, to which I would say to you, the New Testament did not create the resurrection. The resurrection created the New Testament and the writers of the New Testament wrote it down because they saw it and it happened and now we have scripture to go back to in addition to practical and historical facts and archaeology that shows us that all of this stuff is not a myth
[time=1503] that it is true and I believe it and I'm excited about it and we need to be excited about it and
[time=1510] today's time today. Verse 6 we see the second appearance and that is to the crowd of more than 500 in verse 6 to this crowd of more than 500. 500 people in a place like this now you would have
[time=1522] to realize in a rural area like this appearance would have been that gathered a crowd of over 500
[time=1528] people that would be newsworthy as well. That'd be a pretty public thing. That'd be front page newspaper and that's happened and Paul says now these people are still alive they're in verse 6 that you know some have fallen asleep I mean some have died but these people are alive and what he's saying is I'm not telling you this hundreds of years down the road where all of these stories have been concocted and all these myths have come together. He's saying to the people to which he's writing it. Listen these people are alive go down the street and talk to them. There's over 500 he appeared to at one time go talk to them. You can see for yourself and then we now have it recorded
[time=1562] from these eyewitnesses to hear the exact same message. What a beautiful opportunity that we
[time=1568] have and Lee Strobel I mentioned him a moment ago as he went on his journey specifically about verse 6 and the appearance to over 500 he went to a psychologist friend I'll quote from what he said here in his writings and said if 500 people claimed to see Jesus after he died this verse 6
[time=1585] is it possible that it was just a hallucination one of those objections we talked about earlier that's what he asked him and the psychologist said that hallucinations are an individual event
[time=1595] and so here's the quote. So if 500 people have the same hallucination that's a bigger miracle than
[time=1601] the resurrection. Wow even in old ancient history extra biblical evidence bringing it to the biblical
[time=1611] evidence people who saw it we can see that Jesus rose from the dead. He appeared to Peter in the disciples the crowd of more than 500 the third one is verse 7 this is my favorite one that he lists out he appears to Jesus brother James and the apostles Jesus had a couple of brothers James
[time=1628] and Jude so how many of you have brothers lift your hand if you got a brother lift your hand at home as well if you have a brother keep them up that's most of us okay now put your hands down how many of you worship your brother and call him God exactly and James and and Jude we have no
[time=1644] record of them during Jesus earthly life and ministry we have no record of them worshiping their
[time=1650] brother as God or claiming or believing that he was God now no doubt they knew something was up
[time=1657] with this guy right if you had a brother go back to your brother you got him in your mind drawing back up what if he never sinned you're like that wouldn't be my brother
[time=1666] but that's the brother that they had and they've watched this and then Jesus has now appeared
[time=1673] to James and notice that when you study history when you study scripture that it wasn't until the resurrection until after the resurrection that they then worshiped their brother and claimed that he was God James became the leader and pastor of the church in Jerusalem and
[time=1691] he gave his life preaching that his brother died and rose again and that he is fully God now I don't
[time=1699] know about you but if anything convinces me there's something to this story that alone would do just
[time=1705] that James gave his life to preach that message and then verse 8 we see the fourth and that is Paul
[time=1712] Paul is Jesus enemy he persecuted the church verse 8 we see he also appeared to me and he said as
[time=1719] one untimely born he's saying I don't deserve to be on this list I don't know why Jesus would choose to appear to me last of all is one untimely born he also appeared to me verse 8 and then in verses 9 through 11 he goes through this list of why he shouldn't be he shouldn't be on the list and is only by God's grace because Paul was an enemy of Jesus but after seeing the resurrected Jesus his whole life was converted and changed Paul went from being a murderer of Christians
[time=1744] to the pastor of Christians think about this application of that that Paul went from killing Christians to preaching their funerals and preaching about the resurrected Jesus as their pastor
[time=1756] what a transformation what a change a Jesus appeared to him Paul gave his life to this message
[time=1762] of resurrection he was shipwrecked he was homeless he was beaten he was left for dead he was impoverished he was on the run and he was in prison all for one reason why because he wouldn't shut up about this message that Jesus is risen he wouldn't stop he wouldn't stop talking and therefore he went
[time=1779] through that life wouldn't we be foolish my friends to believe people who didn't see it over the people who recorded it for us that walked with Jesus and talked with Jesus and that
[time=1790] leads me to the last thing you've hopefully been encouraged today hopefully been inspired today hopefully been equipped today hopefully your your knowledge has been built up but knowledge has a way of sometimes puffing you up church so now that you know these things what do we do with them that leads me to number five I don't want us just to be puffed up with knowledge I want us to go apply and live out that knowledge in our life and so today we've got to know Paul's fifth statement is that Jesus is coming back he's coming back you can write down verses 20 through 24
[time=1818] Paul talks about this in some more detail but I want to read to you verses 50 through 58 of first Corinthians chapter 15 because Jesus is coming back this is where it gets real for us we're already
[time=1829] not yet you ever felt that tension we already know what's coming but we're not yet there and seeing it all because we're still in this flesh suit and 2020 is happening right now and so we know this but let me read verse 50 through 58 Paul says I tell you this brothers flesh and blood cannot
[time=1844] inherit the kingdom of God nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable behold I tell you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet for that trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised imperishable this is
[time=1860] the results of what happens and God agrees by sending thunder to let his voice ring true in our hearts today in this place this is what's going to happen for those of us who know him verse 53
[time=1872] for the perishable body must put on the imperishable and the mortal body must put on immortality when the perishable puts on the imperishable and the mortal puts on immortality then shall come to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory oh death where is your victory oh death
[time=1889] where is your sting the sting of death is sin and the power of sin is the law but thanks be to God
[time=1895] who gives us victory through our Lord Jesus Christ and verse 58 is the what you should do with it
[time=1904] verse verse 58 therefore if it's there if you see therefore it's there for a reason so listen up
[time=1910] here it is therefore my beloved brothers be steadfast immovable always abounding in the work of the
[time=1918] Lord knowing that the Lord in the Lord your labor is not in vain some of you want to give up because
[time=1925] you think his pursuit of faith is in vain but I came to say today it's not so I want to challenge you today to know that this statement is true that the resurrection of Jesus was the death of death
[time=1936] the resurrection of Jesus was the death of death and for those of you who struggle with grieving
[time=1942] and losing people during the holidays I can't say this without speaking directly to you because that's most of us in one way or another but some of you live that so deeply I want to read you the same Paul who wrote this passage in 1st Corinthians wrote 1st Thessalonians 4 13 through 14 and he
[time=1958] said but we do not want you to be uninformed brothers about those who are asleep that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope for since we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so
[time=1970] through Jesus God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep with Jesus and his resurrection
[time=1978] it was the death of death that means it was the death of mourning means it was the death of grief means it was the death of pain and even though we don't feel the fruit of that to the fullest extent just yet we can know and believe that it's true and we can hang our hat there so today I
[time=1993] ask you my friends this closing question and this question is of first importance as Paul put it this week how can you be steadfast 1st 58 how can you be steadfast knowing Jesus is alive in a world
[time=2005] that is steadily trying to distract you I want to say that again how can you be steadfast this week in a world is steadily trying to distract you I'm going to submit to you that we need to stand on
[time=2016] the resurrection of Jesus and some of you know it but do you know it are you living it from head to
[time=2022] heart to hands wherever you're out in your life may we live as though that truth is the transforming
[time=2028] eternal life and eternity altering truth that it is it has been for centuries it will be for centuries
[time=2035] to come and it will be for all of eternity Jesus is risen I'm going to ask you to buy your heads
[time=2041] close your eyes as you dig into that question of how you can be steadfast and immovable about abounding in the work of the Lord knowing it's not in vain how is God encouraging you how is God answering that question in your life and some of you would say I just don't know that I know that I know that I know that I've trusted in that resurrection I've trusted in that Jesus to bring salvation into my life today and if that is you there's no
