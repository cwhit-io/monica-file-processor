[time=0] Today we're continuing this series, "Take the Journey with Us." You can go to takethejourneywithus.com to start a journey that we have just custom made to help you walk through next steps, wherever those next steps might lead you.
[time=12] But we've been going through this series, looking at some core tenets of the statement of faith that we hold to, things that we can be unified by in a world that is constantly pulling us apart.
[time=22] And so today I'll lead us to the study of the role of the Holy Spirit.
[time=27] You may have noticed the theme today in our time of worship.
[time=30] The role of the Holy Spirit, I want to invite you to Romans 8.
[time=34] Romans 8 will be our guide.
[time=37] But before we dig in there, I want to tell you a story.
[time=40] It's a true story of a place in West Texas that has become known as the Yates oil field.
[time=46] Perhaps you have heard of it.
[time=47] It became one of the most prolific oil fields in West Texas for decades, stayed on the top 10 list of the production of oil.
[time=56] But the beginnings of that story is a fascinating story.
[time=60] It was during the Great Depression season of the 1930s.
[time=64] And a sheep rancher, a sheep farmer, was living there on this field that we now know to be Yates oil field.
[time=73] And it's IRA Yates.
[time=74] And the interesting part of the story is that times were very tough for everybody during that time.
[time=79] But for the Yates, they were looking at the potential of losing their ranch, where they were farming and where they had their sheep.
[time=87] And they were living even on government subsidy.
[time=90] During this time until one day, a group of oil workers came and there was a knock on the door.
[time=95] And they asked Mr. Yates if he would be willing to sign a lease so that they could drill into his field because they think that there's a possibility there could be oil there.
[time=105] And so he signed the lease.
[time=106] And long story short, the first well that they drilled, some 1,000 feet down, started producing oil like crazy.
[time=113] And it produced oil at the rate of about 80,000 barrels per day.
[time=118] And the crazy part of that story, and you can look it up, it's fascinating to know that it became one of the greatest producing fields for oil in all of the United States.
[time=128] In fact, later into the story, it was still producing a flow of about 125,000 barrels, even 30 years into the drilling process.
[time=139] Incredible story.
[time=140] Can you imagine being this guy, though, living in poverty, living in poverty, but the whole time being a multi-millionaire?
[time=152] I'm convinced that a lot of us do the same thing spiritually.
[time=157] I'm convinced that a lot of us are walking around in spiritual poverty.
[time=162] We're drained, we're empty, we feel so impoverished in a year like this.
[time=168] But the whole time, we're living on, we're sitting on an oil field that is so ready to well up within us.
[time=175] And it comes from the power of God's Holy Spirit.
[time=179] And so I get to share with you today, it's a privilege to get to from Romans 8 with that passage as our guide today, how you are a multi-millionaire.
[time=188] Maybe you've been living in poverty just because you didn't realize what you had access to, but as a child of God, we have the role of the Holy Spirit in our life in such a way that makes us so rich spiritually that will blow your mind.
[time=201] And I believe you can get filled up in this place today because he's already there.
[time=204] You're already full if you know Jesus.
[time=205] And I want to show you that today, as we do each week, let me start with our statement of faith regarding the Holy Spirit.
[time=211] We believe that the Holy Spirit of God shows us our need for repentance upon salvation, in dwells and equips us with spiritual gifts and the power to follow Jesus.
[time=223] Grow as God's children and make disciples.
[time=226] That is our statement of faith regarding the role of the Holy Spirit.
[time=230] And today I want to remind you that the Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity.
[time=234] He is our God, he is our guarantee, and he is our guide.
[time=236] And I pray right now in the name of Jesus that he'll guide us into his word in a way that will just fill you up.
[time=241] So Romans 8 is going to be our guide today.
[time=243] And it's blowing my mind as I've studied this week because Romans 8, the first 17 verses really just gives us this even chronological walkthrough of the statement of faith that we have as a church.
[time=254] So I want to show you how the six things that we've looked at so far and our statement of faith, how the role of the Holy Spirit plays a key role in each of those six things.
[time=264] And then I'll even add a seventh.
[time=266] Yes, you heard it right, a seven point sermon.
[time=268] So buckle up and let's get ready and use your app today.
[time=271] I've just felt led of the Holy Spirit this week to read to you about as many scriptures that I think I've ever read to you, maybe in a sermon in all my life.
[time=279] And so they're all listed in our app.
[time=280] You go to the sermon notes on our app, just download that on the website.
[time=284] You can find our sermon notes and they're all listed there in case you miss any of them.
[time=288] So let's dig into Romans 8.
[time=290] We'll start with number one and that is the authority of Scripture.
[time=294] And so the authority of Scripture, write this down.
[time=297] Number one, the Holy Spirit sets us free to understand the point of Scripture.
[time=306] And we see this clearly seen in Romans 8 verses one and two.
[time=310] Are you ready for the word today, Black Hawk?
[time=312] Let's dig in, whatever noise is going on at home or around your screen or wherever you might be, we are going to let the word of God scream loud today.
[time=319] Let's dig in.
[time=320] Verses one and two, we see the Holy Spirit's role, particularly with Scripture.
[time=324] There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[time=329] Verse two, for the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law
[time=336] of sin and death.
[time=337] And before we even get into the next verses, let's talk about what this law of the Spirit of life and the law of sin and death and, you know, what does that have to do with intersecting the word of God?
[time=346] And what's the Holy Spirit's role and all that?
[time=348] Perhaps you feel confused by verses like that.
[time=350] I know I have been at many points of my faith journey, but what we see is what the law is there to do.
[time=356] And in the authority of Scripture, the Holy Spirit gives us clarity.
[time=360] The Holy Spirit sets us free.
[time=362] There is therefore now no condemnation.
[time=364] But then it goes, verse two, into this, the law of the Spirit of life, the law of sin and death.
[time=369] How do those go together?
[time=370] What does the Holy Spirit do to set us free to understand it?
[time=372] And I want to remind you today that the law, before Jesus came, the Old Testament and specifically
[time=378] your first five books, the Pentateuch, the Torah, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, was where a lot of people's understanding of the law started because that is where the word of God began.
[time=388] And then thanks to Jesus, it expanded into a new covenant in which we now live.
[time=393] And so if you want to know some depth in that, we lean on the Holy Spirit because he illuminates that for us.
[time=398] Paul writes about this and shows us that the law was given primarily to show us how much
[time=404] we need a Savior.
[time=405] And so I want to read to you Galatians chapter three, Paul writes this to us in verses 21
[time=411] through 26.
[time=413] And hang with me through this and we'll break it apart.
[time=415] Verses 21 through 26, Galatians 3.
[time=418] Is the law then contrary to the promises of God?
[time=421] Certainly not.
[time=422] For if a law had been given that could give life, then righteousness would indeed be by the law, but the Scripture imprisoned everything under sin as showing us how sinful that we
[time=432] truly are.
[time=433] Why?
[time=434] So that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe, verse 23.
[time=440] Now before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the coming
[time=447] faith would be revealed.
[time=448] So then the law was our guardian until Christ came in order that we might be justified by
[time=455] faith, verse 25.
[time=457] But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God through faith.
[time=465] Paul is reminding us and showing us here what the purpose of the law was and then what the purpose of Christ was.
[time=471] And you see Paul talking about that same thing in Romans 8 verses 1 and 2, particularly verse number 2, that the law was given to show us this tension between what we've looked at in recent months as the flesh and the fruit of the Spirit, the spirit of God and the fruit of the Spirit of God and the fruit of self.
[time=488] Because sin and death comes from the fruit of heaven.
[time=491] Sin and death comes from the fruit of me because the fruit of me is sin and the law shows me how sinful I am.
[time=497] Have you ever read the Word of God and left it going, I've got a long way to go.
[time=503] I think I'm there every single time.
[time=505] I don't think, I know, if I read it with an open heart in mind, I'm there every single time because the Word of God shows us and points to Jesus who is the theme of every book of
[time=514] the Bible.
[time=515] And Paul is reminding us of that fact because Jesus came and fulfilled all of the requirements
[time=522] of the law that we could never fulfill so that we could become children of God.
[time=526] And that's the law of sin and death versus the law of freedom, the law of the Spirit and
[time=532] the Spirit illuminates that to us.
[time=535] Now when it comes to Scripture, that's a base understanding, but I want to give you two things with the authority of Scripture that the role of the Holy Spirit plays.
[time=542] Number one is that the Holy Spirit authored Scripture.
[time=546] He authored it.
[time=547] He wrote it.
[time=548] He is the author.
[time=549] You say, well it's got the names of all these people, yes it does.
[time=552] And 2 Peter chapter 1 verses 19 through 21 shows us exactly how that happened when I show it to you.
[time=558] And we have this prophetic word more fully confirmed to which you will do well to pay attention to, can I get a name in, as a lamp shining in a dark place until the day dawns and the morning star, that's Jesus, rises in your hearts.
[time=571] Saying this, first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation.
[time=577] For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they
[time=583] were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
[time=587] He's the author.
[time=588] He's the driver of that ship that carried along the process that gives us the word of God.
[time=594] And secondly, he didn't just author it, he administers it.
[time=596] He gives it out.
[time=597] He drives us to it.
[time=598] He didn't just drive the process that led to it.
[time=600] He drives us to it and reminds us of it as we look at Scripture.
[time=605] He counsels us.
[time=607] He reminds us and he teaches us.
[time=610] And Jesus said it this way.
[time=611] We do always do pretty well to go to the words of Jesus, don't we?
[time=614] And here's what he said.
[time=615] John 14 verse 26 and the Greek word for helper that we're about to read literally means like
[time=621] a legal counsel.
[time=623] Talks about a counselor, a helper, an advocate, if you will, but a counsel that comes along, you think about a court of law, if you have legal counsel and you're about to say something that you're not supposed to say or do something that you're not supposed to do, you see it on the television shows, right?
[time=636] The counselor, the attorney goes, and that's what the Holy Spirit is.
[time=641] He's a legal counsel who goes deeper than just advising us.
[time=645] He is the reason for life.
[time=646] He authored the Scripture and the words that guide us.
[time=649] And then he reminds us of that on a constant moment-to-moment basis.
[time=653] So Jesus said it this way, John 14 verse 26, but the helper, pericletos is the word that
[time=659] means advocate, it means helper, it means legal counselor.
[time=663] But the helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.
[time=674] How many of you tend to be forgetful?
[time=678] If you didn't raise your hand, yes you are, because sin makes us very forgetful of what we're supposed to do and not do and say and not say sometimes.
[time=688] And Jesus reminds us that he clarifies, does the Holy Spirit.
[time=692] He clarifies the Word of God.
[time=693] He corrects us by the Word of God.
[time=696] How many of you have gotten corrected by the Word of God this week?
[time=698] I know I have.
[time=699] Yeah, I'm reminded how true and how much I need it, but it's the Holy Spirit who does those things, he authored Scripture, he administered Scripture, and here's the point of point one is really that the Spirit of the living God uses the Word of the living God to guide the
[time=716] people of God.
[time=717] And I'm glad that we have a road map because I sure need one.
[time=721] So that's the authority of Scripture.
[time=723] He sets us free, does the Holy Spirit to understand the point.
[time=726] Number two, let's look at the deity of Christ.
[time=728] This comes from Romans 8 verses 3 and 4, the deity of Christ, the Holy Spirit points to Jesus.
[time=734] Write that down.
[time=735] The Holy Spirit points to Jesus, he's the point of Scripture, he's the point that he helps us understand, see and clarify and even be corrected by when it comes to the authority of Scripture, but the deity of Christ that we've looked at, he's fully God.
[time=748] He's fully God.
[time=749] He became fully man for us.
[time=751] The Holy Spirit points to him.
[time=753] The law and our ability to fulfill it could not conquer sin.
[time=757] So God did it.
[time=758] Let's look at verses 3 and 4 of Romans 8 where we see that outline.
[time=762] For God has done what the law weakened by the flesh could not do.
[time=768] Verse 3, by sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin.
[time=774] He condemned sin in the flesh.
[time=777] Verse 4, in order that the righteous requirement of the law may be fulfilled in us.
[time=783] Wow.
[time=784] Who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
[time=788] And we get to do that.
[time=789] Why?
[time=790] He couldn't do and he did it through Jesus.
[time=793] Jesus lived the sinless life.
[time=794] We could not live and it's because he did that that the Spirit now testifies to Jesus.
[time=799] He now screams the name of Jesus, reminds us of where righteousness comes from.
[time=803] And it does not come from everybody, point it yourself at home wherever you're at.
[time=807] It does not come from here.
[time=809] It comes from there.
[time=810] He fulfilled it where we couldn't.
[time=812] God did what the law weakened by the flesh.
[time=814] That's us.
[time=815] We couldn't fulfill it.
[time=816] But he did it for, I said I'm so thankful for that.
[time=819] The Holy Spirit credits Jesus.
[time=821] He constantly reminds us that, hey, it's all about him.
[time=825] It's all about the Son of God for the accomplishment of us being able to be declared righteous.
[time=830] That's a beautiful thing.
[time=832] And it points to the deity of Jesus.
[time=833] Jesus said it this way, John 15, 26.
[time=835] But when the helper, same word, but when the helper comes whom I will send to you from the Father the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about
[time=846] me.
[time=848] And that's exactly what the Holy Spirit does.
[time=849] He points to Jesus.
[time=851] Acts chapter 10 and verse 38, you see a picture of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=856] But you see what the Spirit does in the role of that verse 38, Acts chapter 10.
[time=860] How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power.
[time=865] He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil for God was with him.
[time=871] Jesus is the point of scripture and God's Holy Spirit points us to Jesus every day.
[time=877] And I ask you real quick, how is he pointing you to Jesus this week?
[time=881] How does the Holy Spirit, how has he been working in your heart to point you to Jesus this week?
[time=887] What relationship?
[time=888] What area of your life do you need a little bit more of Jesus?
[time=891] Maybe a lot a bit more of Jesus.
[time=892] The Holy Spirit is pointing you to him and he gave you an example.
[time=896] We don't have a high priest who's unable to sympathize with us in our weakness, but he's walked where we walk yet he did it without sin so that we could be declared righteous.
[time=904] You see the authority of scripture, you see the deity of Christ versus five through eight of Romans chapter eight, you see the third thing here and that is the sinfulness of humanity that we've looked at.
[time=913] The sinfulness of humanity, the Holy Spirit convicts us of sin and righteousness.
[time=919] He convicts us of sin and righteousness.
[time=922] Let's read verses five through eight of Romans chapter eight.
[time=925] For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh.
[time=935] For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the spirit is life
[time=941] and peace.
[time=942] For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God.
[time=947] For it does not submit to God's law.
[time=948] Indeed it cannot.
[time=950] Verse eight, those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
[time=953] Pretty clear passage when it comes to the sinfulness of humanity and the Holy Spirit's role, that's why you see the contrast of the flesh of us and the spirit of God is when where our mind gets set.
[time=965] Have you ever noticed that there's a big difference when you set your mind on the things of God and when you set your mind on the things of the world?
[time=971] You see that contrast because the spirit of God convicts us of both sin and righteousness in this crazy world that we live in.
[time=979] And so the flesh is sin and death.
[time=982] The spirit is life and peace is what Paul is reminding us of.
[time=985] So a couple of things the Holy Spirit does.
[time=987] It starts with this.
[time=988] He convinces us.
[time=989] How many of you are hard-headed people?
[time=991] I'll raise my hand.
[time=992] I'm a hard-headed dude sometimes.
[time=994] Well the Holy Spirit works on us to convince us that we need a Savior, that we're not good enough on our own and sometimes the humility of that is the first breakthrough that the Holy Spirit brings about and conviction is.
[time=1005] It's a convincing of our inability to please God and the need that we have for help.
[time=1009] Then he convicts us of our sin, of righteousness and even of judgment.
[time=1014] Jesus said in John 16, 7 and 8, "Nevertheless I tell you the truth." It is to your advantage.
[time=1019] He's talking to the disciples because he said, "Hey, I'm going to leave." And they're like, "No, you're not.
[time=1023] You've got to stay." And he said, "No, it's better that I go." Here's what he says.
[time=1026] "I tell you the truth.
[time=1027] It's to your advantage that I go away.
[time=1028] For if I do not go away, the helper, same word again, will not come to you.
[time=1032] But if I go, I will send him to you.
[time=1034] And when he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment."
[time=1040] And then Jesus breaks those three apart, but for us and our purposes today, he convicts us of our need for a Savior because we can't fulfill the requirements that Jesus fulfilled on our behalf.
[time=1050] But then he enters and that's where we'll go next.
[time=1053] And he reminds us, he convicts us of where righteousness comes from.
[time=1057] Because it's one thing to know that I'm sinful and I need a Savior and surrender to a Savior.
[time=1061] And that's where we're going next here.
[time=1062] But it's the whole other thing to be walking around convicted of and reminded of where my righteousness can come from.
[time=1069] Because I don't know about you, but when I look at myself in the mirror, I try to do that every day.
[time=1074] And every day that I do, I look and what looks back at me, I don't just see this beautiful picture of righteousness.
[time=1079] And I often don't feel very righteous.
[time=1081] Can I get an amen?
[time=1082] But the Holy Spirit reminds you that it's not by your works that you're righteous, it's by the blood of Jesus.
[time=1087] And so he convicts us and reminds us of these things.
[time=1091] And then that leads us to number four, which is salvation.
[time=1094] Salvation by grace through faith that we've looked at.
[time=1097] And that, the role of the Holy Spirit is that he draws us to God and then he dwells in us.
[time=1103] He draws us to God because he convicts us of sin saying, you need a God, you need some help.
[time=1109] And so he draws you.
[time=1110] Many of you remember those moments.
[time=1111] Maybe you clutched the seed in front of you because you didn't want to move and you didn't want to do anything.
[time=1115] It was the Holy Spirit convicting and prompting and drawing you to God.
[time=1119] But then at that moment of surrender, where you stop trusting in yourself to be good enough and you trust in Jesus and his finished work on the cross, at that moment, the Spirit of God is now not just drawing you.
[time=1130] He indwells you.
[time=1132] He dwells inside of you.
[time=1133] That's why Jesus said, it's better that I physically leave because I'm going to send my Spirit and he's going to consume my church and that means he's consuming you and that means he's indwelling your life, your heart and your spirit can be overtaken by the Spirit
[time=1147] of the living God.
[time=1148] What a beautiful marriage that we could not attain on our own.
[time=1153] That's why Jesus said those things to the disciples.
[time=1156] And as we look at this, we see it coming from verses 9 and 10 as we just read verses 5-8
[time=1162] about sinfulness.
[time=1163] Now let's read verses 9 and 10 from his eight and Paul continues and he talks a lot about salvation here.
[time=1168] Let's read it.
[time=1169] "You, however, on the contrast of walking in the Spirit and being hostile to God, you, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit.
[time=1177] If in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you.
[time=1179] Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him, but if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness."
[time=1190] What a beautiful wording picture of salvation by grace through faith.
[time=1194] And children of God, listen, are not in the flesh, you're in the Spirit.
[time=1198] You say, well, you didn't see me this morning, all right?
[time=1201] It feels like we often get in the flesh and that's the already not yet tension.
[time=1205] We already have the Spirit of the living God, but we're still in this flesh suit right now.
[time=1210] And while we're in this flesh suit living in this kind of a crazy world, we're going to often not line up with who God has made us to be, but that's what the Holy Spirit does.
[time=1219] He reminds us, convicts us of sin, but also of righteousness.
[time=1221] And he points us to the fact that he drew us to God and that he dwells in us and he becomes our power.
[time=1228] I wrote it down this way that the Holy Spirit indwells and compels.
[time=1232] He indwells me as a child of God and then he compels me to look like Jesus.
[time=1238] I'm glad that he does both.
[time=1239] I need his presence every single day.
[time=1242] And 1 Corinthians chapter 6 verse 11 says it this way, Paul writes this, "And such were some of you, but you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name
[time=1253] of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God." The Holy Spirit washes sanctifies, justifies, he confirms salvation, he even certifies
[time=1264] salvation.
[time=1265] If you have ever doubted your salvation, I point you to this scripture and it's the part of the role of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1270] He certifies it.
[time=1271] He guarantees it.
[time=1272] Paul writes it this way in Ephesians chapter 1 verse 13.
[time=1277] In him you also when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation and believed in him were sealed.
[time=1284] Everybody say sealed.
[time=1285] You were sealed.
[time=1286] You were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit who is the guarantee of our inheritance until
[time=1292] we acquire possession of it to the praise of his glory.
[time=1297] And all God's people again said, amen.
[time=1299] We can know that we know that we know because we have the presence of God's Holy Spirit who indwells us and then he compels us and that leads me to number five, the nature of God.
[time=1309] We've looked at the Trinity, the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit and he's the third person of the Trinity.
[time=1314] The nature of God in this, the role of the Holy Spirit is that he shapes us to look like Jesus.
[time=1319] That's the character and the nature of God, Father, Son, Holy Spirit, Jesus personified it all, but the Holy Spirit now conforms us, shapes us to look more and more like him.
[time=1330] This comes from Romans chapter 8 and verse 10 and then we'll skip down to verses 12 and 13 and read verse 10 to you again though.
[time=1336] But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness looking like our righteous King.
[time=1344] Skip down to verse 12, we'll come back to verse 11, which by the way is my favorite verse.
[time=1348] I can't wait to get there in a moment.
[time=1349] But verse 12 and 13, so then brothers, we're debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh, for if you live according to the flesh, you will die, pretty queer.
[time=1358] But if by the spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
[time=1366] And that is what the Holy Spirit does, he shapes us to look more and more like the character of God.
[time=1372] Second Corinthians chapter 3, verse 17, Paul reminds us, now the Lord is the spirit.
[time=1377] The Holy Spirit is God, another testament to the Trinity there.
[time=1380] The Lord is the spirit.
[time=1381] And where the spirit of the Lord is, there is, say it with me, freedom.
[time=1386] And you often think that it feels restricting to be conformed to Christ.
[time=1390] You ever felt that way?
[time=1391] It's like, gosh, I just can't ever live up to it.
[time=1393] It feels like the law, it feels like the Bible, it feels like Jesus, it feels like the Holy Spirit is just pushing me to do something I just can't do and it feels restricting.
[time=1402] And I would say, if that's where you are, you're not truly understanding the role of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1405] You haven't started walking out, maybe you've grasped it, maybe you're saved, but there's something to acknowledging and understanding that where the spirit of God is and where is he again?
[time=1416] If you know Jesus, he's in you, he's in dwelling you and he's compelling you where the spirit of the Lord is.
[time=1420] It's not this restrictive thing, it's a freeing thing.
[time=1424] There is no freedom like walking by the spirit of God, even when you blow it.
[time=1429] He convicts you of that sin, but then he convicts you of the righteousness that's inside of you by which God looks at you and sees you and no, that doesn't lead to more sinning.
[time=1438] It leads you to want to walk like Jesus more and more every single day because you experience freedom that multiplies in him as you keep listening to the spirit of God.
[time=1448] I love how my God works and you see the trinity, the spirit of God, the spirit of Christ, even in verse nine, but verse 10, the spirit is life because of righteousness and so a few
[time=1459] things.
[time=1460] The Holy Spirit changes us, 2 Corinthians 5, 17, we're a new creation, he changes us.
[time=1464] The Holy Spirit corrects us.
[time=1466] First John chapter 4 and verse 6, we are from God, whoever knows God listens to us, whoever
[time=1472] is not from God does not listen to us, by this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error because the Holy Spirit corrects us.
[time=1480] He changes us, he corrects us, he communicates to us, he reveals the heart of God.
[time=1486] First Corinthians 2, I'll read to you verses 10 through 13, Paul says, "These things God has revealed to us through the spirit, for the spirit searches everything, even the depths
[time=1496] of God, for who knows a person's thoughts except the spirit of that person." Like, nobody can read your mind, right?
[time=1502] That's what he's saying, which is in him, right?
[time=1505] He's continuing on here.
[time=1507] So also, no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the spirit of God, verse 12.
[time=1512] For now, we have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit who is from God that we might understand the things freely given to us by God.
[time=1522] If we impart, and we impart this in words, not taught by human wisdom, but taught by the
[time=1528] spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual, that is those who have accepted Christ, those who are following Jesus, those who have surrendered their life to him, the spirit interprets the heart of God to us.
[time=1540] God wants us to know him, and the role of the Holy Spirit is to communicate the heart of God to us, and then to conform us, so he changes, he corrects, he communicates, and he conforms us.
[time=1550] He makes us look more and more like Jesus, even through our weakness.
[time=1554] I bet you didn't hear that very often when you were growing up in Sunday school, that is God, wait a minute, the Holy Spirit conforms me to look like Christ through my weakness, yep, it's exactly right, he reminds, because he convicts you of it, and you remember real quickly that that's not who I am, but then he reminds you of your righteousness, and even when you're weak, and even when you don't know what to pray, and this is something that's hugely on my heart, because somebody's here, and you've been praying and pouring out your heart to God for months, maybe it's been years, and it's time for you to realize that the Holy Spirit of God does care for you, because some of you are doubting that, some of you don't know if it's true, some of you just feel like God has just given up on me.
[time=1589] Romans 8 that we're in right now at the end of the chapter verses 26-28, let me read this to you.
[time=1594] Likewise, the Spirit helps us in our weakness, for we do not know what to pray for as we
[time=1602] ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.
[time=1609] I can't tell you how many times I've leaned on that verse, verse 27, "And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints." That's the children of God.
[time=1620] Yep, you, you're a saint.
[time=1621] That's what Paul is telling you here, according to the will of God.
[time=1625] Verse 28 may be a familiar verse to you, but now may be seated in a new context.
[time=1629] And we know that for those who love God, all things work together for the good, for those
[time=1635] who are called according to his purpose.
[time=1638] But it starts with the Holy Spirit interceding and praying for us.
[time=1641] You've never been so broken, you just didn't even know what to pray, I have.
[time=1645] And in those moments, you can still pray.
[time=1647] Maybe you didn't know that.
[time=1649] God knows your heart, because the Holy Spirit is indwelled you.
[time=1651] He knows the thoughts of your heart, and he knows the thoughts of God, and he connects the two in ways that you can't even do with words.
[time=1659] That's how much, my God loves you.
[time=1662] He even helps you in your weakness.
[time=1664] He even prays on your behalf, and remember that you're called a saint.
[time=1667] Just again, being convicted and reminded of righteousness, even though you don't act righteous, you still are because of the blood of Jesus.
[time=1675] I love the role of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1677] He conforms us, he shapes us to look like God.
[time=1680] And that leads to number six, and my favorite verse in this passage that we're reading is verse 11, is the resurrection of Christ.
[time=1687] I preached to you about that last Sunday, but when it comes to the resurrection of Christ, the Holy Spirit releases resurrection power.
[time=1694] You ought to be saying amen.
[time=1695] If you're sleepy right now, this is where you wake up.
[time=1698] God releases through his Holy Spirit resurrection power.
[time=1702] Verse 11 of Romans 8, Paul reminds us of this fact.
[time=1706] If the spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ
[time=1714] Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his spirit who dwells
[time=1720] in you.
[time=1721] But two times in that one verse, dwells in you, the same spirit that raised Jesus from
[time=1727] the dead dwells in you as a follower of Jesus, as a child of God, the same spirit that calls
[time=1735] Jesus to walk out of that tomb, lives inside of me and you.
[time=1741] He releases resurrection power, and some of you've been looking for some strength.
[time=1745] You've been looking for some power, and today I point you to the role of the Holy Spirit in your life as a believer because he's ready to do just that.
[time=1752] Romans 15 tells us this verse 13, "May the God," this is my prayer for you this week, "May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing so that by the power
[time=1763] of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope." And as you do, the Holy Spirit is going to comfort you.
[time=1770] Maybe you need some comfort today.
[time=1772] I'm glad to know that the Holy Spirit comforts me.
[time=1774] John 14, the words of Jesus, he says, "And I will ask the Father and he will give you another helper." There's that word again, "To be with you forever." How long is that again?
[time=1784] Forever.
[time=1785] You wondered if he was going to go anywhere.
[time=1786] Maybe he thought he did.
[time=1788] Well, not according to Jesus.
[time=1789] Even the spirit of truth, verse 17, "Him the world cannot receive because it neither sees him nor knows him, you know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you."
[time=1800] Praise God.
[time=1801] He comforts us, he blesses us with this power even when there's persecution.
[time=1805] Some of you've been persecuted lately.
[time=1808] Some of you have been torn down by others lately.
[time=1810] Some of you have been going through lies, being spoken of you, slander or malice, and
[time=1816] you're trying to respond like Jesus.
[time=1819] And I've got a word for you today from 1 Peter, chapter 4, verse 14, "If you're insulted for the name of Christ, you're blessed because the spirit of glory and of God rests upon
[time=1830] you." Be encouraged because God blesses even in the midst of persecution.
[time=1835] If you're just blowing it and you need to apologize for sin, that verse doesn't apply.
[time=1840] If you're persecuted for the sake of Christ, he says, "And so if you're doing the right stuff and getting persecuted for it, then be encouraged." If you're just being a bonehead and you need to apologize and make it right, guess what?
[time=1853] The Holy Spirit has already told you that too, had me, because he convicts us of sin and righteousness.
[time=1858] But if you're persecuted for the name of Jesus, then you are blessed.
[time=1862] The Holy Spirit produces fruit, you can just write this down, Galatians 5, I preach through every one of the fruit of the Spirit, and it's singular because you get all of it.
[time=1869] Why?
[time=1870] Because of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1871] Galatians 5, 22 through 25 reminds us that it's love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
[time=1878] You have all of that because of Jesus, because of the role of the Holy Spirit in your life.
[time=1882] And Romans 8, verse 37, he conquers.
[time=1885] You're more than a conqueror.
[time=1887] Romans 8, 37 reminds us, "No, and all these things, we are more than conquerors through Him who loves us." And maybe the most well-known power verse in Scripture when it comes to the Holy Spirit is the Acts 1-8 strategy that we even try to employ, which is here, there and everywhere.
[time=1902] It's Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and the ends of the earth.
[time=1904] Acts 1-8, "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth." And I praise God that we have that power in us.
[time=1917] And that leads me to the last point of the day, and that is the church.
[time=1920] We haven't preached on that, but next week you need to come back because we're looking at our statement of faith regarding the church and the ecclesiology, as theologians will call it, what it means to be a part of the family of God.
[time=1931] And in verses 14 through 17 of Romans 8, that ties our passage together today.
[time=1937] You didn't think I'd get there at this time, did you?
[time=1939] But we did.
[time=1940] Here we are.
[time=1941] Verses 14 through 17, let's read this together about what it means to get this church, to be the family of God, to be children of the living God.
[time=1949] Verse 14, "For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.
[time=1955] For you did not receive the Spirit of slavery to fall back into fear," maybe you've been doing that lately.
[time=1959] "But you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, "Abba, Father," means
[time=1968] Daddy.
[time=1970] The Spirit himself bears witness with our Spirit that we are children of God.
[time=1976] We have children than heirs, heirs of God, and don't miss this.
[time=1980] And fellow heirs with Christ, that's a pretty high seat, my friends.
[time=1985] Fellow heirs with Christ provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified
[time=1991] with him.
[time=1992] Maybe you've been suffering with him of late, I'm certain that 2020 has brought some level of that into your life.
[time=1998] But when it comes to the church, number seven is that the Holy Spirit unifies the church.
[time=2003] The Holy Spirit unifies the church.
[time=2007] He's good at it.
[time=2008] And we see that in verses 14 through 17, what it looks like to be a part of the family of God, to be adopted as sons, he consumes us, he indwells us.
[time=2015] 1 Corinthians 3, 16, "Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you?" You see, the presence of God in the Old Testament was more tied to a place.
[time=2025] Now because of Jesus, it is tied to people.
[time=2028] He's God's people, He unifies us together because He dwells in us as the temple of God.
[time=2034] We are His church.
[time=2035] He commissions us.
[time=2036] He empowers us even through spiritual gifts.
[time=2039] 1 Corinthians 12, and this is where, listen, I'm going to get to this in just a second, churches go everywhere.
[time=2044] And we start to hate each other, and we start to divide, and we start to deform different denominations.
[time=2049] And it's interesting, listen church, it's interesting that the role of the Holy Spirit as you read about Him in Scripture when it comes to the church is always to make us one family.
[time=2057] It's always to make us one body.
[time=2059] It's always to bring us together, yet...
