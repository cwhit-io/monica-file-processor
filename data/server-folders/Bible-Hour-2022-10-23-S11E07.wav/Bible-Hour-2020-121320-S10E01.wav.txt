[time=0] We are indeed going to jump in to God's word this morning.
[time=4] If you have your vibels or you have your phones, get your thumbs ready.
[time=7] Would you go to Genesis chapter 12 first as we begin today as you're turning.
[time=13] This is my 18th year.
[time=14] My name is Steve Webster.
[time=15] It's my 18th year at the school.
[time=18] My daughter's a senior this year, very proud of her, very proud of our basketball teams in action throughout the course of the week.
[time=24] Our Lady Braves basketball team has 10 wins on the season.
[time=28] That's the most wins of any basketball team in Indiana right now.
[time=32] It's remarkable stuff.
[time=33] So clap for them if you would please.
[time=36] They are state ranked.
[time=38] Our boys basketball team, number one in two-way, had a couple of big wins this weekend.
[time=42] So be looking online to watch our basketball teams play.
[time=46] You will not be disappointed several members of those teams in the room.
[time=50] So way to go, guys, very proud of all of you.
[time=53] Genesis chapter 12 is where we'll begin today.
[time=56] But before I jump in there, we'll talk about a person that you may not have heard of.
[time=61] Would you raise your hand, please, if you've ever heard of Lion Gardener Tyler Jr.
[time=68] Lion Gardener Tyler-- I thought that would be the case.
[time=72] No, never heard of-- OK, very good.
[time=74] Lion Gardener Tyler Jr. No one heard of him.
[time=78] Lion Gardener Tyler Jr. was the grandson of President John Tyler.
[time=84] And John Gardener-- I'm sorry, Lion Gardener Tyler Jr.
[time=90] died in October of this year.
[time=93] John Tyler was the President of the United States in the 1840s.
[time=98] And his grandson just died a couple of months ago.
[time=100] John Tyler was 63 when he gave birth to his son, Lion Gardener Tyler, of course, senior.
[time=106] And he was 71 when he gave birth to his-- well, when his wife gave birth, too, Lion Gardener Tyler Jr.
[time=114] So the grandson of the 10th president of the United States died a couple of months ago.
[time=119] Isn't that amazing?
[time=121] None of you know who Lion Gardener Tyler Jr. was, except that he's connected to John Tyler, who was the 10th president of the United States.
[time=132] The lineage matters in that way.
[time=135] So very recently, we lost the grandson of someone who was in the Whig party.
[time=141] Unbelievable stuff.
[time=142] Amazing.
[time=144] This December, we are walking through a series called "Fulfilled" and as Pastor Kevin just mentioned, this series is about the way that Jesus Christ fulfilled the hundreds of prophecies connected to him from what we call the Old Testament.
[time=157] But beyond that-- this morning I pray that you'll see this-- beyond that fulfilled is not simply just from prophecy, from history, but in your own lives how Christ alone can fulfill the deepest longings and yearnings and hungers and thirsts that we all have.
[time=174] So in that spirit, friends, let's jump in this morning.
[time=176] Let's pray as we start.
[time=177] We're going to be busy this morning, so get ready.
[time=179] I can't wait to jump in with you.
[time=180] Would you please pray with me?
[time=182] Heavenly Father, I am so grateful that your son, Jesus, is worthy, worthy to receive praise.
[time=190] I am grateful, God, that we got the opportunity this morning together collectively in the room and elsewhere all around the world to sing praise, to clap our hands, to shout to you, God, with a voice of triumph, to echo with the saints, God, throughout history.
[time=205] We, this morning, Father, and throughout the month of December will gather together as your people to celebrate that your son, Jesus, that all of your promises find their yes in your son, Jesus Christ.
[time=220] And so, God, in his name this morning, I pray that you be with us, be with Pastor Kevin and his family, all those who are watching near and far.
[time=227] I give his time to you in Jesus' name with great thanksgiving, amen.
[time=231] Okay, Genesis chapter 12.
[time=234] Let's jump in right away this morning.
[time=236] There are four areas of concentration for today, and the first is the promise made to Abram, later Abraham of a nation.
[time=244] So in your notes, there are four things we'll focus on.
[time=246] The first one is God's promise through Abram, then Abraham of a nation.
[time=252] Genesis 12 verse one.
[time=254] Now, the Lord said to Abram, go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you.
[time=260] And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great so that you will be a blessing.
[time=270] I will bless those who bless you and him who dishonors you, I will curse.
[time=274] And in you, all the families of the earth shall be blessed.
[time=279] Now, unlike John Tyler, Abraham did not have any children
[time=285] even into his later years, as some of you probably know.
[time=288] So for God to tell Abram, I'm gonna make you a great nation.
[time=292] Abram says, well, God, about that, you know, I don't have any children, and my wife is also not a young person, so what do you think?
[time=303] That's a longer story, but God keeps his promise to Abram, by the way, side note, Abram in Genesis 12 in Hebrew means father of lots, I'm paraphrasing, Abraham means father of lots and lots.
[time=316] So that's what the name change even reflects God's promise, calling him father Abraham, as we all did in Sunday school.
[time=322] Father Abraham had many sons.
[time=326] You could still do that, do you guys do that?
[time=329] Father Abraham song?
[time=330] No, what a tragedy.
[time=332] Okay, go to Matthew chapter one, if you would please.
[time=335] We are gonna focus on this genealogy for Matthew one, and I would love to walk you through more of that.
[time=340] Be watching on Blackcock FY this week, I'll be making some note this week by way of videos, some things to bring out in this remarkable genealogy in the gospel of Matthew.
[time=350] But we're gonna come back to this several times this morning and watch how the fulfillment of this prophecy in Genesis 12 really shows up in the New Testament in very exciting ways.
[time=360] Matthew one verses one and two, the book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, I have misspelled that word many times this week in my notes, the son of David, son of Abraham.
[time=371] Wait, that's entirely out of order.
[time=374] David comes, as you probably also know, many generations after Abraham.
[time=379] So what's going on here?
[time=380] We'll keep reading.
[time=381] Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers.
[time=389] This is a remarkable stuff that Matthew and his, these are the first words in the New Testament, and it's a genealogy, and he leads with David and Abraham, who probably are the two most famous people for the nation of Israel, which is why he's connecting Jesus Christ to these people straight away.
[time=408] In verse two, he talks about Abraham's family.
[time=412] David is the king who entered into an everlasting covenant with God, it's his second Samuel, chapter seven.
[time=417] God says you will never lack a son on the throne, David, never.
[time=422] And every king in history has longed to hear those words,
[time=428] and kings in history have done horrible things to try to preserve their own name on the throne.
[time=434] And David is promised by God, you will never lack a son on the throne forever.
[time=438] And that promise is ultimately fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=442] Abraham is the father of the nation of Israel.
[time=444] God promised to make him a great nation.
[time=447] That promise was kept, and his name was changed from father of lots to father of lots and lots.
[time=455] Abraham to Abraham.
[time=456] Look at Galatians chapter three, please.
[time=458] Galatians chapter three.
[time=461] This, as you're turning, is a rare instance where scripture tells you, whenever the Bible quotes itself, by the way, really lock in there.
[time=469] This is one of those places where the Bible tells you explicitly, oh, by the way, what was said back then has happened.
[time=476] It has been fulfilled.
[time=477] That does happen from time to time.
[time=479] And what it does, friends, oh, lock in there.
[time=481] Lock in.
[time=482] Galatians chapter three, verses seven through nine.
[time=485] Listen to Paul's confidence.
[time=488] Know, then, that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham.
[time=493] I am one of them, and so are you.
[time=497] And the scripture for seeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, in you shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, so then, those who are of faith
[time=517] are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.
[time=521] The offer of salvation for all people by grace through faith in Christ is the fulfillment of the promise to Abraham.
[time=532] All those who place their faith in Jesus are the sons of Abraham, the man of faith who launched off, not knowing where he was going.
[time=541] Hey, Abraham, leave your place.
[time=542] And he goes, okay.
[time=545] And the rest, of course, is history.
[time=546] We will read from Revelation five again in a moment, but listen to these words of fulfillment from John the Apostle.
[time=552] I love it that we're gonna be in Genesis and Revelation a lot today.
[time=556] So watch how that works.
[time=557] The book ends in scripture.
[time=558] Shine light everything in the middle of it.
[time=560] So go to Revelation chapter five, verses eight through 10.
[time=564] This may not be in the screens, but it's worth looking at.
[time=566] So please go there if you would.
[time=567] The last book of the Bible is Revelation chapter five verses eight through 10.
[time=571] If you can keep a mark also in Matthew one, we'll be back there a couple more times too.
[time=574] So it's trying to help out.
[time=576] If you wanna copy my notes after the service, please come see me, I'd be happy to send them to you.
[time=582] Revelation chapter five, verse eight.
[time=585] And when he had taken the scroll of the four living creatures and the 24 elders fell down before the lamb, each holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
[time=599] They sang a new song saying worthy are you to take the scroll and open its seals for you were slain and by your blood, you ransomed people for God from every tribe and language and people and the nation and you have made them a kingdom and priests to our God
[time=622] and they shall reign on the earth.
[time=624] Dear friends, Genesis 12 said that God promised Abram in you, Abram in your family, in your line, in your lineage, all the nations of the earth shall be blessed.
[time=637] Paul says in Galatians three that has happened that we as people of faith are the sons of Abraham, the sons and daughters of Abraham.
[time=645] And it says in Revelation five, that we are a kingdom and a nation from every tribe and every people in the world gathered under Jesus name and that is marvelous.
[time=655] It's fulfillment of the prophecy given in Genesis chapter 12 and I praise God for that today that our brothers and sisters in South Sudan, we are their sisters, we are their brothers, we are members of God's kingdom with them, co-heirs because of what Christ has done.
[time=674] Amen?
[time=675] Don't withhold your amen and friends if you hear something true from God's word.
[time=677] The second point today, the first one again was a nation from Abraham, the second one is a king and this is where we'll focus on Judah from go to Genesis chapter 49, please.
[time=688] So we were at the end of the scriptures in Revelation five, now we're going back to Genesis and we're gonna go to the end of the first book of the Bible, Genesis 49.
[time=696] This is at the end of Jacob's life.
[time=701] Jacob has sons of course, which become the tribes of Israel and his son Joseph, it's another story.
[time=708] Anyway, but Jacob has many, many sons and one of those sons names is Judah.
[time=712] Judah is the fourth in the line of sons.
[time=715] Now I am the only son of my parents and I have one son, my mother's father, I was his only grandson.
[time=724] So I don't know how this works, but I think if you're fourth in the line of voice in the family, not so good for you in terms of long-term promise of, but there's Judah, he's fourth in the line and this is what his father, Jacob says to him on his deathbed, pronouncing blessings over his children.
[time=741] Listen, this is Genesis 49 starting in verse eight.
[time=745] Judah, your brothers shall praise you.
[time=749] Your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies.
[time=752] Your father's sons will bow down before you.
[time=755] Judah is a lion's cub.
[time=759] From the prey, my son, you have gone up.
[time=762] He stooped down, he crouched as a lion and as a lioness who dares rouse him.
[time=769] The scepter shall not depart from Judah nor the ruler's staff from between his feet until tribute comes to him.
[time=777] And to him shall be of the obedience of the peoples, binding his full to the vine and his donkey's colt to the choice vine, he has washed his garments in wine and his vesture in the blood of grapes.
[time=792] There's a lot going on here, let me walk you through it.
[time=795] Judah will be revered by his brothers and he will dominate Judah's line, will dominate his enemies.
[time=803] That is clear from this passage.
[time=805] By the way, verse nine, from the prey of my son, you have gone up.
[time=810] To go up is referring to the lion is down eating his prey and he rises up.
[time=815] You have gone up my son, you have finished devouring your prey and now you're ready to go, it's a pretty powerful image.
[time=822] A descendant from the tribe of Judah will have a scepter and will rule.
[time=827] He will rule over times of remarkable abundance.
[time=831] I don't know if any of you have donkeys in your life.
[time=836] Anybody have any, you never know an Indiana, it could be some donkeys or anybody have donkeys.
[time=840] Okay, donkey, for real?
[time=843] All right, fantastic.
[time=845] So I don't, that's amazing.
[time=847] There's an actual donkey owner and the donkey's familiar person, wonderful.
[time=850] Okay, so I don't have a donkey, but I know, even I know that you shouldn't tie a donkey to a vine.
[time=856] Is that a fair thing for me to say that you shouldn't tie a donkey to a vine?
[time=859] Probably not a good idea.
[time=861] Not a good idea 'cause donkeys are famous for their stubbornness, right?
[time=864] Their wilfulness and in Genesis 49, it says that Judah's gonna tie his donkey to a vine and don't do that because that's not a good place to leave a donkey unless there are times of such abundance and peace and plenty that you would just tie a donkey to a vine and I even worry about it and you would wash your clothes and wine.
[time=887] Who would do that?
[time=888] Wine is so plentiful that wouldn't even, that's how much of this glorious abundance is present.
[time=894] That's the picture of Genesis 49.
[time=895] This is amazing stuff.
[time=898] There's also so much milk.
[time=899] It goes on to the pastor to say that you're, there's so much milk being consumed that your teeth are white, it's amazing.
[time=905] Matthew chapter one, again, go back to Matthew chapter one.
[time=908] First three verses of Matthew one by way of review, okay?
[time=914] The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham, the two most famous Jewish people in the history of the world.
[time=920] Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers.
[time=927] Judah father of Perez and Zara by Tamar, Perez the father of Hezron and Hezron the father of Ram, begat, begat, begat, begat.
[time=935] Don't skip genealogies.
[time=936] I was up here, remember when Nehemiah was up here with genealogies, not saying don't skip those.
[time=942] Don't skip genealogies, this is the most one you should never, ever skip over.
[time=946] Judah and his brothers, he's number four in the line, friends, so why start with Judah?
[time=952] Because those promises from Genesis 49, your lions cub Judah, someone's gonna come from you with a staff, the scepter and they're gonna rule, dominate their enemies.
[time=961] And Matthew knows this from Genesis 49.
[time=965] Matthew's genealogy only refers to Judah in the list of Jacob's sons, just Judah and his brothers.
[time=972] Amazing.
[time=973] Revelation chapter five, again, remarkable stuff.
[time=978] Let these words, friends, encourage you today.
[time=983] We are all in need of encouragement.
[time=986] Revelation chapter five, the first five verses.
[time=990] Then I saw in the right hand of Him who was seated on the throne, a scroll written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals.
[time=998] I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice.
[time=1001] Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?
[time=1005] And no one in heaven or on earth, or onto the earth, was able to open the scroll or look into it.
[time=1011] And I begin to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.
[time=1018] And one of the elders said to me, weep no more, behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David has conquered.
[time=1030] So he can open the scroll and it's seven seals.
[time=1033] He has conquered, friends, thanks be to God.
[time=1035] Jesus is uniquely worthy of the praise you gave Him a few minutes ago.
[time=1042] He deserves it again tomorrow and again the next day.
[time=1045] And as you sing the hymns of Christmas, I pray that these words will ring in your ears.
[time=1051] He has conquered his enemies and he will come again to make all things new.
[time=1055] We are living between arrivals, events.
[time=1059] The first advent of Christmastime, Christ came to conquer his enemies and he did that on the cross and rose again from the dead.
[time=1066] And he will come again one day to make all things new.
[time=1070] Even so come, Lord Jesus come.
[time=1073] So we have a nation with Abraham.
[time=1076] We have a king from Judah who will rule with a scepter.
[time=1080] And now we have a star, number three from Jacob.
[time=1083] This is numbers 24.
[time=1085] The numbers 24, go to numbers 24 if you would please.
[time=1088] Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, then numbers.
[time=1090] The fourth book of the Bible.
[time=1092] And chapter 24, some background here 'cause there's a lot going on here in numbers.
[time=1097] Numbers is a very badly named book.
[time=1100] It's not a book about numbers.
[time=1102] Apologies, hop, math teachers.
[time=1104] We all, hop loves numbers.
[time=1106] But some of others of us don't traffic always in numbers and don't love them as much as other people might do.
[time=1112] So we don't, no one says numbers, yay, numbers.
[time=1116] But that's not what the book of numbers is about.
[time=1118] Numbers is about the Israelites wandering in the wilderness for 40 years.
[time=1123] So that's what's happening here.
[time=1124] At the very end of that wandering, the king of Moab sees all of these Israelites coming toward him to occupy his land and he freaks out.
[time=1133] And so he googles prophets for hire and he finds a guy named Balaam.
[time=1138] And he says, Balaam, I want you to pronounce curses on the Israelites and he goes, man, I can't do that.
[time=1142] And then the king of Moab shows him a check and says, okay, I'll do it.
[time=1146] And Balaam, it's a weird story.
[time=1148] And Balaam tries to curse Israel three times and what comes out is actually blessing, not cursing.
[time=1155] The king of Moab's like, oh, I'm money back.
[time=1157] This guy is no good, this prophet for hire is no good.
[time=1160] Well, then he gets a fourth prophecy in numbers 24 that the king of Moab didn't pay for, it's bonus.
[time=1165] And here's what Balaam says.
[time=1167] I see him, numbers 24 17, but not now.
[time=1173] I behold him, but not near, a star shall come out of Jacob.
[time=1178] A scepter shall rise out of Israel.
[time=1182] It shall crush the forehead of Moab.
[time=1184] I'm sure the king of Moab is happy to hear that.
[time=1186] And break down all the sons of chef, eat him shall be dispossessed.
[time=1190] Sire also, his enemies shall be dispossessed.
[time=1192] Israel is doing valiantly and one from Jacob shall exercise dominion and destroy the survivors of cities.
[time=1203] Balaam tries three times to curse Israel.
[time=1205] It doesn't work, outcomes blessing.
[time=1207] This fourth bonus prophecy speaks of a star, a scepter, a ruler who would arise out of Israel and be awesome in his conquest and decisive in his actions.
[time=1220] This friends is a picture of the coming Messiah.
[time=1225] Go to Matthew chapter two, please.
[time=1226] Matthew chapter two, you know this passage.
[time=1230] The star, the scepter, this ruler is a picture tucked away in this weird little prophecy from a weird little prophet named Balaam in the Old Testament.
[time=1239] Matthew chapter two is after Matthew chapter one, in case you are looking for it, you're welcome.
[time=1245] Okay, you guys still with me?
[time=1247] Matthew two.
[time=1249] Now, after Jesus was born in Bethlehem Judea in the days of Herod the king, notice how he calls him Herod the king, Herod the king, behold wise men from the east came to Jerusalem saying, where is he who has been born king of the Jews?
[time=1262] For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him, when Herod the king heard this, he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him.
[time=1272] And assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.
[time=1279] He then tells them, well then they tell him the prophecy from Micah, what we'll be in a couple of weeks.
[time=1285] Bethlehem in the land of Judah is where the Messiah is gonna be born.
[time=1290] Well, Herod freaks out because Herod is Herod the king.
[time=1294] And Herod the king doesn't wanna hear, there's another king whose star has risen, whom wise men have come to seek, but there he is.
[time=1302] He was troubled and all Jerusalem with him.
[time=1307] Herod's days are numbered.
[time=1309] And the star in Numbers 24, we believe it's possible that those wise men had access to these Old Testament prophecies and they were looking for a star and they came to seek him because of what it says in Numbers, that's entirely possible.
[time=1324] Micah says in chapter five that his origins are this star, this person coming forth, that his origins are from the distant past, the King James says from everlasting.
[time=1335] This king's dominion causes Herod to be troubled and he knows that his time is about to come to an end.
[time=1344] Please go friends to the very last chapter in the Bible, Revelation chapter 22, Revelation 22.
[time=1350] This is remarkable stuff Jesus talking about himself in the first person, very remarkable.
[time=1358] Talking about himself in the first person, so listen carefully, what Jesus says about himself, I, Revelation 22, 16, I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify to you about these things for the churches.
[time=1372] I am the root and descendant of David, the bright morning star, the spirit and the bride say come and let the one who hears say, come, let the one who is thirsty, come, let the one who desire to take the water of life without price, hear me friends, Jesus identifies himself as David's descendant, worthy of his throne, but there's more.
[time=1402] He is the bright morning star offering hope for the future.
[time=1407] All those who seek him will find the living water that he promised.
[time=1413] Did you hear Jesus say, come all who are thirsty, come.
[time=1419] All of your thirsts, if you're inside of my voice,
[time=1425] all of our thirsts that cannot be quenched any other way can and will be quenched by him forever.
[time=1433] Nothing and no one else can ever do that.
[time=1436] And friends, that is good news.
[time=1438] That's the gospel preached beforehand to Abraham.
[time=1441] But in you Abraham, all of the earth's nations will be blessed.
[time=1445] And that's the blessing.
[time=1447] A woman at the well one day meets Jesus and he offers living water and she goes, I want some of that.
[time=1452] And that never runs out, I love that.
[time=1454] This trip to the well is killing me.
[time=1456] This morning friends, I offer you that remarkable hope, the bright morning star of Jesus Christ, who offers water that will never run dry.
[time=1465] Some of you have been chased after stuff your whole life and you're thirsty still and you're seeking and you can't seem to find.
[time=1475] And I give you the words of Jesus in the first person to encourage you today to cast all your cares on him because he cares for you.
[time=1482] This year has wrung you out and maybe it has.
[time=1487] If you are wrung out and you are tired and you are thirsty and you are hungry and you have no rest, come.
[time=1495] Come to Jesus, who loves you and gave himself for you.
[time=1499] That's good news.
[time=1501] Isaiah chapter 11, well, this is our fourth point here friends.
[time=1505] So we have a nation through Abraham.
[time=1508] We have a king through Judah.
[time=1510] We have a star through Jacob.
[time=1512] And now in number four, we have a branch through Jesse.
[time=1516] Good, Isaiah 11 friends, this is a remarkable passage.
[time=1521] I'm teaching a class of seniors in the springtime here at the school called the gospel of Isaiah because it's good news.
[time=1528] The good news of the Messiah coming is all over.
[time=1531] It soaks through every corner of the book of Isaiah in the Old Testament.
[time=1534] Here's one example.
[time=1535] Isaiah 11, read the first 10 verses.
[time=1537] There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse and a branch from his roots shall bear fruit, the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him a spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord.
[time=1555] His delight shall be in the fear of the Lord.
[time=1557] He will not judge by what his eyes see or decide disputes by what his ears hear.
[time=1564] But with righteousness, he will judge the poor and decide with equity for the meek of the earth.
[time=1571] He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips, he will kill the wicked.
[time=1577] Righteousness will be the belt of his waist.
[time=1579] Faithfulness, the belt of his loins.
[time=1582] The wolf shall dwell with the lamb.
[time=1584] The leopard shall lie down with the young goat.
[time=1587] The calf and the lion in the fat and calf together, a little child shall lead them.
[time=1593] The cow and the bear shall graze.
[time=1594] Their young shall lie down together.
[time=1596] The lion will eat straw like the ox.
[time=1599] The nursing child will play over the whole of the cobra and the ween child shall put his hand on the adder's den.
[time=1608] They shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.
[time=1621] In that day, the root of Jesse, who will stand as a signal for the peoples, of him shall the nations inquire.
[time=1629] They'll go seek him out.
[time=1631] His resting place shall be glorious.
[time=1633] This passage is bookended with references to Jesse in verse one, in verse 10.
[time=1639] Do you see in verse one, there's promise of fruit?
[time=1642] And then in verse two, there's a spirit, not coincidence.
[time=1645] And by the way, friends, this person who will be just and who will bring peace and faithfulness and rights, this is the person that I've invited you to come to.
[time=1657] That's the person.
[time=1658] I would then invite you to come to someone else who is not worthy of that for you, not worthy of your deepest fears and hopes and loves and longings, but he is worthy of it.
[time=1668] He's worthy of it.
[time=1670] And when you come to him, that's who you're coming to, a person who is faithful and righteous and just and doesn't judge about what his eyes see.
[time=1678] Does it respect persons?
[time=1680] Does it look at the crowd and say, "Well, you look nice to me, you come on in, "we look so nice, no thanks." That's not who he is.
[time=1687] And I rejoice in that truth with you this morning.
[time=1692] This is new creation language, friends.
[time=1694] It's already, but not yet.
[time=1696] There's, I don't know if you've been looking at the news.
[time=1700] This kind of peace eludes us in the world today.
[time=1704] This is the promise of what will be, but please don't miss Second Corinthians chapter five or 17.
[time=1709] If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[time=1712] This peace that Isaiah 11 promises comes to meet a person where they are and you walk around in that peace every single day as the Holy Spirit takes a presence within you and brings that fruit with him, there it is.
[time=1728] New creation is bubbling up within you and within me every single day.
[time=1734] And Isaiah 11 is a promise for the future to be sure in some ways, but don't miss the already.
[time=1739] We often skip right past it, but you go back to Matthew chapter one, please.
[time=1744] Remarkable stuff here in Matthew one versus five and six as we conclude this morning.
[time=1749] Matthew chapter one versus five and six.
[time=1752] More begats.
[time=1756] Say I'm in the father of Boaz by Rahab.
[time=1759] What?
[time=1759] Boaz, the father of Obed by Ruth.
[time=1763] What?
[time=1764] There's two women in there.
[time=1766] Ladies don't usually show up in Hebrew genealogies, but there they are, two ladies, neither of them, by the way, Israelites.
[time=1774] Rahab is a prostitute from Jericho.
[time=1777] And Rahab, it appears to me, is Obed's grandfather.
[time=1784] Grandmother, excuse me.
[time=1787] Ruth is a Moabitis and there's just no prized people.
[time=1791] And she becomes the great grandfather of Jesse who is the father of David, the king.
[time=1798] These things are tucked away in the genealogy of Jesus Christ.
[time=1803] Earlier on, there's a passage that talks about two sons born to one of the brothers of Judah and under very sketchy circumstances.
[time=1812] All of these things not hidden away and they're all in the line of Jesus.
[time=1817] It's amazing, in his lineage.
[time=1821] In Mark chapter one, the spirit of the Lord descends on Jesus at his baptism.
[time=1825] Mark one versus nine through 11.
[time=1829] Verse nine says, "In those ages came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan when he came apart of the water immediately, that he saw the heavens being torn open, the spirit descending on him like a dove.
[time=1840] The spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him.
[time=1846] He is the root and branch of Jesse.
[time=1850] He is the heir to David's throne in Acts 13.
[time=1853] The Apostle Paul talks to men of Antioch in Pisidia and tells them in Acts 13, 23 of this man's offspring.
[time=1862] God has brought to Israel a Savior Jesus as he promised.
[time=1868] Friends, this December, I invite you to consider these words from 2 Corinthians chapter one as hovering over all that we talk about together.
[time=1880] I've already mentioned them in my prayer, but I'll end our time together with this.
[time=1887] 2 Corinthians chapter one verse 20 says, "For all the promises of God find their yes in him." That is why it is through him that we utter our amen to God for his glory.
[time=1895] It's God who establishes us with you in Christ and has anointed us and put his seal on us and given us his spirit in our hearts as a guarantee, a nation, a king, a star and a branch.
[time=1909] Jesus fulfilled in himself all of those things in a way that nobody else could and offers you fulfillment in a way that nobody else could.
[time=1920] I think that Christmastime deserves every bit of enthusiasm that we can muster.
[time=1925] It's the most wonderful time of the year because the most important thing that has ever happened in the history of the world happened at Christmastime when God became a man and fulfilled all of these promises about him.
[time=1938] It stands to reason to me that if the most important thing that would ever happen in the world's history was gonna happen that people would talk about it ahead of time and there's lots of that.
[time=1945] And we'll spend that time and that the whole month of December.
[time=1949] I praise God with you for that truth this morning.
[time=1951] Let's pray together as we close.
[time=1954] God, thank you for this morning.
[time=1957] Thank you for time in your word bookended and Genesis and Revelation and all throughout God with these wonderful promises about your son, Jesus.
[time=1967] This morning, Father, I pray anyone within the sound of my voice was thirsty or who was hungry.
[time=1974] Would hear Jesus say, "Come," but they would come.
[time=1979] Your word promises God that anyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
[time=1985] If we confess with our mouth, Jesus is Lord and believe in our hearts that God raised him from the dead, we will be saved.
[time=1992] God, so I pray that this Christmas season that those who are thirsty and those who are hungry would find their thirst and their hunger satisfied in you In his name I pray, amen.
