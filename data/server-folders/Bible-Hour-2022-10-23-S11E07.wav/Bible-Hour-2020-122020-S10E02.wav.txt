[time=0] In a world that is so full of bad news, fake news, news that you don't want to hear, we really this Christmas just want to focus on the good news of Jesus.
[time=10] He's the reason for the season.
[time=12] He's the reason for life.
[time=14] He's the reason for eternity.
[time=15] He's the reason that we have hope and peace, no matter what you may be facing this Christmas, and I do want to acknowledge that I do know these times of year, they're so joyful, but so many of you came today and you're watching today with a discouraged heart.
[time=30] And you saw the hearts float up onto the screen as we saying, you thought of how broken your heart is because of loss, because of what death has brought into this world, or just because of circumstances in this life.
[time=40] And this time of year, content to magnify the good, but also the bad and the challenging.
[time=45] And so my prayer is that your heart will be encouraged as we look at the promises of God.
[time=50] And you may say, why prophecy them?
[time=52] And the answer is really simple.
[time=53] It's that the prophecies of scripture point us to the promises of God.
[time=58] And if the prophecies are true, then we can know that the promises of God are true and fulfilled in Jesus.
[time=65] Last week, we ended our time together by reading this verse.
[time=68] I'll start this week with the same.
[time=69] Second Corinthians chapter one and verse 20, says, for all the promises of God find their yes in him.
[time=78] And the hymn there is none other than Jesus Christ.
[time=81] The word who became flesh and dwelt among us, that baby born in a manger, that we celebrate this Christmas.
[time=88] And I wrote it down this way, you know, why does prophecy matter?
[time=92] You should join me in that.
[time=93] You can join us on the app if you wanna fill in the blanks in your notes there.
[time=97] That Jesus fulfilled prophecy.
[time=100] So now I can know that God's promises are true.
[time=103] Prophecies are promises that God told us would happen.
[time=106] And when they become fulfilled, we can see that we can trust God.
[time=111] He's trustworthy.
[time=112] He is holy, He is who He says He is.
[time=115] And that's the best encouragement that you could have for your heart this Christmas season.
[time=120] And so if you're skeptical today about Jesus and about prophecies and about the Bible and about Christianity, then I'm glad that you're tuned in today because I believe that as we look at the prophecies fulfilled by Christ, specifically in His coming, there are hundreds of them, by the way.
[time=136] We could spend forever looking at all the prophecies fulfilled by His life and His death in addition to His birth.
[time=142] We're just looking at a few about His birth.
[time=144] But I believe if you've been skeptical, God can encourage your heart as the prophecies of scripture point to the promises of God.
[time=151] And you see God is trustworthy.
[time=154] Jesus is who He says He is.
[time=156] And therefore my heart can be encouraged.
[time=158] Therefore I can have fulfillment because Jesus has fulfilled prophecy.
[time=164] So last week we looked at the lineage prophecies and who Jesus came from.
[time=168] And I don't know about you, but I was very encouraged by how great of a job that Pastor Steve Webster did, but specifically I was encouraged by just seeing the list and Matthew chapter one will be in chapter two in a minute of how there are prostitutes.
[time=183] There are people that shouldn't be listed in the genealogy and the lineage of Jesus.
[time=189] He came from those kinds of people.
[time=192] And so it reminds us then that with Jesus, it doesn't matter who you come from.
[time=198] And today I wanna zoom into the location prophecies of where Jesus was born, where He grew up.
[time=204] And that shows us not only it doesn't matter with Jesus, who you come from, it also doesn't matter where you come from as we look at these location prophecies today.
[time=213] So I wanna give you three locations.
[time=215] And I've studied Matthew two many times.
[time=217] It's the coming of the wise men from the East is the story.
[time=221] But what you're gonna find with me, and it just struck me in a way I've never noticed before, that in order you find these three locations that I wanna share with you today that all include prophecies that the birth of Christ has fulfilled.
[time=234] So Matthew chapter two, I'll give you three locations surrounding his birth and a little bit of his life that I believe will encourage your heart.
[time=239] You ready for the word today, black hog?
[time=242] Let's dig in.
[time=243] Matthew chapter two and the first 12 verses we see location number one, write it down.
[time=247] It's Bethlehem.
[time=248] It's kind of the most well known, perhaps the most important in that list, but all of them go together to show that Jesus is who he says he is.
[time=255] Let's read Matthew chapter number two, the first 12 verses.
[time=260] Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, it's already solid, already fulfilled.
[time=265] In the days of Herod, the king, behold wise men from the East came to Jerusalem saying, where is he who has been born the king of the Jews where we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him?
[time=277] When Herod the king heard this he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.
[time=288] They told him in Bethlehem of Judea for so it is written by the prophet.
[time=294] There's so many prophecies quoted here in this chapter.
[time=296] Here's the first verse 16.
[time=298] And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah are by no means least among the rulers of Judah for from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.
[time=310] Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem saying go and search diligently for the child and when you have found him bring me word that I too may come worship him.
[time=325] Don't think that's quite what he had in mind and we'll find that out as we keep going.
[time=329] Verse nine, after listening to the king they went on their way and behold the star they had seen when it rose, went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was.
[time=339] When they saw the star they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.
[time=344] And going into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother and they fell down and worshiped him.
[time=350] Then opening their treasures they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.
[time=355] And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod they departed to their own country by another way.
[time=362] And may God bless the reading of his word and the prophecies therein to just encourage our heart and give us fulfillment because I want to tell you today my friends, Jesus.
[time=371] That baby born in that little bitty manger fulfilled prophecy.
[time=375] And we see it here even in the location of Bethlehem.
[time=378] And so Bethlehem is, I love this about just how scripture is so harmonized and it all comes together with all these different people, all these different places, all these different things that come together all the point to Jesus.
[time=391] And Bethlehem's about five miles south of Jerusalem and the name Bethlehem literally means house of bread.
[time=398] House of bread.
[time=400] And you say, well, okay, what's the significance?
[time=402] I think there's a ton of significance about that name because Bethlehem, this little bitty nothing town, it's a nothing and nobody kind of place.
[time=410] We wouldn't even know it existed perhaps apart from Jesus Christ and his birth being born there.
[time=416] But it means house of bread and later in Jesus ministry in John chapter six and verse 48, Jesus would tell us, I am the bread of life.
[time=426] And so in this little nothing town called the house of bread, the bread of life would be born and fulfill prophecy and come and give us peace.
[time=436] He would come to overtake our sin.
[time=438] He would defeat death, hell and the grave on our behalf.
[time=442] But it started in this little house of bread where the bread of life would be born.
[time=447] And Matthew chapter two, the first six verses there, you see clearly Jesus was born in Bethlehem.
[time=452] And that's an important fulfillment taking place because in verse six, Matthew is directly quoting a prophecy from Micah chapter five.
[time=460] We're gonna put that on the screen for you.
[time=462] You can see it in your app.
[time=463] Micah chapter five verses two through five says this.
[time=467] And you gotta remember now, this is written over 600 years before the birth of Christ and Micah prophesied.
[time=474] But you, O Bethlehem, of Ephritha, who are too little to be among the clans of Judah.
[time=481] For from you shall come forth for me, one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose coming forth is from old, from ancient days.
[time=490] We'll look at that next week.
[time=492] Therefore he shall give them up until the time when she is, who is in labor has given birth.
[time=498] Then the rest of his brothers shall return to the people of Israel and shall stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the Lord in the majesty of the name of the Lord, his God.
[time=509] And they shall dwell secure.
[time=512] For now he shall be great to the ends of the earth, and he shall be their peace.
[time=519] And I love that hundreds of years before Christ was born, this was foretold.
[time=524] And if you say, well, I don't believe scripture, the beauty is all of these things, you can be documented in historical documents and you can't refute it.
[time=532] But still, yet many people would say, when it comes to prophecies being fulfilled, that Jesus just went around, 'cause he knew the word, right?
[time=538] Jesus knew the Old Testament law extremely well, which was their Bible during that time.
[time=543] And so people will often argue, well, Jesus just knew, he was a man, he wasn't really God, like he says he was, he was just this man that knew the law, he knew the prophecies from all of these prophets like Isaiah and Micah that we just read from.
[time=556] And so he just walked around doing things that would fulfill the prophecies because he knew them.
[time=562] And so, okay, first of all, all of them, and I could go through them and I think that's quite a stretch even by itself.
[time=568] But if there's one thing that refutes it all, this is why the birth prophecies are so important for us.
[time=574] Because if Jesus did walk around as a man just fulfilling things he knew to be in scripture, I wanna ask you a question.
[time=581] And if he is a man, that means he's not God and he has no say so over his birth.
[time=586] How many of you got to say where you were born?
[time=588] Raise your hand.
[time=589] You know, it's kinda hard to dictate your place of birth.
[time=593] Can I get a name in?
[time=595] And if Jesus was a man, how did he pull that one off, right?
[time=598] And that's just one among so many things that proves Jesus is who he says he is that God sent him forth his son.
[time=606] And it started in Bethlehem.
[time=609] And this is why these prophecies matter so much.
[time=611] And then in that final verse, verse six, Matthew's also directly quoting from 2 Samuel.
[time=617] I wanna read it to you.
[time=617] I love the Old Testament, New Testament.
[time=619] It comes together, it points to Jesus.
[time=621] It points to his grace.
[time=623] It points to his fulfillment of the law.
[time=625] It points to his fulfillment of prophecies.
[time=628] And we see that even in this second Samuel chapter five and verse two, in times past, this is about Israel like kings and their role.
[time=636] In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led out and brought in Israel.
[time=642] And the Lord said to you, get this, you shall be shepherd of my people Israel and you shall be prince over Israel.
[time=651] And shepherding, it was what we see here.
[time=652] It was a very key element of the role of Israel like kings.
[time=657] You say, what does that have to do with anything?
[time=659] Because you notice even in verse six of Matthew chapter two, he calls him a shepherd.
[time=663] And we're gonna see that even more because Jesus is our ultimate good shepherd.
[time=668] And the shepherds even came to worship him as we read about in scripture.
[time=672] And then verses seven through 12 of Matthew two, you see Herod's plotting.
[time=677] You ever had a Herod in your life?
[time=679] The bad guys of Christmas are many.
[time=681] Marv and Harry and all these guys from all the movies.
[time=684] But the ultimate bad guy of Christmas was this king Herod.
[time=687] And we're gonna see what happened and how God even fulfilled scripture and prophecy, even through the actions of evil kings like Herod.
[time=694] What a beautiful picture of our God.
[time=697] And in verse 11, by the way, I don't know if you got a nativity scene in your house right now, anybody got one?
[time=702] Yeah, I may make you a little sad.
[time=705] Verse 11, where did the wise men go to a house?
[time=710] We often have this, don't we?
[time=712] You've got the manger and Jesus.
[time=714] And the shepherds came there and people came in worship there.
[time=717] So it's okay, you don't have to sell your nativity scenes.
[time=721] I'm not making you that sad.
[time=723] But the magi, these wise men, and we're gonna look at them a little more specifically next week when we look at the lordship prophecies of how Jesus is Lord.
[time=730] He's the king of kings and the Lord of lords.
[time=732] They didn't come to the stable.
[time=734] Thankfully, Joseph and Mary had been able to take Jesus obviously by this point to a house.
[time=739] And so they came and found him at a house.
[time=741] You may have just never noticed that.
[time=742] You're welcome for ruin and Christmas for you.
[time=744] And you'll never look at it the same again, perhaps.
[time=747] Bethlehem's number one.
[time=748] And then we continue in Matthew chapter two, verses 13 through 18, the second location is Egypt.
[time=755] Egypt, we have a partnership in Egypt.
[time=756] We have some of our Egyptian brothers and sisters that are tuned in even right now that do so each week.
[time=762] We're grateful for you guys.
[time=763] And Egypt is such an important part of the location prophecies of Jesus as well.
[time=767] Let's read verses 13 through 18 of Matthew chapter two.
[time=772] You guys hanging in there with me today?
[time=774] This is good stuff, I love the Bible.
[time=777] You should too.
[time=777] I know you do, I'm glad you're digging in with me today.
[time=779] Verse 13.
[time=781] Now when they had departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said rise, take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, location number two, and remain there until I tell you for Herod is about to search for the child to destroy him.
[time=797] Verse 14, and then he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt and remained there until the death of Herod.
[time=805] This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet out of Egypt, I called my son, verse 16.
[time=813] Then Herod, when he saw they had been tricked by the wise men, became furious and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem.
[time=822] Not the typical Christmas story we read to our kids on Christmas Eve night, what a horrific thing that had taken place.
[time=829] And in all that region who were two years or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men, verse 17, then was fulfilled, what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah.
[time=841] A voice was heard in Rama weeping and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children.
[time=847] She refused to be comforted because they are no more.
[time=851] So a couple of key prophecies that we see in there, starting with verses 13 through 15, the Egypt part.
[time=858] And so Herod was going to try to kill Jesus and ended up killing all of these precious little babies in Bethlehem, the angel who had warned Joseph and said go to Egypt.
[time=868] And so that is something that took place and it fulfills.
[time=872] And verse 15 directly quotes Hosea chapter 11 and verse one.
[time=877] Hosea 11, one that says out of Egypt, I called my son.
[time=882] Beautiful thought of just hundreds of years before the birth of Christ that these things were foretold and they're coming together.
[time=888] And really when they were written, probably most of the people who would hear them and even wrote them and were scribes to take them down had no idea what length and what depth and what power would come with the words that they were writing down.
[time=903] And then comes Jesus and his birth fulfills all of these things.
[time=907] And again, if he's a human little baby, he doesn't really have a lot of say in going to Egypt, does he?
[time=911] We take our kids with us wherever we may go.
[time=913] So he fulfills Hosea 11, one.
[time=916] And verses 16 through 18, you see some more of this prophecy because verse 18 directly quotes from Jeremiah chapter 31 and verse 15, you can look at verse 18 there and see that.
[time=927] And it's talking about Israel's exile, talking about Jacob's wife, Rachel.
[time=933] And Rachel interestingly enough, if you go to Genesis, I just love these ties, you sometimes miss these things.
[time=940] They're throughout scripture, I've studied it all my life, but Genesis 35 and 48 that Rachel actually dies on her way to Bethlehem of all places.
[time=949] You see all these places coming together, but she is weeping and lamenting over this exile, this taking place for the nation of Israel.
[time=958] And it turns into this picture of what Herod would do there in Bethlehem, the weeping and lamenting.
[time=965] And it points to even what Herod did and God.
[time=968] And that's a good reminder, by the way, my friends, look at me for a minute.
[time=971] If you're saying, well, I don't already believe all this stuff is good, keep going pastor.
[time=976] I'm just concerned with this big problem I got in my life right now.
[time=980] What you see, especially when it comes to Egypt, they fled to Egypt because of horrific things that were coming, horrific things that were going to happen and did happen, that even those things, even those things, when it comes to the second location, God used them for His glory.
[time=998] God used them for good.
[time=1000] What Herod and so many others meant for evil.
[time=1003] And they're horrific things.
[time=1004] And you say, how can the killing of these babies be good?
[time=1008] And I say, it's not good.
[time=1011] But God even takes that which is meant for evil, that which comes from our sinfulness, that which comes from the broken sinful, damned to hell humanity that we would be without Jesus.
[time=1022] God even takes our messes, our mistakes, the horrific parts of life, even 2020.
[time=1029] And He uses them to do things for His good and for His glory and for your purpose in your life.
[time=1035] I believe it with all my heart.
[time=1037] And I declare it over you today if you're going through something, if you've gone through a loss, if you're hurting today, God will take even the horrible things that death and pain brings about in this life and He will redeem it.
[time=1050] God never wastes pain.
[time=1054] And I declare that over you today.
[time=1056] And the prophecies of Scripture remind you of those promises of God.
[time=1061] And even when it comes to death, one day it's gonna be no more.
[time=1064] Right now we live in it, I do funerals frequently.
[time=1066] And it breaks my heart equally every time I hate death.
[time=1069] But God does too.
[time=1071] And He's already won that battle.
[time=1072] He's already won that victory.
[time=1074] And one day He'll wipe it away and it will be no more.
[time=1077] Number three, location.
[time=1078] We've looked at Bethlehem, we've looked at Egypt.
[time=1080] Now let's move to Matthew 2, 19 through 23, the end of the chapter, and let's look at Nazareth.
[time=1086] Nazareth, you've heard that before probably.
[time=1088] Jesus of Nazareth, and that alone is prophetic.
[time=1092] Even a location that fulfills prophecy.
[time=1095] Nazareth was this little town.
[time=1096] Most scholars would estimate the population around the time of Jesus, probably something like 500 people.
[time=1102] I mean, very small, just like Bethlehem.
[time=1105] Little nothing town, but it's talked about by Matthew and Matthew chapter two, starting in verse 19, will read through the end of the chapter.
[time=1112] But when Herod died, beholden angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt saying rise, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel.
[time=1121] For those who sought the child's life are dead.
[time=1124] And he rose and took the child and his mother, by the way, a whole other sermon, preached it before, loved the obedience displayed by Joseph and Mary.
[time=1133] I would be going, hold on, angel.
[time=1135] I got 7,822 more questions before I'm going anywhere, buddy.
[time=1141] That would probably, I mean, I'm just being honest.
[time=1142] You're like, well, I thought you were a good pastor.
[time=1144] You would too.
[time=1145] And I'm sure they had them, but they just went.
[time=1147] They trusted a whole other sermon.
[time=1149] No extra charge for that part.
[time=1152] Where were we?
[time=1153] Verse 21, "And he rose and took the child and his mother "and went to the land of Israel.
[time=1157] "But when he heard that Arkelos was reigning over Judea "and the place of his father Herod, "he was afraid to go there and being warned in a dream." Notice also how God just takes care of his son and he takes care of his people who are obedient to him.
[time=1172] Being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee and he went and lived in a city called Nazareth.
[time=1179] That what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled.
[time=1184] He shall be called a Nazarene.
[time=1187] And certainly he would be known as Jesus of Nazareth in this little town.
[time=1192] And we know from Luke chapter one, verse 26 that Mary and Joseph lived there.
[time=1196] Luke chapter two, verse four.
[time=1198] Mary and Joseph had lived there.
[time=1199] And so it was an important place for them.
[time=1200] And certainly finding out that Herod's son was in Bethlehem where likely maybe they were thinking they would go back to.
[time=1207] We don't totally know what was in their thoughts and their plans other than what we just read about.
[time=1212] But then they say, well, let's go somewhere else.
[time=1214] And they ended up going to Nazareth, which they had both lived there.
[time=1217] And it was a part of Galilee.
[time=1219] It was a part of the same region where God had told them to go back to again, fulfilling more and more prophecies and words of the Lord.
[time=1227] But verse 23, scholars debate over exactly what prophecy, because it's not as direct as a lot of these other prophecies where there's Old Testament prophets that directly say what Matthew says.
[time=1238] Now that could be things that were spoken and word of mouth had traveled or it could be one of the several things I'll give you now.
[time=1244] But verse 23, how is it a prophecy?
[time=1246] Some scholars would think, it probably ties to Isaiah chapter 11 and verse one.
[time=1251] We looked at that last week because it points to the lineage of Jesus.
[time=1254] It's coming from Jesse and from David.
[time=1256] It's the passage that says Jesus is going to be the chute or this branch that comes out of the stump of Jesse.
[time=1263] The Hebrew word for the chute or branch is Nezzar.
[time=1266] And so something, well, it's a picture of a Nazarene, a Nezzar, and it ties those passages together.
[time=1272] That could be the case.
[time=1273] Likely is the case.
[time=1275] The word of God fulfills itself over and over.
[time=1277] And as we looked at last week when the word of God quotes the word of God, you really should zoom in.
[time=1281] And that's exactly what we're doing in this series.
[time=1284] I think it's most likely that this prophecy that's being fulfilled is the fact that Jesus would become known as Jesus of Nazareth.
[time=1292] And Nazareth is this little nothing town that nobody had heard of that has this, just hundreds as a population.
[time=1299] But it also was this rejected people.
[time=1302] It was a people that would be a rejected people.
[time=1305] And so would Jesus be.
[time=1307] As Isaiah, some 700 plus years before Jesus was born prophesied, Jesus would be a suffering servant.
[time=1313] He would be rejected.
[time=1315] And just like he would be rejected, Galilee was looked down upon by Judeans, specifically Nazareth.
[time=1322] Nazareth was in Galilee.
[time=1324] And it was specifically looked down on by Judeans.
[time=1328] And so let me prove that to you.
[time=1329] Later in Jesus ministry, John chapter one, this is when Jesus was calling his disciples.
[time=1334] And we see it coming together later.
[time=1336] Says the next day, John chapter one, verses 43 through 46, the next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee.
[time=1343] He found Philip and said to him, follow me.
[time=1345] And now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter of Philip found Nathaniel and said to him, we have found him of whom Moses and the law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of, say it with me, Jesus of Nazareth.
[time=1362] And he's fulfilling there again, these prophecies, the son of Joseph.
[time=1365] Nathaniel, I love verse 46.
[time=1367] Nathaniel said to him, can anything good come out of Nazareth?
[time=1371] Shows you what they thought of that place, right?
[time=1373] But boy did something good come out of Nazareth.
[time=1377] And I love Philip's response because he simply said to him, come and see.
[time=1382] And that's my invitation to you today, come and see.
[time=1385] Can anything good come from Nazareth?
[time=1387] Can anything good come from my life?
[time=1388] Can anything good come from this baby born in a manger?
[time=1392] Can anything good come from God who would let 2020 happen?
[time=1395] Can anything good come from a God that's supposedly good that would let A, B, C, D, E, or F in the lift?
[time=1401] List goes on and on and on.
[time=1402] Can anything good come from him?
[time=1405] And today my question to you is the same as what Philip said, come and see, come and see, come taste and see that the Lord is good and you see him fulfilling his promises.
[time=1416] And I think that part of the prophecy that these things point to things like Psalm 22 or specifically I wanna zoom in on Isaiah chapter 53, we'll put that on the screen for you because this is true, rejection, write this down.
[time=1429] Rejection fulfilled prophecy, it did, and it even is seen in Nazareth and in the life of Jesus, but it also fostered purpose.
[time=1437] And some of you feel dejected and rejected these days, but God wants to not just use the rejection of his son to fulfill prophecy.
[time=1445] He wants to use the rejections, the denials, the hurts, the pains of your life to foster purpose that you wouldn't have otherwise.
[time=1455] And Jesus is the ultimate picture of that.
[time=1457] He wants to redeem your hurts and rejections and the pain for his purpose.
[time=1461] Isaiah 53 talks of Jesus as this suffering servant, this Jesus who would be rejected.
[time=1468] And so let's read that together.
[time=1469] Isaiah 53, two through six.
[time=1472] This was written over 700 years before Jesus would come.
[time=1475] For he grew up before him like a young plant and like a root out of dry ground.
[time=1480] He had no form or majesty that we should look at him and no beauty that we should desire him.
[time=1485] Here it is, he was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.
[time=1491] And as one from whom men hid their faces, he was despised and we esteemed him not.
[time=1496] Surely he was born our griefs and carried our sorrows.
[time=1500] Yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God and afflicted, but he was pierced for our transgressions.
[time=1507] He was crushed for our iniquities.
[time=1509] Upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace and with his wounds we are healed.
[time=1516] All we like sheep have gone astray.
[time=1518] Remember the shepherding language I talked to you about earlier from second Samuel?
[time=1522] All we like sheep have gone astray.
[time=1524] We have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[time=1530] Jesus was rejected, I'll give you three areas, in his life and his birth and his life and his death.
[time=1536] Jesus was rejected in his birth, his life and his death.
[time=1539] I'll give you a few examples of each.
[time=1541] In his birth, Luke chapter two and verse seven, we find that there was no room for him in the end.
[time=1546] He was rejected even at his birth.
[time=1548] In his life, John chapter seven and verse five, we see that even his own brothers didn't believe in him.
[time=1554] They would at the resurrection and boy, I'm sure glad they did.
[time=1557] They became leaders in God's church.
[time=1559] And another one you could jot down is Luke chapter four, it's not in your notes, but Jesus was rejected, not just in his life by his own family, not just in his birth, there's no room for him in the end.
[time=1570] He was rejected by none other than Nazareth.
[time=1573] And in this amazing passage, you should see what happens in Luke chapter four, you could study it this week, verses 14 through 30.
[time=1580] This rejected town that was his hometown ends up rejecting the Savior who had come to save them.
[time=1587] And even that points to prophecies in the Old Testament.
[time=1592] But then in his death, and notice as I read first Peter, chapter two, verses 21 through 25.
[time=1598] This is in his death, Jesus was again rejected, obviously he was murdered for us.
[time=1603] Notice the picture in first Peter chapter two.
[time=1606] No, you gotta remember, this has written some 60 plus years after Jesus was born.
[time=1611] And Isaiah written some 700 plus years before he was born.
[time=1616] Amazing picture of how the scriptures harmonize and come together, but let's read first Peter chapter two, verses 21 through 25.
[time=1623] Notice the language similar to Isaiah.
[time=1625] For to this, you've been called.
[time=1628] For Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps.
[time=1633] He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.
[time=1637] When he was reviled, he did not revile in return.
[time=1640] When he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly.
[time=1646] He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.
[time=1654] By his wounds, you've been healed.
[time=1656] Does that sound familiar, verse 25.
[time=1658] For you are straying light sheep, but have now returned to the shepherd and overseer of your souls.
[time=1665] And maybe you can relate, maybe you can relate to Jesus.
[time=1668] Do you ever feel rejected?
[time=1670] Maybe because of who you came from, your own lineage.
[time=1673] Or maybe your location, where you came from, where you grew up, or perhaps even more where you are now.
[time=1679] Maybe lineage and location has had a big bearing on your life and the rejection that you often feel, well, these passages remind us you're in really good company because my Jesus loves you so much that he became rejected and despised so that he could pay that price for your sin and mine on that tree.
[time=1695] We don't think of that often at Christmas time, but that's the purpose.
[time=1699] Why did Jesus come so humbly?
[time=1701] So that he could pay the price for your sin and mine.
[time=1704] You feel rejected?
[time=1706] You're worried about where you came from, who you came from.
[time=1708] Well, Jesus has already overcome those things.
[time=1711] No matter who you come from, no matter where you come from, Jesus came and his life and the life that he gives is way bigger than lineage.
[time=1721] It's way bigger than location.
[time=1722] Write it down this way this week when it comes to the location prophecies of God.
[time=1726] How do we personalize this?
[time=1727] How do we apply it and practice it this week?
[time=1730] No matter where you've been or where you are, I declare it over you today.
[time=1734] No matter where you've been or where you are, Jesus came for you.
[time=1740] He came for you.
[time=1741] That, my friends, is the point of Christmas.
[time=1744] That is why Jesus fulfilled prophecy.
[time=1746] That is why we can know that Jesus is the only way to live a fulfilled life.
[time=1750] He fulfilled prophecy so we could believe the promises of God.
[time=1755] And he promises you that he is your peace.
[time=1759] Peace came and became personified.
[time=1763] Truth came and became personified by this little baby who came in the most humble of forms.
[time=1769] He didn't come with this wave of lightning.
[time=1771] He came like a winter snow.
[time=1772] There's a song about that.
[time=1773] I love it, it's beautiful.
[time=1775] Because he just descended upon us and the word became flesh and dwelt among us.
[time=1779] And that is the point of Christmas.
[time=1783] And the point of Christmas is so that moments like right now can happen where we as believers would recognize Jesus for who he is in such a way that we live it out in our world, where we practice his peace, where we practice his love in our own life, and also so that those who are far from God, those of you who today, the Holy Spirit, is working inside of you and saying, I realize today that I am a center in need of a savior.
[time=1804] I realize my sin separates me from God and that Jesus came.
[time=1808] Now that's the point of Christmas.
[time=1809] He came so that I could have life and have it more abundantly.
[time=1812] You realize that in a new way today.
[time=1814] And today is your day of salvation.
[time=1816] What a beautiful Christmas it's going to be.
[time=1818] What a beautiful Christmas Eve when we have communion together and celebrate the body that was broken, his blood that was spilled out, which is why he came at Christmas.
[time=1827] What a beautiful time it's going to be for you if you surrender your life to him today.
[time=1833] And I want to ask you to bow your heads and close your eyes and give you a moment to take whatever step it is that God has prompted inside of your heart.
[time=1840] If you don't know Jesus today, it really is that simple.
[time=1843] It really is as simple as in your own words, letting him know that you know you're separated from him because of sin, you believe Jesus paid that price after he lived that sinless life you couldn't live.
[time=1853] That he rose from the dead and that you trust in him, confess with your mouth, let him know today that you believe he is Lord, that he has risen, that you're trusting in him and not in you or anything or anybody else for your salvation.
[time=1867] And you shall be saved.
[time=1868] Anyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
[time=1871] What a day to do that.
[time=1873] I want to give you a moment to take that step as believers are praying as how we can.
[time=1876] No matter who or where we come from, know that Jesus came for us and show the world that very thing this Christmas.
[time=1882] Let's pray together for a moment.
[time=1883] I give you a moment to respond.
