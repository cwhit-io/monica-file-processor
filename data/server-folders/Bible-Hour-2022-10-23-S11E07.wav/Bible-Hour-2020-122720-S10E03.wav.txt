[time=0] They wanna talk to you about lordship prophecies.
[time=3] And we're in a series of messages called fulfilled where we're looking at how Jesus fulfilled prophecies of old.
[time=9] And we've been through old and New Testament scriptures that are all Christmas scriptures.
[time=14] And so we are excited to kind of conclude that today.
[time=17] We spent three weeks now after today looking at this very fact that Jesus fulfilled prophecy.
[time=23] And so as we look at lordship scriptures and prophecies today, our hope is that in a world that is full of bad news, fake news, that we can be reminded of the good news.
[time=33] Can I get a name in?
[time=35] If you needed some good news today, if your heart is discouraged, you're in the right place because Jesus is ready to meet you there.
[time=40] And so you may say, why are we looking at prophecies at Christmas time?
[time=44] It's really simple.
[time=45] It's that prophecies point to God's promises.
[time=50] And if we see that God promised these things, AKA prophecies, and they came to pass, he fulfilled them, then he must be a trustworthy God.
[time=60] And I don't know about you, but I need a trustworthy God in a year like 2020 and in a world like ours today.
[time=66] And so second Corinthians chapter one, and verse 20 says this, "For all the promises of God find their yes in him." And I came to declare over your life today, Jesus is trustworthy, he is who he says he is, and he loves you right where you are.
[time=84] Jesus fulfilled prophecy.
[time=85] So today, no matter where you are in your walk of faith, you can know that God's promises are true.
[time=92] And so the first week we looked at the lineage prophecies.
[time=95] We looked at the genealogy of Jesus.
[time=97] We looked at the fact that there are prostitutes and sinners listed in Matthew chapter one, the genealogy and the lineage of Jesus.
[time=104] And it encouraged my heart, and hopefully yours too, that as we look at all of these prophecies of lineage being fulfilled in Jesus, we see that it doesn't matter who you come from when it comes to Jesus.
[time=115] Last week we looked at location prophecies.
[time=117] He was to be born in Bethlehem.
[time=118] We looked at Egypt and Nazareth and all of these prophecies that had to do with locations.
[time=123] And we were reminded it doesn't matter when it comes to Jesus.
[time=126] It doesn't matter where you come from.
[time=129] It doesn't matter where you are because Jesus meets you there.
[time=132] And this week as we look at lordship prophecies, my hope is that as we realize it doesn't matter who you come from and where you come from, is that we can all go into Christmas week this week, realizing and remembering.
[time=145] It only matters who you trust.
[time=148] As we look at the lordship of Jesus, we're gonna see that he is trustworthy.
[time=152] There's so many prophecies about who Jesus would be, who Jesus is.
[time=156] So my hope is to just remind you of who he is today.
[time=159] Jesus did that as well.
[time=161] In John chapter five, before we start on this journey together, John chapter five in verse 39, I'll start there.
[time=167] He's speaking to Jews and to religious leaders who were questioning who he was.
[time=172] Jesus says he's the son of God and they struggled with that.
[time=175] It's blasphemy to them.
[time=176] And he went on this long discourse about who he was.
[time=179] And within that is captured this thought that I think just really captures who we are as God's people, both religious people and people who are skeptical in their faith.
[time=189] And there's all kinds of people on that spectrum that are in tune with us today.
[time=194] So Jesus said this to us in John chapter five, 39 and 40.
[time=198] He said, you search the scriptures because you think that in them, you have eternal life.
[time=204] And it is they that bear witness about me, yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life.
[time=212] And as I listen to the words of Jesus there, I'm reminded that in a room like this and on screens like yours throughout the world, as we gather together today, there are people on all different ends of the spectrum from very religious church kids.
[time=226] I'm a PK, I grew up in the church.
[time=228] I was just about born there, I think.
[time=230] I've been in church ministry situations all of my life.
[time=234] And then several who I could also identify with because of my background there, I for a very long while in high school, particularly was very skeptical of the stuff that I was told to believe.
[time=244] And then I came to find that it actually is true.
[time=247] And I've given my life to preaching it.
[time=249] And I'm not supposed to be a preacher because the aptitude test in high school said, "The number one thing not to do is anything to do with public speaking." And God said, "Let's make that guy a preacher." And so wherever you may be to the far end of religion, because I believe this, that Jesus is talking to those people in John chapter five, and for us it breaks my heart as a Bible scholar that I've been for many years.
[time=271] And so many people are so far advanced and beyond where I am at, but in the church so many times we get so hung up on secondary issues, things that matter, things we should study, but we get so stuck on things that are secondary to the Jesus who is the point of scripture that we get distracted to the point where listen, we get paralyzed in our faith.
[time=293] And I pray for you that if you're paralyzed in your faith on the religious end of the spectrum, that Jesus reminds you today, John chapter five, that all the scriptures you may be getting hung up in what they say and don't say in the seeming contradictions and the disagreements about this or that, but I am the point of scripture and I am the point of Christmas.
[time=312] And if you're skeptical on the other end, we actually have a lot in common.
[time=316] In religion we get kind of paralyzed in our faith and we get overtaken and consumed by secondary issues, but sometimes those same issues cause us not to get paralyzed in our faith, but rather to just dismiss faith.
[time=329] And I believe God has made this a divine appointment today, if that's where you're at.
[time=333] Not because you get to listen to my big mouth, but because Jesus has a word for you, wherever you're at, if you're paralyzed in your faith or if you're disinterested in faith and you have just dismissed it altogether today, I am excited to point you to the Jesus of the scripture.
[time=347] And as he reminds us, you may look for life in the word of God and we do and is found there, but the reason it's found there is because every book of the Bible points to Jesus.
[time=359] He's not just the reason for Christmas, he's the reason and the point of scripture.
[time=363] Now, if you are in the skeptical category, as I have been in the past, I am so thankful for people who took Jesus' words seriously and even set out to scientifically, archaeologically, biblically, theologically, yes, but even mathematically show us how the prophecy specifically, but how Jesus is who he says he is and I stumbled across an amazing resource I wanna introduce you to today, it's called Science Speaks.
[time=390] And I think the first, there's a picture on the screen, you can write that down, if you wanna look at it, it's actually online as well.
[time=396] The first publish of this book was I think in 1944 by Peter Stoner, you can Google that and you will find this book and I'll tell you about it more in a moment, but his grandson Donald actually published it in 2002 online so that you can access it, it's out of print and you can access it now.
[time=414] And for those of you who maybe need some of that mathematical scientific proof, let me indulge for just a moment as we look at these prophecies today because what Peter Stoner did is he took a group of college students, it was some 600 plus students and I think it was 12 college classes in Christian evidences, so an apologetics kind of Christian evidence type class and they did research and took mathematic probabilities, the principles of probability and they took the populations of eight prophecies, it was just eight of the prophecies that had to do with Jesus' birth, most of them had to do with locations like what we looked at last week, looked at the populations, the probabilities, the mathematic and scientific principles that just went way over my head in so many ways, I'm a little bit of a nerd when it comes to those things but those of you who are science or math nerds, you need to Google this and just read the whole thing, I'm telling you, I read it way more times than I'd care to admit this week and it just blew my mind but I wanna share a few of the things that they discovered.
[time=473] So they took these eight prophecies and using those populations and probabilities, they discovered what would be the odds, what would be the chance, what would be the probability, a one in what chance, that one human man who's not God could fulfill them and here's what they found.
[time=491] So combined of those eight prophecies, the chance or probability came down to one in 10 to the 17th power, here's that number on the screen, one man in 10 to the 17th power would have the probability that the prophets would have been able to hundreds of years before his birth to have written these prophecies and then them line up and be reminded that these are archeologically, historically preserved documents, even if you don't believe in scripture, these are things that we can hold to and know just from a practical concrete kind of sense that one in that number would be able to fulfill those prophecies and if you're like, well, Jesus just walked around knowing the prophecies and he tried to just fulfill them because he knew the Old Testament and he said, well, I need to do this one today so that one gets fulfilled.
[time=535] How many of you I remind you from last week had any say in where you were born?
[time=539] Exactly.
[time=540] And if Jesus was just a human, then neither would he, but oh, it got better.
[time=545] And if you want a visual of this, I've got a coin here.
[time=548] Looks a little like a silver dollar, but so you've seen silver dollars.
[time=552] And so to make that kind of concrete, here's what they came up with.
[time=555] I'm gonna just read it to you straight from their word.
[time=558] He said, suppose that we take this number 10 to the 17th power, silver dollars lay them on the face of Texas.
[time=565] They would cover the state two feet deep.
[time=569] Pretty incredible.
[time=569] Now, mark one of those silver dollars, stir the whole mass thoroughly all over the state, blindfold a man and tell him he can travel as far as he wishes, but he must pick up one silver dollar and say this is the right one, the marked one.
[time=585] Here's the question.
[time=586] What chance would he have of getting the right one?
[time=589] Just the same chance that the prophets would have had of writing these eight prophecies and having them all come true in any one man.
[time=598] Pretty incredible.
[time=599] But they didn't stop there.
[time=600] They expanded the study of eight prophecies to 48 prophecies.
[time=604] Can you even imagine?
[time=605] And by the way, there are hundreds of them.
[time=607] And so they expanded this to 48 prophecies and they expanded that experiment.
[time=612] And here's the number is 10 to the 157th power, one in 10 to the 157th power.
[time=617] Here's that number.
[time=618] Check this out.
[time=620] Yeah.
[time=621] And then they tried to do a visual model, a visualization model for that.
[time=625] And silver dollars wouldn't work because they were way too big.
[time=628] And so they took electrons.
[time=630] And then they ended up using phrases like light years and you get the picture.
[time=634] I'm not gonna try to even begin to pretend I'm the scientist that can explain those things, but you can Google it and find it.
[time=640] But here's what they wrote at the conclusion of that study in summary.
[time=643] They said any man who rejects Christ as the son of God is rejecting a fact proved perhaps more absolutely than any other fact in the world.
[time=654] And I believe that to be the case.
[time=656] And no matter where you are on the scale of religion and skeptical nature in your faith, God wants to meet you where you are today because he is true, he is trustworthy, and he loves you.
[time=667] And I wanna just brag on him for a few minutes and give you five lordship prophecies that we see in the Old and New Testament.
[time=673] Number one comes from Isaiah chapter nine and verse six.
[time=676] We're gonna be all over.
[time=677] You can follow us on the church app.
[time=679] You can Google or you can look for Black Hawk Ministries in your app store and we've got all the blanks there in the scriptures 'cause there's gonna be a lot of 'em today that we're gonna look in together.
[time=688] Jesus is God is prophecies number one.
[time=690] It was prophesied that Jesus is God.
[time=692] Isaiah chapter nine and verse six.
[time=694] Isaiah wrote over 700 years before Jesus was born.
[time=699] And here's what he said, and this was my little girl's memory verse in the school here, and I'm so thankful for it.
[time=705] So we've been studying, looking at it, got to read to her class this week and they all said their verse to me, it's just beautiful.
[time=711] But Isaiah chapter nine and verse six.
[time=712] For to us a child is born, to us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, mighty God, everlasting father, prince of peace.
[time=727] And we went through each of those four names last Christmas, but today we're reminded of them because this was a prophecy that was written and notice that it says a child is born and a son is given.
[time=739] A child is born, so are these two different children?
[time=741] No, it's talking of the one Savior, Jesus, the Messiah.
[time=745] But the cool part about that is you can't say that the son of God is born because as we're gonna look at it a little bit later, that was also prophesied.
[time=753] He couldn't be born, but a baby could be born, a child could be born, so the child was born and Jesus came through the birth of that child.
[time=761] Why?
[time=762] So that the son could be given.
[time=763] You may wonder why are those two things there because the son of God can't be born.
[time=767] He's always been, as we're gonna look at together, but he came through the birth of a child.
[time=772] What a beautiful picture of prophecy that was to be fulfilled in Jesus.
[time=776] And in Luke chapter one, part of the Christmas story, verses 31 through 35, the angel is speaking to Jesus' mother Mary, and here's what we read.
[time=785] And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son and you shall call his name Jesus.
[time=790] He will be great, remember Jesus is God and will be called the son of the most high.
[time=796] And the Lord will give to him the throne of his father, David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever.
[time=802] And of his kingdom, there will be no end.
[time=804] And Mary said to the angel, something kind of like you and I might have said, she said, how will this be since I am a virgin?
[time=812] The angel answered her, verse 35, the Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the most high will overshadow you, therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the son of God.
[time=825] It was prophesied and fulfilled by Jesus, that Jesus is God.
[time=829] Luke chapter two and verse 11 tells us the same thing, for unto you is born this day in the city of David, who a savior, who is what?
[time=837] Christ the, say it with me, Christ the Lord.
[time=840] Let's say it again together, who is Christ the Lord?
[time=843] It was prophesied and it was fulfilled in Jesus, and Jesus is God.
[time=848] He is the son of the most high who came to dwell with us, which leads to the prophecy number two I want us to look at.
[time=854] And that is that Jesus is God with us.
[time=857] And that comes from Isaiah chapter seven and verse 14.
[time=861] Jesus is God, but he's also God with us.
[time=864] Emmanuel is the word here and it means God with us.
[time=868] God became a man so that man could know God.
[time=871] Isaiah seven, 14 says, therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign.
[time=876] Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name, Emmanuel.
[time=883] Matthew chapter one, we see the fulfillment of this, and a quote of what we just read in Isaiah.
[time=889] Again, over 700 years before the birth of Christ, Matthew one, 21, she will bear a son and you will call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.
[time=898] All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet.
[time=903] Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name, Emmanuel.
[time=907] And then it's spelled out for us, which means God with us.
[time=912] John chapter one also attests to this fact that Jesus is God with us.
[time=916] The word is word.
[time=918] The word is word, and the word used in John chapter one and verse 14 and in John chapter one in general is the Greek word logos, which means logic.
[time=927] It means where we get the word logic.
[time=929] It means reason, it means purpose.
[time=932] And in Greek philosophy, that word was seen as something that really was unattainable in a global sense.
[time=940] It was seen as something that we had to go out and pursue on our own.
[time=943] And then comes John writing about Jesus and says, no, no, no, no, it's not true.
[time=948] Meaning, purpose, logic, hope, it has a name.
[time=953] His name is Jesus.
[time=955] The word became flesh.
[time=957] John one 14, let's look at it together.
[time=958] And the word became flesh and dwelt among us.
[time=961] And we have seen his glory.
[time=963] You've seen this.
[time=964] It is attainable.
[time=966] This logos that you think you can't reach and achieve on your own.
[time=970] You're right, Jesus brought it to you.
[time=971] It's glory as of the only son from the Father, full of grace and of truth, John one 14.
[time=980] Colossians chapter two and verse nine captures the Christmas story, the fact that Jesus is God with us.
[time=986] Colossians two nine for in him and Jesus, the whole fullness of deity, that he's God dwells bodily.
[time=992] Jesus is God with us.
[time=995] He's God, he's God with us.
[time=996] Number three, he is king of all.
[time=999] This is where it gets really personal and good.
[time=1001] We're gonna do some application.
[time=1002] You need some application for Christmas, not if you do at home, not if you do.
[time=1005] And elbow that person, don't do it in the room 'cause everybody can see you.
[time=1008] But at home elbow that person, if they need to hear this today, Jesus is king of all, Psalm 72.
[time=1014] Again, hundreds and hundreds of years before the birth of Christ.
[time=1017] We see this prophecy pointing to the fact that Jesus, the Messiah, would be king of all.
[time=1023] Psalm 72, Psalm 72, verses 10 and 11.
[time=1027] Says, "May the kings of Tarshish "and of the coastlands render him tribute.
[time=1032] "May the kings of Shiba and Saba bring gifts.
[time=1035] "May all kings fall down before him.
[time=1038] "All nations serve him." Now those three locations mentioned there really were to point out the worldwide rule that Jesus would have because it's far east, it's far west, and it gives this picture of a global kind of rain, not a local kind of rain in a king, but a global kind of rain, which is pretty awesome in and of itself, but the cool part to me is you see that they would bring him gifts.
[time=1064] You see that they would bow down and worship him.
[time=1066] And if you were with us last week, I told you I'd go back to the wise men while we don't know what their exact status was.
[time=1072] They may have been some kinds of kings.
[time=1075] They certainly were rich people of high status.
[time=1078] And in Matthew chapter two and verse 11, here's what we see happening apart, just a part of the fulfillment of Psalm 72.
[time=1085] Says, "And going into the house," this is when I ruined your nativity scenes last week, if you're with us.
[time=1090] "If you don't know, you need to check out last week's sermon." Going into the house, they saw the child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him.
[time=1097] Then opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold, frankincense, and mer.
[time=1103] What a picture of the fact that Jesus came to rule and reign over everything.
[time=1108] And so here's where it gets personal for you and me.
[time=1110] He's fulfilled that.
[time=1111] And throughout history, he's fulfilled that.
[time=1113] Throughout the rest of the New Testament, Jesus fulfilled Psalm 72.
[time=1117] He's king of all.
[time=1117] He's the king of kings and the Lord of lords.
[time=1119] As he ascended to heaven, he reminded us that all authority has been given to him in heaven and on earth and under the earth, nothing.
[time=1126] Nothing can overthrow this throne of the king of kings and the Lord of lords.
[time=1130] And if that's true, and I submit to you today that it's true, that means that Jesus is king over your pain.
[time=1137] It means that Jesus is king over your loss.
[time=1140] It means that Jesus is king over your grief and over those things that I'm well aware in a season like Christmas, the joyful things get pretty magnified, don't they?
[time=1149] And you see them shine bright.
[time=1151] And I praise God for that because we could use some brightness shining today.
[time=1154] But in the same way, the tough things, those empty seats at the table, the people that you've lost, just had a neighbor that lost her husband.
[time=1161] I've done funerals throughout the pandemic.
[time=1163] And just, wow, it's brutally awful.
[time=1168] This thing called death any year, but especially this year.
[time=1172] And some of you are feeling the weight of that today.
[time=1174] My heart breaks for you, goes out to you.
[time=1177] I've had so many people in my own family in life that have lost loved ones.
[time=1181] So I feel that with you, but some of you are walking a darker path than I could ever even imagine.
[time=1186] So I wanna speak to you for just a moment and remind you that this Christmas that you say there can't be a purpose in the slaughter of babies in Egypt, like we looked at last week.
[time=1194] There can't be a purpose in my loss, in my grief, in my pain.
[time=1198] But I remind you today that Jesus is king of all, even of loss, even of pain.
[time=1204] And there is no pain that is wasted in God's economy because God always redeems even the most painful things for his purposes.
[time=1213] And one of those is the fact that Jesus is also king over death.
[time=1218] And that means he's defeated it.
[time=1219] And that means it will never rule and reign.
[time=1221] Right now we're in the impact of death, but Jesus, the same Jesus who came that first Christmas morning, gets this where it gets good.
[time=1228] This is where you can have hope this Christmas.
[time=1230] He's coming back.
[time=1232] And when he comes back, he's gonna make everything right.
[time=1235] And death will be no more.
[time=1237] And grief will be no more.
[time=1238] And tears will be wiped away.
[time=1240] And we will get to worship him together forever with the family of God.
[time=1245] That's why it's important to be a part of that family.
[time=1247] And if you are, it's why it's so important to hold tight to those truths this Christmas.
[time=1254] Know that you're not alone.
[time=1255] And know that because Jesus is king of all, light has come into darkness.
[time=1261] That means that every bit of the darkness you have to walk through in this life.
[time=1265] Because Jesus came that first Christmas morning, it means you'll never have to face darkness without the light ever again.
[time=1274] He's king of all and he loves you.
[time=1276] And he's fulfilled that prophecy and he's fulfilling it today.
[time=1279] And that's why we can have fulfillment in him.
[time=1282] Two more things, Jesus is God.
[time=1284] He's God with us.
[time=1285] He's king of all.
[time=1286] Number four, from Micah chapter five and verse two, Jesus always was.
[time=1291] He always was.
[time=1292] You thought that science stuff was gonna go over your head.
[time=1294] Wait till you see this thought for just a minute.
[time=1296] Jesus always was.
[time=1298] Micah five two, I left off a part of this last week 'cause I wanted to zoom in on it this week.
[time=1302] This is where we see Bethlehem being prophesied in locations, but the lordship is just as equally prophesied.
[time=1308] Micah chapter five, verse two.
[time=1310] But you, O Bethlehem, I brought the who were too little to be among the clans of Judah.
[time=1316] From you shall come forth for me, one who is to be ruler and Israel, whose coming forth is from old, from ancient days.
[time=1325] Jesus always was.
[time=1327] The son is given even though the child was born because Jesus always was.
[time=1332] You can write down this word with this one is eternal.
[time=1335] Eternal, or eternal means that there's no beginning or no end, which we'll get to in a moment.
[time=1340] And in John chapter one, going back to the logos for a moment, John chapter one, the first three verses reminds us of this.
[time=1346] It says in the beginning was the word.
[time=1349] There was no beginning, in the beginning.
[time=1351] There's no beginning for Jesus ever since and it keeps going.
[time=1354] In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God.
[time=1357] He was in the beginning with God.
[time=1359] All things were made through him and without him was not anything made, that was made.
[time=1365] And then Jesus later in his ministry, John chapter eight.
[time=1368] I've been young in ministry and I've heard a pastor recently say that there's probably one week in there.
[time=1374] If you ever feel too old to accomplish things, sometimes you ever feel too young to accomplish things.
[time=1379] Sometimes I've had a pastor recently say there's probably a week in there somewhere where you're not too young to be a pastor or too old to be a pastor.
[time=1387] I don't know where that week is, but I'm glad that my Jesus uses us all.
[time=1390] So if you think you're too young or too old, well guess who else did Jesus?
[time=1394] And so in John chapter eight, let's look at this together.
[time=1396] John chapter eight, I think it's verse 57.
[time=1398] We see Jesus dealing with these religious leaders, and here's what he says to them.
[time=1402] So the Jews, they said to him, you're not yet 50 years old.
[time=1406] You're not old enough, Jesus.
[time=1407] And yet you talk of Abraham and yet you've seen Abraham.
[time=1410] Father Abraham, and here's what Jesus said to them.
[time=1413] Verse 58, truly, truly I say to you before Abraham was, I am, I am.
[time=1419] And the crazy thing about the fact that Jesus is God, he's the great I am, he's always been.
[time=1425] Jesus always was, he is eternal.
[time=1427] The amazing thing about that fact is that if God is the great I am, if Jesus is I am, that means we have to say, you're ready for this, it's humbling, I am not.
[time=1438] If he's I am, I am not.
[time=1441] But I can know the great I am, and I can be a part of his family.
[time=1445] And he loves me and cares for me because he is the great I am who came to meet me and my sin and pay that price.
[time=1452] And so today be encouraged by that.
[time=1453] Another one you could jot down is Colossians one, the whole chapter, if you want to devotional this week, but specifically verses 15 through 19 of Colossians one, remind us of the fact that by him, by Jesus, all things were created, he is the beginning.
[time=1467] He is the beginning, he's the Alpha, he's the Omega, the beginning and the end, Jesus always was.
[time=1473] Then it doesn't stop there.
[time=1474] Number five, Jesus always will be.
[time=1477] And here's where it gets really personal for you and applicable to your life in so many ways.
[time=1482] Jesus always will be Psalm 102, reminds us of this fact, Jesus always will be.
[time=1487] Psalm 102, the Psalmist writes, "Of old, you laid the foundation of the earth, "and the heavens are the work of your hand." That's the beginning part.
[time=1494] They will perish, but you will remain.
[time=1497] But you will remain.
[time=1498] They will all wear out like a garment.
[time=1499] You will change them like a robe.
[time=1501] They will all pass away, but you are the same.
[time=1504] You and your years have no end.
[time=1508] The word you can write down with this one is everlasting.
[time=1511] Not only is Jesus eternal, he always was.
[time=1514] Jesus is everlasting, he always will be.
[time=1517] It means there's no end.
[time=1519] He's forever in existence and in power.
[time=1521] In Moses, I love in the Psalms that it captures Moses and a prayer of Moses said this in Psalm 90, the first two verses.
[time=1529] He says, "Lord, you've been our dwelling place "in all generations before the mountains were brought forth, "or ever you had formed the earth and the world.
[time=1538] "From everlasting to everlasting, you are God."
[time=1544] Who'd have thought a little baby could fulfill all of these things?
[time=1548] And then in Hebrews, the writer of Hebrews talks about and quotes directly this hundreds of years old prophecies that we read that foretells what Jesus would be and who he would be as the Lord of Lords.
[time=1559] Hebrews one, 10 through 12, he quotes that Psalm directly and says, "And you, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth "in the beginning and the heavens of the work of your hands.
[time=1567] "They will perish, but you remain." They will all wear out like a garment, like a robe.
[time=1572] You'll roll them up like a garment.
[time=1573] They will be changed, but you are the same and your years will have no end.
[time=1579] Why'd you read it to me twice, pastor?
[time=1581] It was this in there twice.
[time=1582] And where the Bible quotes itself, we best be listening.
[time=1585] And it reminds us today that Jesus always will be the same writer in Hebrews chapter 13 and verse eight captures this in a very succinct phrase that I wanna remind you of this Christmas.
[time=1596] It reminds us that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever.
[time=1603] You'll never change.
[time=1604] You notice 2020 has been a little bit of a wave up and down and left and right, ever changing.
[time=1611] We need some consistency in a year like 2020.
[time=1613] And Jesus is that steady horizon.
[time=1616] No matter what the waves of life look like for you, this Christmas season, look to Jesus.
[time=1621] Fix your eyes on Jesus, the author and perfector of your faith.
[time=1624] He's the beginning, he's the end.
[time=1626] He always was, he always will be.
[time=1629] Look to him, he will be your horizon.
[time=1632] The truth is, if Jesus is constant and oh, he is constant, if Jesus is constant, that means I can live in consistent contentment.
[time=1641] Could you use some consistent contentment in your life?
[time=1644] I know I could, in an inconsistent world.
[time=1646] I wanna be content.
[time=1648] I wanna be filled with joy and you can be because Jesus is joy.
[time=1652] Joy is not an external thing that you feel.
[time=1655] Peace is not an external thing that you gotta grasp and hold on to and not let go.
[time=1659] Peace and joy and contentment became flesh and dwelt among us.
[time=1663] His name is Jesus.
[time=1665] Jesus is joy and peace personified.
[time=1667] And because he came that first Christmas morning, you can live in consistent contentment and joy.
[time=1674] Even when it don't feel very joyful, you ever have those mornings where it's just not gonna be a joyful day.
[time=1679] I'm not gonna be joyful.
[time=1683] Well, when you know Jesus, joy is right on the inside of you.
[time=1686] I challenge you, look for him, fix your eyes on him, and you'll be able to fulfill what I pray you can find through this series.
[time=1693] Three weeks now, we've looked at lineage.
[time=1695] It doesn't matter who you've come from.
[time=1696] We've looked at locations.
[time=1697] It doesn't matter where you come from or where you are, lordship.
[time=1701] It only matters who you trust.
[time=1703] Psalm 118 in verse eight says, "It is better to take refuge in the Lord "than to trust in man." Who you trust, my friends, is more important than who or where you came from or where you are at.
[time=1716] May we take the posture of Mary, Luke chapter one, verse 38, where all this crazy inconsistency's going on and she says, "I'm the Lord's servant." That was her message and she lived it out.
[time=1729] May we do the same thing.
[time=1730] And I challenge you with this one question.
[time=1732] No matter where you may be on that spectrum of religious or skeptical or somewhere in between, I pray that this could be answered for you this Christmas.
[time=1739] Here's your application question for the week.
[time=1741] How can I embrace and emphasize the gift of Jesus this Christmas?
[time=1747] Maybe you need to embrace him.
[time=1749] It's time to realize that he did come for you.
[time=1751] That these prophecies and scripture all attest to the fact that he is who he says he is and he came for a purpose.
[time=1758] Not just so that we could have major scenes on Christmas and have a reason to get a little bit of hope here and there.
[time=1764] No, because we had a sin problem and Jesus came into that world of sin, lived the sinless life.
[time=1770] We could never have lived on our own to pay a price for your sin in mind that I could never pay.
[time=1776] You could never pay.
[time=1777] He paid that debt becoming our perfect spotless sacrifice so that he could die for us but more importantly so that he could rise again and he is alive.
[time=1788] That's why Christmas is worth celebrating.
[time=1790] Not just that he came, but that he came for a purpose and that he rose from the dead so that that purpose could be fulfilled and he has fulfilled prophecy and the promised savior became flesh and dwelt among us in Jesus.
[time=1802] Maybe you need to embrace him.
[time=1803] That's salvation and that is the invitation for you but if you have embraced him, maybe you need to emphasize him a little bit more than politics.
[time=1811] Maybe you need to emphasize him a little bit more than painful things.
[time=1815] Maybe you need to emphasize him a little bit more at your family gatherings.
[time=1818] I don't know what emphasizing the gift of Jesus looks like for you this Christmas but that is the call of God this Christmas and may we walk into it with all of our hearts.
[time=1827] Don't ask you just to bow your heads and close your eyes.
[time=1829] Ponder, what does that mean for you?
[time=1831] How can you embrace and emphasize this gift of Jesus like Mary said, "I am the Lord's servant." And as you do today, my prayer for you is that this Christmas would be a Christmas like no other.
[time=1842] That's already taken care of, thanks 2020.
[time=1844] But spiritually, internally inside of you,
[time=1850] I pray it'll be a Christmas like you've never experienced before because you embrace and you emphasize the true meaning of Christmas in ways you never have before.
[time=1858] I wanna give you a moment to respond to that.
[time=1860] Maybe you need to accept Jesus as your savior.
[time=1862] I'm gonna lead you in a prayer.
[time=1863] I think your heart's screaming it.
[time=1864] I've told you the gospel, the good news.
[time=1866] Maybe you need to say, "Jesus, I trust in you to save me.
[time=1868] "Please forgive me of my sin.
[time=1870] "I believe you died.
[time=1871] "I believe you rose again." In your own words, when you cry that out to him, ask him to save you wherever you're at.
[time=1876] And this Christmas, you'll be a part of the family of God.
[time=1878] Or maybe you're a part of the family of God and it looks a little different this year to embrace and then to emphasize Jesus this Christmas and God's laying things on your heart of how you can be a picture of him this Christmas.
[time=1889] I wanna give you a moment of silence to just respond to him in this moment.
