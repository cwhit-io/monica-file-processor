[time=0] 2 Corinthians 8 and 9, we're going to spend four weeks in these two chapters, we're going
[time=8] to go through them verse by verse, and the first two weeks will be in chapter 8, and I'm going to give you some principles, we're going to call these overflowing principles.
[time=16] Today will be part one, I'll give you seven of them today, seven of them next week, and then we'll be in chapter nine for two weeks, and now we are there overflowing principles, they're overflowing promises, we'll spend two weeks looking at that.
[time=29] So today I'm excited to begin this series, each year at Black Hawk, we try to start the year doing a lot of what Jesus did, Jesus talked a lot about our possessions, our money,
[time=39] our things, and before you check out saying, "Oh, here comes the money, sermon," what we're going to learn is that the grace of God overflowing in our life, it always looks like generosity, but so has the early church.
[time=50] When you look at the early church in the midst of pandemics in the past, when you look at the early church through persecutions and trials, the church has always been known for its generosity, and generosity and grace goes so much deeper than a pocketbook.
[time=66] It's a lifestyle, it's a mindset that Jesus came to implement as he started the new kingdom.
[time=71] In the second Corinthians chapters eight and nine, the Apostle Paul is writing to the church at Corinth, and I want to start with just a little bit of context for this whole series, so important stuff here.
[time=83] If you haven't read the first and second books of Corinthians, these two letters, you will find if you do, that Paul and the church at Corinth had a lot of issues to work through, some really interesting issues, but one of those was this fact that the church had agreed
[time=99] to participate in an offering, kind of like what we do each year with a give light offering.
[time=103] This was an offering for the poor, offering for the saints, those who had needs, and they were going to meet those needs, and the church at Corinth had made a commitment but had not yet followed through, and so Paul is writing to them, he's sending Titus, we're going to look at all of these verse by verse, he's writing to them to help them follow through.
[time=121] The context here, as we look through this, write this down, these are two important words, is really intention and intentionality.
[time=130] That's a good word for us for 2021, y'all, I don't know where you're at, but sometimes my intention doesn't match my intentionality, sometimes I procrastinate, sometimes I don't
[time=141] follow through super well.
[time=144] Sometimes I don't overflow with intentionality about the things that I have good intentions
[time=150] for.
[time=151] And the church at Corinth had good intentions, they committed to participating in this offering, but a year had gone by and they had not met their intention with intentionality.
[time=161] Have you ever been there, kind of sounds like New Year's resolutions, doesn't it?
[time=164] And so Jesus helps us look through this, Paul helps us look through this, not just through the lens of generosity, did you know that Jesus talked about your stuff in almost half of his parables, 16 of his parables, he talked about money and stuff, did you know that the Bible has some 500 or so verses about prayer, pretty significant, but did you know that there are over 2,000 verses about our stuff and being intentional as stewards with our stuff, moving from intention to intentionality.
[time=192] And I want you to know today my friends, I can speak for myself and for Blackhawk, but more than that I want to speak for Jesus for a minute, is that Jesus isn't after your money, he's got plenty.
[time=203] God's pretty loaded, he owns the cattle on a thousand hill, everything that we see is his, but he invites us to be intentional and to manage that which belongs to him, he entrusts
[time=214] it to us as managers and stewards.
[time=217] And so this is at the heart of not just generosity, but of grace overflowing.
[time=221] The Bible in 1 Peter chapter 4 calls us managers, stewards of God's own grace, wow, I'm glad
[time=229] I get to be a part of that kind of a family.
[time=232] I want you to know today my friends as we start 2021 as we talk about generosity, as we talk about grace and it overflowing, we're looking at a tie between grace and generosity, but I want you to know Jesus doesn't want something from you, he wants something for you.
[time=246] And I do too, and I know God's got great things for you this year, and grace is a word that our elders have prayed over and just really sought the face and the heart of God this year.
[time=256] And it's a word you're going to be hearing and seeing as a theme throughout our year is that we want to be culture, we want to have a culture of, we want to be characterized by Jesus Christ, and to do that we have to be characterized by grace.
[time=268] And grace is so loud in a day that screams everything but grace, can I get an amen.
[time=275] And so that's going to look like generosity, that's going to look like relationships changing, that's going to look like your intentionality going through the roof this year that goes way deeper than New Year's resolutions.
[time=288] Intentionalities and grace is used 10 times in chapters 8 and 9 of 2 Corinthians.
[time=294] That's 10 of the 18 times that Paul uses the word in all of his writing to the church at Corinth.
[time=300] So it must be pretty significant in the context of this offering.
[time=303] So I'll start with this question much like you saw the video.
[time=307] How many of you see this glass, don't judge my proportions, you get the point, as half
[time=313] empty versus how many of you see this glass as half full.
[time=319] Sometimes you're half full, I try to be a half full person, like I'm positive, I often say I try to be the most positive person in every room I met, it's a good thing for you to do.
[time=327] But sometimes even when you're a half full person, it just feels like you don't have anything to offer.
[time=332] It feels that way in your bank account sometimes, can I get an amen.
[time=335] It feels that way in your energy sometimes, can I get another.
[time=338] It feels that way sometimes just in your spirit.
[time=342] Sometimes we feel like even though we're called to be generous and overflow with grace, even when we try to see the glass as half full, we just sometimes feel empty.
[time=352] And years like 2020 leave us feeling about like this.
[time=356] Even though there's supposedly something in there, we see you only drops coming out.
[time=360] And we're looking and we're hoping that there's more to the story, but it just feels empty sometimes.
[time=365] If you feel drained, the question we're trying to look at in this series is how can I be a faithfully overflowing, generous, grace-filled person?
[time=374] How can I be faithfully generous even when it feels like there's not enough?
[time=380] That should touch all of us in one way or another.
[time=383] So as we look at this context of intention versus intentionality, this church, the church is at Macedonia or used by Paul as an example for the church at Corinth.
[time=393] Now the church is at Macedonia that we'll read about in a minute.
[time=395] This is Philippi.
[time=396] It's Thessalonica.
[time=397] It's Berea.
[time=398] It's churches that were among the first that supported Paul and his ministry.
[time=401] And they didn't have a lot of money, but yet Paul calls them rich.
[time=405] And Jesus does the same.
[time=406] And we'll see why as we go through this series.
[time=409] And they had agreed to be a part of this offering, much like all of us did.
[time=412] And that's why I commend you church.
[time=414] It didn't take us a year to meet our goal.
[time=416] Can I get a name in?
[time=417] We're excited about what God's done in and through us.
[time=419] But the church at Corinth had good intentions, but not such good follow through and intentionality.
[time=425] Something got this.
[time=426] Something had interrupted their intentions.
[time=429] Has that ever happened to you?
[time=432] Maybe it's happening to you even with your three days in to January and maybe your New Year's resolutions.
[time=438] Those good intentions have already been interrupted by that donut or whatever it might have been that stepped in and interrupted most of the time it's way worse than just a donut.
[time=447] But today here's what I want to tell you, and this is the premise of the whole series, that God's grace.
[time=451] Write this down.
[time=452] God's grace bridges the gap between intention and intentionality.
[time=457] Now here's what that does not mean.
[time=459] That does not mean that God in His grace, even when we're not intentional with something that we have good intentions for, He just swoops in and deletes all the donuts that you ate in January, that you promised yourself you weren't going to.
[time=471] That God's grace just swoops in and fills up your bank account even when we're not intentional in being good stewards and good managers, that God just gives on your behalf even when we don't make effort.
[time=481] That's not what this statement means.
[time=483] This statement does mean a couple of key things, that God's grace bridges the gap between our intention and our intentionality in that while we're still sinners Christ died for us in that where sin abounds grace does that much more abound, that God still loves you
[time=499] even when you fall flat on your face.
[time=502] Some of you came today just to hear that.
[time=504] That's the first part of the meaning behind this statement.
[time=506] The second is this, that God's grace doesn't just forgive, doesn't just love you in spite of, but God's grace is powerful.
[time=515] God's grace will empower you and overflow in you when you tap into His strength above
[time=521] your strength this year, His grace will overflow and that doesn't mean all your problems go away as we'll see in a moment, but it does mean that His grace will be bigger than all of your problems and all of the obstacles and all of the things that interrupt your good intentions.
[time=535] So here's what I want to do, I want to give you 14 ways that grace overflows through our
[time=542] generosity and this touches every area of life way beyond just our checkbooks.
[time=548] It's our time, it's our talent, our treasures, it's our relationships, our management of everything God has given us 14 ways and before you think you're going to miss lunch, I'm only going to give you seven this week and I'll give you seven next week.
[time=559] So let's go to 2 Corinthians chapter 8, we'll go through verse 11 and I'll give you seven of these principles, these overflowing principles and they're really great new year principles no matter where you may be because listen I want to help us, look at me for a minute, I want to help us, I want to help you.
[time=575] I want us in a world that's so distracting, that pulls us away and interrupts our good intentions.
[time=580] I want us to be anchored, there's an anchor, there's this hope, there's an anchor for our soul.
[time=585] You heard about him, his name is Jesus and these principles are going to keep you anchored to the hope that will carry you into this year and beyond and keep us focused on eternity.
[time=594] Number one comes from 2 Corinthians chapter 8, the first two verses and it is that we give out of emptiness.
[time=601] Some of you are like I was all fired up pastor and then you said emptiness but that's where many of us are even if you're a half full person, sometimes years like 2020 make us feel empty.
[time=612] So did the churches at Macedonia, the churches that Paul uses as an example for the church at Corinth.
[time=617] Word today, Black Hawk, let's read verses one and two where we see this picture of emptiness.
[time=623] The apostle Paul says we want you to know brothers about the grace of God that has been given among the churches of Macedonia for in a severe test of affliction, their abundance
[time=635] of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed, everybody say that with me, have overflowed
[time=643] in a wealth of generosity on their part.
[time=648] We give out of emptiness.
[time=650] Verse one we see that God's grace was given freely to the churches at Macedonia.
[time=654] It would be kind of like us saying because they had had extreme poverty, all these tests and severe trials, it would be kind of like us saying God's grace flowed so freely through
[time=665] 2020 and we get real silent in that moment but I want you to know I believe it to be true.
[time=671] As I've watched God, as I've reflected at this year in, I remember so many things and see so many things that God has done in and through his church, listen, that he couldn't and wouldn't have done in a quote unquote normal year and I know it's been painful and there's been death and there's been loss and there's been all of these horrific things that one day and what a day it's going to be that God will wipe away and it will be no more but in the meantime God wants to use emptiness to do his will and his work in and through his
[time=702] church and we get a picture of that as we look at God's heart for his church.
[time=707] Paul get this did not equate grace given freely to the removal of affliction.
[time=714] He didn't say God's grace was given so freely to the churches at Macedonia and they had no afflictions, no tests, no trials and they had an abundance of wealth.
[time=721] He said they had an abundance of joy and it overflowed in generosity but it came through severe tests and affliction and extreme poverty.
[time=731] Some of you came today just to hear that.
[time=733] There's hope for you.
[time=734] You're like, wow, those churches are me.
[time=737] That's exactly what I brought to the table and Paul wants the churches at Corinth to get this learned from these churches who had nothing it would seem and I want to be that kind
[time=747] of church.
[time=748] This year, 2021, I want people all around the world to watch what we do as God's church
[time=755] at Black Hawk and say that's that kind of example that Paul was talking about with the churches in Macedonia.
[time=762] I want to be that kind of church, I want to be that kind of follower of Jesus.
[time=765] Write this down if you feel empty sometimes.
[time=768] God specializes in overflowing grace through empty vessels.
[time=772] We see it in these verses, we see it in the Old Testament, we see it in the New Testament.
[time=777] God takes people who physically have empty jars, you remember that?
[time=780] They were filled with oil but God takes empty people.
[time=783] God takes empty hearts and he overflows his grace and touches the world around us even
[time=790] through our emptiness.
[time=792] Emptiness can either be an excuse for you this year or it can be an encouragement.
[time=796] It can be an excuse to sit back and do nothing and whine and complain or it can be an encouragement
[time=802] to fix your eyes on Jesus and realize you serve a God who specializes in filling and overflowing and using empty vessels.
[time=810] Verse two, we see the picture of that severe test and affliction but that they overflowed.
[time=816] They overflowed as the word and generosity and the test, the severe test you see there in verse two, that word is a little different than the normally used word in the Greek language for like tests or trials or temptation.
[time=827] It usually refers, it's a word that kind of refers to the temptation or the problems within the test.
[time=832] This word is not that.
[time=833] This word actually refers more to a positive outcome that came because of the severe test.
[time=840] It points more to the end game than to the process of getting there.
[time=844] And I came to share with you and encourage your heart today that that is what we can do as believers.
[time=848] No matter what you brought with you into 2021, God is ready to bring a positive outcome that
[time=854] which the enemy and maybe even those around you and maybe even you sometimes mean for evil, God can use it and will use it for good.
[time=864] And that's what that word even means.
[time=865] So I go back to our question, is it half empty or is it half full?
[time=869] No matter where you're at, God's ready to overflow some grace in you.
[time=873] There's a couple examples of this.
[time=874] This is by the way the most important point of today's message, this emptiness point.
[time=878] If you don't get this, the rest of the points in verses three and onward, it really doesn't matter very much.
[time=883] If we think we've got to be full for God to use us, we miss the point.
[time=886] And so there's a couple of examples in Revelation you can jot down.
[time=889] The first, there's, Jesus talked about seven churches, the beginning of Revelation, Revelation chapter three, verses 14 through 22.
[time=897] He talks about the church at Laodicea.
[time=899] And this church is a church that was outwardly rich, but Jesus essentially calls them spiritually bankrupt.
[time=905] Here's some words that Jesus used about them.
[time=907] They had a lot of money, but he calls them wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, naked, empty.
[time=914] And then on the contrast, Revelation two, verses eight through eleven, is the church at Smyrna.
[time=919] And it liked the churches at Macedonia that Paul's talking about.
[time=922] It's a church that is stricken with poverty.
[time=925] It's a church that was filled with affliction, yet Jesus himself describes them as rich.
[time=934] Jesus doesn't quite do things in our earthly rational manner of thinking, does he?
[time=937] And I'm glad of that, because this world in its rationale, in its current seeming purpose,
[time=943] direction and trajectory.
[time=944] If your hope was in any of that, we're in a mess.
[time=947] But my Jesus flips it all upside down, and that which seems empty is what he will use to overflow.
[time=953] So we give out of emptiness number one, number two, we give with enthusiasm.
[time=957] That comes from verses three and four, because the Macedonians will see gave what they were able and then some.
[time=963] And they did it enthusiastically.
[time=965] Let's read verses three and four, where we see this thong.
[time=968] So they gave according to their means, as I can testify, and beyond their means of their
[time=974] own accord.
[time=975] Verse four, begging us earnestly.
[time=978] As a pastor, that'd be like, wow, that'd be something to see people knocking on the door, begging.
[time=983] Let us give.
[time=984] But you know, church, I've watched you with that kind of enthusiasm.
[time=986] And as I read this verse this week, I thought about this year in 2020 and how generous you've been.
[time=992] And I thank God for you.
[time=993] I really do.
[time=994] I praise God.
[time=995] So earnestly, for the favor or privilege that word could be translated, of taking part
[time=1001] in the relief of the saints, begging us earnestly.
[time=1004] I love these verses, verse three, they gave what they were able and then some.
[time=1008] They gave sacrificially.
[time=1009] They gave beyond their means.
[time=1011] You can write it down this way.
[time=1012] Godly generosity comes from overflowing grace, not from overwhelming guilt.
[time=1018] And Paul is saying, I didn't guilt you into giving.
[time=1020] They just did it of their own accord.
[time=1022] They just did it freely of their own heart.
[time=1024] They begged earnestly to be a part of this.
[time=1027] And I want to share with you.
[time=1028] Listen, if you give out of compulsion, if you give here through Blackhawk because you feel gilted into it, stop, Paul's.
[time=1036] Don't give, get right in a heart understanding, in a heart that is in tune with and connected
[time=1042] to God.
[time=1043] You don't hear a lot of pastors say that.
[time=1044] And then start again and do it for him and not because of anybody else, not because of your own guilt, not because of grandma or grandpa or mom or dad or anything other than what God has called us to do.
[time=1056] We'll look at that more specifically in a moment.
[time=1059] That's what Paul was telling them.
[time=1061] He said, I didn't compel them to do it.
[time=1062] They begged earnestly.
[time=1064] They were enthusiastic about giving willingly even though their cup seemed so empty.
[time=1071] They begged, verse four says, and it was a privilege for them to give and yet they had less to give than the churches at Corinth.
[time=1079] Did these churches at Macedonia, Thessalonica, Philippi, Berea, these places that were so
[time=1085] supportive of Paul's ministry, they didn't even have as much.
[time=1089] And yet they original language here of take part, they begged us earnestly to take part.
[time=1094] This is interesting.
[time=1095] If you're a Greek scholar, you've probably heard the word coinonia before.
[time=1098] There's church is named after this word.
[time=1101] It's typically translated means fellowship, means assembling, coming together, people talk about unity with that, it has so many deeper meanings does this word coinonia.
[time=1110] But what you read in the English standard version, taking part is actually coinonia.
[time=1115] It's the first time that we see this word using connection to a monetary collection to
[time=1121] giving, to money.
[time=1122] It's kind of interesting because it's that kind of enthusiasm that feeds and fuels unity
[time=1128] togetherness, being the body of Christ, being the fellowship, and didn't we see our church
[time=1135] come together.
[time=1136] That's why we are all about participation, not amounts around here.
[time=1139] We set a goal this year, but what we really wanted to see was people participated in this year and offering.
[time=1144] And I got to tell you, not only did we see more than 100% participate, we saw over 70
[time=1150] people give through black heart for the very first time this year.
[time=1154] Isn't God good?
[time=1156] That's coinonia, that's coming together, that is unity.
[time=1160] That is enthusiasm.
[time=1161] And for many, it was done through emptiness, not because you had a lot to give, but because you sacrificed.
[time=1166] And I thank God for you.
[time=1168] Number three is that we give out of obedience, not obligation, kind of continuing the previous
[time=1175] thought.
[time=1176] This comes from verses five and six because Paul gets this, he says, okay, so these Macedonians, they gave with enthusiasm, but here's why they gave with enthusiasm.
[time=1185] You say, well, how can I do it enthusiastically?
[time=1187] I don't feel very enthusiastic.
[time=1189] Raise your hand if you've ever tried to feel enthusiastic about giving, but you just couldn't quite get there.
[time=1193] I'll raise my hand.
[time=1195] Sometimes I want to be enthusiastic, but it's like, oh, I've got to, I could do, oh, I've got this thing, I've got this problem, that bill, and I kind of want that thing.
[time=1204] You know what I'm saying, right?
[time=1205] So how do we do it?
[time=1206] Verses five and six.
[time=1207] It's because of obedience, not obligation, verses five and six.
[time=1211] And this, not as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord.
[time=1219] And then by the will of God to us, accordingly we urge Titus that as he had started, so he
[time=1226] should complete among you this act of grace.
[time=1231] Some nine different ways that Paul describes this offering, but by far his favorite is act of grace.
[time=1236] It's grace.
[time=1237] It's about the offering and the light of grace here, and we see this enthusiasm bubbling over why?
[time=1242] Because of obedience.
[time=1243] He says that these Macedonians gave themselves first to the Lord.
[time=1248] And I've got to point something out, this is truly an encouragement.
[time=1250] If you consider yourself a follower of Jesus today, you're a part of the church, you're a part of the family of God, and notice God's heart for his church in this passage.
[time=1260] It's all about the church.
[time=1261] When you see giving and generosity, Paul, Jesus, God, through his word, points us to the church.
[time=1268] And that's why I know a lot of people who are extremely generous people, but really don't have much of anything to do with God's church.
[time=1274] And I believe with all my heart, if that describes you, you are missing so much that Jesus wants to do for you and in you and through you, because there is such a beauty and a command and a call for us to be a part of coming together through the church.
[time=1289] And I don't say that if those of you here are like, "Yeah, because you want the bills paid, Pastor." And that's kind of your job is to raise funds.
[time=1295] Listen, God has taken care of this church way longer than I can even count way more than I could ever even begin to imagine, and he always will.
[time=1304] I just want something for you, and I want you to this year, if you think I'm just out to get the money, I say this every year, I would challenge you, give it somewhere else.
[time=1313] And I believe you'll give and God will prompt your heart where you should give, but it should be through the local church.
[time=1318] Why?
[time=1319] Because God's heart is for the local church.
[time=1321] We have a phrase around here that we say often, "We don't give to Black Hawk, we give through
[time=1327] Black Hawk." That's what the churches at Bassadonia were doing.
[time=1331] They were giving to the Lord we gave.
[time=1333] They gave themselves to the Lord first and then to us.
[time=1336] That means they supported their ministry, gave to these offerings, and people ask questions about, you know, like, "Tithing," as an example.
[time=1343] You know, like, "Well, so what are you trying to say that I should start tithing?" I'm saying I think God wants to do way more than that.
[time=1349] How many of you remember the bike series giving in tandem that we did a year or two ago and I wrote in on the bike, "I've described to you before that I think tithing is really just the training wills of trust.
[time=1361] Tithing is the training wills of generosity." Because if you say, "Well, that's an Old Testament thing, Jesus came and fulfilled the Old Testament," he didn't come to abolish it, he came to fulfill it, but here's what he did with it.
[time=1371] He came and blew it up and he made it way bigger.
[time=1374] So if you are trying to get out of the 10 percent, if you want to do it the Jesus way, it really looks more like what we've challenged you with at year end giving.
[time=1380] It's Acts chapter 4 where it goes from 10 to 100.
[time=1384] It's where we just don't have anything that we consider our own, but we consider everything that is ours to be his and we have it in common and we say, "God, what you want me to do with your stuff, 100 percent is where I want my heart to be." And that's what, and you can do that enthusiastically.
[time=1400] I believe that.
[time=1402] Not just with money, but with your heart, with your relationships, with your time, your talent, and your treasures we can give because we're obedient to God.
[time=1409] It's the principle of first fruits.
[time=1411] They gave themselves to the Lord first.
[time=1414] First fruits goes all the way back to the book of Genesis, it's affirmed by Jesus, and we're called to give our first and best to God.
[time=1421] And they did that and godly generosity, get this, we'll always start with the right heart and you can't start with the right heart unless it's a generous heart, unless it's a heart that looks a lot like God.
[time=1432] And I believe that we don't ever look more like Jesus than when we're giving.
[time=1437] For God so loved the world, say it with me, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever
[time=1445] believes in Him would not perish, would have everlasting life.
[time=1448] For God so loved the world that He gave.
[time=1451] I'm glad God gave.
[time=1453] I'm glad I love because He first loved me.
[time=1455] I'm glad I get to give, a privilege of giving as the Macedonians saw it because He first gave to me.
[time=1461] The phrase will of God that you see in verse 5 here.
[time=1465] That's the beginning and the end of this collection, but also of what generosity is supposed to look like when we have a heart that's poised to overflow with grace.
[time=1473] Verse 6, we see Titus was sent in because we can't do this procrastination thing.
[time=1477] Let's go on and just on up to it.
[time=1479] How many of you on your screen at home and throw elbows at home?
[time=1482] Don't do it in the room because everybody's watching, but at home on the screen, throw those elbows.
[time=1486] Raise your hand if you're a procrastinator.
[time=1488] All right, you put it off and put it off again and put it off some more.
[time=1494] Well, Titus was sent in verse 6 to complete what had commenced.
[time=1499] To finish what was started, we're going to find out in a minute that it was a year that had gone by and we've got maybe some procrastinators in our house.
[time=1505] I won't say who they are because that'll get me in big trouble, but I'll tell you one person in my house who's not a procrastinator and that is little miss Callie Joy.
[time=1514] She's my middle child and she, if something's got to get done, it's like, "I'm going to get done." Come on, why are you sitting there, Dad?
[time=1521] And so we're at home and I don't know how many of you still have Christmas lights up and you're just trying to save.
[time=1526] It's okay.
[time=1527] There's no judgment in here.
[time=1528] Some of you think it's got to come down by January 1.
[time=1530] Some of you want to savor it and last a little longer.
[time=1532] I don't blame you, especially this year.
[time=1534] Hold on to those lights.
[time=1535] Let's light it up all year.
[time=1536] Jesus is on the throne.
[time=1538] He came.
[time=1538] We can celebrate it all year.
[time=1540] That's fine by me.
[time=1540] Can I get a name in?
[time=1542] But Callie was not okay with that.
[time=1544] She was ready to have those Christmas lights down.
[time=1546] We wanted to clean up the living room and so we did, because she's not a procrastinator.
[time=1551] But some of us are procrastinators and verse 6 reminds us of that because the word complete, he sent Titus to complete what they had started.
[time=1560] The word complete is epitolio in the Greek and it means to finish what was started to accomplish, get this, to complete action that was already begun or bring something to conclusion.
[time=1572] And so a good 2021 New Year's question for you and I believe God's ready to complete some things in your heart and life is what is something God has started inside of you that he wants to bring to completion, to accomplish in you and through you this year.
[time=1587] I dare you to ask him and he'll show you and he's got big things in store for you.
[time=1594] Give out of emptiness with enthusiasm, out of obedience, not because of obligation.
[time=1599] Number four, we give out of genuine growth, verses 7 and 8 shows us this genuine growth.
[time=1605] There's a list of things that we grow with, but out of it flows this act of grace, this generosity.
[time=1610] Let's look at it together.
[time=1611] We give out of genuine growth, verses 7 and 8.
[time=1614] Verse 7, "But as you excel in everything, in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all earnestness
[time=1622] and in our love for you, see that you excel in this act of grace also." Verse 8, "I say this not as a command, but to prove by the earnestness," this is the genuineness, the sincerity of others that your love also is genuine.
[time=1638] Faith, speech, knowledge, earnestness, the love that they shared as the church, but also this grace giving.
[time=1645] It is possible, listen, it is possible to get so wrapped up in the gifts of the Spirit in accumulating more knowledge, more giftedness, more abilities, more skill sets.
[time=1656] It is possible, and this is what Paul is teaching the people at Corinth, it's like don't get so consumed with all the good stuff that you have.
[time=1662] Those things are great, but it is possible to get so consumed with the gifts of the Spirit that you miss the grace of the Spirit.
[time=1670] And the same, listen, this is such a danger for God's church today.
[time=1674] May it never be so of us that we get so consumed as it was prone to be for the church at Corinth,
[time=1680] where we're all about filling up our notebooks, where we're all about knowing the next thing, where we're all about completing the next spiritual check mark, where we're all about having more gifts, having more skills, having more numbers, and by God's grace may He send all of those things and He will according to His will and His time, but may we never get so consumed with accumulating that we forget that God fills us up so that we can
[time=1706] pour out, so that His grace can overflow in us and through us.
[time=1712] God has not called us to be accumulators, listen, God always uses ignorance on fire more than
[time=1719] He uses intelligence on ice, and may it never be said of us that we just said in soak, but
[time=1727] that we get uncomfortable, and we get filled up so that we can pour out.
[time=1732] I don't negate those things because no doubt the glass needs to be full, and that's God's grace, that's His job.
[time=1738] He will fill us as we just come with open hands and open hearts, but the whole point is that it leads us, write this down, God's grace leads us from knowing to overflowing.
[time=1749] May it be so for us.
[time=1750] And the word here, for excel that you read about here in verses 7 and 8, you see it a
[time=1756] couple of times, it's the same word as overflow in verse 2, means to be welled up, bubbling
[time=1762] over, overflowing, that we excel in all of those things.
[time=1768] And Paul is saying that just like the Macedonians overflowed with generosity and this abundance of joy, the churches at Corinth, they overflow with gifts, but don't miss the point of the
[time=1779] gifts, and that is to be grace-filled, to overflow with the grace of God.
[time=1784] It's useless to have knowledge and gifts, but not overflow with God's grace.
[time=1788] True inward growth always leads to outward generosity, and that's genuine faith.
[time=1794] And let's practice our church smile, everybody get your church smile ready.
[time=1797] Your church smile looks like this, if you don't know what the church smile is, if you're new with us or watching us online, that's a smile you put on, even if you come to church in the building, you may have had a big fight, but as soon as you step out, you put on your church smile and it looks something like this, 3, 2, 1, even on the inside, you're really
[time=1813] gritting your teeth, you want people to see that it's all good here, you don't want anybody to know what's going on on the inside, and there's something to the enthusiasm of just putting your money where your mouth is and trusting and believing God and putting on a smile even when you don't feel like it.
[time=1827] That's a good thing, but not if it comes at the expense of vulnerability and transparency because we miss the emptiness principle.
[time=1834] We miss the opportunity for our emptiness to be shared among other believers and shared before our God so that He can fill us up even when we are the most empty.
[time=1843] That is why you need a life group this year.
[time=1845] God didn't call you to go through life alone, He wired you to know and to be known.
[time=1851] So may we tear off our church smiles and have genuine growth.
[time=1856] Verse 8, Paul wants them to live out this sincere, genuine kind of faith because genuine love
[time=1862] is always expressed through generosity.
[time=1865] Number 5 is that we give because of God's example, and this is the gospel.
[time=1869] I love verse 9 where we see this fifth principle here.
[time=1873] Look at verse 9 with me, "For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sake He became poor, so that you by His poverty might become rich."
[time=1888] I think in the same book here, 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 21, it says that, "He who knew no sin became sin, He became poor, so that we could become the righteousness of God.
[time=1901] He became poor so that we could inherit His riches." That is the gospel.
[time=1906] He took our place.
[time=1907] He became poor while we were poor and deserving of nothing but God's wrath because of our sin.
[time=1913] He took it all for us by dying that brutal death on the cross, and He rose from the dead so that we could have His riches.
[time=1920] His righteousness doesn't mean that life goes perfectly, it means we have peace and eternal life throughout whatever this temporary life brings our way.
[time=1928] That my friends is the gospel, and so we give because of God's example.
[time=1933] Number 6, we give with a heart to start.
[time=1938] Don't despise the little beginning steps.
[time=1941] Some of you have been so hard on yourself.
[time=1943] Look at me for a minute.
[time=1944] If you're your worst critic, I'm my worst critic, I'm preaching to me for a minute.
[time=1948] If you always beat yourself up, I've got two words for you, stop it.
[time=1955] God looks at you through the shed blood of Jesus.
[time=1959] And I know you're a knucklehead.
[time=1961] Me too.
[time=1962] God knows you're a knucklehead, but He doesn't despise your little beginning steps.
[time=1967] I want to share a moment with you from two years ago, right before Christmas in 2018, I got to, this is a big announcement.
[time=1974] You ready for this, y'all?
[time=1975] Jessica and I, as parents, have successfully taught three children how to walk.
[time=1982] Two years ago, our youngest was taking her first steps, Little Miss Kaya Grace, and it was right before Christmas, I think it was the 23rd.
[time=1989] So check this out.
[time=1990] Let's just see how we cheered her on.
[time=2004] One, two, three, you got it.
[time=2042] Five, six, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, sixteen, fifteen, sixteen.
[time=2066] Collectively we all say, oh, but here's the truth of the matter, those steps were terrible.
[time=2075] She couldn't even get started, she wobbled the whole time, it took over a minute to get
[time=2081] sixteen steps.
[time=2082] I mean, come on, that's awful, yet all of you are saying, oh, and there we were cheering her on saying, one, two, and we cheered her every step of the way.
[time=2091] Why?
[time=2092] Because it was the beginning for her.
[time=2093] She was starting something new, and we believed in her, and listen, my God has to say to you Zachariah chapter four and verse ten, I love the new living translation that says, do not despise these small beginnings for the Lord rejoices to see the work begin.
[time=2109] Maybe it's time to join a life group, to start tithing, to start being generous, to start
[time=2115] working on that relationship that you gave up on a long time ago, to find a place to plug in and use your gifts and serve in and through, and as a part of God's church this year.
[time=2125] Why?
[time=2126] Because God will cheer you on even when you fall flat on your face.
[time=2129] We give with a heart to start.
[time=2131] We give to take one step at a time, and our God will cheer us on and pick us up.
[time=2136] What do you think we did after that?
[time=2138] We picked her right back up, and we just kept on training.
[time=2141] We kept on cheering, and my God does the same thing with us.
[time=2145] But he does that so that number seven can happen, is that we give to follow through.
[time=2150] We give with follow through.
[time=2152] We don't just start.
[time=2153] We keep going.
[time=2154] Look at me for a minute.
[time=2155] God wants you to hear this, keep going.
[time=2159] He's behind you.
[time=2160] He's for you.
[time=2161] He's with you.
[time=2162] Verse 11 reminds us of this where Paul says, so now, finish doing it as well.
[time=2166] I didn't read verse 10, I think.
[time=2167] Let's go back to verse 10.
[time=2168] Put them together.
[time=2169] And in this matter, I give my judgment.
[time=2172] This benefits you, who a year ago started, not only to do this work, but also a desire
[time=2179] to do it.
[time=2180] He said, hey, you got going, you had a good start, you had a good desire.
[time=2183] But then verse 11, we also follow through.
[time=2185] So now, finish doing it as well, so that your readiness in desiring it may be matched
[time=2191] by your completing it out of what you have.
[time=2196] I love the last part of verse 11, out of what you have.
[time=2199] It reminds me of what Peter says in God's word, that we have been given everything as God's kids, everything that pertains to life and godliness.
[time=2207] What you have, even in your emptiness, is always enough when God's overflowing grace
[time=2213] that is always enough, is on the inside of you.
[time=2216] Not just for check books, but for your heart, for your energy, for your effort, for your spirit.
[time=2222] Some of you feel your spirit has been broken.
[time=2224] Some of you feel like you're terrible at following through.
[time=2226] I found, listen, I found that the best follow through principle is, and that's why I went back to the start, is stop beating yourself up about the past.
[time=2235] Forget those former things, press on toward what lies ahead, Paul says, and start.
[time=2240] The best follow through principle is getting something started.
[time=2244] Don't talk about it, let's be about it, let's take the step, let's trust God, let's know we'll fall flat on our face, and let's know that even when we do God's grace is overflowing, not just to forgive us and pick us up, but to compel us and empower us forward this year.
[time=2260] And that will be the case, no matter how many times you fail, no matter how many times you fall, my God is always there with you.
[time=2268] I want to ask you to buy your heads and close your eyes, and as you do, I want to give you this question.
[time=2272] It's the closing question, it's an application question I ask all of you to consider and ponder this week, and the question is this, what overflowing principle does God want you to start or follow through on this week?
[time=2285] It's a simple question.
[time=2286] What overflowing principle does God want you to either start and or follow through on this
[time=2292] week?
[time=2293] Because our heads are bound, our eyes are closed, believers are praying and asking God, I dare you to ask Him, He'll get you started this week in a new direction.
[time=2300] Not because 2020 just changed to 2021, but because God's grace is always enough, it's overflowing.
[time=2306] We need to trust in verse 9 that we read that He who is rich became poor so we can inherit
[time=2312] His riches.
[time=2314] He who knew no sin, became sin on our behalf so that we could become the righteousness of God.
[time=2320] And you need to trust in that.
[time=2321] To start the New Year, there's no better way on January 3rd to start this New Year than to say, Jesus, I give you me.
[time=2327] I trust in you and nothing and no one else for salvation.
[time=2331] You believe in your heart that Jesus paid that price by dying, that brutal death on the cross after living that sinless life you could never live.
[time=2339] And during the wrath of God, His hatred of sin, He took it on Himself by dying that brutal
[time=2345] death so that we could become His righteousness, so we could be children of God and He rose
[time=2352] from the dead so that you could have life and have eternal life even in this temporary life now and forever more.
[time=2359] Trusting in that is the only way to be saved and I believe some of you need to take that step and I want to give you a moment in your own words as the Holy Spirit draws you right now.
[time=2368] Believers are praying to trust Jesus as your Savior in the silence of this moment.
[time=2372] Don't wait another minute.
