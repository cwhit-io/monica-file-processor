[time=0] Today, I'm excited to share with you about grace overflowing.
[time=3] And we're looking in this series at this premise that when it comes to our stuff, when it comes to our money, when it comes to our management of all God has given us, that includes checkbooks, but includes relationships and includes our time, our talent, our treasures, everything about what God has given us.
[time=19] We know that God's still on the throne, that everything belongs to God.
[time=23] And yet he wants something for us.
[time=24] And that's what Jesus has for us that Paul is talking about in 2 Corinthians.
[time=29] We're going verse by verse through 2 Corinthians 8 and 9.
[time=32] And he's writing to the church at Corinth about an offering that they had agreed to participate in.
[time=37] But here's the heart of Jesus and the heart of Paul and our heart for you, Black Hawk.
[time=41] And it's simply this, that Jesus doesn't want something from you.
[time=44] He already has it all.
[time=46] He created the universe.
[time=48] He doesn't need us, but he wants us.
[time=50] Jesus doesn't want something from you.
[time=52] Jesus wants something for you.
[time=54] And so as we look at that, we've got our glasses.
[time=57] And I'm guessing some of you feel about like this glass.
[time=60] Maybe there's a drop or two and they're not nothing, just dry as can be.
[time=64] Maybe this, the events of this last week, this last year, have you feeling empty?
[time=68] And I believe with all of my heart, whether you look at a glass like this and you see it as half empty or half full,
[time=74] there are times where it feels like you don't have enough.
[time=77] And the Corinthian church, Paul is writing to them about how their good intentions hadn't yet translated into good intentionality.
[time=85] Is there ever a gap in between your intention and your intentionality?
[time=88] And sometimes that gap and sometimes the world leaves us, whether you see this as half empty or half full, you just feel like,
[time=95] even though you know God's the giver of all good things and he never runs out, you just feel really empty.
[time=99] You just feel like there's nothing that you can bring to the table.
[time=103] And perhaps this church felt that way, but definitely we often do feel that way where we get to, we get to answer this question.
[time=110] Here's the question of the series with the church at Corinth, but also with our lives.
[time=114] How do we display God's call?
[time=115] How do we overflow with God's grace and generosity, even and especially when it feels like there's not enough, not enough time, not enough energy, not enough money, not enough of this, not enough of that, not enough skill set, not enough ability.
[time=132] I don't know what you're not enough is, but that's where God's grace comes in.
[time=136] Write this down. This is the premise of what Paul is writing about, not just to the Corinthian church, but what God has to say to us, that it's God's grace that bridges the gap between intention and intentionality.
[time=148] This is a good sermon for us in January, just like it was last week, because sometimes we just don't follow through, well, we have really good intentions, but the intentionality to get us there is often lacking.
[time=161] And God's grace comes in the gap between intention and intentionality. That doesn't mean that if you didn't make your bed at home, while you're at church that angels swooped in and made your bed for you.
[time=171] Doesn't mean that God swoops in through His angels and deletes all the bad food that you promised yourself you wouldn't need.
[time=177] You had good intentions, but you didn't have intention.
[time=179] Now, it doesn't mean that God just fixes all of your problems according to your will with your timing, but it does mean that even when you fall flat on your face, the grace of God is sufficient where sin is abounded.
[time=190] If grace is abounded, all the more that God picks us up when we fall down, but even more than that, as if that's not enough, God's grace will empower us and overflow in us and through us compelling us forward to God's call, His purpose, and His plan for our lives, even when and during seasons where we feel consumed by everything else and feeling like we are not enough.
[time=212] So, if you ever feel not enough, then you're in the right place. Not because I'm here, but because the Word of God has a great grace-filled word for you because this follow-through principle of intentionality is a spiritual discipline.
[time=224] And a lot of research has been done about New Year's resolutions. I won't take the poll in here, but I'll tell you what I found researching, that about 74% of us made some type of resolution for 2021.
[time=236] But there was one organization that did a poll and did a survey about with the people who made a resolution, they asked them the question, "Well, what if anything would cause you to fail at your goal this year, your resolution?
[time=249] What would it be that would cause you to fail?" And it was interesting because all three things that were said at the top of the list had to do with follow-through or intentionality.
[time=257] Here's the three. It was willpower. Just have enough willpower to get there. Another one was that I'll just lose focus. I'll get distracted.
[time=266] Another one and the third one is just laziness. I'll just get lazy. Can you nod if you've ever run into one of those foes before?
[time=275] Well, this follow-through, and it's not that God's grace is going to make you hit all of your resolutions. Honestly, God might change your resolutions tomorrow.
[time=283] The grace of God overflowing usually looks more like me seeing things in a way I haven't yet seen things before because God swoops in and changes my heart to look more like his heart.
[time=292] But whatever it is that his heart is for, he will overflow and empower you in your life. That doesn't mean that bank accounts overflow.
[time=300] That doesn't mean that he swoops in and adds 10 zeros to that bank account that you've been staring at and hoping it would just change.
[time=305] It doesn't mean that your relational problems will go away. Jesus actually said the opposite. Jesus said in this world, you will have tribulation, but take heart.
[time=314] I have overcome the world and my grace will overflow and I will swoop in and help you see things my way, help you understand that there's a greater purpose and you can be empowered in a way that you can't achieve yourself.
[time=328] And so we're looking at 14 ways, grace overflows through generosity. I gave you seven last week and so I'm going to recap those quickly. You can find them in today's notes and the sermon notes, but I'm going to read them to you quickly.
[time=339] They came from 2 Corinthians 8, 1 through 11. Here they are. This is the most important one, number one, because it's emptiness. It's that we give out of emptiness, the first two verses.
[time=349] Secondly, we give with enthusiasm. We give out of obedience, not obligation, was number three. Number four, we give out of genuine growth. When we grow, we know things and our knowing leads to growing and it leads then to going and to giving and to generosity.
[time=365] We give, because of God's example, he who knew no sin became sin on our behalf so we could become the righteousness of God. 2 Corinthians 5, 21, verse 9 of 2 Corinthians 8 says that Jesus, that Jesus became poor so that we could inherit his riches.
[time=381] I just love that. I'm not preaching it again though. Look at last week's sermon. And then the last two is kind of the heart of the passage and number six was that we give with a heart to start.
[time=390] We give the heart to start. And then number seven was we give with follow through. And I believe some of you, this heart of the passage to start something or to follow through on it has bubbled over perhaps in your generosity and giving and tithing and being a part of God's church and taking your next step of baptism and saying yes to Jesus and engaging with the body of Christ and whatever way to use your gifts as God would have you to do.
[time=413] I don't know what God has started, but he's ready to complete it. And I declare that over us today. And I got to brag on you guys for a minute. I like bragging on our church. I love my church. I love you guys. I love our church family.
[time=425] So last week we started and I gave you an update on our give light offering. We set a goal of $200,000 in a time where everybody's kind of holding on to everything they've got. We just wanted to give and give big with open hands to internally invest in local and global missions.
[time=438] Everything went beyond our walls. And so we were at like 99% of that, which is just unprecedented. I shared that last week. But before I even got to lunch last week, you all had already come together and now we're several thousand dollars above $200,000.
[time=452] So we went beyond our goal. Can I get an amen? And can you give it up for Jesus? And for you, I love you guys. I love being a part of a church that's ready to start and ready to follow through.
[time=463] And that's what Paul is writing about to the church at Corinth. It took them over a year. It didn't take us that long. So I commend you for that in the offering that we took up.
[time=471] Paul is talking about this one. Let's go to verse 12 and I'll give you number eight, the first principle of today.
[time=476] And that is that we give through contentment. Write that down. We give through contentment.
[time=481] Verse number 12, meet me there. So this is at the end of verses 10 and 11. You already knew that, right? Where Paul has said, I commend you for your start. I commend you for your desire.
[time=492] Verse 11, now finish. And then he talks about that readiness. Let's go to verse 12. You ready for the word church?
[time=499] Verse 12, for if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what a person has not according to what he does not have.
[time=510] So in verse 12, there's a big contrast. What you have and what you don't. How many of you at times end up looking at what you don't have more than what you do have?
[time=518] I think we've all been guilty of that. Maybe you're doing it even right now. Paul is saying, look, this readiness to start and to finish is going to begin and end with your contentment.
[time=527] You focusing on what you do have, and I'm reminded of the words of Peter again this week toward the end of your Bibles where we have, as believers, as followers of Jesus, we have everything that pertains to life and godliness.
[time=539] And so Jesus is telling us, Paul is telling us that what you have is enough, even if it doesn't feel like it, even if you feel empty, God's grace will overflow in and through our emptiness when we just bring all that we have to him.
[time=553] It's about what you have, not what you don't have. Paul is advocating for this grace-giving kind of generosity, and I want to give you a formula that Paul is trying to teach us about.
[time=563] It's grace and generosity. A lot of times we talk about grace, a lot of times we talk about generosity. He's doing this new formula where he's putting them together where grace leads to generosity.
[time=573] You could write it this way, that grace plus generosity equals grace-giving. So it's a grace-giving formula, and it goes way beyond what you put in an offering plate or what checks your ride and how you spend your money.
[time=586] It starts there, that's a big part of it, why Jesus talks so much about our money and our things, but it goes to our heart.
[time=592] Did you know that God is not in the finance business? God's in the heart business. Did you know he owns everything?
[time=600] We created money. It wasn't his idea to begin with. He just created it all, and we've created all these systems, but he knew how much it would grip our hearts because he is in the heart business that he says, you get consumed with the 10% or the four or the five or the this or the that, percent.
[time=614] I want a hundred percent. I want all of your heart, a hundred percent of the time, and when you do that, I'll take care of the rest.
[time=622] All overflow, even when you are empty. That's the kind of generosity Paul is talking about. It's planned, it's percentage driven, it's proportionate, but it's never capped with a maximum or a minimum.
[time=633] It says, even if it doesn't fit the rationale of our human logic, I'm going to do whatever God says with obedience, even when it doesn't make sense.
[time=642] That takes contentment. That takes being satisfied, not with where you're at, but it takes being satisfied and fulfilled and at peace with who God is inside of you.
[time=653] If that's not a word for today that somebody needed to hear, I don't know what is. We need contentment and joy and satisfaction and fulfillment in who God is, especially when things around us don't seem to be going all that well.
[time=668] It's a good word for us in the middle of our nation, in the middle of all the events of this last week. It's a good word for us all year, all the time, and here's one of the things that I often see steal contentment.
[time=678] There's a lot of things that do. The enemy uses, I believe, comparison, especially in our comparison culture where we're scrolling constantly.
[time=685] We're comparing, "Oh, did this side get enough? Did that side get enough? Or look at their new boat or look at their bank account or look at how big their smiles are comparing it to ours?"
[time=693] And you can write it this way. Comparison always kills contentment. It always kills contentment.
[time=699] And so we're called not to compare with others. We're called to compare ourselves with the standard, the perfect, holy standard of God.
[time=706] Realize how far short, how empty we come, but then look at the fact that Jesus paid it all and he's medicine our sin and he, with his overflowing grace, has loved us enough to die for us.
[time=718] And then we no longer look left and right. We look up and we see a God who loves us no matter how we feel like we measure up, or if we're enough or not.
[time=727] That, my friends, is joy. And it comes from the inside. It's way bigger than external circumstances.
[time=733] And so I ask you today, do you need to do less scrolling and more serving, less groaning and more gratitude? That'll overflow in grace.
[time=741] That'll overflow in generosity. But when we don't live with joy, we really don't shine with Jesus very much.
[time=747] And one of the things I reflect at the year end, because experience is one thing, but it really doesn't change you very much unless it becomes evaluated experience.
[time=755] Good word, good leadership principle. You need to evaluate your experiences and learn from them.
[time=760] So I try to do that very intentionally every year. And as I've done that, there's one thing that has stood out that I want the enemy to do.
[time=766] I want to allow the enemy through the power of God and his overflowing grace in my life to do less of in my life this year.
[time=772] I want to share it with you. Something that I've allowed way too much of, and it's that external things.
[time=777] Whether it's something somebody says, something somebody doesn't say, something somebody does, something somebody doesn't do.
[time=782] Something that happened, or something that didn't happen, or the list goes on and on, external circumstances.
[time=787] I want this year for my joy to have nothing to do with those things and everything to do with the overflowing grace of God in my life.
[time=794] There've been too many times in my life friends where I have just allowed all of these external things to dictate and dominate and consume my experience of joy.
[time=803] Why? So many times it's because we think joy is an external thing, but with Jesus, joy is an internal thing that overflows even through our emptiness because it doesn't depend on them.
[time=815] It doesn't depend on that. It doesn't depend on anything other than the blood of Jesus Christ and the fact that He loves me so much.
[time=825] With that you can have joy even when the nation that we live in is falling apart, and right now I know many people are waiting.
[time=832] Is He going to say things that lean right or lean left? Stop it! Focus on Jesus. That's my call to us.
[time=838] As we're content and filled with joy, we will focus more on the word of God and the work of God that He's doing through His church than we will on nitpicking, criticizing, comparing and tearing others down.
[time=850] May the world look to us as an overflowing, grace-filled, joy-dominated church where people can see the love of Jesus in a world that has got such a dark backdrop.
[time=862] May we live it out. That's just point one. Contentment. Contentment we give with contentment, and this year I pray that we can go on that journey together.
[time=872] But it takes you going from, I'm going to talk about contentment some more because we need a lot of contentment today. Can I get a name in?
[time=878] I've used this illustration before where a lot of times when it comes to surrender, we want to kind of take a gift card approach.
[time=885] It's a controlled surrender. When you get a gift card, you're giving, but it's, you know, you're controlling where it goes, right?
[time=891] That's a good thing in certain contexts. This year, you know what God wants from you. He wants you to go from gift cards to blank checks.
[time=900] God doesn't want controlled surrender. He wants complete surrender.
[time=907] And for us this year, if you want to be content-ed, you want to have joy, you want to have overflowing grace, God is ready for you to sign the blank check.
[time=916] Even moving here to Indiana from Georgia from my family was a signing of a blank check. Didn't know what in the world God was doing, why he would call us to, especially in times like January.
[time=925] It's really cold here, to a place like Indiana. We didn't know what he was doing, but it took us, and it was only by his grace.
[time=932] I say that not as any picture of me, but as a total picture of overflowing grace, we had to say, the answer is yes, Lord.
[time=939] Now what's the question? A lot of times we'll say, God, give me the question. I'll take two weeks, research, ponder, pray a little bit too, and then I'll get back to you with my answer.
[time=949] Am I right about it? But God says, sign the blank check. Give me your yes, and you'll find contentment. You'll find peace. You'll find joy, and it'll overflow in grace.
[time=960] So I pray this week, as you remember today, you'll remember this right here, a blank check. Even when you feel empty, you'll remember. All I got to do is just sign my blank check.
[time=969] God's going to overflow with his grace.
[time=973] Principle number nine is that we give by faith in God's supply that comes from verses 13 through 15, is that he knew Paul knew the Corinthian church would be saying things like, well, how do I know that we're not just patting the pockets of these other people who say they have needs?
[time=986] You ever felt that way before God prompts you to give? And it's like, well, I don't know if I trust what they're going to do with it. And so Paul knew that things like that was going to come about, but again, he wants a blank check.
[time=995] And so verses 13 through 15, we see that we give with faith and trust in God's supply. Verse 13 says this, "For I do not mean that others should be ease and you burden." Don't go into debt to do this.
[time=1007] He's saying, I've given you what you need, as we'll see further. But that as a matter of fairness, your abundance at the present time should supply their needs so that their abundance may supply your need, that there may be fairness two times.
[time=1020] Then he quotes Exodus 16 and verse 15, he says, "As it is written, whoever gathered much had nothing left over and whoever gathered little had no lack." I'll unpack that in a moment, but let's start with these first couple of verses there, 13 and 14,
[time=1035] where we're called to give willingly. Paul is saying it's an Acts 4 kind of thing, where they had everything in common, 100%.
[time=1042] And because of that, they gave freely, and there were no needs among them. Paul is saying, look, while you have an abundance, you give, and you give big.
[time=1050] And sometimes the table's going to turn, and you're going to have the lack, and others who have an abundance will give, and will share it all together.
[time=1057] He's telling us that, listen, some of you need to hear this when it comes to generosity, that God is the one who balances the books.
[time=1063] God is the one who brings about the fairness. That word fairness means like it means equitable, means the same, it means sameness.
[time=1071] It kind of reminds me of my little kids, and how many of you are still little kids, even though you're now not a little kid anymore, all four of us.
[time=1079] We all know that there's a higher percentage of that, but we say things like this, don't we? We'll say, that's not fair.
[time=1085] And that's kind of what Paul is addressing here, and God is saying, listen, when you trust me with a blank check mentality, you'll have the bold faith.
[time=1094] A lot of times we think it starts with bold faith. No, it starts with contentment. It starts on the inside.
[time=1099] It bubbles out to the outside, and this contentment, and overflowing grace and joy in my life leads me to big, courageous, bold faith.
[time=1108] And God's supply, that He promises that every good and perfect gift comes from God, and that He will supply all of our needs according to His righteousness, Philippians chapter 4 and verse 19.
[time=1117] And grace overflows in us and through us when we signed the blank check, trust Him, give away what He's given us, give us our daily bread, Matthew chapter 6 verse 11.
[time=1127] Give us today our daily bread. You know the problem with that today?
[time=1131] Our daily bread that God gives us in our consumerism, driven culture, in our comparison culture, what God gives us, it never quite feels like it's enough. Can I give a name, man?
[time=1142] So it's hard to overflow when we look at it that way. That's why it's got to start on the inside with joy, and then it bubbles up into faith on the outside, trusting in God's supply.
[time=1151] And He's saying, don't worry about how much it blesses them or that or how they're going to use it, trust me, don't trust what others are going to do, trust me. You give where I tell you to give, you live how I tell you to live in obedience, and I will take care of the rest.
[time=1166] I'm glad I can put my faith in something that's going to last, something that is true in a world that's filled with all kinds of the opposite.
[time=1172] So we give with faith in God's supply. Verse 15 talks about Exodus 16 and verse 18. Exodus 16 and verse 18 is what Paul is quoting there in verse 15, and he's talking about the Old Testament miracle of the manna.
[time=1187] God provided this bread, light, this food, substance. There's all kinds of debate. What is it even like? He fed his children while they wondered in the wilderness.
[time=1196] And so he's quoting that and talking about two things that would happen that whoever gathered for the day, whatever they gathered for the day, it was always enough.
[time=1204] God's grace is always enough. This is what we see in verse 18 of Exodus 16, but here's the biggest part, and this is where it hits us right between the eyes so many times.
[time=1214] But did you know as well, if you read Exodus 16, you'll find that a lot of people tried to hoard the manna. They said, well, what if God doesn't show up tomorrow?
[time=1224] I'm going to put some in my back pocket, and this is not condemning saving. There's things in the Bible about that, but this is way bigger than a finance issue, it's a trust issue of the heart.
[time=1233] And so they would hoard things and put them aside because they were told, just get what you need for you and your family today, and they would take it and they would put it aside.
[time=1241] And you know what happened? They would be smelly, nasty worms and rotting stuff in whatever pocket or pantry that they put it in, because God wanted them to trust them for their daily bread.
[time=1252] And so that reminds us, we're called not to hoard, but to be obedient. Even if it doesn't seem logical, we're called to trust our God because he and his supply is always enough.
[time=1263] Grace giving this formula is planned, but it's not legalistic in that it says, well, I'm never giving more than this or less than that, or I'm never going to act this way more than that.
[time=1273] Don't ever say never. I always said, I'd never be a pastor, like my dad who's in the building right now, not because he's a bad pastor, but I saw what he had to put up with.
[time=1280] And I said, nope, not that. No blank checks for me. So be careful with your nevers. Don't put a cap or a minimum on what God might want to do through you, not just with your check, but with your heart.
[time=1292] Malachi, at the end of your Old Testament, is the only time in Scripture where God says, test me in this, talking about giving to and through the church, the storehouse.
[time=1300] He says, test me in this and see if I won't open the windows in heaven and overflow blessings.
[time=1306] The problem is we think blessings means extra zeros a lot of times. That's not necessarily what he means.
[time=1311] It's this overflowing grace and joy and contentment, and the list goes on. Paul then shifts us from this contentment and this faith to a list of five closing things that he says, this is how we're going to manage this offering with integrity.
[time=1325] And that's why it's so important for us to operate with integrity. And Paul lists three people, and I'll show you a verse at a time, who they are, as much as he tells us here.
[time=1333] And principles about managing, stewarding, administrating God's gift and God's resources with integrity and with honesty.
[time=1341] And that starts with number 10, and that is that we give within the other's first mentality.
[time=1346] And we see person number one coming in, and it's Titus. Again, we already looked at Titus last week, but he came within the other's first mentality.
[time=1353] Let's look at verses 16 and 17. Paul says, "But thanks be to God who put into the heart of Titus the same earnest care I have for you."
[time=1362] But he not only accepted our appeal, but being himself very earnest, he is going to you of his own accord.
[time=1372] And what we see here is that godly generosity living out this servant leadership mindset, like Paul and like Titus were doing, it's never coming through a what's in it for me mentality.
[time=1384] But our world lives out this what's in it for me. He's saying, "Hey, look, we did ask Titus to come. He's the first person he's sending to make sure all this is handled with integrity.
[time=1392] We'll see that more in just a moment." But he's saying, "I asked Titus to come, but he's not coming just because I asked him.
[time=1397] He's coming because he loves you so much. He's coming because he's putting himself last and putting you first.
[time=1403] He's coming with an other's first servant leadership mentality.
[time=1407] And if you want to live that out the way Titus did and the way that Jesus did and the way so many heroes of our faith have done, listen, servant leadership is not about service through the lips.
[time=1417] It's about service through your life. It's not just talking the talk. It's walking the walk and Titus is doing just that.
[time=1424] He's saying, "I'm coming of my own accord. I'll come and serve you guys because I put others before myself."
[time=1431] And so that's a great question for us in a world that's doing all the math and hating this side or that side and throwing darts and throwing stones and being so consumed with a side.
[time=1442] Maybe we choose Jesus who came not to be served, but to serve.
[time=1447] And so the question I'd like to ask you is how can you be like Titus, like Jesus?
[time=1452] How can you this week display in others' first mentality?
[time=1456] How can you this week serve somebody else? Because listen, if you feel distracted and you feel like your joy is gone and you feel empty today, there's not going to be much better way to fill your cup to see the grace of God overflow than to put yourself last.
[time=1469] I know it's illogical, but try it. I dare you this week.
[time=1472] Then to put yourself last and to put somebody else first and to love them with the love of Jesus and even better yet you want to take it up a notch, go do that display of love and grace with someone who doesn't deserve your grace or your love or your gift.
[time=1488] How can we do that this week in others' first mentality like Titus?
[time=1492] Number 11 is we give with a passion for the lost. Here's the second person. It's a nameless person who is passionate about the gospel.
[time=1499] In verse 18, we see the record of him.
[time=1502] Verse 18 with him, we are sending the brother who is famous among all the churches for his preaching of the gospel.
[time=1510] We don't even know his name. And I listen to church. I hope one day you forget Kevin Rivers.
[time=1515] You forget his name, but maybe one day people will say, you remember that guy, he used to be at Black Hawk.
[time=1520] I don't remember his name, but man, people just knew him because he preached the gospel.
[time=1525] People knew him because he was all about the good news of Jesus.
[time=1528] I want that to be said of me, and God wants that to be said of all of us, that we would have a passion for the lost.
[time=1535] And that's why as we see this, preaching of the gospel is the good news of Jesus, and I'm reminded of Jesus.
[time=1540] Why did Jesus come? He said, "I didn't come because of the healthy. It's not the healthy that need a doctor.
[time=1545] It's the sick. I didn't come to be served, but to serve. I came to seek and to save that which was lost."
[time=1551] And it's for that reason that we at Black Hawk and I as a preacher will never apologize for prioritizing the people that Jesus prioritized.
[time=1559] I'll never apologize for prioritizing, reaching the lost.
[time=1563] And the beauty is as we gather, you say, well, why do we gather?
[time=1566] We gather so that we could be filled with the grace of God.
[time=1569] We dig into the Word together. We're encouraged by the gathering together, the assembling of believers for a purpose, though.
[time=1575] Not to sit and soak, but to go and take the grace of God and overflow with it in our lives that is lost and dying in the need of a Savior.
[time=1583] So we give, and we live, and we are the church in a way that prioritizes what Jesus prioritized, and that is to have a passion for the lost.
[time=1593] And maybe you're here and you would say, I just don't know that I have the kind of peace you're talking about.
[time=1599] Jesus prioritizes you. I do too. Black Hawk does too. This body of believers, we prioritize you because Jesus loves you so much.
[time=1610] Number 12, we give to glorify God and not us. Verse 19 talks of this person, this nameless person who had a passion for the gospel and says this of him about where he's trying to give glory.
[time=1622] And not only that, but he has been appointed by the churches to travel with us as we carry out this act of grace.
[time=1629] That's that word again, how he's describing this offering that is being ministered by us. Why? For the glory of the Lord himself and to show our good will.
[time=1640] So about this person, we realize a true principle of ourselves that we cannot glorify yourself if you're trying and glorify your Savior at the same time.
[time=1651] How many of you have ever been a glory hog? It's kind of like, well, you know, I mean, I'm doing it for the right reasons, but, you know, in the back of your mind,
[time=1658] you know, I'm really kind of hoping maybe that other person sees that I'm doing it and, you know, maybe you post it and posting is not bad, but maybe you do it kind of with the wrong motive because it's like, well, I hope they see it.
[time=1668] You know, they need to act more like me or you hope maybe you didn't get the affirmation that you were looking for this last week and you just hope you can get the clicks and the likes and the hearts and all of those things.
[time=1678] You hope you can find that affirmation. And so I want to challenge you this week. Don't be a glory hog. Give all the glory to God.
[time=1684] And as we do that, as we sign our blank check, God, as we are humbled before Him, will exalt us in due time.
[time=1691] He alone deserves the glory. And listen, in a world that's telling you there's all kinds of kings and all kinds of things that we seem to be putting so much of our energy and effort in,
[time=1700] we need to be remembered that God will always be the only one worthy of all glory, all honor.
[time=1707] He is the name above every name and at the name of Jesus, every knee is going to bow and every tongue is going to confess that He is Lord to the glory of God, the Father.
[time=1717] We give and we live to glorify God and not us. So I'm thankful for this individual who did that as well.
[time=1723] Number 13 is that we give with honesty and integrity, honesty and integrity.
[time=1728] Verse 20 through 22, we see the third person, but we see some of the premise for all of this honesty and integrity that He tried to display.
[time=1736] Verse 20, we take this course so that no one should blame us about this generous gift that is being administered by us.
[time=1743] For we aim at what is honorable, not only in the Lord's sight, but also in the sight of man.
[time=1749] That's why we do things above reproach, what Paul is saying here. We're taking every precaution.
[time=1753] Verse 22, and with them we are sending our brother, here's person number three, a nameless person again, whom we have often tested and found earnest in many matters,
[time=1764] but who is now more earnest than ever because of his great confidence in you.
[time=1769] Stop there for a moment. We give with honesty and integrity and Paul is proactively looking at how they may want to poke holes.
[time=1776] Like, well, do we really know what you're doing with the money? Do we really know that you're handling it? Well, it's kind of an honest good question in any situation in Paul's day and current day.
[time=1784] And so he is proactively looking at a couple of things that I'll take from it, the integrity of the church.
[time=1790] And so that's why it's so important for us as a church to always operate with honesty and integrity.
[time=1795] And it's why we do things like, as an example, with money, I never have access to nor look at or have anything to do with our money stuff around here.
[time=1803] We have a team of deacons and elders and staff and leaders who are never alone with money.
[time=1807] It's not because we don't trust those people, it's because we want to do things that are above reproach.
[time=1812] Integrity in God's church screams so loudly in a world that is often so contaminated by sinfulness.
[time=1820] It's not because we don't trust those people, we never put them in a room alone.
[time=1824] I would trust my kids with those people individually, but we do that so that we protect the above reproach, honesty and integrity of God's church.
[time=1833] Not just in money, but in all kinds of areas as a church.
[time=1836] We have a great leadership team that works hard at that here.
[time=1839] To that, everybody says, amen, but now I want to make it personal.
[time=1843] You're a part of the church too.
[time=1845] And in the same way, God has called you to display honesty and integrity.
[time=1848] So I ask you, will you search your heart right now and maybe God is revealing to you some area where you're not above reproach.
[time=1855] Where you're going just a little bit too far.
[time=1857] Some area where you weren't quite totally honest.
[time=1860] Some area where you didn't display the integrity that God would have you to display and lay it at the foot of the cross and watch his grace not only cover your sin,
[time=1868] but overflow in you and through you as you confess, as you make it right, as you do whatever you got to do to correct whatever wrongs you've done.
[time=1875] Watch God's grace overflow in you and through you and watch it open doors of opportunity for you to look more and more like Jesus and shine more and more brightly for his name this year.
[time=1885] So may we, as Paul is talking about, live with honesty and with integrity.
[time=1890] And it takes, get this, intention and intentionality.
[time=1893] You know what's at the heart of that gap many times, certainly it's the grace of God that drives it, but it's integrity.
[time=1899] If you want to go from intention to intentionality, the difference will often be integrity.
[time=1904] May we be believers who do what we say we're going to do.
[time=1908] Let our yes be yes and let our no be no and let us be clear and let us stand on truth.
[time=1913] May we honor God with everything we've got.
[time=1916] It's kind of like when I asked my father-in-law for Jessica's hand in marriage.
[time=1920] You know, he knew that I was going to give this vow that all of my days I will honor and cherish her as long as we shall live, right?
[time=1927] So many of you have gotten married.
[time=1928] I've done some weddings of many in here and we said things like that.
[time=1931] But when I went in and asked, first of all, I was like this, so I had my hands like this.
[time=1934] He's a pretty intimidating dude.
[time=1935] Mr. Kinney asked, I love you.
[time=1936] But you scared me to death that day.
[time=1938] I'm glad you said yes.
[time=1939] But Jessica and I will be married for 15 years in just a couple of months.
[time=1943] And I thank God for Mr. Kinney, but I'll never forget asking him.
[time=1946] But here was the assumed thing.
[time=1948] He wasn't thinking like, well, when he asked that, I wonder what part of his life he'll honor and cherish, Jessica.
[time=1954] Well, you know, I mean, as long as he takes care of her, maybe feeds her a meal here or there.
[time=1959] And, you know, I mean, cares about her just a little off and on, you know, about 60% of the time.
[time=1965] That'll be all right.
[time=1967] No, if I were to ask him that, first of all he said no, second of all he would have said no, 100% of her.
[time=1972] You give all of your heart, all of your life to loving and cherishing my baby girl.
[time=1978] And I'm trying my best to do that, Mr. Kinney.
[time=1980] But the same is true and exponentially more so for all of God's resources.
[time=1985] And all of God's grace may we with 100% of us, with all of our heart, 100% of the time,
[time=1991] give and live with honesty and integrity, honoring all that God has entrusted to us.
[time=1997] Last but not least, number 14, you guys have done great.
[time=2000] 14-point sermon in two weeks.
[time=2002] We've made it through.
[time=2003] Number 14 is we give as a family.
[time=2005] This is verses 23 and 24.
[time=2008] We give as a family.
[time=2009] Let's read those verses together.
[time=2011] 23, as for Titus, he's my partner.
[time=2014] I love these words.
[time=2015] And fellow worker, for your benefit, as for our brothers, they are messengers.
[time=2020] This is the Greek word apostolos where we get the word apostles.
[time=2023] We'll look at it in a minute.
[time=2025] Of the churches, the glory of Christ.
[time=2027] So give proof before the churches of your love and our boasting about you to these men.
[time=2033] The word messengers is often translated apostles.
[time=2036] And here's what it means.
[time=2037] It's one who is sent with a special commission.
[time=2040] And as a part of God's body, the body of Christ, the church, look at me for a minute.
[time=2045] You are sent with a special commission.
[time=2049] We are a part of this family, this team, this called to overflow with the grace of God.
[time=2056] And his grace, even when you're not enough, his grace is always enough.
[time=2062] I go back to this question.
[time=2064] Maybe it's a question of controlled surrender versus complete surrender.
[time=2069] Maybe it's time to sign that blank check.
[time=2072] And when you do, I know it's scary, but you can trust in a God who has always enough.
[time=2077] And I lead you to the same question I asked you last week because we need to ask it two weeks and probably 52 weeks this year.
[time=2083] And the question is what overflowing principle does God want you to start or follow through on this week?
[time=2089] And my God who starts something in you, he'll complete it.
[time=2092] And I'm grateful for my God who meets me where I'm at with overflowing grace.
[time=2096] And he's ready to walk with you this week.
[time=2099] We better head close your eyes and ponder that question.
[time=2102] What do you need to start?
[time=2103] What do you need to follow through on this week?
[time=2105] And whether you're watching on a screen, you're in the room, as a believer, I believe God's ready to do something new in you.
[time=2111] He's ready to finish something in you.
[time=2113] He's ready to help you display honesty and integrity.
[time=2116] He's ready to help you have an others first mentality.
[time=2118] He's ready to help you overflow with contentment in an area where you have been maybe doing the opposite.
[time=2123] Will you trust in him? Will you identify that right now?
[time=2126] And maybe you're here and you would say I need to trust in Jesus.
[time=2129] My blank check to be signed is saying that I trust in Jesus for salvation and not in myself or my good works or my money or my this or my that or my grandparents or my parents or anything but Jesus.
[time=2140] I want to trust Jesus and Jesus alone for salvation.
[time=2143] You feel the Spirit pulling and tugging on you right now in that regard.
[time=2147] Then the gospel is clear to you.
[time=2149] It's that Jesus paid that price.
[time=2151] Jesus paid it all.
[time=2152] It's His grace that is while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[time=2156] He paid the price for our sin that we could never pay.
[time=2160] He rose from the dead to defeat that separation that comes from your sin.
[time=2165] Hell, the grave.
[time=2166] He won the victory over it all as he rose from the dead.
[time=2170] He is alive in salvation.
[time=2172] The gospel is asking him for forgiveness, trusting in him alone with complete surrender for salvation.
[time=2179] It just starts with a decision but it overflows in everything that you are.
[time=2183] It starts right inside your heart.
[time=2185] God wants your heart.
[time=2186] He doesn't want your words.
[time=2187] That's why I'm not going to lead you in a prayer.
[time=2189] Your heart's screaming.
[time=2190] God doesn't want a perfect prayer.
[time=2191] He wants a surrendered heart.
[time=2192] Will you trust him for salvation?
[time=2194] He will save you right now in the silence of this moment.
[time=2196] Believers praying.
[time=2197] If you need to trust Jesus.
