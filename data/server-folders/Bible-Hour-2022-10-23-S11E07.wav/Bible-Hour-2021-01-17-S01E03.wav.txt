[time=0] I you and your Bibles to 2 Corinthians chapter 9 today.
[time=4] If you missed the last two weeks, you can go to blackhawk.fyi find all of our sermons where we talked about overflowing principles.
[time=12] And now it leads us to when we proactively participate in and practice these principles, the promises of God through his grace overflow in chapter nine of 2 Corinthians overflowing promises today.
[time=26] And what we've been learning is that when it comes to our stuff, we typically start the year here of talking about how we manage, how we steward, how we take care of, how we administer, how we take that which is God's which is how much, by the way, if you've been here, it's everything.
[time=41] That which is God's that he entrusts to us and manage it well, including our time, our talent, our treasures, Jesus said where your treasure is, there your heart will be, his heart is for his church to manage and steward so well.
[time=53] So we've looked at these principles and what we've been learning is that Jesus because he owns everything, he doesn't need your money.
[time=59] Did you know that?
[time=60] Our God is loaded.
[time=62] Jesus doesn't want something from us.
[time=65] He wants something for us.
[time=66] And so as we talk about this today, remember the mindset of our God in that regard and what we've learned about enough in the series so far, empty you may feel, is that write this down, three words.
[time=77] Enough is elusive.
[time=79] Enough, the concept of enough is elusive, meaning it's something that we often try to strain for and go after them, but it eludes us.
[time=87] It always slips away because in today's world, if you look through earthly standards, there is never enough.
[time=93] Can I get an amen?
[time=94] You felt that, you're feeling that right now, but God's grace is always enough and he starts with our emptiness way better than when we come to the table starting with what we think we bring to the table.
[time=107] So if you've come today empty, God's ready to fill you up with his grace overflowing.
[time=112] And we're looking at this formula that Paul is tying together with the church at Corinth because they promise at this point to be a part of an offering that is being taken out for the poor and for the believers there in Jerusalem and they haven't followed through.
[time=125] You ever done that before?
[time=126] I promise, I really am gonna change that this year, but you don't quite follow through.
[time=130] And Paul is writing to them and he sent Titus and a couple of other people to go and help them follow through.
[time=135] And he's giving them this new formula of tying grace and generosity together.
[time=140] And we've called it for the last few weeks here.
[time=143] This concept, this principle of grace giving, it's a different kind of eternally minded giving and generosity that God has in mind for us that stems into every area of our life.
[time=154] And so in second Corinthians chapter nine, we're gonna look at overflowing promises.
[time=158] But the first five verses kind of gives you a good recap.
[time=161] So if you're new with us today, we're so glad you're here.
[time=164] Glad to have you on the screens in the building.
[time=166] Wherever you may be, we are scattered, but we are gathering today under one name and his name is Jesus.
[time=171] And his word to us through Paul in second Corinthians nine, these first five verses will give us these two implications of our generosity, just like it is their generosity.
[time=181] Really, he's answering and reminding them, today, by the way, we're taking communion.
[time=185] Another reminder, we do that.
[time=186] Jesus said, do this in remembrance of me.
[time=189] And so we'll be doing that at the end of the service today.
[time=192] And today, I wanna remind you of several things, of the promises of God, but also of what Paul is about to tell us as he talks to the church at Corinth, about the implications of our own generosity.
[time=203] What I mean by that is, what is at stake with your generosity?
[time=208] What hangs in the balance that God's wanting to do through you, but maybe you've been doing this.
[time=213] In fact, let's do that, just at least with one hand.
[time=215] I know you got your notes out and all, but if you can't do this, what would happen?
[time=219] What's at stake that God is waiting for you to just simply do that, do that with me?
[time=225] There's power in that.
[time=226] His grace is ready to overflow and he's ready to speak to you.
[time=230] Are you ready to receive it today?
[time=231] Are you ready for the word, Black Hawk?
[time=233] Second Corinthians chapter nine, let's read the first five verses, then I'll give you through these two implications, two things that are at stake with our generosity.
[time=240] Verse one, Paul says, "Now it is superfluous for me "to write to you about the ministry of the saints." This is that offering that we've been talking about.
[time=248] "For I know your readiness, of which I boast about you "to the people of Macedonia saying "that a chaos has been ready since last year." So a whole year has gone by on this resolution they said.
[time=260] "And your zeal has stirred up most of them.
[time=263] "But I am sending the brothers," this is Titus and two others we looked at last week, "so that our boasting about you "may not prove empty in this matter, "so that you may be ready, as I said, you would be." Verse four, "Otherwise, if some Macedonians come with me "and find that you are not ready, "we would be humiliated to say nothing of you "for being so confident." So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and to arrange in advance for the gift you have promised, so that it may be ready as a willing gift, not as an exaction, exaction meaning something that, a transaction in which you give and expect something back, but instead he wants this cheerful willing giving.
[time=306] And so this is about that offering that we've been talking about.
[time=309] And so the two things, let's start with number one, coming from the first two verses, write down inspiration.
[time=314] That's at stake with their generosity here.
[time=316] They want to inspire others.
[time=318] And it's interesting because as we look at their readiness, Paul talks about the churches at Macedonia.
[time=323] And if you remember in chapter eight, and if you weren't with us in chapter eight, Paul used the churches in Macedonia to be an inspiration, to be an example of generosity to the churches at Corinth, which is the people he's writing to as we read this letter.
[time=337] So he used the Macedonians as an example for the Corinthians, but now he's saying, "You're inspiring them too.
[time=343] "I've been boasting about and bragging about you "to the churches at Macedonia, "just like we've been doing it." You see the cycle here, the recurring grace, this inspiration, he says, "They're stirred up by you." And so I've got a really personal question I want to ask you today.
[time=358] We're going to get personal today.
[time=359] And I want to ask you this question.
[time=361] In your life, what are you inspiring?
[time=369] Your generosity, your heart to be a picture of Jesus.
[time=374] What hangs in the ballast is what you inspire.
[time=378] And so as a part of God's church, what are you stirring up?
[time=381] Are you stirring up dissension, division, negativity, critical spirits?
[time=385] Are you stirring up love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control, unity in your home, in your workplace?
[time=395] What are you inspiring?
[time=396] What are you stirring up?
[time=398] And even if you're very discouraged by the answer that you just gave to that question, I've got good news for you.
[time=404] God's grace, God's grace is still overflowing.
[time=407] And that leads to the second thing, in verses three through five, it's intentionality.
[time=411] That's also what's in the balance here.
[time=413] Inspiration, what you're stirring up and what you're inspiring, but also your intentionality.
[time=417] You see these Corinthians had promised to do something but they didn't follow through.
[time=420] Did you know follow through as a spiritual discipline?
[time=423] There's often a gap between our intention and our intentionality.
[time=426] We have good intentions.
[time=427] Well, I meant to do that.
[time=428] It's the thought that counts, we think, right?
[time=430] I meant to do that, but then the intentionality to actually follow through and do it kind of hangs in the balance.
[time=435] But Paul is now saying at the end here, you are stirring them up, you're inspiring them, but also follow through.
[time=440] And he says follow through, and verse one, actually, let me back up.
[time=443] He says, it's superfluous for me to say these things to you.
[time=446] What he's really saying, and you've done it before, if you've had kids, raise your hand if you've had kids or grandkids or raise kids.
[time=451] If you've ever been a kid, raise your hand, you'll get this.
[time=454] He's saying, you know, I really shouldn't even have to remind you of this, but I'm gonna.
[time=461] You know, kids, I really shouldn't have to tell you to clean your room, but it's a mess.
[time=467] I'm gonna tell you anyway.
[time=468] And so he reminds them of the promises of God and their own promises to follow through, because there's often a gap between what we intend, our intention and our intentionality to follow through.
[time=478] But it's God's grace, get this, that bridges the gap between intention and intentionality.
[time=483] That doesn't mean that God's grace swoops in and he sends angels and he fixes all of your problems because how many of you got any problems?
[time=489] All right, good, if you didn't raise your hand, there's one coming, probably today, just look out.
[time=493] God doesn't solve all your problems, but this statement means that his grace is sufficient for you, even in weakness, even when you fall short, even when you sin, even when you fall flat on your face, God's grace is a forgiving grace, but secondly, it's also an empowering grace that helps push you and compel you from good intentions to good intentionality.
[time=513] And that inspiration, what you stir up and the intentionality of following through is what hangs in the balance when it comes to this lifestyle that Paul is describing.
[time=522] So let's look at some of the promises that come about as we are proactive, because really my friends, that is what God has called us to do to be proactive with the promises of God.
[time=531] God didn't just give us promises so we could get fat and happy and sit and soak in them.
[time=536] God gave us his promises so that we could overflow his grace to a world that desperately needs it.
[time=541] And when I look at our nation, and when I look at our world right now, we need the church to be the church.
[time=548] Our inspiration, our intentionality, it's all gonna come from and flow through the promises of God.
[time=555] So I wanna give you 17 promises from God's overflowing grace.
[time=559] Don't worry, it's a two-part series.
[time=560] I'm gonna give you 10 today, so buckle up, but then we'll do seven next week, all from chapter nine, just go on a verse at a time through chapter nine.
[time=567] These first set will be internal promises, write that down.
[time=572] A lot of times when we hear promises, we think, oh good, God's gonna fill up my bank account, change all my relationship problems and fix all my mess.
[time=578] No, it means that he's gonna do something in you so that through you externally, he'll do something in the midst of and in spite of and maybe even through your mess.
[time=588] So this week I'll give you internal promises, there are 10 of them.
[time=590] And next week I'll give you eternal promises that Paul outlines here in this passage.
[time=595] And as we go through today, as we go into Martin Luther King Jr. weekend, we celebrate people whose lives have inspired us so many ways, he says it well, and this has been my prayer for you this week, this quote that he once said, "I pray over you when it comes to hope." Some of you feel hopeless today, and these promises are gonna help you clean to the right hope.
[time=612] He said this, "We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope." And I pray that over you.
[time=621] I know you've suffered some finite disappointment.
[time=623] Our nation has, you have, you feel broken, you feel empty, but God has an infinite hope that he wants us to clean two together.
[time=630] What better way to do it than look at his promises.
[time=632] Let me give you number one and it is blessing.
[time=634] Comes from verse six, write that down, blessing.
[time=637] And to help us kick into this, let me read to you.
[time=640] Second Corinthians, let's just read verses six through 11, and you'll see in verse six, principle number one, promise number one, which is God's blessing.
[time=648] Verse six, "The point is this, whoever sows sparingly, will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.
[time=655] Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.
[time=663] And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work.
[time=673] As it is written, and he quotes from the Psalms, he has distributed freely, he has given to the poor, his righteousness endures forever, he who supply seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness." Verse 11, "You will be enriched in every way to be generous in every way, which through us will produce thanksgiving to God." And may God just multiply those seeds and may it reap bountifully at harvest in our life.
[time=704] And blessing is where these promises start in verse six.
[time=708] Blessing, and a lot of times when we hear blessing, we think, oh good, this is where I get all my problems solved.
[time=713] But again, this starts internal, it invests in the eternal, so that the external gets affected.
[time=719] The implications and applications overflow into external things, but it starts internally when we're focused eternally.
[time=727] And blessing is just the same.
[time=729] Verse six, the word bountifully, he says, "If you sow sparingly, you're gonna reap sparingly." And a lot of times we misuse this verse, and think that, oh, if I give God $10, I'm gonna get $20 back next week.
[time=739] Sometimes he does that, but most of the time he doesn't.
[time=742] Most of the time he blesses internally and eternally in ways that you might not even recognize.
[time=747] So he says, "If you sow bountifully, you're going to reap bountifully." It's interesting, the Greek, the original language for the word bountifully is actually translated to blessing.
[time=758] So that's where we get this idea as a promise of God, blessing.
[time=761] And so as we look at that, we gotta define and know what blessing truly is.
[time=766] And what I would say to you is that number one, principles from this verse that we learn about God's blessing is that, listen, I believe this with all my heart.
[time=774] I didn't used to think it true 'cause I thought about blessings and had the wrong perspective on blessings, is that you cannot out give God.
[time=784] How many of you found that to be true?
[time=785] Some of you are still wrestling with that.
[time=787] I've wrestled with that in the past, but God owns everything.
[time=790] He doesn't need anything from us.
[time=792] He doesn't want your money, he wants your heart.
[time=794] And with that, he said, "Where your treasure is, your heart will be." And that means we're gonna have our treasure follow our heart.
[time=799] Our treasure is gonna follow where God changes and moves on our heart when we just give him 100% of us, 100% of the time.
[time=805] God's not in the fundraising business.
[time=808] He's in the heart change, business.
[time=810] And the blessing flows from when we allow him to change us inside out where his grace overflows.
[time=815] Because giving and sowing for the believer, for the follower of Jesus, giving and sowing is not something that we do.
[time=823] It is who we are.
[time=826] We love because God first loved us.
[time=828] We give because God loved us so much that he sent his son, that he gave to us first.
[time=834] And the same Paul who wrote to the Corinthians, wrote in Ephesians chapter one and verse three, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in heavenly places." Notice that it is eternal in its mindset.
[time=850] It's every spiritual blessing in heavenly places.
[time=854] And that's what we're called to do.
[time=855] We're called to invest and be generous, to invest not in the earthly and things that we look for in ROI, or return to our investment here.
[time=862] But eternally, where thieves can't break in and steal and moth and rust cannot destroy.
[time=867] We put our investments in the eternal.
[time=870] And we have spiritual blessings in heavenly places.
[time=874] And they are way better than any blessing you're thinking of in your mind when you first heard the word blessing.
[time=879] That's when materialism goes away.
[time=881] That's when what you have doesn't have you.
[time=884] It's when you invest it eternally.
[time=886] And blessing is now further spelled out by the rest of these promises.
[time=891] So number one is blessing.
[time=892] It's the foundation of the rest.
[time=894] Number two is joy.
[time=895] Joy, write that down.
[time=896] It comes from verse seven.
[time=897] Love verse seven.
[time=898] Each one must give as he's decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion.
[time=903] And that's why I've told us in this series boldly, if you're giving because you feel guilted into it by your pastor or by your church or by this person or that person, stop.
[time=911] You're not doing it with the right heart.
[time=913] And God wants you to pause.
[time=914] And God wants you to connect with him and give out of a heart to serve God.
[time=919] We don't give to black talk here.
[time=921] We give through black talk.
[time=922] We give to God through black talk as a part of his church as the body of Christ.
[time=927] And we do it with joy.
[time=928] He says, when you have that heart, you're going to be a cheerful giver.
[time=932] Now, Helios is the Greek word for cheerful.
[time=936] And it's what's interesting about it.
[time=938] It means joyous.
[time=940] So that's where we get this concept of joy.
[time=942] But it's the word from which we get our English word, hilarious.
[time=947] So that's how you should give as you leave.
[time=950] You should bust out laughing.
[time=951] You've been doing it wrong, who knew?
[time=953] All this time.
[time=954] It's that kind of overflowing joy that God has called us to give with and to live with as his followers.
[time=960] He doesn't want a compulsive surrender.
[time=963] He wants a blank check.
[time=964] How many of you were here last week?
[time=965] I had the biggest blank check I've ever had in my life on stage with me.
[time=969] That's the mindset that we give through.
[time=970] Not this compelled compulsive surrender, but a complete surrender.
[time=974] We don't give through a gift card mentality where we control the surrender.
[time=978] We give of the blank check mentality that says the answer is yes Lord, now what is the question?
[time=983] In first Peter chapter one, verse eight, Peter writes, though you've not seen him, you love him.
[time=989] Maybe that's how you feel today.
[time=990] You just can't see God at work.
[time=992] But we choose, we love him.
[time=993] Though you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory.
[time=1000] And I praise God that we can have that kind of joy that doesn't depend on what's happening to us, but instead is dependent upon what God is doing in us so that he's doing something through us.
[time=1010] Internal promises, blessing, joy.
[time=1013] Number three is grace, grace.
[time=1015] Thank God for his grace.
[time=1016] Verse eight, we're gonna look at a few promises from verse eight.
[time=1020] But in verse eight, there's four a's.
[time=1022] There's two abounds and there's one every.
[time=1025] Sounds like an overflowing verse, if you ask me.
[time=1028] And the first part of it, we see the promise of God's grace.
[time=1031] God is able to make all grace abound to you.
[time=1035] Abound is this overflowing sense, this in excess.
[time=1038] It's God's all sufficient love and grace.
[time=1041] We've often defined it this way around here.
[time=1043] G-R-A-C-E, God's riches at Christ's expense.
[time=1047] Jesus paid it all.
[time=1048] It's why we participate in communion that we'll do here in just a little bit to remember that Jesus paid it all, to be reminded of the promises of God that were fulfilled and made possible because Jesus, his body was broken and his blood was spilled out.
[time=1061] John 1 16 says, "And from his fullness, "aren't you glad that when you feel empty, "our God is always full?
[time=1069] "As from his fullness, we have all received grace upon grace." And today's shameless dad plug for a moment, so humor me for just a second.
[time=1079] One of the greatest pictures of grace I've ever seen in my life is my little Kaya Grace.
[time=1084] And today's her birthday.
[time=1086] She turns three years old today.
[time=1087] Many of you walked with us on that journey of adoption and said, "Well, I'm gonna cry.
[time=1092] "I can do this." Man, nothing pictures the grace of God
[time=1099] more than our little babies.
[time=1100] I'm so thankful for all of you who walked with us on that journey and Jessica and I have been reflecting and remembering her sweet little birth, all four pounds and one ounce of her.
[time=1111] And her middle name is Grace because I've never seen a greater picture of God's grace than her sweet smile, the blessings of God, the joy that overflows and grace overflowing than in my babies.
[time=1122] And so today I wanna ask you a personal question.
[time=1125] I know you're hurting.
[time=1126] I know you may feel empty.
[time=1128] I know you may not feel like you've seen God's grace.
[time=1130] But I bet if you look back, you'll realize that you're not where you wanna be, but you're not where you used to be.
[time=1135] And I bet you'll realize that God's blessings and his joy and his grace has abounded even when your sin was abounding, his grace abounded all the more.
[time=1144] I bet when you look back, you're gonna find that God's grace has been sufficient, at least in some point of your life.
[time=1149] And I believe the best remedy for discouragement, the best remedy for feeling empty is remembering the blessings and the grace of God in your life.
[time=1159] And I believe the best way for us to overflow with the grace of God, with generosity, with looking like and being like Jesus in our life will come from the moments where we pause and remember and reflect and respond to God's grace and his goodness in our life.
[time=1176] So if you feel empty, respond to his goodness, his grace is always sufficient, it's always there.
[time=1182] And what a perfect Sunday today is sanctity of human life Sunday.
[time=1187] And I'm reminded of that in looking at my own children, but I'm reminded of that in reminding you today that you matter to your Creator.
[time=1194] He values you, he loves you, and he's got a plan for you and his grace is enough.
[time=1201] It's a promise, mark it down.
[time=1203] Take it to the bank.
[time=1204] Number four is contentment.
[time=1206] Verse eight, we continue because it's not just God is able to make all grace abound you.
[time=1210] He continues, why?
[time=1211] So that having all sufficiency in all things at all times.
[time=1215] Some of you are saying, well, you preached on contentment last week, Pastor, and that hurts, stop it.
[time=1219] I just preach to us there.
[time=1221] It's here again, so I'm gonna preach contentment to you again.
[time=1223] And you say, well, we just read it and it says sufficiency.
[time=1225] It doesn't say contentment.
[time=1226] But the original language for sufficiency get this, this is so cool.
[time=1230] The original language is actually contentment.
[time=1233] It's the sufficiency of God inwardly displayed through a content spirit, a joy-filled, peace-filled spirit.
[time=1241] So that's why I'm for each about contentment.
[time=1242] That's the promise of God.
[time=1244] So when he says having all sufficiency, he's saying having all contentment and peace and joy in all things at all times.
[time=1252] The same Paul who wrote this also wrote to the churches at Philippi, Philippians 4.11.
[time=1257] Not that I'm speaking of being in need, but I have learned, get this, in whatever situation I am to be content.
[time=1265] The same word content here is the same Greek word used in verse eight for sufficiency.
[time=1270] They go together.
[time=1272] Maybe you've been missing the mark on contentment.
[time=1275] Write it down this way.
[time=1275] My heart breaks for some of you who are looking elsewhere for contentment.
[time=1279] I believe you will never be content in your circumstances until your completion comes from Christ.
[time=1288] Some of you are looking to a relationship to fulfill you.
[time=1291] Some of you are looking to finances to fulfill you, to stuff to fulfill you.
[time=1294] Some of you are scrolling on Facebook and comparing to what everybody else has when the whole time God says that stuff even to them is never gonna be enough.
[time=1302] And it'll never be enough to you, but I am always enough.
[time=1306] Your contentment and your joy can always be found in me until we are complete in Christ and Christ alone.
[time=1313] You'll never find contentment in any circumstances in life, even when it's going well.
[time=1319] Jesus is everything you've been looking for.
[time=1321] I promise you, go try it out.
[time=1323] He promises us we'll find contentment in and through him.
[time=1326] And then it starts to overflow and it starts to look like promise number five, which is effectiveness.
[time=1332] Effectiveness, also coming from verse eight and verse nine.
[time=1335] He says, now so you may abound in every good work in verse eight.
[time=1338] You may abound, that word abound is excess.
[time=1341] It's overflow is too much.
[time=1343] It's just one all fit.
[time=1345] And so that means you're gonna abound in effectiveness for the kingdom of God and for the gospel.
[time=1350] Jesus is not teaching.
[time=1351] As Paul is not writing to the churches at Corinth to say, you're gonna have everything you want.
[time=1355] You're gonna abound at all of your wishes and dreams.
[time=1357] And I'm gonna make them all come true like a genie in a bottle.
[time=1359] He say, no, I'm gonna make you abound and overflow with the grace of God to invest eternally so that internally I do something so big in you that externally people look at you and say, what's so different about that dude?
[time=1371] Why is that lady so different?
[time=1373] I want more of what she has.
[time=1375] Effectiveness is promised.
[time=1377] And I wanna remind you today, look at me for a minute.
[time=1380] Or if you're at screens in the room, all you have is all God needs to make you effective for your purpose, for his kingdom and his glory.
[time=1390] Some of you think I'll be effective for God's kingdom if blank, when blank.
[time=1395] If I have this blank, blank, blank.
[time=1397] We try to put all these blanks in front of God and God says, listen, I gave you everything you need to be all I've called you to be right here, right now, in this moment.
[time=1408] You have everything you need to be effective for my kingdom and my glory to do my will and my work in your life.
[time=1416] It's a promise.
[time=1418] So stop believing the lies of the enemy that you are not enough.
[time=1422] God looks at you and says, you're enough because Jesus is enough.
[time=1426] And if Jesus is inside of you for you to say, you're not enough is to look at Jesus and say, Jesus, you're not enough.
[time=1433] And I came to tell you today, his grace is overflowing.
[time=1435] He is always enough and he'll make us effective for his kingdom, it's a promise.
[time=1440] And in verse nine, Paul quotes Psalm 112, Psalm 112 and verse nine, ironically here, even with our verse numbers lining up.
[time=1449] And so I'll read it to you straight from Psalm 112 as you'll see we'll line up with verse nine of 2 Corinthians eight.
[time=1455] He has distributed freely, talking of God.
[time=1458] I'm glad he's a giving God.
[time=1459] He has given to the poor, his righteousness endures forever, his horn is exalted in honor.
[time=1465] And I'm thankful that my God is a giving God and he gives us a purpose to be generous, to be his hands, to be his feet.
[time=1473] Number six is provision, it's a promise.
[time=1476] God promises to provide.
[time=1477] In verse 10, we see he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply.
[time=1484] It's a provision.
[time=1485] See some of you are like, oh, I'm gonna zoom in on the seed and the sower.
[time=1488] Because that's the point of the promise, right?
[time=1490] Is that the seed and the sower get everything that they want.
[time=1492] No, hold on with me because this is a three part promise.
[time=1495] We're about to break apart.
[time=1496] It starts with provision.
[time=1497] The point of the promise, the point of this verse is not the seed and the sower.
[time=1502] The point of this verse is he who supplies seed, that he who supplies it is the owner, that he is the author and finisher of our fate, that he is the beginning and the end, that he is the firstborn from all of creation, that he owns it all, that God is our supplier and our source of all things.
[time=1522] And that the same God, get this who created the universe, is the one who will supply your knees.
[time=1527] But he doesn't always do it the way you want him to, does he?
[time=1530] But he is the supplier.
[time=1531] He's the one who balances the checkbook.
[time=1533] He's the one who balances the knees.
[time=1535] He's the one who takes them all and meets them according to his purpose and plan and will that often goes way above our heads.
[time=1543] And I've learned that sometimes God bypasses in his provision.
[time=1546] God will bypass what I want to give me what I need.
[time=1550] Maybe God's been doing that in your life.
[time=1552] He's skipping over the stuff that you want to give you what you really need.
[time=1556] And it might even include some emptiness.
[time=1558] James 1 17 captures this thought so well.
[time=1561] It says every good gift and perfect gift is from above.
[time=1566] Coming down from the father of life, with whom there's no variation or shadow due to change.
[time=1572] He stays the same.
[time=1574] He's the same God today as he was when he created the universe.
[time=1578] He's the same God today as he was when he formed you in your mother's womb.
[time=1584] I praise God for that.
[time=1586] We need that consistency.
[time=1588] And that is who supplies our needs.
[time=1590] Provision is promised.
[time=1592] Number seven is multiplication.
[time=1594] 'Cause he doesn't just provide the needs, now he multiplies them.
[time=1596] And so we see he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply.
[time=1600] Now number seven and multiply your seed and don't miss these last two words, for sowing.
[time=1607] Grace means that my emptiness is enough that God will supply what I need as I need it.
[time=1612] And that even when I feel empty, he's gonna multiply my seed.
[time=1616] Now what does that mean?
[time=1617] It means for sowing.
[time=1618] Means that he is multiplying.
[time=1620] There's a big difference.
[time=1621] Listen to me.
[time=1622] It's a big difference in interpreting God's word and saying God's gonna multiply the seed in his provision in my life for sowing purposes.
[time=1630] Selfish purposes, sowing purposes.
[time=1632] What's this passage about?
[time=1634] It's about sowing, very clear here.
[time=1636] It's about pouring into and investing eternally, as God does something internally, so that externally people see him at work and in through our lives.
[time=1645] That is what he's going to multiply.
[time=1648] And then the third part is, what is it?
[time=1650] What is it?
[time=1653] What is it going to multiply?
[time=1655] And then the third part is, what is he gonna multiply?
[time=1658] He's gonna provide.
[time=1659] He's gonna multiply.
[time=1660] Why and what?
[time=1662] Number eight is righteousness.
[time=1663] That's what he's gonna multiply.
[time=1665] The end of verse 10 says and increase the harvest, so the sowing, the reaping, increase the harvest of your righteousness.
[time=1673] When I hear that, I think of my righteousness.
[time=1675] Isaiah 64 and verse six, my righteousness is as filthy rags.
[time=1679] But it makes me so thankful to serve a God, 2 Corinthians chapter five, verse 21.
[time=1685] A Jesus who knew no sin was blameless, a spotless lamb and son of God.
[time=1692] He who knew no sin became sin, so that we could become the righteousness of God.
[time=1697] That's the harvest Paul is writing about.
[time=1699] It's the same Paul who wrote 2 Corinthians 5, 21, that Jesus came and took on our sin so that we could not just strive towards them.
[time=1708] Every now and then be obedient and people might kind of sort of maybe think we might have a little strat of righteousness in it.
[time=1714] No, that we would become the righteousness of God, not because of anything that we bring to the table, but because of everything that Jesus is and he paid it all.
[time=1724] That is what God will provide and multiply and harvest in his promises.
[time=1730] The righteousness of God.
[time=1733] In the Old Testament, I love this picture in Hosea chapter 10 and verse 12 of sowing and reaping and righteousness coming together.
[time=1740] Hosea 10, 12, so for yourselves righteousness, reap steadfast love.
[time=1746] Sounds like bountiful blessings to me.
[time=1748] This is what I pray over all of us today.
[time=1750] Break up your fallow ground for it is the time to seek the Lord.
[time=1757] That's not a word for our nation and for the church of Jesus.
[time=1759] I don't know what is.
[time=1761] It is time to seek the Lord.
[time=1763] And then what's gonna happen?
[time=1764] That he may come and reign righteousness upon you.
[time=1770] It's a promise and it leads us to number nine.
[time=1773] In verse 11, we see you will be enriched in every way to be generous in every way, right down enrichment.
[time=1780] It's a promise of God.
[time=1780] You'll be enriched in every way so that you can be generous.
[time=1784] Enrich means supplied abundantly, excessively enough.
[time=1787] Still not convinced God's grace is enough.
[time=1790] It just keeps overflowing.
[time=1791] Can I get a name in?
[time=1792] And he'll enrich you, not with the riches that maybe your mind goes to, but these internal promises of God.
[time=1798] God's sacrifice, God's supplied wine so that we can become sacrificial stewards to manage all of the blessings and the promises of God.
[time=1808] And then it leads us to a mindset that we'll explore in depth next week.
[time=1812] Number 10, a promise of God is gratitude.
[time=1814] The end of verse 11, which through us all, will produce thanksgiving to God.
[time=1819] Gratitude is always a gateway to generosity.
[time=1822] We give because God first gave to us.
[time=1825] So I don't know what promise God is prompting you with today to be proactive, but I ask you this question, and I wanna ask it to you this weekend next week.
[time=1834] We need two weeks at least to work on this one.
[time=1837] We may need two years.
[time=1838] How can you proactively practice God's promises this week?
[time=1842] Which one has God stirred inside of you?
[time=1844] Maybe it says blessing, it's joy, it's grace, contentment, effectiveness, provision, multiplication, righteousness, enrichment, gratitude.
[time=1852] The list goes on and on.
[time=1853] God's promises are never ending.
[time=1855] I wanna ask you to bow your heads and ponder that question in this place because God's ready to do a work and you were gonna remember his promises being fulfilled in Jesus by his blood that was spilled out, his body that was broken in a moment.
[time=1868] But I wanna give you a moment to reflect and proactively respond to what God is teaching.
[time=1872] If you're a believer, what is the promise that God has brought to the forefront of your heart that you need to practice proactively in a planned fashion this week?
[time=1880] You're not gonna accidentally give.
[time=1882] You're not gonna accidentally practice it perfectly.
[time=1884] Take some planning, it takes some proactivity.
[time=1886] And some of you're here and you need to trust Jesus as your savior and the promise of God of salvation is the one that all of this begins with and you realize that you're separated from God because of your sin but that Jesus paid it all.
[time=1898] He paid that price for your sin that you could never pay.
[time=1900] And if you ask him to forgive you believing that Jesus is that spotless savior who died to pay the price for your sin on that cross and that he rose again and that he is alive today, you will be saved.
[time=1914] Anyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
[time=1917] So in your own words to God, will you ask him to forgive you?
[time=1920] Will you ask him to save you from sin?
[time=1922] He's gonna meet you right where you are.
[time=1924] Own your screen and your home wherever you're at in the building.
[time=1927] Take a moment and let's respond and reflect as we prepare to remember.
[time=1932] Do that right now.
