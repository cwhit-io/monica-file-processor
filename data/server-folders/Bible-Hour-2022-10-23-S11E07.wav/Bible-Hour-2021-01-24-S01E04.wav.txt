[time=0] you guys ever feel like life's kind of a process that looks something like this, you get filled up in a way that probably doesn't feel like enough and then you pour it out and you try to stay enough full but the next time it feels a little more empty and you pour it all out and before long you just feel kind of empty. Some of you came into this series feeling empty and I pray I really do that this process of looking at the grace of God and the generosity that we're
[time=26] called to has helped you see the glass more half full but even more than that I hope that we go beyond seeing a glass half full to seeing that even when we're empty we think we're empty even
[time=39] when there's not enough that God's grace is always enough that he never runs out and that he will
[time=46] fill you up this week he will fill you up this month he will even fill you up this year into a
[time=52] place where you can overflow with his love and grace we're going to continue with this but no matter whether you feel this or this today God has a very special plan for you and he wants it to
[time=64] unfold through his promises so today I want to ask you to look at second Corinthians chapter number nine we're in a series called grace overflowing and we're looking at how Paul is talking to these
[time=75] Corinthian churches and they've made a promise to participate in an offering and a year has gone
[time=82] past and they have not followed through and we can relate because sometimes our follow through
[time=88] falls through can I get a name in we have good intentions but sometimes those intentions where we say well I really want to do this I believe God's calling me to take this step whatever it might be we have good intentions good motives a good heart but sometimes the obedience that it
[time=103] takes to actually take the step and go from having good intentions to having good intentionality there gets to be a gap that exists there and the Corinthian church was living in that gap and Paul has given us this new formula we've called it grace giving it's a different kind of giving it's not just a generous mindset it's a grace overflowing kind of generosity it is the combination
[time=124] of grace and generosity coming together and it leads us to our study today which is overflowing
[time=130] promises we spent two weeks in chapter eight of second Corinthians looking at these overflowing principles that now overflow into some promises of God and we need the promises of God to overflow
[time=143] in our life today you need that whether you needed it or you know you needed or not you need that I need that we need that so this is our second week looking at overflowing promises and no matter
[time=154] how full you feel today what we are learning is that even when I don't feel there's enough even when I feel empty that God's grace is always sufficient and it's his promises that make that
[time=166] true they are overflowing promises and it is the grace of God that fills the gap between my intention
[time=174] and my intentionality it's God's grace that bridges that gap write that down God's grace bridges
[time=181] the gap between intention and intentionality doesn't mean that he fixes all your problems fills all your bank accounts and everything goes exactly according to your plan but it does mean that God's grace is both forgiving and empowering he forgives us and lifts us up even when we fall
[time=197] down but then he empowers us to take forward steps and so starting last week we started this list of 17 that's a good list for us 17 promises from God's overflowing grace and I gave you 10
[time=211] last week and so you can access our sermon notes through the app is an easy way you can just go to our church app Blackhawk Ministries search for it go down to the gather section there click it you'll find the online bulletin you'll find sermon notes we've got this list of the first 10 that I gave you there you can find it if you're watching online in various forums there on our website Blackhawk.fyi so glad you're here wherever you're at we're trying to offer you as many tools as we can whether you're in the room or scattered around the world I want to pray for us do things
[time=241] a little different today because I believe God really wants his promises to stand out and I want to give you a moment to pause once again and remember those words that we just sang that our God truly
[time=251] is a great God let's give him our ear let's give him our attention now God we thank you for today we pray that these overflowing promises would fill us up God that we would even if we feel empty in an
[time=261] earthly sense that in an eternal sense God we would be ready to receive all that you have for us today we thank you for your overflowing grace we pray it would overflow through your word now as we dig in together we pray it all in Jesus name and all God's people said amen so let's look
[time=276] at these 17 promises last week we started with what I called internal promises this was from verses 6 through 11 of 2 Corinthians chapter 9 here's a quick recap they are in your notes
[time=287] if you missed last week it's blessing joy grace contentment effectiveness provision
[time=294] multiplication righteousness enrichment and gratitude can I get an amen if you need a little of that
[time=301] we need as much of that as we can get but now Paul shifts from these internal promises because
[time=307] we'll look at this further what God does with his promises they start on the inside but then they affect the outside but it all is done in light of eternity we are called to live in light of the
[time=318] eternal more than the earthly so now we shift to what I'll call eternal promises I gave you 10 internal promises now let's look at the seven we'll close our list with seven eternal promises
[time=330] you ready for the word of God this morning church let's look at second Corinthians chapter 9 these seven promises will come from verses 12 through 15 that'll finish up our two chapter study for the ministry of this service is not only supplying the needs of the saints but is also
[time=347] overflowing in many thanksgivings to God by their approval of this service they will glorify God
[time=356] because of your submission flowing from your confession of the gospel of Christ and the generosity
[time=364] of your contribution for them and for all others verse 14 and while they long for you and pray for
[time=371] you because of the surpassing grace of God upon you thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift
[time=380] and may God just overflow his grace to us through the reading of his word and I want to give you seven eternal promises and so we'll start with number 11 picking up last week where we left off coming from verse number 12 write this down eternal investments will provide for earthly needs
[time=396] that's what we see there in the beginning of verse 12 Paul says for the ministry of this service is
[time=402] not only supplying the needs of the saints that means that there are earthly needs that are real but God's overflowing grace doesn't mean that eternal investments when we're generous when we manage God's stuff the way that he wants us to it doesn't mean that he's going to provide for our needs the way that we would prescribe his provision everybody catch that that's important because a lot of times I would say yeah God here's how I would prescribe the provision that I think you
[time=428] should give me in my life because I'm being obedient raise your hand if you've ever thought that way before if you didn't raise your hand you can be nudged by your neighbor because that's not true we all think that way because we are so natural and we have these prescriptions of what we think God should do but God very rarely does things our way because his ways are not our ways
[time=446] his thoughts are not our thoughts they're so much higher than ours but you can rest assured this is
[time=452] a promise that eternally minded investments yes that means your finances but it also means
[time=458] your time it also means in your relationships when you think eternally that's going to be the theme of the day you'll see here about the promises of God when we invest in the eternal then God will
[time=470] supply in the earthly you can mark it down it may not be the provision and the supply that you hope
[time=476] for but God always supplies and he was using his church to do that they're in verse 12 and the word
[time=482] service there in the original language is liturgia which is really a word that's often used about a
[time=488] priestly kind of ministry that's why he says the ministry of this service he's elevating their giving and their generosity and participation in this offering for the saints who have need he's elevating it to the top possible level saying this is like a priestly kind of service and to
[time=506] illustrate that a lot of times when it comes to making eternal investments we kind of get gun shy sometimes we sit tight when things get tough don't we and there was a story I read this
[time=516] week of a little guy whose family always prayed for the missionaries of his church that's a pretty good practice and so this family would pray for the missionaries their church supported and they would often know of needs specific needs that maybe a missionary would have and they would pray that God would meet those needs those earthly needs that he would meet them in an eternal fashion and this went on for weeks and this little boy watched his dad pray that God would eternally meet these earthly
[time=541] needs week after week after week and finally after prayer one night the little boy just paused and said dad dad I can answer that prayer and so the dad said that's interesting tell me tell me about
[time=553] what's your plan for you answering that prayer asking God to answer that prayer and he went just give me your wallet I'll answer that prayer and a lot of times I do think the simplicity of a
[time=564] child's mind is such a beautiful picture of the simplicity of the gospel and of the overflowing
[time=571] grace and sometimes we tend as big kids urge your hand if you're a big kid I raise my hand first
[time=577] we big kids tend to complicate that which God has really made so simple and I think that's a good
[time=583] picture of that for us and so write this down here's what I think the promises of God will do when we have an eternal investment mindset it's that God's internal promises that's where we started last week
[time=594] will overflow into external places why to fulfill his eternal purposes I want to say that again
[time=603] that is so important that's the grasp of blessing that we looked at last week the promises of God
[time=609] that his internal promises they start on the inside they'll overflow grace overflowing to external places so that God can fulfill his eternal purposes that are way bigger than anything we could ever
[time=620] plan out for ourselves and that's where this list of promises begins and grace really here's what
[time=627] it does grace giving this combination of grace and generosity it doesn't look for obstacles and Paul's helping them overcome obstacles that have caused them to get distracted something interrupted their good intentions from going from intention to intentionality and Paul's helping them get past that and grace giving it won't look for obstacles look for ways out instead we look for opportunities to be generous knowing that our God through his eternal provision will provide
[time=653] our earthly needs as we do as he says so I go back to the question that we started with in this series
[time=659] when it comes to money specifically we've already looked at the fact that Jesus he doesn't want something from you he wants something for you so when he talks about money and giving and stewardship so much he doesn't need our money he's the owner of it all but he entrusts it to us and he knows that it's a picture of our heart and where our treasure is there our heart will be so he speaks so much to us about that but I ask you this question do you have money or does money have you
[time=686] Jesus didn't want to get your money Jesus just doesn't want your money to get you and that's why
[time=693] so important to start with this eternal investment mindset knowing that God will supply earthly
[time=700] needs this ministry is not just supplying the needs of the saints verse 12 but it leads us now to this idea of giving is material yes but it is also spiritual and we see it show up in the
[time=710] spiritual in the next promise promise number 12 is that thankfulness will overflow thankfulness
[time=716] gratitude will overflow verse 12 continues this service is not just supplying the needs of the
[time=722] saints but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God overflowing thanksgiving and some chapter
[time=732] number one hundred one hundred eighteen Psalm one eighteen and verse one says this that give thanks
[time=738] to the Lord for he is good his love endures forever so you give thanks in light of the eternal notice
[time=745] that gratitude is always a byproduct when you read scripture gratitude is always an overflowing byproduct it is always a result of an eternal perspective so in your life if you haven't been
[time=757] feeling very thankful you haven't looked at things with a gratitude and overflowing thanksgiving
[time=764] kind of mindset then I would submit to you that it's very likely that you've lost sight of an eternal perspective because when you have an eternal perspective you look at the big picture and not just the earthly but you zoom in on the eternal no matter what the earthly is bringing about you can't help but be thankful as a believer and so we see that in verse 12 but also in the
[time=784] Psalms and here's what God wants to do with his promises in you this week he wants to do it every day every week because his mercies are new every morning all right this down God wants his promises to change your perspective God wants his promises to change your perspective and to help you see
[time=803] this a little bit we're gonna do a little bit of a psych eval together collectively you can do it online watching on your screen you ready for this you didn't know you came to church for this I want to show you a series of pictures and we're gonna through these pictures maybe gain a little understanding of maybe what God wants to do through his promises check this picture out how many of you immediately
[time=822] saw the woman's face raise your hand at home to all right hands down how many of you saw the jazz player the guy with the horn okay how many of you saw both at the same time few of us okay so yes
[time=833] kind of sort of and here's the thing a lot of times we will see one without the other notice this next picture here's one for you how many of you saw the bunny first all right how many of you saw the kids
[time=845] looking at each other first okay next one how many of you see the tiger
[time=852] hands down how many of you see the monkey I heard it there's oh I see it now that's the that's the
[time=858] beauty that's what God wants to do my friends he wants you to realize that you've been zooming in on one thing but there's way more to the story God wants his promises to open your eyes to see that
[time=870] there is a bigger picture there's more in the picture than you think there is almost all the time when
[time=877] you think eternally you see more than when you zoom in on the earthly God wants his promises to change
[time=883] your perspective so I submit to you maybe just maybe you've been missing something and that's why you haven't been living with a thankful heart that's why you can't find contentment in your life is you've been missing the big eternal picture that leads you to overflow with God's thanks giving because your values will determine your views but your views will turn into a perspective that leads you to what you practice did you know your perspective will determine your practice how you see will always determine how you be it starts with your view and Jesus knew this because in Matthew
[time=913] chapter 6 Jesus said that the eye is the lamp of the body Matthew 6 22 the eye is the lamp of the
[time=920] body Jesus said this and in Jesus time it's important to note when Jesus said this the eye was seen to be
[time=927] this instrument of the body that would do two things it would both emit light meaning it would actually put off and generate light but it would also admit light now obviously we've learned a lot
[time=938] about the mechanism that is the complex creation of the human eye since them but because that was the case for them they would see the eye really even in ways that maybe we don't even see it as
[time=949] such today but we can certainly and should certainly learn from this that the eye was really the gateway
[time=955] to the body to the mind to the heart and Jesus is building on that mindset Jesus created your eye
[time=962] by the way he already knew what it was going to do he knows everything about it that you don't even know but that eye your perspective is a representation of being this gateway to your heart and Jesus
[time=973] knew that our perspective would matter so much that's why there's so much in scripture about your thinking as a man thinks in his heart so is he is so important that you grab hold of your thinking
[time=983] policies take every thought captive there's so much about our thinking be transformed by the renewing of our mind because Jesus took what was external and made it internal in Leviticus chapter
[time=996] 24 and Exodus chapter 27 we see this external lamp it was a physical lamp that represented the
[time=1002] presence of God at a tent or at a tabernacle at a place God's presence was tied to a place but
[time=1008] Jesus comes along and he takes that which is external and makes it internal the eye is the lamp of the
[time=1014] body and then he talks about the light that is in us talking about himself talking about his grace overflowing talking about salvation that only he could bring he took the presence of God which was external made it internal and that is the light that overflows and overcomes the darkness
[time=1031] that is how thankfulness can overflow as we make eternal investments and watch God meet earthly
[time=1037] needs so Jesus today wants you to see what you've been missing so ask that question to God this
[time=1045] week God what have I been missing what are you trying to teach me that I just don't yet see and
[time=1051] I believe he'll open your eyes promise number 13 is what will overflow from that and that is that God will be glorified verse 13 that we read a moment ago says by their approval of this service
[time=1062] so the people will receive it and we'll talk about that in a moment they will glorify God two key
[time=1068] words approval the word approval there really is talking about like a proof like they're going to approve of it they're going to prove they're going to see they're going to buy into the evidence that you have done what you said you were going to do the follow through the intentionality that comes from good intent the proof of the love the unity the grace they were called to demonstrate and the word they says they will glorify God you'll see it translated as they and you'll see it translated
[time=1093] as you at times it's because it's a little bit bigger of a word than either or it's kind of this all-encompassing word it's basically saying that when you follow through like this and they see these gifts and they see the love of God coming to them from you everybody's going to glorify God God is just going to be glorified and so that's what we see happening here and that's why Paul is giving this grace giving kind of formula in this passage Jesus said it best I think Matthew chapter
[time=1120] five verse 16 Jesus said in the same way let your light shine before others so that they may see
[time=1127] your good works it's what Paul's talking about and what and give glory to your father who is in
[time=1134] heaven I believe that God is most glorified when our talk turns into our walk and so that thought
[time=1143] of obedience is where we go next and it's another promise so let's look at this number 14 is that obedience then will spread the gospel continue in verse 13 obedience will spread the gospel he says
[time=1154] because of your submission flowing from your confession of the gospel of Christ so what we're
[time=1162] seeing here is like wow they don't just preach it they practice it I want people to say that about
[time=1168] me how about you I want people to look at my life and say man that guy he didn't just preach it and I know you're like well you preach and I don't preach and to which I say look at me for a minute camera screens wherever you're at yes you do you are a preacher look at your neighbor at home
[time=1182] wherever you're at in the room say you're a preacher tell him right now tell somebody you're a preacher you're preaching something and my prayer is that our life that listen our life matches our lips
[time=1192] that we don't just talk the talk but we can walk the walk and it's the overflowing grace of God in this
[time=1198] generosity principles that are overflowing leading to the promises that are overflowing this grace giving formula grace plus generosity that Paul is describing that leads us to obedience he says
[time=1209] confession what you say your intentions turned into a submission which is obedience which takes
[time=1216] intentionality a lot of times our intention doesn't turn into obedient intentionality and Paul is leading them into that and for us a lot of times here's a good intention story I've shared it with
[time=1227] you maybe a few years ago but there was a story of a farmer who had two twin calves born and I don't
[time=1233] know I've grown up around farms and all if you haven't that's a big payday right when you have twin calves that's a good day and so the farmer was pretty excited that there were these twin calves
[time=1245] knowing that that was going to be extra provision good earthly provision from his god and he went back to his wife and told his wife about these two twin calves and there was a black calf and there was a white calf and he said God is provided and so I want to make sure we give back to the Lord because he's the one who's provided all these things so half of what we make of prophets from these two calves we're going to give half of the prophet to the Lord the wife very happily agreed but had one question she said well which calf is the Lord's calf and which calf is our calf
[time=1277] and he said oh that doesn't matter it doesn't matter there's a white one there's a black one we're just going to give half of everything that we receive to the Lord and so time went by and
[time=1287] payday came but before it did one of the calves died and he comes back in and tells his wife he
[time=1295] says honey I've got bad news the Lord's calf died to which she remembered what he said and said
[time=1303] hold on I thought you said we were just going to give half and he said oh no no no see black you know in the Bible it represents darkness and sin and white represents light and you know spot
[time=1314] like a spotless kind of lamb so obviously the white calf was the Lord's calf and the white calf
[time=1320] is the one that died and I wish that there was a further punchline to this story but there's not
[time=1326] and there's not because doesn't that represent us all too often when we lose an eternal perspective
[time=1335] and get caught up in the earthly implications it seems like it's always the Lord's calf that dies can I get an amen the Lord's calf is usually the first to go yes I'm talking about money yes I'm
[time=1346] talking about your giving but probably way more than your giving definitely way more than your giving that's why Jesus said well your treasure is your heart's going to be there our heart gets consumed and distracted and our heart being pointed towards that which is eternal is often the first
[time=1360] thing to go when circumstances get tough and so may we keep the Lord's calf first may we give to God
[time=1369] all of our heart a hundred percent of the time you say well what percentage we've already looked at those principles God wants your heart way more than he wants a percent there's a great starting places the training wills of trusting God with your stuff we call it tithing there's good principles
[time=1383] that we can dig into like that but Jesus wants a whole lot more than that why so that he can overflow through you a whole lot more than you even think possible it goes against so much of our human logic but true faith is obedience it's an overflowing action it's this it's going from mouth to movement
[time=1399] going from mouth to movement sometimes we mouth things we say things but moving and taking a step
[time=1407] it's a different story so I want to get personal and ask you this question because God's promise is that obedience will spread the gospel obedience will spread the gospel because it's that submission
[time=1416] flowing from their confession of the gospel that was now going to spread the good news and so I ask you this question what's something that God has started in you a step that maybe long ago God
[time=1427] asked you to take a dream a vision an apology a phone call a gift an act of generosity stepping
[time=1437] up and giving to God through his church I don't know what it is but what is one step of obedience
[time=1443] that maybe you've been procrastinated you have good intentions but the obedient intentionality to follow through has fallen short I want to challenge you to revisit that this week because your obedience
[time=1454] to God when we follow his heart for us as his church is going to spread the gospel and that leads
[time=1460] to the next promise promise number 15 is that generosity when we take those kinds of steps in any area is going to impact the world look at verse 13 all this is from verse 13 so much packed here
[time=1472] that their approval of the service is going to glorify God secondly we're going to see this submission flowing from our confession of the gospel then the generosity of your contribution is for them and for all others in your bible if you've got a physical bible I've got that circle
[time=1486] and for all others like of course it's going to benefit them the recipients of the offering right
[time=1492] but it's also going to be for all the others really what does that mean for all others the word for
[time=1498] all is past in the Greek it's the same word get this it's the same word that Timothy uses to say that
[time=1505] all scripture is inspired by God so it's an all encompassing all it's a world changing kind of
[time=1514] all so he's saying that your simple act of generosity following through on this offering
[time=1520] being generous giving God your heart and showing it walking the walk as you've talked the talk that
[time=1526] when you do that it's going to impact the whole world we often don't look at steps of obedience that way do we as believers we think well my little step of obedience might impact two three ten for lucky maybe twenty thirty but the promises of God tell us they'll overflow to the world we get
[time=1544] to be a part of a church that God is using to change the world and so i'm thankful that we get to be a part of that kind of family and i've said to you before that we're never more like God
[time=1555] than when we give i don't want to put john 3 16 on the screen because i often quote it in light of this but i just want you to see these words notice the promise of God even in john 3 16 that generosity
[time=1566] giving is going to impact and change the world for God so loved the world that's everybody that he
[time=1574] say it with me that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have
[time=1580] eternal life you notice this giving and taking there it's a giving that turns into the eternal
[time=1587] impact that changes the world your simple step of obedience could be a world-changing step so don't
[time=1594] neglect it that's my challenge to you this week promise number 16 and this is wow this gets so
[time=1600] relevant it's just amazingly relevant to where we're at as a nation in a world right now right this down God's grace will be upon us and don't just shrug that off it may seem like a simple statement but this comes from verse 14 where it says while they long for you and pray for you this is the people they're giving to because of the surpassing grace of God upon you it's not there
[time=1621] surpassing talks of this overflowing this overcoming kind of grace it's not this passive did you know
[time=1627] grace is not passive a lot of times we think grace like meek is is weak meek is not weak meekness is
[time=1634] not weakness grace is not passive grace is active it is overcoming it is overflowing it is overtaking
[time=1642] it is surpassing and it's even listen it is even bigger than the divides we see in our nation and
[time=1648] our world then the divides that the enemy uses to wreak havoc in his church and even in your relationships because get this the people that are participating in this offering this is interesting stuff and I want to reiterate it we mentioned it in the earlier part of the series but you can't miss it that these are Gentile people any of them people that the Jews wouldn't really have wanted
[time=1668] anything to do with and there was all these these head-budding things but these are Gentile people giving to Jewish churches in Jerusalem and that is a massive step here's what you can write down about that grace unites grace brings us together when we understand the grace of God we see that it
[time=1687] is overcoming it is overtaking it is surpassing grace that is upon us and it is bigger than all
[time=1694] of the things that are ripping the church of Jesus Christ apart today because we get so earthly in
[time=1700] our perspective that we miss the eternal promises of God that he is the king of kings and the lord
[time=1707] of lords nothing and no one can dethrone him no matter what happens in our nation or around the
[time=1713] world the surpassing overtaking overcoming grace of God is bigger and it brings us together and when
[time=1721] we reunite around that truth it'll change the world it has changed the world and it's just beginning
[time=1729] to change the world that we live in today Paul even said it this way with Jews and Gentiles and he also says it about you and I Galatians 3 28 there's neither Jew nor Greek there is neither
[time=1740] slave nor free there's no male and female for you are all one in Christ Jesus and so I want to
[time=1749] challenge us wherever you're at in this emptiness season what's going to happen is God will take our divisions and our emptiness and he's going to bring us together and he's going to fill us up with things that don't even look quite so earthly anymore he's going to fill us all up to the place where there's no more room we're all of our divides we're all of our differences overflow
[time=1772] and people look at us and they see what kind of seems like a mess but they see a beautiful mess of overflowing grace and God still got more left in the tank he's just getting started this is a picture
[time=1783] all the sides that are divided all of the ways that Satan is wreaking havoc in God's church God wants us to look like this it makes a mess it overflows but it cannot help but be something
[time=1794] that people notice it stands out his grace overflows in us so that it overflows externally to external
[time=1802] places why so that people can see the eternal purposes and promises of God may we be an overflowing
[time=1811] kind of church maybe be an overflowing kind of grace filled Christian and may we listen some of
[time=1817] you need to take this simple step embrace grace some of you don't think that that's possible for you
[time=1825] but it's that overflowing grace that God wants totally available to you he's made it available
[time=1831] to you through Jesus he lived the sinless life you could never live he paid the price that you could
[time=1837] never pay he took your place that's the beauty of grace that's the gospel and when we understand
[time=1844] that when we embrace grace not only can we be saved in an eternal sense but that internal promise
[time=1852] that we've now achieved going to overflow into external places and we'll be able to fulfill some eternal purposes that God has for us one more promise and then we'll be through with our study
[time=1862] I pray you've been blessed verse number 17 and in verse 15 we see God's generosity will flow
[time=1869] through his church God's generosity will flow through his church and I'm so proud of you church
[time=1875] because not only has that happened happened practically through us through our give light offering least recently where we're investing in eternity here there and everywhere locally and globally and you'll be seeing story after story about how you made an impact how God is changing the world through us as his church through that practically speaking but spiritually God's ready to do a work and I pray revival over our nation but I want to remind you that revival starts
[time=1900] in God's church may we let God change us from the inside out and his generosity notice verse 15
[time=1906] thanks me to God for his inexpressible gift that's how Paul closes this chapter thanks me to God is
[time=1915] his generosity his gift that's inexpressible and he expresses it to the world he overflows it
[time=1921] to the world through his church first john 419 we love because he first loved us
[time=1930] ask you just like I did last week to close our time how can you this week proactively practice
[time=1936] God's promises how can you be proactive go from intention to intentionality and practice the
[time=1944] promises of God this week God's grace is ready to overflow in your life trust him follow him
[time=1950] he's a good good father by your heads with me close your eyes and ponder what does this mean for you today to trust in Jesus at that kind of level what does it mean for you today to proactively
[time=1961] practice the promises of God by implementing the overflowing principles that we've talked about where God can take that which seems impossible and empty and not enough and overflow it to a world
[time=1972] around us how can you take those steps as a believer this week ask God he's going to show you he's going to walk with you this week how can you be generous as God has given to you and I ask you
[time=1983] most importantly some of you're here and some of you are watching on your screen right now and you would say that you've never totally trusted in Jesus as your lord and savior all of the principles
[time=1993] all of the promises that we've looked at begin and end with Jesus begin and end with the author
[time=2000] and the finisher of our faith begin and end with a god who is ready to save you to save you from
[time=2006] separation from God from hell from sin to give you an eternal home in heaven yes but eternal life
[time=2012] right now Jesus said I've come that you may have life and you could have it more abundantly why did he come he came to pay that price for your sin which he did by dying that brutal death on the cross he paid it all but he rose again he rose again to defeat all of the things that would prohibit
[time=2030] you from having a right relationship with God he paid the price he won the victory your role is
[time=2036] to receive the gift grace God's riches at Christ's expense will you trust in him and stop trusting
[time=2044] in you you're not going to be good enough they're not going to be good enough the faith of your
[time=2050] parents or grandparents or anybody else is not good enough to save you only Jesus only Jesus
[time=2056] and in your own words I want to give you a moment just to cry out to him and ask him to save you and And he will do just that we cry out to him right now.
