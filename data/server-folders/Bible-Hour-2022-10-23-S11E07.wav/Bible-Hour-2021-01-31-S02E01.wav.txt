[time=0] And so today, let's dig into First Corinthians chapter 13, and here's the deal.
[time=9] As before I get to the principles of focus, undistracted focus today, you've got to get some context about what Paul is talking about in First Corinthians.
[time=18] We hear this passage at weddings, we talk about it oftentimes, but the context of the passage really goes a lot deeper than just a superficial kind of love, because in today's society, we've kind of perverted love.
[time=30] We make it either sexual or romantic or even brotherly, and all those things are good and they were created by God, but the unconditional agape, which is the Greek word used for love in this passage, it goes a lot deeper.
[time=44] And so today I want to give you some context, because in First Corinthians 13, you'll find that it's sandwiched by chapters 12 and 14, and the meat of that sandwich is the love
[time=54] of God in 13, but the bread cannot be ignored.
[time=58] And the context surrounding First Corinthians 13 and the love of God is spiritual gifts.
[time=64] And so Paul has just walked the Corinthian church through three different looks at how spiritual giftedness is supposed to come into play for God's church.
[time=73] And here's what he has done, he's pointed to them to the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[time=78] That's the gift of the Holy Spirit as the person in the Trinity that he is, that he's gifted us himself.
[time=85] We're indwelled by his Holy Spirit.
[time=86] So we have the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[time=88] Then he's talked to them about the gifts plural of the Holy Spirit.
[time=92] These are spiritual gifts that the Holy Spirit gives to believers, followers of Jesus, to edify, to build up the body of Christ, the church.
[time=102] And then he moves into the graces of the Spirit.
[time=105] The gift of the Spirit, the gifts of the Spirit, and the graces of the Spirit.
[time=110] The graces of the Spirit is really the attributes that are attached to the character of God.
[time=117] And then in 1 Corinthians chapter 12, look there with me.
[time=121] This is the last verse of the chapter 12, verse 31.
[time=125] Paul says this.
[time=126] He says, "But earnestly desire the higher gifts." We'll talk about why in a second.
[time=130] But here's what he says about the graces of the Spirit.
[time=132] "And I will show you a still more excellent way."
[time=138] So you gotta understand the church at Corinth was divided by the very gifts, the spiritual gifts that were meant to build up the body of Christ in love.
[time=148] The church at Corinth had become divided by that which God built and made and gave to build up.
[time=155] And for centuries, that has continued.
[time=157] We often, even as staunch followers of Jesus, allow ourselves to get divided and distracted by the very things that God wants to use to build us up.
[time=168] And so this message is very relevant for us even today just like it was for Paul.
[time=173] And the love that Paul talks about in 1 Corinthians 13 is agape.
[time=177] Say that in your home or wherever you're at watching, agape, agape is the Greek word.
[time=182] And it is this, it's used 10 times in 13 verses.
[time=186] It's where we get this phrase or this thought of unconditional, the name of our series.
[time=191] It's characterized by humility.
[time=193] It's characterized by obedience.
[time=195] It's characterized by self-sacrifice.
[time=198] It is a heart posture of unconditional, purely giving love.
[time=203] This is not a give and take kind of love.
[time=208] This is a purely giving love.
[time=210] It's not a receiving love.
[time=211] It's a love that always seeks the higher good of its object.
[time=216] It's a love that transcends.
[time=218] Really, here's what you gotta understand.
[time=219] It transcends anything we could do in and of our own strength.
[time=224] We've gotta have God's strength if we're gonna love with this kind of love.
[time=230] And so here's the thing for us in relationships, for us to exemplify the kind of love that we're reading about to experience unconditional agape love, here's the deal.
[time=240] God's going to have to undo some things, undo some things.
[time=245] I want you to write it in the chat.
[time=247] Say it out loud wherever you're watching.
[time=249] I'm ready to understand.
[time=251] I want to understand.
[time=254] This is so important because listen, if you really wanna see God's love show up in your relationships, if you really want his plans to ring true, then you've got to unplug from some of your plans.
[time=267] If you want God's will to reign in your life and in your relationships, then you've got to unplug from some of your own wills, from some of your own plans.
[time=277] God's ready to undo some things and he wants you to understand at a new level, not just the people that you relate to, but he wants you to understand his love that becomes an unconditional overflowing kind of love.
[time=290] And so today, I don't know where your relationships are, but put it in the chat, #undistracted.
[time=296] We're gonna focus on the unconditional love of God.
[time=300] And before we read these three verses, and then I'll give you some points that examples that Paul gives us, and then we'll end with just giving you some focuses for your life this week.
[time=309] Before I do that, this is the point Paul is about to make.
[time=312] Write this down in your notes.
[time=314] Without love, everything is nothing.
[time=320] It's really the point that Paul is teaching us about.
[time=323] First Corinthians chapter 13, let's read these first three verses, and then for the next several weeks, we're gonna unpack the following verses, but let's start with these three as they lay the groundwork for all the rest.
[time=333] I hope you're ready for the word.
[time=334] Let's dig in together.
[time=335] First Corinthians 13, verse one, "If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong, or a clanging symbol.
[time=346] And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing." Verse three, "If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing." And so Paul gives us three examples here of this statement that he had just made.
[time=373] He said, "Without love, everything is nothing." And he gives us specific examples, and all of these examples are gifts in the context of the gifts that he has been teaching the church about.
[time=383] And these three specific examples start with verse one.
[time=386] Art this down, the first one is this, "That unconditional love is bigger than words." It's bigger than words.
[time=391] In verse one, he says, "If I speak in the tongues of men and angels, but don't have love, I'm a noisy gong or a clanging symbol." And I just so happened to have some symbols.
[time=403] So come on over.
[time=405] And let's just ponder what your relationships might just look like.
[time=411] Maybe in your life, it's gotten pretty distracted and...
[time=415] (buzzing) Noisy, I have no idea how that just translated online all over the world, for whatever it is, I'm really sorry.
[time=424] Hopefully you've got your volume back up.
[time=425] But some of us are living life where this is what love looks like.
[time=431] It's just a noisy clanging symbol.
[time=434] And today, I just so happened to have, I can't do the symbols without also getting out the gong.
[time=442] I just so happened to have one here, and I don't know where you're at today, but I've come to sound the alarm that today, maybe this is your relationships.
[time=455] Maybe this is a picture, it's just noisy and it is just clanging and you're getting nowhere.
[time=460] And maybe you feel stuck in your relationships right now.
[time=464] And I've come not only to sound the alarm to the realities that perhaps you probably already know, but I wanna show you a way forward.
[time=470] And the truth is that the love of God, this agape unconditional love is so much bigger, is so much deeper than noise than your words.
[time=481] And so today, I believe with all of my heart that the enemy is screaming lies.
[time=487] Write this down, the enemy is screaming lies, but God is whispering love.
[time=493] God is whispering his truth.
[time=494] The world is noisy like clanging symbols and this noisy, loud gong and the enemy is screaming lies at you and maybe you've been believing them and maybe those lies have manifested themselves into your relationships.
[time=508] But where the enemy is screaming lies to distract you from the truth, the still small voice of God is whispering, his unconditional agape love.
[time=521] And I believe that that still small voice is ready to make a big change in your life.
[time=525] These meaningless distractions, they may be loud and the world, can I get an amen at home?
[time=530] Type it in the chat, if you think the world's full of meaningless distractions right now, there's so many things that pull away our focus.
[time=539] I know, I know that God's still small voice is speaking to you today.
[time=543] Number two is that unconditional love is bigger than wisdom.
[time=546] This comes from verse two, it's bigger than our words, but it's also bigger than wisdom.
[time=551] Verse two says, and if I have prophetic powers and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and then adds faith to the mix, to this ultimate wisdom, if I have all faith so as to remove mountains but have not love, I am nothing.
[time=565] And maybe you've been relying on words, good intent, but though you're not turning into intentionality in your life or wisdom or knowledge or thinking that you're right.
[time=574] And 1 Corinthians chapter eight, the same Paul writes this, 1 Corinthians eight verse one says, knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.
[time=584] Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.
[time=587] And some of you are living life like this.
[time=592] (buzzing) And you think that filling yourself up with the love of God means filling yourself up with knowledge and giftedness and abilities.
[time=603] And I've come to sound the alarm because I believe some of you, and this may be a humbling statement, but I believe some of you always think you're right.
[time=614] And you filled yourself up with knowledge and sometimes it's even biblical truths that we distort and twist in our relationships to manipulate, but that my friends is not what love does.
[time=626] It's knowledge that puffs up, but it's love that builds up.
[time=630] And some of you have puffed up through knowledge so much that you're exploding and popping and everywhere you go, you're this explosion of criticism or judgment in your relationships because maybe you've relied on knowledge or words to puff you up and it's the love of God, my friends, that wants to build you up.
[time=651] Maybe you're like an exploding balloon that have just been popping and exploding all over all of your relationships, but today you gotta understand that unconditional agape love is bigger than just what we say.
[time=662] It's even bigger than the wisdom and the knowledge and even the faith that we hang our hat on.
[time=667] Those things are good, but this love is supernatural.
[time=670] It goes so much deeper.
[time=672] It goes from our heads to our hearts so that it can affect our hands.
[time=676] So this unconditional love is bigger than words.
[time=678] It's bigger than wisdom.
[time=679] Number three, Paul reminds us in verse three, unconditional love is bigger than works.
[time=684] And he uncovers these works.
[time=685] He says, if I give away all I have and if I deliver up my body to be burned, that's like the ultimate work, but have not love, I gain nothing.
[time=696] Paul is reminding us that, you know, you may be doing things and maybe even holding them over those that you're in relationship with saying, well, you know, I did this for her.
[time=706] Oh, I did that for him.
[time=708] I just don't know why they can't do their part.
[time=710] And we oftentimes get consumed with either words or knowledge or wisdom or even works in our relationship so much that we miss the overflowing unconditional love that's not predicated on receiving anything at all.
[time=722] And that means that even if the other person, and you know who that other person is that you were thinking about, maybe they're not reciprocating.
[time=729] Maybe they're not doing their part.
[time=732] Unconditional agape self sacrificial love overflows and loves even when the other person doesn't do their part.
[time=740] That doesn't mean you're a doormat, doesn't mean you don't speak truth, but it does mean that the love of God has so grasped you that you understand it's way bigger than just what we say or even what we know or even what we do is who we are.
[time=754] That's the message that Paul is uncovering here.
[time=756] And he's reminding the Corinthians and all of us that we can't get distracted.
[time=761] Listen, by the works themselves.
[time=763] Love is not a works based thing.
[time=767] It's the why behind the works that will start to give you the heart of what it really means to love God and love others through the love that he pours out to us.
[time=777] It starts with our heart.
[time=779] So write this down.
[time=780] Now that we see the context, we understand the gifts and the surrounding bread that is all around the meat of 1 Corinthians 13 and the love that God is uncovering.
[time=790] We understand that this love is way bigger than just what we say or what we know or even what we do is who we are.
[time=795] It starts with our heart.
[time=797] Write this down.
[time=798] Agape love is more than a feeling.
[time=800] It is a focus.
[time=801] And through this statement, I want to unpack it and give you some focuses that will help you this week, some undistracted focuses, but agape love.
[time=809] Listen, it's so much more than a circumstantial feeling that comes and goes, goes up and down.
[time=816] Unconditional agape self sacrificial love is a focus that we've got to have.
[time=821] We've got to focus on the love of God if we want it to flow through us.
[time=825] And I'm going to give you the best relationship principle that I know.
[time=829] You ready for it?
[time=830] This is the best relationship principle that I know.
[time=834] And it's simply this, that what you magnify will multiply.
[time=838] Write that down.
[time=839] What you magnify will multiply.
[time=842] And so I don't know what this looks like to you, but you know what it looks like to magnify things in your life.
[time=849] What you focus on, relationally, is where you constantly are consumed by what the other person does wrong.
[time=856] And in churches, if you're constantly looking for magnifying something to be wrong with your church, guess what, you'll find it every time.
[time=864] If you're just looking for something wrong with your kids, you're going to find plenty.
[time=868] Because we're all flawed human beings in our homes, in our families, in our workplaces.
[time=873] And yes, even in God's church.
[time=876] And what you magnify, you're going to get a whole lot more of it, it's going to multiply.
[time=881] And so today my friends, I want to help us magnifying an undistracted fashion.
[time=886] The things that will help those things, the good things of God, the overflowing, unconditional love of God to multiply in our lives.
[time=894] Now that doesn't mean it's going to fix everything.
[time=896] You'll still be the same problematic person that you were when you woke up this morning.
[time=900] And so will your spouse and so will your kids.
[time=902] And so will that person at work.
[time=904] And so will he and so will she.
[time=907] But today, I want to give you some focuses that I believe will help you zoom in on the right things in your life, because whatever you're looking for, you're going to find it.
[time=915] What you magnify will multiply.
[time=917] So let's look at five undistracted focuses.
[time=921] Five undistracted focuses to help you relationally zoom in on and magnify the things that will help you better embody and exemplify and even experience the unconditional love of God.
[time=933] Write this down, the first one is word over worries.
[time=937] Word over worries.
[time=938] And by word, I'm talking about the word, capital W, the word of God over the worries of life.
[time=946] There's so much power, my friends, in filling ourselves up with the amazing, powerful word
[time=954] of God that's alive and active and sharper than any two-edged sword.
[time=958] And so I don't know what worries of life have been getting you down lately.
[time=962] But there's so much power in filling ourselves with the love of God, with the word of God when worries tend to creep in.
[time=970] And when we do that, we fill up with truth and love so much that there are no room for the lies that the enemy has been whispering to you.
[time=978] And it helps you be focused.
[time=980] And so write it down this way for you this week.
[time=982] I'm going to give you two challenges.
[time=983] I'll start with the night owls.
[time=984] Before you go nocturnal, go biblical.
[time=990] And for the mornings, before you do anything else, before you go digital, because most of the times we reach for our phone right when we wake up, I want to give you a challenge this week.
[time=1000] Just give it a try.
[time=1001] Before you go digital, go biblical.
[time=1003] Start with the word of God instead of scrolling and filling yourself with the worries of life.
[time=1009] What you magnify will multiply this.
[time=1011] Agape love is not just a feeling.
[time=1015] It is a focus.
[time=1016] So focus on the word over the worries.
[time=1019] Secondly, focus on opportunities over obstacles.
[time=1023] Opportunities over obstacles.
[time=1026] I know in my relationship it's easy to find plenty of obstacles to help a relationship move forward.
[time=1032] It's true in marriage, it's true in parenting, it's true in any arena of life in your workplaces.
[time=1036] No matter what you find yourself doing, guess what?
[time=1039] People are going to be there and relationships are going to be there and with relationships and with people come problems, come obstacles.
[time=1047] But today my friends, I want to challenge you to zoom in on and magnify the opportunities that you have to show the love of God, even in your most difficult relationships.
[time=1060] So focus on the opportunity to let God's unconditional love spill out to those in your life more than you focus on the obstacles, the negatives, if you will, that may get in the way of helping you do that.
[time=1072] Identify them.
[time=1073] Know what the obstacles are, but don't dwell there.
[time=1076] Focus on how you can be Jesus in the midst of all of the obstacles.
[time=1080] And then I think what you'll find is what you're magnifying is contentment.
[time=1083] And it will multiply, even though the challenges are still there.
[time=1087] And instead of having a critical spirit and being consumed by challenges, you will find that you are content in any circumstances.
[time=1095] As you focus on the opportunities more than the obstacles, our mind and our focus is such a powerful thing.
[time=1102] So focus on the word of God over the worries of life, focus on the opportunities to exemplify Jesus over the obstacles that make that very difficult to do.
[time=1112] And some of you, I just have to say this word to some of you, somebody watching today, maybe you just got forced into it 'cause you're locked in for a snow day.
[time=1120] I don't know where you're at, but you're ready to quit on something because of the obstacles.
[time=1125] But my God is so good.
[time=1128] He is so powerful and he is so able to take the impossible and do the possible.
[time=1135] He is so good and so able to take that which you are ready to quit on, to give up on.
[time=1140] And this is a word for somebody.
[time=1141] I just believe it so much.
[time=1142] You're ready to quit on that marriage or that relationship or your kids and being the person God's called you to be in any relationship God has placed you in the middle of right now.
[time=1152] But God says, take one more lap, keep trusting me.
[time=1155] Don't give up.
[time=1156] Focus on the opportunities that I am bringing about to do a new thing even through the obstacles.
[time=1163] So whatever you're at in your life, may we focus on that.
[time=1166] And it leads me to the third focus.
[time=1169] And that is focus on the supernatural, not the situational.
[time=1173] It's so easy to get caught up in the situations, the circumstances of life.
[time=1178] But true love is really a supernatural thing.
[time=1182] Agape love is not something we can do on our own.
[time=1185] It's not based on heartfelt feelings that come and go.
[time=1188] It's based on a heavenly Father that never ever changes.
[time=1192] Agape love is unconditional in that it is supernatural.
[time=1197] It's not natural.
[time=1198] It's not situational.
[time=1200] It never changes.
[time=1201] A few verses to support that would be first John chapter four, verse 18 that says, in this is love, not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins.
[time=1215] That means God put on him the wrath of God because of sin.
[time=1219] He bore the sins of the world, paid the price for that sin that we could never pay.
[time=1224] Rose from the dead and became our perfect sacrifice, became this picture.
[time=1231] It's a perfect complete picture of Agape, self-sacrificing, unconditional love.
[time=1238] And in that is love.
[time=1239] Not that we can achieve it at all.
[time=1241] It's supernatural, but that God loved us.
[time=1244] Romans five and verse five says, God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.
[time=1253] Romans chapter five and verse five.
[time=1255] It's God's love that's been poured into our hearts.
[time=1258] And that's where we get our hope from.
[time=1260] That's where we can experience this kind of Agape love.
[time=1264] We went through the fruit of the spirit recently as a church in Galatians chapter five where that list is found.
[time=1268] Verse 22 says this, that, but the fruit of the spirit is love, love.
[time=1274] And that's Agape.
[time=1276] And the list goes on, it's love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
[time=1283] But notice it's a fruit of the spirit.
[time=1285] It's not a fruit of self.
[time=1287] And if you're like me, I try to go about love.
[time=1290] I try to go about relationships so many times through the fruit of my own abilities, through the fruit of my own effort.
[time=1296] But the focus of Agape love is that it's supernatural.
[time=1300] We can't achieve it on our own.
[time=1302] And so what if we change the question we asked this week?
[time=1305] What if instead of asking in your relationships something like what do I feel like doing in my relationships today based on my situation?
[time=1314] 'Cause that's really what we do a lot of times.
[time=1315] We say, well, I don't really feel like helping my wife out or helping my husband.
[time=1320] I don't really feel like making that apology.
[time=1322] I don't really feel like going the extra mile to say that extra thing.
[time=1325] So instead of asking what do I feel like doing in my relationships based on our situation?
[time=1331] What if we ask something like, God, what do you desire to supernaturally do in my relationships because of your love?
[time=1339] That's a whole different question.
[time=1341] And it might change the actions that we go about doing.
[time=1344] And what you'll find is focusing on the supernatural instead of the situational.
[time=1349] It makes it all about God's equipping instead of my effort.
[time=1353] There's a big difference.
[time=1354] If you're approaching a relationship through your own efforts versus approaching your relationship through God's equipping, the supernatural ability of God flowing in you and through you because of Jesus Christ through the power of His Holy Spirit.
[time=1366] There's a whole different level of capacity.
[time=1369] And then you'll find that love is less about trying because some of you, you've worked so hard.
[time=1375] You've really tried to mend the relationship but unconditional agape love.
[time=1381] Really, when you focus on the supernatural more than the situational, you'll find that it becomes less about trying and more about relying.
[time=1390] Maybe you've been getting it backwards.
[time=1392] Maybe you're trying first and relying last.
[time=1395] I would say swap it up this week.
[time=1397] Focus on relying on the power of God in you and through you and what He wants to empower in your relationships first.
[time=1403] And then the effort's gonna follow.
[time=1405] He'll empower you.
[time=1406] It doesn't mean you don't try, it doesn't mean you're lazy.
[time=1408] It means you focus first on the ability God has and then you put in all of your effort.
[time=1415] And when you do that, I believe God's gonna do some supernatural things.
[time=1419] Word over worries, opportunities over obstacles, supernatural over situation.
[time=1423] Number four is eternal over earthly, eternal over earthly.
[time=1428] Last week we talked about having an eternal perspective and I wanna dig in a little more on that today.
[time=1435] And to do that, I found a great illustration.
[time=1437] Look at this picture of this fish.
[time=1439] This is a fish, we got a couple of pictures of the fish that will show you will flip through them for you.
[time=1443] This is a fish that is located in South and Central America among some other places, but it's become known as simply the four-eyed fish.
[time=1453] And what you'll notice as you look at this picture of the fish is that it really in essence has four eyes.
[time=1459] It has eyes that bulge from its head and it hovers at the top of the water.
[time=1463] And you'll find that it is able to look above the water and below the water with both of its eyes at the same time.
[time=1470] Just fascinating stuff.
[time=1472] And as I looked at that, I thought about how we go about life and relationships.
[time=1476] And this really is a great illustration of what God has called us to do.
[time=1481] We're living in the earthly.
[time=1483] We're in earthly relationships with earthly broken, sinful people, but as believers, as followers of Jesus, we're called to fix our eyes on Jesus, on the eternal.
[time=1494] So we're living in the already not yet tension.
[time=1497] And we're called to, as we look under the water and see the mess that may be our relationships, the earthly parts of life, we're at the same time as we look with loving compassion under the waters of life.
[time=1510] We're called to keep our eyes above the water on the eternal at the same time.
[time=1516] And when you're focused on Jesus and when you're focused on the eternal, while also walking through the challenges of life, you'll find that you're longingly awaiting that day when we'll be glorified and perfect like Jesus, but lovingly engaging in relationships as we focus on the eternal, even as we go about the earthly.
[time=1537] So this is my challenge to you this week in your relationships, as you focus on the eternal, not the earthly, is be a four-eyed fish.
[time=1547] Be a four-eyed fish.
[time=1548] Bet you never thought you'd hear that in a sermon, but what a picture of what God has called us to do.
[time=1554] As I look under this week, may we at the same time look upward.
[time=1560] Paul said it this way in 2 Corinthians chapter number four, in verses 17 and 18, he said, "For this light, momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory." Beyond all comparison, verse 18, as we look not to the things that are seen, but to the things that are unseen, for the things that are seen are transient.
[time=1583] They're changing constantly.
[time=1585] But the things that are unseen are eternal.
[time=1588] And my friends, I think there's an old song we used to sing growing up.
[time=1593] They would say, "The signs of the time are everywhere." And it's the midnight cry, not the midnight cry.
[time=1599] The bride of Christ will rise.
[time=1601] At the midnight cry, Jesus is coming again.
[time=1603] And I believe, I don't know the time.
[time=1605] I don't know.
[time=1606] Only God the Father knows that.
[time=1608] But I do know the end is coming and we're called to be ready.
[time=1612] We're called to be focused on the eternal more than the earthly.
[time=1615] We're called to make sure that we are a follower of Jesus.
[time=1619] We've nailed down our salvation and that unconditional love of God, that He's given so freely to us, that it is overflowing into our relationships and life.
[time=1628] So may we be ready?
[time=1631] May we focus on the eternal and not just the earthly.
[time=1635] May we be a four-eyed fish.
[time=1638] Last focus I'll give you today is progress over perfection.
[time=1642] Progress over perfection.
[time=1645] And what I know about you, if you are a follower of Jesus, I know this to be 100% for certain, is that you may not be and you are not who you want to be or who you will be, but you're not who you used to be.
[time=1659] Because as a follower of Jesus, we're transformed.
[time=1662] We are made new and people who are made new overflow with love to others, although so unperfectly.
[time=1669] And today I don't know where you're at or what progress means for you, but I would challenge you to take a moment and consider where you used to be.
[time=1677] Yep, that painful thought of the old you.
[time=1680] Especially if you know Jesus today, I would challenge you to pause and remember where God has brought you from.
[time=1686] You're not where you want to be, I know, but you're not where you used to be by the grace and the love of God overflowing in you.
[time=1693] And I thank God for how He doesn't demand perfection of us.
[time=1696] But yet sometimes in our relationships, even though we know God met us in our imperfection and in our sin, sometimes we expect perfection, either out of ourselves or other people.
[time=1708] And those expectations may be the knowledge that's puffing up the balloon of your relationships and exploding over and over and over in your life.
[time=1717] So what if this week, if we look through the lens of God's love and grace at the people God has called us to love?
[time=1723] And instead of focusing on perfection, even from ourself or even from other people, but instead look through the lens of progress, how can I take a step forward in my walk with God?
[time=1733] How can I stir up others?
[time=1736] In their walk with God to help them take a next step, to help them make progress in their life.
[time=1741] When the higher good of them trumps the me part of the equation, when even how we look in the mirror, we see that God is building me up, sanctifying me to look more and more like Jesus.
[time=1754] And one day I'll be glorified and I'll be perfect, but until then I'm gonna make progress in my relationships and in my walk with God.
[time=1762] And when we are transformed that way, we put others first.
[time=1766] And in first John chapter three, verse 16, there's a picture of that.
[time=1769] That says, by this we know love, that he laid down his life for us.
[time=1774] Notice where it starts.
[time=1775] It's about him, not about us.
[time=1777] By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us.
[time=1779] And here's the overflow.
[time=1781] And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers, for those relationships, for those people in your life.
[time=1787] So what if you asked this week, how can I adjust my expectations of myself and of others and offer grace to partner with God, to stir up progress?
[time=1797] That would change the focus of your relationship.
[time=1800] Word over worries, opportunities over obstacles, supernatural, over situational, eternal, over earthly.
[time=1808] And then now we see that we can focus on progress over perfection.
[time=1812] Why?
[time=1813] Because this love is more than a feeling, it's a focus.
[time=1816] And so I pray we can have an undistracted focus this week on the love of God.
[time=1821] I wanna give you an application question and it's simply this, this week.
[time=1824] What step can I take to remove distractions and focus on God's love?
[time=1835] I don't know where you're at today in your relationship with God, but if you want your relationship with others to change, you've probably already found out that it doesn't really start with you.
[time=1846] It starts with agape, unconditional self-sacrificing love that God made perfectly visible and complete in front of us in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1855] As we've read and looked at, that's the good news, that's the gospel.
[time=1859] Jesus died with a self-sacrificing love for you and for your sin.
[time=1865] He went on that cross and he said, Father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing.
[time=1869] He thought of moments just like this one, as the Holy Spirit is stirring on the inside of you perhaps.
[time=1874] If you don't know Jesus as your Lord and Savior, I believe that's what he's drawing you to in this very moment to see that Jesus was that substitute for you through his unconditional love.
[time=1885] He rose from the dead to defeat death hell in the grave so you could have a personal relationship with your creator.
[time=1892] That's my Jesus and accepting that is your part in the equation.
[time=1897] He did the work.
[time=1898] Now we just simply receive the love of God, receive the gift of salvation.
[time=1903] And if you've never done that today, I pray that you'll take a moment.
[time=1907] If you need to get away for a moment, if you need to go, you might not be able to go outside, but you need to go in another room, pause, stop, don't miss this moment and the spirit's drawing.
[time=1917] Believers that are tuning in, I believe God is stirring you up to take a step to stop focusing on meaningless distractions that are but a gong or a symbol that are pulling you away from the eternal.
[time=1930] Today may we focus on what matters.
[time=1932] So believers praying for your next step and if you are ready to receive Jesus, you don't have to be in a church building.
[time=1938] Jesus is already right there with you.
[time=1940] He's ready for you to receive Him as your Lord and Savior.
[time=1944] So I want to give you a moment, just to pause and pray.
[time=1946] And then I'll pray for us and give us some next steps as we end our time together today.
[time=1950] So right now, respond to what it is that God is stirring up in your heart.
