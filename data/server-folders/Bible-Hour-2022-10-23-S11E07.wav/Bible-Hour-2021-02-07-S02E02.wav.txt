[time=0] I invite you to 1 Corinthians, chapter 13.
[time=3] We're in this series called Unconditional.
[time=5] And last week I looked with you at this undistracted focus that comes from the first few verses.
[time=11] But today I wanna talk to you about unadgetated patience.
[time=16] Yeah, I said it, the P word, patience.
[time=19] Unadgetated patience from 1 Corinthians 13.
[time=22] And then after we're through there, we'll start there and then we'll end up in 1 Thessalonians chapter five.
[time=28] So you can hold your place in both.
[time=29] But I don't know about you, but I've noticed that people aren't naturally patient.
[time=34] I've noticed that I am not naturally patient.
[time=39] And that is true even in God's church.
[time=43] That is true even with the most godly of people.
[time=46] And Paul learned this as well because the church at Corinth, they were just kind of a mess.
[time=51] They really had a lot of problems and they had gotten impatient in areas.
[time=54] And Paul is teaching them about spiritual gifts.
[time=57] I'll talk to you more about that in a minute, but he's teaching them about spiritual gifts.
[time=60] And what I've noticed about our impatience and about our sinfulness as human beings is we will often end up as humans that are imperfect and impatient.
[time=70] We will end up taking the things that God sent to us to build up His church and actually end up being a tool of Satan with those things to tear the church down.
[time=79] We take the good things of God and we turn them into divisive things.
[time=83] And we see that throughout history.
[time=84] We see that through the church.
[time=86] We see it in our nation.
[time=87] But today we're digging into what patience can look like.
[time=91] And in 1 Corinthians chapter 13, the first three verses last week, if you missed last week's sermon, by the way, it's so good to have all of you back.
[time=98] I got flashbacks to our 10 weeks and I wasn't really a big fan.
[time=101] It's fun when you're in the room and I'm glad to be on your screens wherever you are.
[time=105] But I taught you about this undistracted focus.
[time=109] And if you missed that, go to blackhawk.fii or on our website and catch up.
[time=113] It's a foundational message for this whole series.
[time=115] It gives you the context today.
[time=117] But what we learned is that without love, everything is nothing.
[time=122] And I want to refresh your memory of the first few verses in 1 Corinthians 13.
[time=126] Without love, everything is nothing.
[time=127] Paul says it this way.
[time=128] "If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I'm a noisy gong or a clanging symbol." And yeah, I had one last week, if you missed out on that, you need to check it out.
[time=137] Verse two, "If I have prophetic powers and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and have all faith, so as to remove mountains that have not love, I am nothing.
[time=147] If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned but have not love, I gain nothing." This word agape is what Paul uses.
[time=157] It's the word for love and it's this unconditional, it's this self-sacrificial giving, others first, always others first, always seeking the higher good of them and not myself, the sacrificial love that we cannot have in and of ourselves that Paul is describing.
[time=173] That's agape, the word is used 10 times in these 13 verses of 1 Corinthians 13.
[time=179] It's a pretty important word, as Paul describes, even last week, but it's in the context though, of Paul teaching us about spiritual gifts.
[time=187] And it's these things that God gave us to build up the body.
[time=191] He's taught the church at Corinth in chapter 12, he'll continue it in chapter 14.
[time=195] And right in the middle is love, which is the heart of these gifts.
[time=198] He's taught about the gift of the Holy Spirit that God gives his own presence and self to us through his living Holy Spirit.
[time=206] And then the gifts of the Holy Spirit, the gifts that he gives to believers for the edification and building up of the body of Christ.
[time=213] And then he talks about the graces of the Holy Spirit, these things like love of which love is the greatest, that have to be the heart of all of them.
[time=221] And he's teaching that we have to unconditionally give all of ourselves, use all of our gifts all of the time in love, or it doesn't count for anything because we often get so distracted and so agitated.
[time=236] Some of you came today and you logged in today and you're already agitated.
[time=240] You don't like how I started the sermon, you don't like the noise that's going on at home, you don't like something.
[time=244] And we just, we live agitated.
[time=246] It's just this rubbing agitated society, but now Paul is wanting to help the church at Corinth and us to see what it looks like for the overflowing grace and love, of unconditional love of God to overflow into our lives.
[time=259] And for that to happen, there's a reason we're starting with the words un, look at your neighbor, say un, un.
[time=265] It's an important two letters for us today because if you want to learn God's ways, you're gonna have to unlearn some of your ways.
[time=274] If you want to plug into God's will in this unconditional love that he has, you gotta unplug from some of yours.
[time=281] And so we're looking today at unagitated patience.
[time=284] And Paul is teaching this overview, get this.
[time=287] He's teaching an overview of the spiritual gifts so that they become an overflow of supernatural grace.
[time=294] Or they overflow in us and through us where other people can see them.
[time=297] You can write it down this way.
[time=298] The context is spiritual gifts, but the content is supernatural grace.
[time=304] The context and the way Paul is teaching this, this overview is meant to lead to an overflow into your relationships and into your life.
[time=312] I don't know about you, but I could use some patience and unconditional love in my relationship and life.
[time=318] And so we're going through what he overflows into then from here on out.
[time=321] First Corinthians 13 starting in verse four, we'll read the first phrase and I'm gonna preach about it for the rest of our time today.
[time=327] First Corinthians 13 for love is patient and kind.
[time=332] And you notice this mirrors Galatians chapter five verses 22 through 26, which is the fruit of the spirit.
[time=337] And I taught and we taught through the fruit of the spirit singular because it's a package to deal, by the way, all predicated and based on love.
[time=345] Even last year we looked at that.
[time=347] But today I wanna talk to you about patience.
[time=350] Raise your hand if you already know you have a patience problem.
[time=353] I'm raising my hand, not as an example, but as a participant in this exercise.
[time=358] And for those of you who did not raise your hand, allow me to convince you for just a moment.
[time=363] You might have a patience problem.
[time=365] If this picture, check out this picture, if when you see this picture, you're having road rage in your heart right now and you're not even driving.
[time=373] You might have a patience problem.
[time=375] Next picture, you might have a patience problem.
[time=377] If this button in an elevator, the closed door button, you get in and you press it 15 times and then when the door finally closes, you're convinced that that button doesn't even do anything to begin with.
[time=387] You might have a patience problem.
[time=389] There's a couple more.
[time=390] Next one, you might have a patience problem if your child didn't learn to tie their own shoes until middle school because you always said, just let me do it.
[time=399] Some of you aren't laughing because that's you.
[time=403] Next picture, microwave.
[time=406] You might have a patience problem.
[time=407] If you can't even let the microwave count down to zero.
[time=410] One more.
[time=412] You might have a patience problem.
[time=414] If when you see this, someone's typing back to you in a text, you send 18 question marks before they can even finish their text message.
[time=424] And last but not least, you might have a patience problem.
[time=427] If you're just thinking to yourself right now, I wish you would hurry up and finish this list and get to the sermon.
[time=432] And for those of you who feel that way, I'm gonna do just that.
[time=435] The Greek word for patience that we're gonna look at, that's in 1 Corinthians 13.
[time=440] Now all of us have a patience problem.
[time=442] Is macro the mayo?
[time=444] Is two Greek words put together?
[time=446] And my buddy, Pastor Kevin Newbury, got the privilege of teaching on this same word as a fruit of the spirit last year.
[time=453] And so it's the same word that is used here in 1 Corinthians 13.
[time=457] The word means to suffer long, as opposed to a hasty anger or a quick agitation.
[time=464] Maybe that describes you in some of your relationships.
[time=467] It's made up of two Greek words, macro, which is long, and thumas which is anger or wrath.
[time=473] And it doesn't mean that you stay angry or wrathful for a long time.
[time=477] It means that it takes you a long time to get to that kind of a boiling point.
[time=481] In fact, I think that's a great visual for us, is consider a boiling pot, a pot that's on the stove.
[time=487] You know, what makes it boil is the burner, is the flame, is the heat from underneath it.
[time=492] It really doesn't matter what's in the pot, doesn't matter with the water, and all those things, they affect things just a little bit.
[time=498] But what really gets things to a boiling point and where a pot will boil over is the temperature underneath.
[time=504] And so this kind of patience, this long suffering, as it's even often translated, means turning down the heat.
[time=511] It means controlling through the power of the Holy Spirit, the level of the flame and the temperature that often causes you to get agitated and boil over the rim and the brim of your relationships.
[time=523] And so today in first Thessalonians, turn there with me, if you will.
[time=527] First Thessalonians will be there for the rest of our time.
[time=530] This same word is used by Paul to the church at Thessalonica.
[time=534] In first Thessalonians chapter five, we'll look at verses nine through 18.
[time=538] And the context of this passage is that Paul is, get this, encouraging believers to both expectantly, but also patiently await the coming of our Lord Jesus.
[time=549] And by the way, I just need to remind somebody, I'm not preaching on it specifically today.
[time=552] Look at me, Jesus is coming again.
[time=555] He's coming back.
[time=556] I know you're stressed out.
[time=557] I know the world seems like it's falling apart, but Jesus is coming again.
[time=562] And we can expectantly, hopefully, patiently await His coming because one day He is going to fix everything.
[time=571] I'm glad of that today.
[time=572] And in the meantime, we can be patient.
[time=573] And that's what Paul is writing to the church at Thessalonica about in chapter five.
[time=578] This is one of about seven places where this Greek word for patience is used in scripture.
[time=584] And Pastor Newbury preached on that in Galatians five, but he also used James chapter five, which is one of those seven places.
[time=591] James five verse eight says this.
[time=593] You also being patient, be patient.
[time=598] Does everybody say it?
[time=598] Be patient.
[time=599] Look at your neighbor, say be patient.
[time=601] Be patient.
[time=603] Establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord is at hand.
[time=608] And I want to spend the rest of our time in this passage of 1 Thessalonians five.
[time=612] And I want to give you five pictures that Paul paints of patience.
[time=616] There's five pictures.
[time=617] In verse 14, he uses the same word, but the surrounding verses give us some great pictures of patience.
[time=622] Number one comes from verses nine through 11.
[time=625] And it is payback and patience.
[time=628] Some of you are living in your relationships right now through a lens of payback.
[time=632] You want to get even.
[time=633] You want to do the eye for the eye, the tooth for a tooth.
[time=636] What they dish, if somebody one ups you, you're going to level up and take it further.
[time=640] You're going to win.
[time=641] You're going to come out on top.
[time=644] I figured it'd be quiet.
[time=645] Some of you are throwing imaginary elbows right now, left and right, wherever you may be.
[time=649] Because sometimes that's how we look at life.
[time=651] But Paul reminds us of what payback could have looked like by giving us a picture of the opposite that we get from God in verses nine through 11.
[time=659] Let's read those together.
[time=661] You excited for the word today, black honk?
[time=664] Verse number nine, 1 Thessalonians five.
[time=666] For God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep, living or dead, we might live with him.
[time=680] Verse 11, therefore, encourage one another and build one another up just as you are doing.
[time=688] In verses nine and 10, we're reminded that if God wanted to pay us back and give us what we deserve, it would be hatred.
[time=695] It would be complete isolation and separation from God in hell.
[time=699] It would be a horrible place of payback and of guilt and of pain that lasts forever and ever and ever.
[time=708] We would get the wrath of God.
[time=709] But Paul reminds us, verse nine, that God didn't destined us for wrath.
[time=714] God instead sent his son Jesus.
[time=716] He didn't pay us back for our sins.
[time=719] If he did that, listen, a lot of people say, well, I just wish life was fair.
[time=723] I don't, if I get what's fair in life, I get hell.
[time=726] But because of God through Jesus Christ, my God didn't pay me back.
[time=730] Instead of paying me back what I deserve, he gives me all of his mercy and all of his grace, getting all these things I don't deserve.
[time=737] His grace is God's riches at Christ's expense.
[time=740] He gave it to us freely.
[time=742] He didn't pay us back.
[time=743] And so for those of us who look at getting even as our mode of relationships, whether it's in your marriage or at work or with your kids or with whomever it might be, wherever you're at, if you've got relationships, if you were born, you're around people, then this applies to you and to me.
[time=759] If you look at life through the lens of payback, you're missing the grace of God that he has given to us so freely that he wants to overflow into your relationships.
[time=770] Second Peter, chapter number three, verse nine, talks about God's patience.
[time=774] It says, "The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise that some count slowness, but is, say it with me, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance." I don't deserve that kind of a God at all.
[time=792] You don't deserve that kind of a God at all.
[time=795] Yet he gives himself so freely, not paying us back, but instead giving us his unconditional love and grace.
[time=801] And at least to verse 11, where it says, "Therefore," by the way, in scripture, when you see the word, "therefore," it's there for a reason.
[time=807] And in this case, it's there to remind us of what we should do with the information that we have just downloaded.
[time=813] And so he says, "Therefore, therefore do two things." Encourage one another and build one another up, just as you're doing.
[time=819] He gives us two things.
[time=820] I wanna talk about those two things.
[time=821] Encourage and build.
[time=826] Now, why didn't he say criticize and blame?
[time=829] Why didn't he say prove that you're right and win the argument?
[time=834] He didn't say that, but that's what we see, isn't it, in our world.
[time=837] He says, "encourage and build." And that word for encourage is two words brought together.
[time=841] It's paracaleo.
[time=842] Para means come alongside.
[time=845] It means alongside of, to the side of, caleo is to call, to come alongside, to follow, to exhort, to follow.
[time=853] So what you find is an encouragement, an exhortation, to come alongside somebody with calling in mind.
[time=859] Caleo is calling to pursue that calling alongside others and stir other people up towards the calling of God in their life.
[time=867] That's encouragement.
[time=868] It's not just giving a little white lie to make them feel better about themselves.
[time=872] It's finding out and pursuing the heart of God with them and for them and stirring them towards those good things, which leads to the second one, which is build.
[time=881] That word is like construction.
[time=883] It's like this coming together of a house, construction.
[time=888] And you know what I've learned about those two things, especially in the context of relationships, is that calling and construction take time and patience.
[time=897] Write that down.
[time=898] Calling and construction, build and encourage, calling and construction take time and patience.
[time=906] So I heard somebody talk about patience even before the message today and they were talking to somebody and I think the quote was something like, "Well, I don't have time to be patient." But calling and construction take time and patience.
[time=920] Maybe God's got you ready for a pause today.
[time=923] It takes time, but you're called to build other people up because why?
[time=927] When God could have paid you back.
[time=929] When God could have, and maybe should have taken you down and torn you apart.
[time=932] He lifted you up by lifting his son Jesus on that cross so that we could know him.
[time=937] And then verse 11 ends with this.
[time=938] This is important.
[time=939] He says, "Just as you are doing." That's good for the church at Thessalonica.
[time=942] That means they were doing this building and encouraging pretty well.
[time=945] He's like, "Hey, keep it up.
[time=947] You're doing a good job." And so I would ask you, if Paul were to be here and writing now, and if God were to look at your life, would he say, "Hey, blank, your name." Keep it up.
[time=956] Do this just as you are doing.
[time=958] Or perhaps would he say, "Hey, you hadn't been up to this much at all.
[time=964] Let's get going.
[time=965] Let's encourage, let's build because the world is in the business of tearing everything and everybody down." Have you noticed church?
[time=972] And it's true of the church.
[time=974] We gain these critical spirits and hearts that just wanna rip apart things.
[time=978] Why?
[time=978] We miss the heart of God because when he could have, and maybe should have paid us back and ripped us to shreds, he built us up and encouraged us through this unconditional love made manifest through Jesus Christ.
[time=991] So my question to you is what are you doing?
[time=994] Consider this payback that God didn't give us when you think about that in the lens of your relationship.
[time=999] Secondly is peace, write that down.
[time=1001] Peace and patience.
[time=1002] It's another picture of what God is doing.
[time=1005] I love God's heart for his church that is really clear in these verses 12 and 13 is where we see this picture of peace and patience.
[time=1013] Verse 12 says, "We ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you, and to esteem them highly in love." There's agape again.
[time=1024] And to esteem them very highly in love, and here's what it turns into because of their work.
[time=1029] Be at peace among yourselves.
[time=1032] So how did that connect to peace one may ask?
[time=1035] What's this deal of people investing in your life?
[time=1037] So I wanna ask you this question of what elder or life group leader or deacon or pastor or parent or grandparent or influencer or mentor has labored over and is laboring over you in the Lord, gives oversight, gives shepherding, gives influence, has helped to change your life's trajectory.
[time=1058] Who is it that God has placed over you to admonish you and exhort you to build you and to encourage you?
[time=1064] And whoever that is, whoever comes to mind and it could be a number of different things.
[time=1068] This is why you see God's heart for his church.
[time=1069] Listen, Jesus said, "I'll build my church and the gates of hell won't prevail against it." That is the system through which all of this happens.
[time=1076] We're called to be God's church.
[time=1078] That's why we take church governance and structure so seriously here.
[time=1081] We wanna do it God's way 'cause it's his church, not Kevin's church or your church or his church or her church.
[time=1087] It's God's church and this is the venue.
[time=1090] You see the heart of God for building and encouraging but whoever it is that came to your mind to things that you should do.
[time=1097] You should respect them and you should esteem them very highly.
[time=1100] That means be the first to recognize them.
[time=1103] You should lift them up.
[time=1104] You should thank them.
[time=1105] So the question is, who do you need to thank this week?
[time=1107] Who's poured into your life?
[time=1109] Maybe you need to just give them a thank you.
[time=1110] Words matter, encourage, exhort.
[time=1114] Love one another, build each other up, especially in that area and it leads to this peace.
[time=1118] It's when we're at peace together like that, when we're and listen, it's not just who's pouring into you.
[time=1122] Here's my challenge to you.
[time=1123] Who are you pouring into?
[time=1125] Who are you making disciples with?
[time=1127] Who would think of you when I ask them this list?
[time=1131] That's our call and it leads us to being at peace and it flows from agape, highly in love, it says.
[time=1137] You could write it this way, that where there is peace with God there will be patience with people.
[time=1143] Or there's peace with God, there will be patience with people and peace with others.
[time=1148] It just, the vertical and the horizontal go together and it makes a cross, imagine that.
[time=1152] It's only possible through him.
[time=1155] Peace produces patience and patience produces peace.
[time=1159] There's the cyclical pattern of production that happens when patience and peace come together.
[time=1165] And then in verse 23, I'll just read it to you at the end of this passage.
[time=1168] It just says, now I'll make the God of peace himself, sanctify you completely and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1180] Number three is people.
[time=1182] Here's where it gets real.
[time=1183] You ready to get real?
[time=1184] People and patience.
[time=1185] Looked at payback, peace, but now people and patience verses 14 through 15 is a picture of this unconditional love and verse 14 where you see this same word that's used in 1 Corinthians 13.
[time=1197] Let's read verses 14 and 15.
[time=1198] And we urge you brothers, admonish the idol, encourage the faint hearted, help the weak, be patient with them all.
[time=1207] See that no one pays anyone evil for evil but always seek to do good to one another and to everyone.
[time=1215] I wanna remind you of something that you already know, that the greatest platforms for you to demonstrate and practice patience will always involve people and their problems.
[time=1227] A lot of times we pray for patience.
[time=1229] You should be careful with that because God might just give you the opportunity to be patient.
[time=1233] And usually he will do that.
[time=1234] He goes something like this.
[time=1235] We pray for patience and God sends us that person.
[time=1238] That one, yep.
[time=1240] I'm gonna preach about that person, the one that is requiring the most patience from you right now in your life.
[time=1245] It's a platform for God's patience to be displayed to his people.
[time=1249] And Paul gives this list of three things.
[time=1251] It's idol, faint hearted, and weak.
[time=1253] And he tells us to do three things with them, admonish the idol, encourage the faint hearted and help the weak.
[time=1259] Idol is this undisciplined kind of word.
[time=1261] It's somebody that's, they just don't get it.
[time=1263] They're not putting in the effort.
[time=1264] You've beat 'em over the head with it over and over and they just don't get it.
[time=1267] Can I get an amen?
[time=1270] You know those people.
[time=1271] Then there's the faint hearted.
[time=1273] There's people 'cause this is in the context of believers that don't see themselves the way God sees them.
[time=1278] It's this idea of kind of identity.
[time=1280] They have this low self-esteem because they have a low view of themselves, ultimately because they have a low or misinformed view of God.
[time=1287] And we're called to encourage them.
[time=1290] And then the weak, we're called to help the weak.
[time=1291] This is the powerless, physically, spiritually.
[time=1294] We're called to do those three things.
[time=1295] But here's what I wanna challenge you.
[time=1296] You've probably got people already in all those categories right now, don't you?
[time=1299] You're in somebody else's category too, by the way.
[time=1301] That's a whole other sermon.
[time=1303] But just so you know, the packaging though, for all three of those things, for the encouraging, for the helping, for the admonishing, with the idol, the faint hearted, and the weak.
[time=1312] The packaging for doing those things get this is patience.
[time=1316] Notice what he says at the end there in verse 14.
[time=1318] He says, "And be patient with them all." How many of them?
[time=1322] Not that one, right?
[time=1323] No, them all.
[time=1325] Be patient with them all.
[time=1326] That's the packaging for all of it.
[time=1327] And then it leads to what reminds me of some words of Jesus in verse 15 says, "Not an eye for an eye, "it's this unconditional seeking of good of other peoples.
[time=1336] "You unconditionally give yourself "and your spiritual gifts and who you are "to the good of other people." In verse 15, it reminds me of what Jesus said in Matthew five, verses 38 and 39.
[time=1346] Jesus said, "You've heard it that it was said, "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
[time=1349] "But I say to you, did not resist the one who is evil, "but if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, "turn to him the other also." And a lot of people misinterpret this and take it way out of context.
[time=1361] And it's like, well, Jesus just wants me to be a doormat.
[time=1364] And Jesus just wants me to be a little weakling and let people beat up on me all the time.
[time=1367] No, the context of Matthew five is this bold, outrageous, courageous, radical faith that pushes against every natural convention of humanity.
[time=1377] And as Jesus is saying that, he's not saying, let people beat up on him.
[time=1380] He's saying, listen, he's saying speak the truth and live the truth, but do it in love.
[time=1384] And listen, when they're trying to win the argument, let your motive be not to win the argument, but instead to win them to Jesus.
[time=1393] There's a big difference, because in our relationships, we might win an argument, but sometimes we do it at the expense of losing the relationship.
[time=1402] And God doesn't want you to win arguments.
[time=1404] God wants you to win people to Jesus.
[time=1406] God wants you to win people to the view of who Jesus is and how much he loves them.
[time=1412] He's not in it for you to win it.
[time=1413] He's already won it.
[time=1415] He's the ultimate victor, but he wants his victory to flow through you and through your relationships.
[time=1421] This is people and patience, and it gets messy when we deal with people and patience.
[time=1426] So I want to ask you what person has come to mind.
[time=1429] I know you have 13, but just pick one, just pick one.
[time=1433] And with that person in mind, I want to read these two verses over you.
[time=1436] Romans 15-5 from the New Living Translation says, "May God who gives this patience and encouragement help you live in complete harmony with each other, as is fitting for followers of Christ Jesus." And even more practical from Proverbs chapter 15 and verse 18 in the NIV says, "A hot, tempered person stirs up conflict,
[time=1457] but the one who is patient calms the quarrel." I don't know about you, but I feel like a hypocrite preaching on this sometimes because I feel like a big failure.
[time=1466] A lot of times I'm an impatient person, and I like to get things done yesterday.
[time=1470] And I agree with that statement.
[time=1472] I don't have time to be patient, but I'm so glad my God made time for me.
[time=1476] And with that person in mind, I want to ask you another question, is how can you today?
[time=1480] I originally wrote this down this week, and I crossed it out in my notes and wrote today, because we need to start now, not tomorrow.
[time=1485] How can you today display humble, godly patients with that person today?
[time=1493] I challenge you to answer that this week.
[time=1494] And maybe even in a couple of categories, with a loved one, a loved one, somebody that maybe is a little easier to do that.
[time=1500] But secondly, with somebody that is so difficult to be patient with, I want to challenge you to dig into that today, start today and this week, because people and patients go together when we overflow with God's unconditional love.
[time=1513] Number four is perspective and patience.
[time=1515] I've talked to you a lot about perspective lately, and it's just because I'm preaching the word.
[time=1518] If it's here, I'm preaching it, and we're preaching straight through it, and perspective is in there a lot.
[time=1522] It's almost like Jesus knew our thinking would need some help.
[time=1526] Perspective and patience comes from verses 16 and 18.
[time=1529] We'll go back to verse 17 for our fifth thing here, but let's read those three.
[time=1533] Verse 16, rejoice always.
[time=1535] Pray without ceasing.
[time=1537] Give thanks in all circumstances.
[time=1541] For this is the will of God and Christ Jesus for you.
[time=1544] Two things that happen there, rejoicing and giving things.
[time=1547] Both of those, rejoicing, I often say to rejoice is a choice.
[time=1551] We gotta choose to rejoice.
[time=1552] There's something you can rejoice over in your life, even in the areas where you feel so beaten down and discouraged.
[time=1558] So how can you choose to rejoice?
[time=1559] How can you choose joy?
[time=1561] And when you do that, it's usually gonna come from giving thanks.
[time=1563] Verse 18, giving thanks because this in all circumstances, not some, not the easy ones, but all circumstances because that's God's will for us and Christ Jesus.
[time=1572] So today, I don't know where you're at with all of that, but those things are perspectives of worship.
[time=1578] They're postures of worship.
[time=1579] And I'm convinced that one of the greatest inhibitors of worship is worry.
[time=1587] It is so impossible to have a posture of rejoicing, giving thanks and worshiping God when you're worrying about something.
[time=1594] And that's why Jesus says, don't be anxious about anything.
[time=1598] Says nothing in the Greek.
[time=1599] You wanna know what the word means in the Greek?
[time=1601] Nothing.
[time=1602] Zilch, nada.
[time=1604] There's nothing that should overtake our perspective.
[time=1607] We've gotta value the eternal over the earthly.
[time=1610] And you see those two postures there today.
[time=1613] And as this inhibitor of worship that worry is, I wanna give you a remedy.
[time=1618] I think it's to simply be still.
[time=1620] We don't do well with this, do we?
[time=1629] You guys are like, "Lunch is coming, pastor, let's go." But God says, "I want you to be still." And I wanna read to you two verses from Psalm 37 that God has just been pouring all over my heart and convicting me with all week, verse seven and eight, Psalm 37.
[time=1644] He says, "Be still." Say that with me.
[time=1646] "Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for Him." Fret not yourself over the one who prospers in his way, over a man who carries out evil devices.
[time=1656] This is, well, they're evils progressing, God.
[time=1660] Why are the bad people winning?
[time=1661] Why does evil seem to come out on top?
[time=1663] Why does this happen in our nation?
[time=1665] Why does that happen in my family?
[time=1666] Well, I just, he's stressing, you fret.
[time=1669] And he's saying, be still.
[time=1671] Wait patiently for the Lord.
[time=1672] Don't fret over those things.
[time=1674] He continues, "Refrain from anger and for sake wrath." Fret not yourself, it tends only to evil.
[time=1682] When I worry, I go to all kind of evil places.
[time=1685] The enemy wants to take me every single day and he wants to tear you apart with your worry this week.
[time=1691] So have an eternal perspective and trust the God who's bigger than it all.
[time=1695] Write this down.
[time=1696] Eternal perspective leads to enduring patience.
[time=1699] You need some patience, well, you need to really zoom in on your perspective.
[time=1704] And here's a great quote.
[time=1705] If you feel like you're waiting on God or you feel stuck in this moment, G. Campbell Morgan said this, "Waiting for God is not laziness.
[time=1712] Waiting for God is not going to sleep.
[time=1715] Waiting for God is not the abandonment of effort.
[time=1718] Waiting for God means first, activity under command.
[time=1722] Second, readiness for any new command that may come.
[time=1726] And third, the ability to do nothing until the command is given.
[time=1730] I don't know who that resonates with, but it caught me for sure this week.
[time=1735] And some of you feel impatient today because you're feeling just stuck.
[time=1739] You're waiting on God to answer a prayer, waiting on God to show you what's next.
[time=1741] You're waiting for God in some way and waiting is so difficult and it takes so much patience.
[time=1746] But today I want to remind you today that some of the times you feel, listen, the most unfruitful and the most stuck are the very times that God is using the most to cultivate future fruit.
[time=1759] The times you feel like I'm just stuck and I'm getting nowhere and I'm miserable and God's not doing this.
[time=1764] He's not doing that.
[time=1765] God has something so much bigger in mind than what you could imagine.
[time=1769] So stop being consumed in your perspective by what feels like stuckness.
[time=1774] I don't know if that's a word, but it is now or feeling unfruitful and realize, listen, some of the times, most of the time God is cultivating a future fruit that you can't even begin to imagine.
[time=1784] So don't give up.
[time=1787] Have an eternal perspective and bathe it all in prayer.
[time=1790] That's number five, prayer and patience.
[time=1792] Verse 17 gives us this picture, prayer and patience.
[time=1795] It's just reminded here, pray without ceasing.
[time=1797] Verse 17, pray without ceasing.
[time=1800] Here's what that doesn't mean.
[time=1801] It doesn't mean close your eyes on the road, bow your head, fold your hands.
[time=1806] Please don't do that.
[time=1807] The pastor did not tell you to do that today, especially in these crazy cold circumstances that exist on our roads.
[time=1814] It doesn't mean to close your eyes necessarily, but you know what it does mean?
[time=1817] It does mean to open your hearts.
[time=1823] It's this posture of prayer.
[time=1824] It's a focus of listening to God and looking for God.
[time=1828] I call it God winks.
[time=1830] Where it looked for God this week, listen for his voice.
[time=1832] It's a still small voice, but a lot of times we let it get drowned out by all of the noise.
[time=1837] So let prayer and patience go hand in hand where you posture yourself to hear.
[time=1841] You posture yourself to connect with and communicate with the creator of the universe.
[time=1846] Even when your head's not bowed, hands folded and eyes closed, let your heart be open.
[time=1851] Your ears attune to what God wants to say to you because I assure you he is speaking.
[time=1858] And when it comes with those difficult people, I want to challenge you to pray for them.
[time=1862] Back, yep, that person again.
[time=1864] When's the last time you prayed for them?
[time=1865] And no, it doesn't count if you went, God helped them because they just, they need you.
[time=1871] [AMEN] It's a start, if you've been doing that, some of you haven't even done that.
[time=1877] But it's a start, but earnestly pray for their good.
[time=1880] Earnestly pray for whoever that person is to hear the voice of Jesus in their life.
[time=1886] Dietrich Bonhoeffer said it this way about praying for others.
[time=1888] I can no longer condemn or hate a brother for whom I pray.
[time=1892] No matter how much trouble he causes me, I dare you to pray for that person this week.
[time=1897] I bet your posture, your perspective changes.
[time=1900] Couple of verses for you to encourage you.
[time=1902] Psalm 40 and verse one says, I waited patiently for the Lord.
[time=1905] He inclined to me and heard my cry.
[time=1907] Romans 12, 12, rejoice in hope.
[time=1910] Be patient in tribulation.
[time=1911] Be constant in prayer.
[time=1914] If you need more patience, you gotta start with prayer.
[time=1918] I wanna give you a question for you to ponder this week.
[time=1920] And it's how can I prioritize patience in my relationships this week?
[time=1926] How can you prioritize patience in those relationships?
[time=1931] I wanna ask you just to bow your heads and ponder that question.
[time=1933] And I wanna read over you a couple of verses.
[time=1935] James 1, 19 says, my dear brothers and sisters, take note of this.
[time=1938] Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to become angry.
[time=1943] This is my prayer over you and what God is prompting in your heart right now.
[time=1946] Colossians 1, 11, may you be strengthened with all power according to his glorious might for all endurance and patience with joy.
[time=1954] How can you prioritize patience in your relationships?
[time=1958] This week, believers that are in the room, what does that look like?
[time=1961] Who is that person?
[time=1962] What's the demonstration?
[time=1964] What's the call of God that he's stirring inside of you to display patience?
[time=1968] And some of you today, whether you're in the room or scattered around, you realize that God is so patient with you and you've been missing some things.
[time=1977] You've been basing your hope for salvation on your own works, your good works being better than this person or that person on yourself or on somebody else's faith perhaps.
[time=1988] But today you see that God in Jesus Christ was patient with you in sending his son, his only son and whoever believes in him, the word of God tells us that if we believe in our hearts, confess with our mouths that Jesus is Lord, we'll be saved.
[time=2004] And maybe you've been missing that simple truth.
[time=2005] It really is that simple.
[time=2007] So today I wanna challenge you to in your own words, through prayer, not some perfect set of words, but through your heart's posture coming to Jesus right now in this moment.
[time=2017] And just simply asking him to save you, to forgive you, to thank him for being patient with you and to trust in him that he died to pay a price for your sin you couldn't pay and he rose from the dead to win a victory you couldn't win.
[time=2030] And because he's won that victory, you can have salvation and he can look at you and we'll look at you in this moment and say, you are my son, you are my daughter.
[time=2042] I'm gonna give you a moment to respond right now and just to seek the Lord and reflect what he's teaching you.
