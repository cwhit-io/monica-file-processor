[time=0] I wanna talk to you today about this concept of contentment.
[time=4] I wanna preach to you about unenvious contentment.
[time=8] First Corinthians chapter 13, we'll look at the first four verses and then we'll be in Philippians chapter four, the same Paul wrote them both, unenvious contentment.
[time=18] And what we're learning from Paul is that in chapters 12 and 14, the context is spiritual gifts, but the meat of that sandwich is in chapter 13 and it's the unconditional self-sacrificing others first, always giving kind of love, that we unconditionally use the gifts that God has given us, use the unconditional love He's implanted within us through His Holy Spirit, the gifts that He provides to build up the body of Christ, to build others up and to display the graces of the Holy Spirit, especially in building upon unconditional love.
[time=53] So the context is spiritual gifts, but the content as it overflows is this supernatural grace and the use of the gifts that God has given to us.
[time=64] And so let's refresh where we've been in this series so far.
[time=67] I'll read the first four verses of 1 Corinthians chapter 13.
[time=71] I'll tell you what, you've been sitting for a while today, and those of who are willing are able, let's stand in honor of the reading of God's Word today.
[time=77] And you can do that at home on your screens.
[time=79] We're glad to have all of you here.
[time=80] If you're a guest with us, if you've tuned in, logged on to a screen for the first time or shown up in our building, we think you're in the right place because God's love is ready for you.
[time=90] 1 Corinthians chapter 13, let's read the first four verses.
[time=94] Paul says, "If I speak in tongues, in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging symbol.
[time=102] And if I have prophetic powers and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.
[time=113] If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing." And then last week we started with verse four, "Love is patient and kind." I'll talk to you last week about unagitated patience that overflows and kindness in your relationships.
[time=131] And here's our focus this week.
[time=132] Love is patient and kind.
[time=133] Love does not envy or boast.
[time=137] God, I pray over the reading of your Word that it truly would overflow into our lives, into our relationships, that we would unconditionally display who you are to the world around, as starting with those that you've implanted in our paths, that we would be intentional.
[time=150] May this word from you be a seed that sprouts forth a lot of fruit this week in our lives.
[time=156] In Jesus' name and all God's people said, Amen, you can have a seat at home in the building wherever you're at.
[time=161] So today here's what I want to do.
[time=162] I want us to zoom in on this phrase from verse four, "Love does not envy or boast." First Corinthians 13, "For love does not envy or boast." And I want to answer two questions today.
[time=174] The first one is this, "What destroys contentment?" What destroys contentment?
[time=180] The second question we'll answer in a moment is what builds contentment?
[time=184] So let's start with question number one.
[time=186] What destroys contentment?
[time=188] Number one, you can write it down as jealousy, jealousy.
[time=192] And in this verse, love does not envy or boast that original language for the word envy.
[time=197] Love does not envy is to be jealous, to strive for, to profess a passion in order to gain.
[time=204] It even carries this idea of covetousness.
[time=207] One of the 10 commandments, "Now shall not covet." We shouldn't covet our neighbor's stuff.
[time=212] We shouldn't covet our neighbor's spouses.
[time=214] But you get this picture of coveting and being jealous of and envying something to the point where you're taking steps to try to achieve it and attain it.
[time=223] That's what's met here by jealousy.
[time=225] It's a total different kind of jealousy than what we sing about when God jealously desires our affection and our focus, that we would have no other gods before him, no idolatry in our life.
[time=237] This is the negative other end of that spectrum where we get consumed by longing for something that somebody else might have that we think we need.
[time=247] A couple of ways you could say it is comparison.
[time=249] I've talked to you a lot about comparison.
[time=251] Comparison and covetousness always kill contentment.
[time=256] They always kill contentment.
[time=258] And we live in the age of social media and I love social media.
[time=261] It's a great tool when used appropriately.
[time=263] But a lot of times in our use of social media, it fosters this environment of comparison and coveting.
[time=271] You ever scroll before and be like, "Man, look at that picture of that beautiful male and here's my PB at Jay." Right?
[time=277] I wish I was eating out at Longhorn or whatever restaurant you wish you were at.
[time=282] Or you see this beautiful picture of this person's family and that day your family has been a wreck.
[time=288] Just a terrible mess and you covet and you compare.
[time=291] And it fosters this mindset of pulling you away from contentment, away from agape.
[time=296] That's the word love for love.
[time=298] It's this unconditional love and it always breeds contentment, which is joy and peace and rest.
[time=305] We've talked today about knowing that God is love.
[time=308] We've talked today about the fact that God loves you and we've talked today about the fact that God loves us in general and that we are to receive His love.
[time=317] And if you walk in that, you will find rest.
[time=320] That's the contentment we're talking about.
[time=321] But jealousy and covetousness and comparison will always kill that kind of contentment.
[time=326] And I wanna remind some of you who've been caught up perhaps in the social media scrolling and comparing mindset here of late.
[time=332] I wanna remind you that whatever picture it is that you're looking at, that was the highlight, but you didn't get to see the bloopers that happened before and after the highlight.
[time=342] And you know what I'm talking about 'cause you picked the 38 pictures that you went through and filter it out and make sure it looks as good as it can, but life full of bloopers, can I get an amen?
[time=352] And so quit getting consumed by other people's highlights.
[time=354] They have bloopers too.
[time=356] And I wanna prove it to you today.
[time=358] Every year around this time, I try to talk a little bit about Pinterest 'cause I just think it's awesome.
[time=363] Not the Pinterest part as much, but the Pinterest fails part.
[time=366] Oh yeah, those are where you see the difference in the highlights and the bloopers.
[time=370] And so back by popular demand, I've got three I wanna share with you.
[time=372] I think one of them is a brand new one.
[time=374] So check this one out.
[time=375] This is a picture you might see on Pinterest and it cute everybody say, oh.
[time=379] And now here's the blooper behind it, the reality that often comes.
[time=384] Couple more, here's another one that you might find on Pinterest.
[time=388] Isn't that beautiful?
[time=388] Don't you wish you could do that, but when you try a lot of times, it looks like this one.
[time=392] You're welcome.
[time=395] And back by popular demand, this next guy has been the most popular picture that I've shared with you.
[time=401] I believe maybe ever in his Elmo, check him out.
[time=403] Here's the Pinterest version.
[time=405] And here's the reality version.
[time=407] Not if you think that describes your life a lot of times.
[time=412] Some of you feel like the second Elmo in this place today.
[time=416] And I just did that to remind you today that you don't have to be consumed by what seems like highlights on the other end of a screen and become envious and jealous and comparing and covetous towards other people's stuff.
[time=429] And Proverbs chapter 14 and verse 30 were reminded of this fact from the NIV.
[time=434] It says, "A heart at peace," that's what I pray over you today.
[time=438] "A heart at peace gives life to the body, but envy rots the bones." Envy rots the bone.
[time=445] Some of you are rotting away and this is one of the culprits.
[time=449] And living with envy, jealousy, covetousness, comparison, it always, listen, it always leaves you wanting more.
[time=455] It's like getting a glass full of ocean water and drinking it over and over to quench your thirst.
[time=461] All it does is leave you thirsty for something else, some other unfulfilled part of what you're looking at in life.
[time=467] Jealousy, this envy that Paul writes about is number one thing that destroys contaminant.
[time=472] Number two is boasting.
[time=474] Boasting, love does not envy or boast.
[time=476] This original language for boasting is to brag, think too highly to be haughty or to praise oneself.
[time=484] And I just gotta shoot straight for just a minute.
[time=486] Some of you are wondering what's the biggest problem in your relationships and God sent me today to tell you it's you.
[time=493] You're too prideful.
[time=497] We as humans often make life about ourselves, don't we?
[time=501] I wanna raise my hand because I do this all the time.
[time=504] We're not naturally born with this disposition towards putting other people before us.
[time=509] We say what's in it for me.
[time=510] And we end up boasting about what we did.
[time=513] And the love of God, the unconditional agape love of God is not based upon what we do at all.
[time=519] If it was, it wouldn't exist and I would have nothing to preach to you today.
[time=524] And so may we not boast in anything we bring to the table.
[time=528] We just sang about it just a few moments ago.
[time=531] [MUSIC - 13 seconds]
[time=548] Let that be your prayer, let that be your anthem.
[time=551] I'm not gonna boast about anything I bring to the table only by what Jesus has done.
[time=557] His death and resurrection are why I can have contentment.
[time=560] And even though Chip sings it better than me, we can sing it all week together because it's true, it's our heart, and we're not gonna boast about anything except the death and the resurrection of Jesus and what it means in our lives.
[time=571] Paul says that this way, Galatians 6, 14, may I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world's been crucified to me.
[time=582] That's all your comparison problems, your jealousy problems, and I to the world.
[time=588] And I to the world, that means you're humble and you don't have anything to boast about except Jesus.
[time=591] But what better to boast about than Jesus Christ than eternal life, jealousy, boasting.
[time=596] I wanna give you number three, Paul gave us two in that simple phrase, but number three is complacency.
[time=602] And I talk about this because throughout scripture it's very clear that the opposite of what we often think is true when it comes to contentment.
[time=609] A lot of times we confuse contentment with complacency.
[time=613] We think that being content means being lazy.
[time=615] It means that I'm just hanging out, I'm just chilling.
[time=618] I'm just being lazy and hanging out, sitting around, getting fat and happy, trusting Jesus and sitting there doing nothing with it.
[time=627] But the overflowing love of God is quite the opposite of complacency.
[time=631] Contentment is not complacency.
[time=633] You wanna know what contentment is?
[time=634] Contentment is living in freedom.
[time=636] And living in freedom, the freedom that comes from the love of God that allows us to rest and be a peace, no matter what's going on around us, it takes a constant day by day, even moment to moment focus.
[time=650] Does that sound like complacency to you?
[time=652] Or does that sound like it's a lot of overwhelming work?
[time=654] And I'm glad that even when I fall short in that work, the love of God overflows through me and does the work in me and through me, even when I fall flat on my face.
[time=662] But contentment is quite the opposite of complacency.
[time=666] It's living in freedom.
[time=667] And perhaps the best Old Testament example I could give to kind of point to this today is the Israelites and their deliverance from slavery and bondage in Egypt.
[time=676] Read the book of Exodus and you can read that account.
[time=679] God delivered them from Egypt.
[time=682] He brought them out of Egypt.
[time=684] But then he started this process of getting Egypt and it's bondage out of them.
[time=689] Because it's real easy sometimes to enter into freedom, to say I believe in Jesus, I believe in being content in his name, but to live in that freedom is a lot more difficult than just to enter that freedom.
[time=701] And so in the wilderness, the Israelites were delivered from Egypt and it's bondage.
[time=708] But then God had to get the internal bondage and slavery out of them.
[time=713] The Egypt and its impacts on them, he had to bring out of them.
[time=716] And in the wilderness, they started whining to Moses their leader.
[time=720] When things got tough, they said, why did you lead us here?
[time=724] What's your problem?
[time=725] Why did you bring us here just to die?
[time=727] Let's just go back to Egypt.
[time=730] And man, that is so true of all of us spiritually and in our walks because a lot of times what we'll end up doing is going back to what is familiar, even though that familiar thing is dysfunctional and unhealthy.
[time=741] It's why we end up going back to abusive relationships sometimes or to old addictions or habits.
[time=747] It's not because we think it's good, it's not because we think that it's healthy, it's because it's familiar, it's predictable, it feels normal.
[time=754] And God, listen, God is so ready to blow up those familiar normals.
[time=758] He wants you to move from familiarity to freedom.
[time=762] And walking in freedom is a lot harder than entering in to it.
[time=767] And the Israelites and the wilderness, maybe you feel like them.
[time=770] You feel like, I just want to go back to the familiar old problems of my past and ways that I've mishandled my relationships because at least I know what I'm getting.
[time=779] No, God wants to do something new.
[time=782] He wants to set you free from whatever it is, this holding you back, this holding you in bondage in your past and your relationships right now.
[time=790] God wants you to be free from the need to acquire more stuff.
[time=794] God wants you to be free from worrying about what they think about you.
[time=798] God wants you to be free in every way from what others and their influence on you looks like because your eyes are so fixed on Jesus.
[time=805] You can't hear anything but his voice and what freedom and what peace and what joy and what contentment there is when we get set free in that way.
[time=815] But what will tear it down?
[time=817] Jealousy, we'll tear it down, this envy, this comparison, boasting, complacency, we'll tear it down.
[time=824] But God wants you to live in freedom.
[time=826] So let's answer this question.
[time=827] What builds contentment then?
[time=829] I want to give you four things.
[time=830] From the four verses we'll look at in Philippians chapter four.
[time=834] Same Paul who wrote that.
[time=835] I want to ask you to turn there with me.
[time=836] Philippians chapter four, we'll look at verses 10 through 13.
[time=841] Philippians four 13 is one of Paul's most quoted verses.
[time=844] It's definitely in his top five out of many that we often memorize and quote.
[time=848] But maybe the context is something a little bigger than you ever thought it was.
[time=852] It definitely has a lot to do with contentment.
[time=854] So as you turn there, Paul, get this.
[time=856] And we talked about prison a moment ago.
[time=858] Paul is writing to the church at Philippi in this book we call Philippians.
[time=863] He's writing from prison.
[time=865] He's at the, toward the end of his ministry, he doesn't know what's coming.
[time=868] He's got a trial pending of him that he doesn't know what the outcome will be and he really doesn't deserve the trial to begin with.
[time=875] He's at a very disappointed, difficult place in his life.
[time=879] And yet he's writing to the church about contentment.
[time=883] Really?
[time=884] Seems like quite the opposite, right?
[time=886] But here's what we're gonna learn from Paul.
[time=887] Write this down before I give you these four things.
[time=889] Contentment is more about what you pre than what you see.
[time=893] Let me explain.
[time=895] Contentment you're gonna find has way more to do with what you do pre the circumstances, pre the challenges, do ahead of time things.
[time=903] You determine and set forth before the bad stuff comes.
[time=907] So contentment's more about what you pre than what you see.
[time=910] That's the stuff that's already happening.
[time=912] There's some proactive things that Paul teaches us about contentment instead of living this reactive spiritual life that goes like this with the wind and the waves and with the circumstances of life.
[time=923] Contentment is less about your situations than it is the mindset.
[time=928] Paul uses the word mind or think or see over and over and over double digits in his writings.
[time=935] And here's just such a good example because your mindset matters.
[time=940] Philippians chapter four, let's read that together.
[time=942] Verses 10 through 13.
[time=945] Paul says, "I rejoiced in the Lord greatly.
[time=949] "Now at length you have revived, "you are concerned for me, "you are indeed concerned for me, "but you have no opportunity." Not that I'm speaking of being in need for I have learned, first of two times he says that, I've learned in whatever situation I am to be content.
[time=967] I know how to be brought low and I know how to abound in any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need.
[time=979] Here's that verse we were talking about.
[time=980] "I can do all things through him who strengthens me." Number one, how do we build contentment?
[time=988] Number one is pre-decide your rejoicing.
[time=991] It comes from a verse 10.
[time=993] Pre-decide your rejoicing.
[time=995] I often say it to you this way that to rejoice is a choice.
[time=1000] To rejoice is a choice.
[time=1001] So we've got to pre-decide our rejoicing.
[time=1004] Before the bad stuff comes, have you ever heard it said this way that you're either entering a really tough time in the middle of a really tough time or coming out of a really tough time?
[time=1014] Sometimes all three happen simultaneously.
[time=1016] Can I get an amen?
[time=1017] But Paul is reminding us in verse 10 that we're to pre-decide our rejoicing.
[time=1022] In verse 10, he says, "I rejoice in the Lord greatly." Remember, he's in prison.
[time=1027] He doesn't have a whole lot to rejoice about by our standards and definitions, but he says, "I rejoice greatly in the Lord." Now at length, you have revived your concern for me.
[time=1035] He's writing a thank you note to this church.
[time=1038] These people that have meant so much to him because they have brought forth a gift and concern for Paul.
[time=1043] So Paul, what we'll learn here is he's really good at writing theology.
[time=1047] Not if you agree.
[time=1049] If you didn't know, he wrote most of your New Testament.
[time=1050] I'd say he did pretty good.
[time=1051] He made the Bible.
[time=1052] I didn't quite make that.
[time=1053] God, I get to read it and preach it.
[time=1054] So he's good at that.
[time=1055] But by our standards, his giftedness towards writing, thank you notes, not so good.
[time=1061] Because really in verse 10, what he says is, "I rejoice greatly in the Lord because of this gift that now we read at length.
[time=1068] Some virgins might even say at last." So I will finally, I thought you forgot about me, but I'm glad you finally showed up.
[time=1075] How's that for an opening line of a thank you note?
[time=1077] That's really how Paul starts this whole journey.
[time=1080] And he reminds us today of what it looks like to not have, listen, you're rejoicing tied to what people do or do not do.
[time=1088] He's disappointed here.
[time=1090] He's in prison.
[time=1091] Obviously he feels at some level they had forgotten some things about him.
[time=1094] 'Cause now at last you have remembered to be concerned for me and to bless me and to walk with me.
[time=1100] This kind of contempt is less of a disposition you're born with than it is a decision that you make.
[time=1105] That's the kind of rejoicing that Paul is teaching us about.
[time=1108] And Paul also wrote in Philippians 4 for a few verses earlier.
[time=1112] He said, "Rejoice in the Lord always." How much is that?
[time=1116] Always.
[time=1117] And again, I say rejoice.
[time=1119] Paul's reminding the church to rejoice.
[time=1121] And so much of what we do on Sunday mornings with services while we gather is we want to remind you to rejoice.
[time=1128] We wanna celebrate.
[time=1129] That's why we praise, why we open our hands.
[time=1131] That's why we lift our hands.
[time=1133] That's why we worship.
[time=1134] That's why we read the words so that we remember to rejoice but real spiritual maturity.
[time=1139] Real spiritual maturity.
[time=1140] The kind Paul's talking about depth of contentment and peace comes when you don't even have to be reminded to rejoice.
[time=1146] It's just who you are.
[time=1148] And that's the kind of disposition that Paul is teaching us about when he says rejoice in the Lord always.
[time=1154] And again, I say rejoice.
[time=1156] I love the second part of verse 10 too because another key to remembering to rejoice is refusing to resent.
[time=1163] You should write that down.
[time=1164] If you wanna remember to rejoice, you've got to refuse to resent.
[time=1169] Again, obviously Paul felt like they had maybe forgotten about him in some way 'cause he says at length, at last you've revived your concern for me but here's what he says.
[time=1177] He could have presented him.
[time=1179] He could have gotten upset.
[time=1180] Some of you are stuck in resentment and we're gonna look at this so much more deeply in this series a little later.
[time=1185] But some of you are bound.
[time=1186] Your chains of bondage like the Israelites in Egypt is resentment and you're bound by that resentment.
[time=1192] He could have resented them but instead here's what he said.
[time=1195] He said you are indeed concerned for me.
[time=1197] He believed the best.
[time=1198] I know you were really concerned but you just didn't have an opportunity.
[time=1202] Do you do that in your relationships?
[time=1203] Listen, when what you expected they would do doesn't line up with what you experienced that they did.
[time=1209] Some of you expected your husbands to take out the trash but your experience is the whole house stinks.
[time=1215] Some of you expected your kids to clean their room but your experience is that it looks 10 times worse than the last time.
[time=1222] Some of you expected one thing and got another Paul in the same way shows us what to do when that gap exists.
[time=1228] We can fill it with suspicion.
[time=1230] We can fill it with negative critical spirits.
[time=1232] This is true in marriages.
[time=1233] This is true in parenting.
[time=1235] This is true in church leadership relationships.
[time=1238] Sometimes we live in a culture where we're so quick to throw stones.
[time=1242] We are so quick to jump to the negative, to jump to these critically minded spirits of tearing down.
[time=1248] But God through Paul is showing us what it looks like and pre-decide our rejoicing, refusing to resent and believe the best.
[time=1255] That doesn't mean you're gonna get the best.
[time=1257] It means that even when those people fail you, because listen, those people that are so frustrating to you right now, they are human and they're gonna sin.
[time=1266] I as your pastor am human.
[time=1269] I will let you down.
[time=1270] That's not what Paul's saying that they'll never let you down.
[time=1273] No, he's saying when they do, you'd refuse to resent.
[time=1277] You remember to rejoice because you pre-decided to do so before the events even occurred.
[time=1283] So Paul's teaching us about it.
[time=1285] That's some good relationship stuff that'll help us in our life.
[time=1288] You could write it this way.
[time=1289] That contentment is not the reception of what I want, what I expected.
[time=1294] Contentment's not the reception of what I want.
[time=1296] It's the recognition of how much I already have.
[time=1301] I believe this week God will show you how much you have to rejoice over if you ask him.
[time=1305] Paul could have resented, but instead he believed the best.
[time=1308] He was disappointed.
[time=1309] And Paul teaches us a lot about disappointment.
[time=1311] Some of you feel disappointed today.
[time=1314] If you feel disappointed, what Paul teaches us in this passage, because he's living disappointment, he's in prison awaiting a trial he didn't deserve.
[time=1321] He feels let down by people.
[time=1322] There's no telling what else he feels disappointed about.
[time=1325] Paul teaches us that you can be disappointed and still be content at the same time.
[time=1332] Disappointment does not have to define you.
[time=1337] That's the beauty of contentment.
[time=1338] That's hard to live out.
[time=1340] But what a beautiful picture of what Paul shows us.
[time=1342] So we've got to pre-decide our rejoicing.
[time=1344] Number two comes from verse 11.
[time=1346] And it's to pre-fill our heart.
[time=1349] Pre-fill our heart.
[time=1352] Paul in verse 11, we usually skip to the second part of verse 11, but I want to really hone in on the first.
[time=1357] He says, not that I am speaking of being in need.
[time=1360] He's like, no, I was really okay.
[time=1362] Like, wait a minute, you're really okay.
[time=1363] You're in prison and people are forgetting about you and you're not in need.
[time=1367] I think that's the epitome of need by our standards, right?
[time=1370] But Paul says, not that I'm speaking of being in need.
[time=1373] For I have learned, by the way, I love Paul says learned in past tense.
[time=1378] For me, it is definitely an ING.
[time=1381] I haven't learned contentment, how about you?
[time=1384] I'm learning contentment.
[time=1385] But Paul, he wrote part of the Bible.
[time=1387] He can say that, not me.
[time=1389] But he says that for the first time, I've learned in whatever situation I am to be content.
[time=1394] But he starts with this idea of being filled.
[time=1396] Notice that he says, not that I'm speaking of being in need.
[time=1400] How is that possible for somebody like Paul?
[time=1402] He had pre-filled his heart.
[time=1405] Paul, here's what Paul's saying in our vernacular.
[time=1407] He's saying, hey, I got your gift.
[time=1410] I'm really grateful for it, but really I was already good 'cause I have God.
[time=1415] I needed it.
[time=1416] I'm glad to receive it, but either way, I was good.
[time=1418] Look at your neighbor, whether at home or in the building.
[time=1420] Look at him and say, I was already good.
[time=1422] Tell him, I was already good.
[time=1424] What an anthem.
[time=1426] What an anthem of contentment.
[time=1429] Have you ever gone to somebody's house and you don't know about their culinary abilities quite yet?
[time=1435] And maybe you even have an inkling that maybe it's not gonna be so good.
[time=1439] And so you eat a snack before you go.
[time=1441] Some of you are like, did you do that in my house?
[time=1444] It could be.
[time=1447] You pre-eat.
[time=1449] You pre-eat before you go in case the food is bad 'cause you don't know.
[time=1453] They may burn the turkey.
[time=1455] It may taste terrible.
[time=1456] You may feed it to the dog under the table, right?
[time=1459] So you pre-eat.
[time=1460] Listen, I came to tell you today, this is why when you come to church, you gotta come to church full.
[time=1465] That means no matter who preaches that day, that means no matter what the worship sounds like, what songs were chosen, what the style of the music was, what the style of preaching is, you come and you're blessed because you pre-decided to rejoice and you have pre-filled your heart so we come to church together together and we can come saying, I already ate.
[time=1486] May you live your life that way, not just for Sundays, but for the circumstances that are gonna come on Monday and Tuesday, when they come.
[time=1495] Don't act surprised that you have a bad day.
[time=1497] Say, you know what, it came, but I already ate.
[time=1500] I pre-filled my heart.
[time=1502] I've pre-decided to rejoice.
[time=1504] Whatever comes my way today, I'm already for.
[time=1510] Paul says, not, not that I am speaking of being the need, I already ate, I'm already full.
[time=1517] We are called to pre-fill our heart.
[time=1519] Paul was pre-filled to the point that his contentment, it wasn't get this, wasn't tied to their gifts.
[time=1526] Sometimes our contentment gets tied to what another person does or doesn't do.
[time=1530] This kind of contentment comes where, you know what, when they let me down and they will, when it happens, my contentment isn't tied to my spouse, to my kids, to my boss, to my career, even to my church leaders or any of those things.
[time=1545] My contentment is tied to Christ and Christ alone.
[time=1549] That's the only way you can have a pre-filled heart like Paul demonstrates for us.
[time=1555] Pre-fill your heart and because Paul was full, he was full-filled to the point that he had learned to be content.
[time=1561] And then it overflowed into verse 12, which is number three today, I wanna share with you preview your circumstances.
[time=1568] Write that down, preview your circumstances.
[time=1571] That'll build contentment.
[time=1573] And verse 12, Paul says, I know how to be brought low and I know how to abound.
[time=1577] In any and every circumstance I have learned, again, I'm the ING, but he learned it.
[time=1583] The secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need.
[time=1588] How many of you remember back in the old days when we used to go to movie theaters?
[time=1592] You remember those days?
[time=1594] The first 15 to 20 minutes are typically the previews, right?
[time=1598] The previews where they try to hook you to another movie before you watch the movie that you went there for.
[time=1602] And if you're like me, maybe you show up a little late and you're that annoying person that goes across when the lights have already come down 'cause you just wanna skip the previews.
[time=1609] I came to tell you today, you can skip those kind of previews, but the kind of preview Paul's talking about today, the predetermined view and perspective of your circumstances before they come, you can't skip those previews.
[time=1622] God has called you to preview your circumstances.
[time=1626] No matter whether it's good or it's bad, whether I'm in poverty or I've got an abundance of wealth available to me.
[time=1632] I've decided I'm gonna view it all through the lens of God because it came from him anyway.
[time=1638] And I trust my trustworthy God.
[time=1640] I preview the circumstance even before it comes to pass.
[time=1645] That's what Paul is talking about.
[time=1647] I pray that you can live your life in that kind of a way.
[time=1650] The second time he says I've learned.
[time=1652] And when we learned those kind of things, we can say things like hey, my situation is not gonna dictate my satisfaction.
[time=1659] My circumstance is not going to dictate my contentment.
[time=1663] In any and every circumstance, Paul says at the end of verse 12, here's the secret.
[time=1667] He said here's the secret to having plenty and hunger, abundance and need.
[time=1672] Here's the secret to contentment is what Paul says there at the end of verse 12.
[time=1676] And at least a verse 13.
[time=1678] And number four is this, pre-select your source.
[time=1682] Here's the secret to contentment, Paul saying, pre-select your source, write this down.
[time=1686] The secret is the source.
[time=1688] Some of you have been looking to all the wrong sources to fulfill you and give you contentment.
[time=1693] We're looking at relationships in a big picture way in this series and some of you have hung your hat on being fulfilled by relationships more than by the source and the giver of that relationship to begin with.
[time=1705] And then when they let you down, you're down.
[time=1708] You're down for the count.
[time=1709] You're not fulfilled, you're not at rest and at peace and content.
[time=1713] God wants you to look to him as the source.
[time=1716] Verse 13 is the picture of that.
[time=1717] I can do all things through Christ in him who gives me strength.
[time=1723] This is the verse that's plastered with every Christian weight room across the globe, right?
[time=1728] And so it should be, it's a good thing.
[time=1730] You know, I can do all things.
[time=1733] I didn't get parallel to all things through Christ who gives me strength.
[time=1736] That's a good thing.
[time=1737] But Paul's meaning of that verse.
[time=1739] Now you see the context is contentment.
[time=1742] Paul's really saying in any circumstances, I can go through anything no matter what life throws at me with contentment because of Christ who gives me strength.
[time=1753] And if you replace Christ in that verse with anything but Christ, here's what happens.
[time=1758] I can do all things through my bank account that gives me strength.
[time=1764] It fails.
[time=1765] I can do all things through this amazing spouse, God gave me this awesome relationship that gives me strength and it fails.
[time=1773] I can do all things because of my new title in my career path, which gives me strength and it fails.
[time=1781] No, I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength.
[time=1788] Maybe you need to pre-select your source.
[time=1791] You're tapping into sources that are going to run dry.
[time=1794] They're gonna be like that ocean water that leaves you thirsty for more no matter what.
[time=1798] And Paul, get this, God is using a man in chains to teach us about freedom that comes from contentment.
[time=1806] Paul, who was in chains, lived in and walked in freedom better than a lot of us who are experiencing freedoms that Paul never had in his entire life.
[time=1815] And boy, I wanna learn from it.
[time=1817] I wanna take that into my life.
[time=1819] So what source have you been relying on?
[time=1823] Maybe you think the server for the food.
[time=1825] We always thank God for our food in our house.
[time=1827] Do you do that?
[time=1828] We thank God 'cause it came from him.
[time=1829] This is a meal from God, we do that every time.
[time=1832] And usually I'll add to that and we thank mom for putting it together 'cause she's such a great cook.
[time=1837] And then when we go out to eat and I get to buy it, I remember one time one of the kids said, well, we should think our waiter 'cause he brought it.
[time=1845] And I reminded him real quick, look, they brought it, but I bought it.
[time=1848] But listen, no matter what your food comes from, where it comes from every good and perfect gift comes from God.
[time=1858] He alone is our source.
[time=1860] And verse 19 of Philippians four, put it on the screen for you.
[time=1863] I wanna read this to you.
[time=1864] Philippians 4 19, Paul concludes this after talking a little more to this church.
[time=1868] And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
[time=1876] We gotta pre-select our source and tap into him every single day.
[time=1880] Paul at the beginning of this passage said, I rejoice in the Lord because of your gift.
[time=1885] They gave the gift, but he rejoiced in the Lord because he trusts him and him alone as his source.
[time=1891] Proverbs chapter 19 and verse 23, wanna read this to you, says, the fear of the Lord leads to life.
[time=1900] Then one rests content.
[time=1904] Rest content, this is my prayer for you.
[time=1906] The fear of the Lord leads to life.
[time=1907] Then one rests content untouched by trouble.
[time=1912] Here's what that verse doesn't mean.
[time=1913] It doesn't mean your life will be untouched by trouble.
[time=1916] It doesn't mean troubles won't come.
[time=1917] Jesus himself said, hey, guess what?
[time=1919] This world's gonna be filled with tribulation but take heart.
[time=1922] What he's saying here is that your contentment, your rest in that contentment will be untouched no matter what trouble does come your way.
[time=1930] I pray you can rest in that kind of contentment this week.
[time=1934] And so I'll give you a question you can ponder this week as we leave this place.
[time=1937] And the question is this, how can I prepare?
[time=1940] How can I prepare to be content in my current circumstances?
[time=1944] And as you think of that question and how you can live it out, how you can answer it, I'm gonna ask you just to bow your heads and just reflect for a moment on what God is teaching.
[time=1952] I believe he's showing you some amazing things, doing some great things in you.
[time=1956] And I wanna give you a second to respond to what God is teaching you.
[time=1959] Believers, you're praying for which of those pre-pairing steps that God wants you to proactively engage with today.
[time=1966] And next I wanna talk to those of you who are in the building at home, on your screens, wherever you are, who may say, I've really understood the gospel that while I'm still a center, Christ died for me.
[time=1977] It's the unconditional love of God and I see it in a way, I've never seen it before.
[time=1981] Today I want you to know that the gospel is true and it applies to you.
[time=1985] Jesus died to pay a price for your sin you could never pay.
[time=1988] He rose from the grave, defeated death hell in the grave so that you could live in his victory over sin.
[time=1995] The sin that separates you from God, he overcame it.
[time=1998] He died, he rose again, and your role in this is to pause, to reflect, to receive that.
[time=2005] We've talked about how God is love, he loves us, but he loves you to receive his love.
[time=2011] Stick out your hands today and say, God, I receive your love, your salvation, because I realize for the first time I recognize it fully that I could never achieve it on my own.
[time=2020] I'm stopping now, trusting in me, my works or anything else.
[time=2025] I trust in Jesus and Jesus alone for salvation and you shall be saved.
[time=2030] Yep, it is that simple, that is the gospel.
[time=2033] Wherever you're at, would you cry out to Jesus right now?
[time=2035] He's gonna meet you right where you are.
