[time=1] So the newest app on my telephone is called the RunKeeper app.
[time=6] Yes, skinny people need to exercise too.
[time=11] And so I had been running for like a couple, every other day for a couple of years, and then I downloaded this app 'cause I thought, "Man, it'll really help me keep track of things like how often do I do it, how far did I go, maybe I need to step it up, New Year's resolution." So I put in my knockoff earbuds 'cause who has cash to pay for earbuds?
[time=33] And I put in my new app and I start jogging, and about five minutes into it, I wasn't expecting this, but the app takes over my podcast and announces something to me.
[time=45] And it's this girl voice and it's super annoying and she's like, "Time, five minutes, distance, 1.025, whatever, kilometers." And I was like, "Oh, that was kind of annoying, so I just keep jogging on." And then she did it again at 10 minutes, and then again at 15 minutes, and I started to realize, "Wow, I'm actually making really bad time here." I thought, "I was doing pretty good the first five minutes and then discover at 15 that I'm slowing down." And then I actually get back to my house and she didn't say 30 minutes yet, and I realized I didn't even run 30 minutes yet, so I actually had to run past my house in order for her to say, "Time, 30 minutes." And so what I'm discovering is that actually, this information is helping me change my behavior.
[time=93] And downloading this RunKeeper app is impacting how fast I run, how far past my house I run, and this little app actually became like a measuring rod for my running.
[time=107] A plumb line for my running was running too fast, too slow.
[time=112] It became like a lamp into my feet and a light into my path, and this information became really valuable because it impacted what I was doing.
[time=121] And today we're talking about 1 Corinthians 13,
[time=127] the love chapter.
[time=129] And like the RunKeeper app, 1 Corinthians 13, can be a plumb line of sorts for us, a measuring rod of sorts for us, because come on, everybody knows how to love.
[time=138] It's just like this emotion that we feel and we're jogging along in love and thinking, "I'm fine, right?" Like, "I love people, I would never heard anyone." And then we read the plumb line of 1 Corinthians 13, and 1 Corinthians 13 says, "Love is not rude." Okay, so I love people, but man, when they get on my nerves, I can be a little bit rude to them, right?
[time=162] And we get corrected by 1 Corinthians 13.
[time=166] Or, "Sure, I love my wife, I would never insult her publicly." But would I be irritated with her?
[time=173] And 1 Corinthians 13 says, "Love is not irritable." Sure, I love my kids.
[time=177] I would never hold them back from all their dreams, but would I be impatient with them?
[time=183] Like when they're not putting their shoes on, again, and we're trying to get out of the door.
[time=188] I have five kids, I do with this every day.
[time=190] Sure, I love my classmates, sure, I love my coworkers.
[time=194] I would never judge them.
[time=196] It's not politically correct to judge them.
[time=199] But when we get together on Monday and hear about all the horrible things that they did over the weekend, I kind of snicker along with them.
[time=205] And 1 Corinthians 13 says, "That's not what love does.
[time=208] "It doesn't rejoice with wrongdoing." And like a plumb line, and like the runkeeper app, 1 Corinthians 13 can help us adjust our pace and help us tweak our definition of love and how we love others.
[time=223] So far, if you've been tracking with the series, we've done, love is undistracted, love is un-agitated, love is un-envious.
[time=232] And then today they gave me a made-up word and we're gonna talk about how love is un-arragant.
[time=238] But I kind of like it 'cause new words help us remember things.
[time=243] So actually, I have a really short passage for us today.
[time=246] It's like the end verse four and the beginning of first five and it's just two things.
[time=249] You know what?
[time=250] Love is not arrogant, love is not rude.
[time=256] And that's what we're gonna talk about today.
[time=258] Love is not arrogant, love is not rude.
[time=261] I think one of the best ways for an American guy like me to learn how arrogant he is and how rude he is is to get plopped in a foreign country for seven years and learn how to live with people that are oh so different than he is.
[time=274] And that's exactly what happened to me.
[time=276] Kevin mentioned it earlier, my wife and I and our kids we've been working with Josiah Venture for the last seven years in Poland.
[time=285] And you know, I didn't really know what I was getting myself into as far as differences were concerned.
[time=290] Europe, America, it's similar, right?
[time=294] No, like everything is different in Poland, everything.
[time=297] The size of the paper is different, the size of the mattresses are different, the size of everything's different, everything's different.
[time=303] And so I get plopped in there and I start to learn about how arrogant I am at my core and how arrogantly I approach my way of life and it becomes humbling and it becomes humiliating at times.
[time=318] I've got loads of stories, but I'm not going to share all of them with you.
[time=321] First, a quick definition of arrogance.
[time=324] Arigance, one definition is this showing an offensive attitude of superiority.
[time=330] I was thinking you were kind of better than or my way is better than one way this got expressed really quickly seven years ago.
[time=339] You know, I'm kind of an eloquent person.
[time=342] I know how to say things.
[time=343] You've already laughed a little bit at my delivery methods.
[time=346] I know how to do that.
[time=347] Then I landed in Poland.
[time=350] I can't even talk to people and I get silenced and my lips get sealed.
[time=354] Why?
[time=355] 'Cause I can't speak Polish and I'm in language class and I can't even say the names of all the pieces of clothing on my body.
[time=362] Never mind have a conversation.
[time=363] Never mind training to quip leaders like I moved there to do, humbling experience.
[time=370] Then I finally do get a grasp on the language and I tell you every time I open my mouth and mess something up.
[time=376] Some of my stories are so embarrassing that I can't even say them in church.
[time=379] 'Cause you'd be so offended by the things that I've accidentally said in Polish.
[time=384] But what does that do that causes me to humbly go to other people all the time?
[time=387] Hey, will you help me?
[time=389] Hey, will you check this for me?
[time=391] Hey, will you say it for me instead of me?
[time=393] And I learned how to humble myself and not be arrogant in my approach to ministry.
[time=398] Another thing, you know, Black Hawk, hello, 11 years here.
[time=401] This is an established church, a building, a ministry in town, effective leadership going on at every level in good ministry success.
[time=412] When we go to our Polish church, I knew it would be small and it was.
[time=415] We didn't have our own building and we were unstable.
[time=418] But you know what I didn't expect?
[time=420] About a year after we were there, that little church as it was, finds itself in a split, not a two-way split, but a three-way split.
[time=429] And the very thing we came to serve disintegrated before our eyes, two weeks before we launched our music outreach ministry.
[time=436] Ugh.
[time=438] And I mean to see that I was a little arrogant in my approach to ministry success.
[time=445] Arrogance, one piece of it.
[time=448] Rudness is another.
[time=449] What does rudeness mean?
[time=450] Rudness definition is this, a display of disrespect by not complying with the social norms or the etiquette of a group.
[time=459] Said another way, like rudeness is a continuum of sorts
[time=467] where what's okay in one setting is not okay in the next setting.
[time=472] If you went to a basketball game recently, you know what it's like there.
[time=476] Shouting, cheering, name calling from time to time.
[time=480] If you bring that social etiquette around the dinner table, your mom and dad are not gonna be happy with you, right?
[time=487] 'Cause that's not appropriate.
[time=488] It's the right behavior at the wrong time.
[time=491] And that's like rudeness.
[time=492] And so rudeness takes a little bit of study.
[time=494] You gotta figure out what's the situation.
[time=497] What's called for here?
[time=498] We do that all the time in Poland.
[time=500] So one thing that's really important is that you understand the social construct in order to apply the behavior.
[time=506] So when I go to the grocery store in Poland, and somebody's in front of me looking at the canned peaches, but I need to buy canned peaches, it's really okay in that cultural construct to just kind of bump the back of their ankles with my shopping cart to let them know that I'd actually like to look at those canned peaches too.
[time=524] How did I learn that?
[time=525] Got my ankles bumped a few times in Poland because somebody wanted to look at those canned peaches.
[time=531] And for that situation, it's okay.
[time=534] I won't do it at Walmart in Kroger, but when I'm in Poland, I bump them all the time.
[time=539] Get out of my way.
[time=541] I also learned in Poland that when my family, who loves to be together in chat and talk and share stories, when we go into the city bus or the tram, we can't do that.
[time=552] Why? Because there's 93 other people on the bus that aren't making a sound.
[time=557] And if we start chatting about our day in a foreign language to them, we all of a sudden become very rude.
[time=563] And so we have to get around the bus, be quiet.
[time=567] And we have to adjust our behavior according to the cultural construct.
[time=572] And so I think as Christians, it's really important for us to get good at that.
[time=576] Analyzing, what's appropriate here?
[time=578] What should I do?
[time=579] Why? 'Cause we're supposed to love.
[time=581] And love is not arrogant.
[time=583] And love is not rude.
[time=584] Okay, to emphasize what we should be doing, I've got this illustration and I need a couple of volunteers to pull it off.
[time=594] And I know some of you don't have the spiritual gift of volunteering in public, but if any of you do this morning, I need two people to come up on stage, it's gonna last about one minute.
[time=602] You have to answer a simple question, and I promise it won't hurt.
[time=606] And if nobody helps me, I can't finish the message.
[time=610] Could you come up, please?
[time=611] It'd be so easy.
[time=612] Grab somebody on your way, because nobody else is volunteering.
[time=616] Oh, here, you got a second one.
[time=620] Rod, sit down, you just keep Susie warm.
[time=622] Okay, we already got two people.
[time=624] (laughs) Come on, come on, come on.
[time=627] Okay, I promise it's gonna be so easy.
[time=629] And you guys can just sit here, and there, this is a visual aid that we learned in missionary training.
[time=637] Have a seat, guys.
[time=638] Missionary training out in Colorado.
[time=639] That was like eight years ago, and I tell you, I think about this all the time.
[time=644] It's so powerful and so helpful.
[time=645] First of all, we're gonna get your names.
[time=647] I already know your name, I didn't know it was you.
[time=649] What's your name?
[time=650] Scott.
[time=651] Hi, Scott.
[time=652] I haven't seen you in a long time.
[time=653] We should mask up.
[time=654] This is so important.
[time=658] (audience chattering) Nice, you got one?
[time=661] Good.
[time=662] 2021, here we go.
[time=664] Let's do this again.
[time=665] They can edit it later, right?
[time=666] The unmasked diversion.
[time=668] Okay.
[time=668] (audience chattering) Oh, livestream.
[time=670] What's your name?
[time=672] Scott Townsend.
[time=674] Okay, my name's Corbin.
[time=675] What's your name?
[time=676] Jermaine.
[time=676] Jermaine, nice to meet you.
[time=678] Okay, so, Scott and Jermaine are gonna help me illustrate this point.
[time=681] All they have to do is answer one question, and the question is, where is the table?
[time=686] Okay.
[time=687] Smart guys, I think they're gonna figure it out.
[time=689] So, let's start with Scott.
[time=690] Scott, where is the table?
[time=692] Behind Jermaine.
[time=693] You're messing me up already.
[time=695] Just say, where's the table?
[time=698] In front of me?
[time=700] Excellent.
[time=701] Okay, another, Jermaine, where's the table?
[time=704] Behind me.
[time=706] Excellent.
[time=707] So, Scott sees the table, Jermaine sees the table.
[time=711] Who's right?
[time=712] Scott, where's the table?
[time=714] Behind Jermaine.
[time=715] Scott, Jermaine, where's the table?
[time=719] Behind me.
[time=720] Excellent.
[time=721] So, they don't see eye to eye.
[time=722] You're messing this all up for me.
[time=724] Okay.
[time=725] So, they don't see eye to eye.
[time=727] And actually, that's okay for a while, especially if they don't spend a lot of time together.
[time=731] But if they start to hang out all the time, and they keep talking about the table, they can get a little irritated.
[time=735] They can get a little arrogant.
[time=737] They can get a little rude.
[time=738] It couldn't even come to a point where Scott starts talking to people about Jermaine, and he's like, you wouldn't believe this guy.
[time=743] He thinks the table is behind him.
[time=745] Or Jermaine could start talking about Scott and badmouling him.
[time=748] He'd be like, he thinks it's in front of him.
[time=750] It's totally behind.
[time=751] Don't you see life the way I see it?
[time=753] And if you would, Jermaine, stand up.
[time=756] The only way these guys will agree, totally, and you can have a seat again, is if this really important moment happens, where one of them, it doesn't have to be Jermaine, where one of them moves their chair to a different spot, and now we ask them the same question.
[time=775] Don't miss it.
[time=776] Okay, Jermaine, where's the table?
[time=779] - It's in front of me.
[time=781] - Excellent, Scott, where's the table?
[time=783] - It is in front of me.
[time=784] - Thank you, Scott.
[time=785] Okay, let's give them a hand.
[time=787] I appreciate you guys.
[time=788] So, so, for me, this was really important,
[time=797] because to me, it's the essence of humility, right?
[time=802] Coming to a point where you're willing to say, all right, I'll move my chair.
[time=806] I'll move my chair beside you to find out, what's life like for you?
[time=810] Why do you see it that way?
[time=812] 'Cause I don't see it that way.
[time=813] When we don't see eye to eye, we actually have a natural tendency to become really hasty and quick to judge.
[time=821] But the Bible says, in James 119, be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry.
[time=832] When we don't see eye to eye, we like to huddle up with people just like me, and say, oh, you're another chair in front of me, person.
[time=840] Let's hang out together.
[time=841] But the Bible says, actually Paul says, first Corinthians nine, you should read the whole thing, but specifically in 919, he says, "I'm so free in Christ that I become a slave to all "that I might win some." He's not huddling up with people like him.
[time=860] He's going to people who are very different.
[time=863] When we don't see eye to eye, we wanna get stubborn and we prove our case to everybody around that table is not behind him.
[time=871] But Jesus says, in Matthew seven, verse two, it's a warning and he says, "Be careful with the measure you use, "it will be measured to you." When we don't see eye to eye, we become arrogant, we become rude.
[time=891] I have to tell you this story about my son Roman.
[time=895] We've got all girls and one boy, Roman's eight, and he and I were excited just before Christmas when the snow fell up in Michigan, we were at my in-laws.
[time=904] They live out in the country and so we grab the sleds and we go out in the country how the road is a little bit higher than your yard and so we're sledding down into the yard.
[time=913] It's really fun.
[time=914] And we're up by the road and know how it is out in the country.
[time=917] Every once in a while, a car drives by, and so this car comes and wave at the person, the car, they wave back and my son whips his head around and he's like, "Dad, what are you doing?
[time=929] "We don't know those people." And I'm almost like Roman, we're in the Midwest and you have to wave at people to show that you're not crazy or it's psycho.
[time=938] You can show your friendliness, okay?
[time=940] And he looks at me with his face and I wrote it down so I could quote it, he says, "Dad, in Poland, "we just stare at strangers in frown.
[time=948] "It shows respect." And so from the perspective of an eight year old, he reminded me of one of the biggest move your chair moments I had in my initial time in Poland.
[time=963] This was so hard for me that strangers were rude and unkind to each other.
[time=968] And I started to think, "Well, Lord, "you sent me to Poland just so I can teach them how to wave "and say hello, how are you?" That's one of my callings, okay?
[time=977] 'Cause these people just don't do that.
[time=978] It's not in their culture.
[time=980] And so it's really hard for me because I saw friendliness to strangers from my Midwest point of view and I was like, "That's how you greet strangers." And it's not that Polish people are unkind 'cause I would see them at church.
[time=994] They would greet each other warmly.
[time=997] They'd come to our fusion rehearsals and hug and hey, it's so good to see you.
[time=1002] They're really warm, but those same people would then go out to the bus stop and ignore everybody.
[time=1009] And in Poland, there's just hundreds of people on the street and so it was just really hard for me.
[time=1014] And I ended up getting pretty stubborn about it and just be like, "Poles are not friendly to strangers.
[time=1018] "They're just not.
[time=1019] "Some days I would try to change it.
[time=1021] "Some days I would try to just become like it, "but it was really frustrated and it was kind of boiling "under the surface for about a year and a half." That's a little bit embarrassing than you have.
[time=1034] And just keep saying, they're unkind of strangers.
[time=1036] What happened at a year and a half?
[time=1038] Year and a half into it, I go to the barbershop, I'd been there many times, I sit in my chair, they're clipping my hair.
[time=1042] The guy next to me finishes before I'm done and he leaves.
[time=1047] But the three guys behind me waiting for their turn, they all one by one say, "Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye." And I had this moment of conviction.
[time=1063] I was like, "They're friendly to strangers." It seemed so dumb, but I was like, "Hi."
[time=1071] I said, "They weren't." And I was wrong for a year and a half.
[time=1074] I said, "They don't like strangers.
[time=1076] "They'll never meet new people." But you know what they did?
[time=1079] They didn't say, "Hi to strangers." They said, "Goodbye to strangers." And I just couldn't see it for their point of view for like a really long time.
[time=1088] And so it was a big deal for me and my heart personally to say like, "Wow, I was judging on something stupid, "really small." And I was so judgy that I got blind and I couldn't even see that I was so wrong that they actually were friendly, just not in a way that I could see it.
[time=1108] Anyway, so now one of my favorite things to do in Poland is say, "Goodbye to everybody." As you can imagine, this concept isn't just true
[time=1118] when you go to a different country.
[time=1120] This concept is true everywhere.
[time=1123] I mean, how often do we not see eye to eye with others?
[time=1126] Maybe you have a roommate that loves to stay up all night in party and then the other roommate is a morning person, but they're both really just asking like, "When do I get my sleep?" Or maybe you've got a neighbor who's, I don't know, loving to do tea parties in the afternoon, nice and quietly and the other person likes to have a lot of people over at night, but they're really just trying to do hospitality from different points of view.
[time=1152] Or maybe you have a coworker, maybe you're structured and you love to know, "What's my task? What's my timeline?" And she over here is always worried about, "Let's brainstorm. Let's come up with as many good ideas as possible." But you're both really asking like, "How can we make this company better?" And we fight and we get arrogant and we get rude and nobody wants to move their chair.
[time=1176] Nobody wants to move their chair.
[time=1179] If you'll allow me to bring it into maybe church world, maybe even black or church world, we can get real stubborn about preferences in music style.
[time=1190] We can get stubborn and say, "Well, with songs, they need to be done by musically trained musicians." Or other people can say, "Well, where's the improvisation?
[time=1202] Why can't we just do it off the cuff?" Or maybe some people say, "Well, if the song's gonna be sung in church, it needs to have four verses and be written at least 150 years ago by an Anglican pastor." I've heard these things.
[time=1216] I was here, 11 years.
[time=1218] Other people are like, "No, those songs are old and we shouldn't do them.
[time=1224] The songs have to repeat over and over again.
[time=1228] The chords have to be simple and they need to be written by Australians who wear skinny jeans." It's the only way.
[time=1237] We don't see eye to eye.
[time=1238] It happens to the preacher too.
[time=1240] And people say, "No, only expository preaching, verse by verse." That's the only way.
[time=1245] Other people know, topical.
[time=1247] We gotta address the people and let's do a sermon about love or about productivity or about whatever and being responsible.
[time=1253] And we start to fight.
[time=1257] And what we're really asking all the time is how are we gonna worship God together?
[time=1261] How are we gonna be the church together?
[time=1262] How are we gonna be the body of Christ together?
[time=1264] And instead of talking about that, we just get stuck in our chairs and we become arrogant and we become rude and we don't show the world what it means to love one another.
[time=1278] Let me do those sort of things.
[time=1279] Let me tell you a few things
[time=1285] that moving your chair does not mean and I think this is really important.
[time=1288] Moving your chair does not mean compromising your convictions, okay?
[time=1294] Now there are gray matters, disputeable matters and you can go back and forth and whatever, but when I move my chair to talk with a teenager in Poland who's an atheist, it means that I come over here and I think about the world from that teenager's atheistic point of view and we have good conversations.
[time=1309] So I really wanna know how they think the world began and why things work they do, the way they do.
[time=1315] But it never compromised my conviction that there's a creator.
[time=1318] So moving your chair does not mean compromising your convictions.
[time=1323] Neither does moving your chair mean that we never judge.
[time=1328] So earlier I said we judge hastily and I just wanna clarify that.
[time=1332] Moving your chair does not mean that you never judge.
[time=1334] Read your Bibles, okay?
[time=1336] I know judging people is not very socially acceptable right now, it's just not.
[time=1342] But if you read your Bible, you'll see that the Bible's clear that we're not to judge on outward appearances, but we are supposed to rightly judge.
[time=1350] And so we need to be prepared to know the truth, understand the situation, move our chair, but it's okay if we come to a conclusion at the end of it and say this is wrong.
[time=1361] If we never judge, how will we ever hold each other accountable?
[time=1364] How will we ever be able to be the church with one another if we never make a judgment?
[time=1369] As a by the way, I came across a really good article on judging and it's on crosswalk.com.
[time=1377] So if you're interested in finding it, you can go to crosswalk.com in search of judging others.
[time=1383] There's a great article.
[time=1383] What does the Bible say about judging others?
[time=1386] And it kind of runs you through lots of different scriptures to understand that topic a little bit better.
[time=1391] Okay, so up to this point,
[time=1398] we've talked about not being arrogant and not being rude in our relationships with one another and that's really important.
[time=1407] But as we close, I kind of want to talk about one more thing and it's this idea of not bringing arrogance and rudeness in our love to the Lord.
[time=1415] Because 1 Corinthians 13 is also a great way for us to understand how to love God with all of our heart and soul and mind and strength.
[time=1425] And just yesterday I read this verse.
[time=1429] Maybe it's familiar to you.
[time=1432] From Psalm 95, it says, "Today if you hear his voice, do not harden your heart." And to me, that's a picture of bringing arrogance into my relationship with God, right?
[time=1445] Like he's speaking to me via his spirit, via the word, via other people.
[time=1452] And I hear something that he wants me to do.
[time=1454] And if I'm arrogant and if I'm rude, I'm gonna harden my heart and say, hmm, not today, God.
[time=1462] Love her, hmm, no.
[time=1466] And actually, if I look at the plot lines of my spiritual journey, there were a lot of questions where God was saying,
[time=1475] "Will you do this?" And I had to decide, "Am I gonna be arrogant or am I gonna move my chair?" In my salvation experience at five years old, he was asking me, "Will you do this?" And I had to move my chair.
[time=1489] When I was in junior high and learning what it means to follow him and he'd say, "Will you follow me?" I'm gonna move my chair.
[time=1495] In college, when he said, "Will you follow me into persecution and unto death?" I'm gonna move my chair.
[time=1502] After college, when he said, "Will you be a pastor?
[time=1504] I know you never wanted to be." I'm gonna move my chair.
[time=1508] 11 years later, when he said, "Will you go serve overseas?
[time=1511] I know you never wanted to be a missionary." I'm gonna move my chair.
[time=1515] And if we bring this arrogance into our walk with the Lord, we're gonna become like the Israelites who hardened their hearts.
[time=1523] They heard his voice, but they got arrogant and they got rude.
[time=1527] Now think about this.
[time=1533] This is my favorite part of this illustration.
[time=1536] So, I need to move my chair to the Lord, right?
[time=1539] Corbin, go do this.
[time=1540] Okay.
[time=1541] But, remember this.
[time=1546] I'm not actually the one moving my chair so much as it is that Jesus is the one that moved his chair for me.
[time=1557] Let me tell you what I mean.
[time=1560] He's so humble and he's so not arrogant and he's so not rude.
[time=1565] And we see it in several different ways.
[time=1567] Jesus moved his chair in the incarnation when he became a human being.
[time=1571] Jesus moved his chair in his atonement when he died on the cross.
[time=1576] Jesus moved his chair in my justification when he said, "I was righteous." And Jesus moved his chair in my sanctification, my ongoing process to look more like him.
[time=1586] Think about it.
[time=1589] Jesus moved his chair in the incarnation, Philippians 2, six and seven.
[time=1594] It says that Jesus emptied himself being born in the likeness of men.
[time=1599] He was God and didn't consider equality with God something to be grasped.
[time=1604] And he moved his chair.
[time=1605] He could have said, "God, come on." I've been with you since, before, forever.
[time=1611] And you want me to become a person?
[time=1614] They're so perspired, take a shower, scrape my knee, need a band-aid, what?
[time=1621] No, he humbled his chair, his self.
[time=1624] And he moved his chair.
[time=1626] And the king of the world became human.
[time=1628] In the atonement we see at Mark chapter 10, 25, where it says, "Jesus came not to be served, but to serve and to give his whole life as a ransom for many." That's the atonement where it ransomed for many, payment of sin.
[time=1645] And he could have said, "God, die on a cross, death.
[time=1650] We invented death.
[time=1653] I can't die." What?
[time=1655] Or die the sinner's death I've never sinned and he could have gotten stubborn and arrogant.
[time=1659] But no, he humbly moved his chair in the savior of the world and died in our place.
[time=1668] Justification, this declaration that were made righteous.
[time=1673] 2 Corinthians 5, 21 says, "For our sake, God made him to be sin who knew no sin so that we might become the righteousness of God." And he moved his chair in the justification process.
[time=1689] 'Cause the atonement is helpful, but the atonement is not justification.
[time=1693] And justification means that Jesus humbly said, "I declare them righteous." Through his atonement, that's made possible, but he humbly moved his chair in the redeemer of the world and parted his righteousness to you.
[time=1710] And then lastly, he moves his chair in the sanctification process.
[time=1716] Galatians 2.20, Paul writes and shows us about his own sanctification process where he said, "It's no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me, he's growing up to be more like Jesus, more like Jesus, more like Jesus." And Christ could have said, "You want me to grow them up?
[time=1738] You want me to teach them how to walk in my ways?" Really, they're so different, but he didn't.
[time=1744] He moved his chair and the purifier of the world moves his chair every day to grow us up, to be in his likeness.
[time=1757] So.
[time=1758] This is the part where we need to pause
[time=1766] and reflect and think a little bit.
[time=1768] 'Cause we've talked about a lot, right?
[time=1770] And maybe there was something this morning about interpersonal relationships that was striking a chord with you.
[time=1777] Maybe there's something about your walk with the Lord that's striking a chord with you.
[time=1780] There's a continuum of people in the room.
[time=1782] Some of you are far from God.
[time=1784] Some of you are new believers.
[time=1788] Some of you need a new thing in your life.
[time=1791] And I don't know how to challenge you, but the Holy Spirit does.
[time=1796] And so we're just gonna take a minute and get quiet and ask the Lord one question, what do you want me to do?
[time=1802] And then I'll encourage you today,
[time=1808] if you hear his voice, don't harden your heart.
[time=1812] Don't be arrogant.
[time=1814] Don't be rude.
[time=1816] Ask him, what do you want me to do?
[time=1818] Then move your chair.
[time=1821] So if you would, close your eyes for just a minute.
[time=1829] The quietness of your own heart,
[time=1835] just asking that question, God, what do you want me to do?
[time=1846] (gentle music) And today, if you heard his voice, move your chair.
