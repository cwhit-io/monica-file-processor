[time=0] I wanna preach to you today about revival lessons, revival lessons from South Sudan.
[time=6] If you didn't know, I just got back recently, the last few days from a mission trip to South Sudan.
[time=12] And so I wanna invite you to go on this journey with me as we look at some lessons about revival because I need a little revival in my life.
[time=19] How about you?
[time=20] So I wanna invite you to first Peter chapter four, first Peter chapter four versus seven through 11.
[time=26] First Peter chapter four, seven through 11.
[time=28] We'll look at these revival lessons.
[time=30] Now here's the cool part.
[time=32] First Peter chapter four, verses seven through 11, is the first passage that the Lord gave me, the privilege to preach.
[time=38] The first passage of many, many passages, I had the privilege of preaching in South Sudan.
[time=44] And I preached it to this group that I'll introduce you to in just a few moments.
[time=47] But a little did I know that the first passage, the first message that I preached there would end up characterizing so fully what I saw God doing there.
[time=60] And I just can't help as I shared with our elders recently as I got back on Thursday with them.
[time=66] We talked about sharing some of the church and it was pretty unanimous.
[time=69] It's like, no, this really needs, our church should hear more about this.
[time=72] And so I wanna share with you these revival lessons.
[time=75] Little did I know that they would characterize everything I saw and hopefully some things that we can grow in and learn together.
[time=81] So you ready for the word today, Black Hawk?
[time=83] In the building, on your screens, wherever you are, let's read first Peter chapter four verses seven through 11.
[time=89] First Peter four, we'll start with verse seven.
[time=92] The end of all things is at hand.
[time=95] Therefore be self-controlled and sober minded for the sake of your prayers.
[time=100] Above all, keep loving one another earnestly since love covers a multitude of sins.
[time=106] Show hospitality to one another without grumbling.
[time=110] As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another as good stewards of God's varied grace.
[time=118] I'm gonna read that part again because it's my go-to leadership verse that gets me up in the morning and I go to bed with it every night.
[time=124] Think about what we are as followers of Jesus.
[time=127] As good stewards, that's a manager of something that is not your own, but you get to manage it on behalf of that other person.
[time=133] As good stewards of God's varied grace.
[time=138] I get to manage the grace of God.
[time=141] Wow, I'll save that preaching for a little later.
[time=143] That's verse 10, verse 11.
[time=145] Whoever speaks as one who speaks with oracles of God, whoever serves as one who serves by the strength that God supplies in order that in everything, God may be glorified through Jesus Christ.
[time=159] To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever and all God's people said wherever you are, amen.
[time=167] May it be so is what that word amen means and that's my prayer for us.
[time=171] And so I want to share with you how I've seen, it's a stewardship passage.
[time=175] Stewardship managing something, but it's not just money.
[time=177] I think of money sometimes when I hear stewardship, but it's managing the grace of God.
[time=182] And that's ingredients, my friends, to our revival, much like what I got to see overseas, but much like what God wants to do in our hearts each and every single day.
[time=190] And I thank God for testimonies like what we saw with Rylian.
[time=193] I have my shirt on still, made new.
[time=195] We're made new because Jesus sent His grace.
[time=199] It's God's grace, not our effort that we are saved by.
[time=202] It's His blood and His blood alone.
[time=204] It's His righteousness.
[time=205] It's His sacrifice.
[time=206] It's His resurrection.
[time=208] But we get to steward that.
[time=210] And I watched that.
[time=211] So give light is what we called our year end offering if you knew with us.
[time=214] I mean, if you know what that is, but give light is an offering, we often call it Jesus' birthday offering.
[time=219] The end of each year, we challenge everybody to give above and beyond your normal giving, your greatest gift of the season to Jesus.
[time=225] And this year we set a goal and we set over $200,000 just out of our doors to local and global missions.
[time=232] And $15,000 of that went to South Sudan.
[time=235] And I got to go see that stewardship in action.
[time=238] But more than that, I got to see the stewardship of the grace of God happening there that inspired me in so many ways.
[time=244] Did you know that's what God will do, by the way?
[time=246] Anytime you think you're gonna go be a blessing and you're gonna serve the Lord, you just go serve the Lord with all your heart and you're going to teach people and you're going to change lives and you're going, it's your life that gets changed.
[time=256] You're going to be a blessing and God blesses you and I'm overflowing with the blessings of God.
[time=261] He's renewed my spirit and I pray your spirit can be renewed.
[time=264] Some of you came, listen, I don't know who this is for.
[time=266] Some of you came today and you're weary, really weary.
[time=270] Some of you are sick of church, sick of politics.
[time=273] Some of you are just sick of life.
[time=276] And God wants to renew your spirit.
[time=278] God wants to revive something that has been dead inside of you for a long time.
[time=283] And I believe it and I claim it over you in the name of Jesus today.
[time=286] So let's look at some of these lessons.
[time=288] This passage, I shared it and you know, what I saw is good stewardship for sure when I went over there from you, from all of us, but also from my brothers and sisters in South Sudan.
[time=298] But I saw revival.
[time=301] Listen, some of you believe the lie of Satan right now that the gospel is losing ground.
[time=306] So I do that sometimes.
[time=308] Even as a pastor that may be disheartening to hear that your pastor feels that way sometimes, that the church is losing, but it feels that way sometimes.
[time=314] And in a world where it feels like we're often losing ground, God wanted me to share my heart with you and to remind you today that the gospel is moving forward.
[time=322] Jesus is still on the throne.
[time=324] He still loves you.
[time=327] And he is leading this winning team that we get to be a part of called the church where he says, I'll build my church and even the gates of hell won't prevail against it.
[time=335] I've been refreshed in that fact and I want to share with you a little bit about it.
[time=339] And so this passage we'll dig into together.
[time=342] Let me introduce you to South Sudan, 'cause if you're like me, I didn't really know a whole lot about it prior to studying up and going.
[time=347] So this is a map of Africa, the continent of Africa.
[time=349] And the red part is South Sudan.
[time=352] It's a little landlocked country.
[time=354] It's actually the youngest country in the world as it broke from Northern Sudan in 2011 to become an independent nation.
[time=361] It's the world's youngest nation.
[time=364] The population is about 12 million people and get this.
[time=368] It's one of the things, if God does nothing else when we look beyond ourselves as he gives us a sense of gratitude.
[time=373] But what I learned is that out of this population of 12 million, over 80% of them live on less than one US dollar per day.
[time=382] So the need is great there, but listen, the need is great there, but the gospel is even bigger.
[time=388] And it is moving in powerful ways.
[time=390] And so we got to serve there and I'll zoom in on South Sudan now for you.
[time=393] This is the country of South Sudan.
[time=395] We flew into the capital, which is Juba and we flew another little trek.
[time=399] And I'll show you that in a moment to a wheel in Northwest part of the country.
[time=403] So these are the two primary places that we got to serve.
[time=406] We started and finished in Juba, but in the middle, the meat of our time was in a wheel, which was an amazing experience.
[time=414] And so I wanted to show you what we're talking about, but now I wanna give you five lessons.
[time=418] Five lessons about revival that I learned from this time that I think we can all learn together.
[time=423] And before I dig in, I'm not gonna make the number one rookie mistake of when you go on a trip and if any of you that are going on trips later don't do this.
[time=430] Sometimes we go on a trip and we come back and we wag our fingers and condemn the spoiled Americans in our lives that we all are at times.
[time=438] I'm not here to do that today.
[time=439] I'm here today to inspire and encourage you to make the gospel as urgent as it is and as it must be in all of our lives.
[time=447] And as it is all across the world and to encourage you by the global church of what God is doing around you so that God can do something very special in you.
[time=455] So today's message, let me be an encouragement, may it be a challenge to us to continue moving forward.
[time=460] So this is us flying in to a wheel.
[time=463] This is the little dirt airport.
[time=465] Yes, this is a landing strip.
[time=467] We flew into this dirt landing strip and as we flew into this dirt landing strip I had no idea how God was gonna use the soil there to plant seeds in my heart and in the hearts of others.
[time=477] And I believe the same is true of you.
[time=478] I don't know what dirt is in your life right now.
[time=481] I don't know what dirt field you may be staring at right now but God wants to use it as a place of fertile ground for the soil to sprout forth using the seed of God's word to do something special within you.
[time=495] And this passage is amazing to me.
[time=497] The word of God, imagine this, right?
[time=499] Imagine that the word of God would characterize what God is doing in the world so perfectly, but that's exactly what this passage does.
[time=504] So I wanna verse at a time give you five revival lessons.
[time=507] Number one is urgency of the gospel.
[time=509] The urgency of the gospel.
[time=512] I saw this so clearly.
[time=513] It was amazing to see how urgent the gospel was to spread there and it reminded me of the need of that in my own life and our call to make urgent, to make important, to prioritize the gospel of Jesus Christ, the good news in our own lives.
[time=530] And you know, when you make the gospel urgent, let me give you a little bit of a disclaimer.
[time=535] When you make the gospel urgent, spiritual warfare is inevitable.
[time=540] I've known that, what do you mean by spiritual warfare pastor?
[time=543] I don't even know what you mean.
[time=544] When you take ground for the kingdom of God, when you do something like go to South Sudan or like cross your street and share the gospel with your neighbor.
[time=551] So don't just pin it on going to South Sudan.
[time=553] This is local and it's global.
[time=555] When you do things that take steps like Riley did in obedience to the Lord today with baptism, the enemy doesn't like it.
[time=563] Do you know the enemy will leave you alone when you sit complacent in your faith?
[time=567] And boy, I'm here to tell you, the week's leading up to this trip, why don't we have time for the stories?
[time=571] The way the enemy attacked was insane.
[time=573] There was every reason to not go on the trip.
[time=575] Things helped things in our faith.
[time=576] You name it, it all happened.
[time=578] But I saw spiritual warfare.
[time=580] So be warned, but be encouraged because my God is bigger than anything the enemy can throw at you.
[time=586] Can I get an amen?
[time=587] Some of you are living that today.
[time=588] And when we make urgent the gospel of Jesus, yes, there will be spiritual warfare.
[time=593] But the power of my God is so much greater because I made new in Christ.
[time=599] And that power within me, the same power that raised Jesus from the dead lives in us.
[time=605] And the urgency of the gospel, I get this from verse seven.
[time=607] And I saw it characterized there.
[time=609] Verse seven simply tells us to realize that the end of all things is at hand.
[time=615] And the end of all things is at hand.
[time=617] So do a couple of things.
[time=618] Be sober minded, that means think clearly, see clearly and be self-controlled.
[time=622] So do things that are in response to what you see clearly and you prioritize well.
[time=627] Because the end of all things is at hand, this was written a long, long time ago.
[time=630] And it's still true today.
[time=631] Jesus said it then, Peter said it then, we say it now.
[time=634] And here's what I'm noticing as a trend in church culture today, maybe it's America, maybe it's globally, I don't know.
[time=640] But I'm noticing kind of an alarmist mentality about this truth.
[time=643] It's good that we recognize that the signs of the times are everywhere.
[time=647] There's a song about that we sang growing up over and over and over.
[time=650] I still remember it.
[time=651] Hi, I won't see you.
[time=653] But I can still remember it.
[time=654] The signs of the time are everywhere.
[time=655] The end times are at hand and sometimes we get really focused there.
[time=659] This is a good thing.
[time=660] I'm glad.
[time=661] But I'm noticing a trend where it becomes an alarmist mentality.
[time=664] Like we get fearful and frantic and like, what are we gonna do?
[time=667] The end of all things is at hand.
[time=668] But instead, no church, listen, we're not called to have an alarmist mentality.
[time=672] We are called to have an awareness mentality where we see it and then it leads to this amazing peace and joy to realize two things.
[time=681] Number one, we've got to have urgency for the gospel because the end of all things is at hand.
[time=685] Number two, the end of all things is at hand and that means Jesus is coming back.
[time=689] And when he comes back, he's gonna fix everything.
[time=691] And we get to spend forever in all of eternity with him.
[time=694] But in the meantime, may we make the gospel as urgent as it must be in our lives.
[time=699] There's a big difference in the alarmist mentality and the awareness mentality.
[time=702] And that's what I pray we can have as we go about looking at the urgency of the gospel.
[time=708] Can I get it, man?
[time=710] I wanna show you a picture of somebody who gets that urge you.
[time=713] This is Joseph Sammy.
[time=714] Joseph Sammy is a church member here.
[time=716] He's a pharmacist.
[time=716] He and his wife, Gigi are both pharmacists.
[time=718] He introduced himself to me in the foyer.
[time=721] Shortly after we moved here, it's almost been five years you've been putting up with me, by the way, praise God.
[time=726] But Joseph introduced himself to me out there and he said, "Pastor, I may be one of your only Arabic speaking church members." I said, "Yeah, you might be, but then I started to learn." And he was doing this all on his own that Joseph was going out.
[time=738] This is him sharing with some young adults there.
[time=741] And I'll introduce you to some more of these people.
[time=742] But I noticed, and I learned that Joseph was taking trips on his own, not through church or anything.
[time=747] He was going to the Middle East to encourage churches, to encourage pastors, to share the gospel.
[time=753] And then we started getting more and more connected with Joseph and his connections, like with Bassam, who I'll introduce you to in a minute.
[time=758] I've introduced him to you before he's in Egyptian.
[time=761] Never even been in the United States, but he's a brother to us.
[time=763] And he's helped us with tons of our trips and our partnerships.
[time=766] It's like a modern day Paul.
[time=767] He just goes wherever God sends him, even if it's the unsafe places and he paves the way for knuckleheads like me to come follow him one day like we did in South Sudan.
[time=775] Just an amazing thing.
[time=776] I think of Joseph and I think of Bassam.
[time=779] And if you guys are watching, Joseph couldn't be here today because we took him out of the country and he actually has to work and make a living.
[time=784] So he's working today.
[time=785] So Joseph, we love you, Bassam, we love you.
[time=788] But they've made the gospel priority.
[time=791] They made it urgent.
[time=793] And maybe we learn from those kinds of examples.
[time=796] I pray that we can do that in our own lives.
[time=799] So let me show you another picture of urgency.
[time=800] This is one, this is me preaching.
[time=802] And I'm preaching in a tie.
[time=804] You know a surgeon if I'm putting a tie on.
[time=807] I put on ties sometimes, special occasions, weddings, funerals, you know, I like to be a little more casual.
[time=812] But it was beautiful in the culture there where the tie preached, I preached my head off there.
[time=816] It was just wonderful.
[time=817] I had a wonderful time sharing about the love of God.
[time=820] And here's what I want to tell you about urgency.
[time=822] I believe with all of my heart that one of the enemy's greatest tools that he uses specifically for American Christians like you and me, to get us distracted and to make the gospel not as urgent as it truly is and should be and must be in our life, is complacency that comes from things like self-sufficiency.
[time=841] We say, I'm good, I've got it.
[time=843] You know, I watch there, and it's not just a financial thing, but I watch the true dependence on God that I often miss in my life.
[time=850] And I felt convicted about that.
[time=852] That I often think, well, I'm good, I got it, I got this.
[time=855] And I came to remind you today, you don't got this.
[time=858] I don't got this.
[time=859] We need Jesus.
[time=860] And because we need Jesus, we must receive Jesus.
[time=863] And then we must give all of our lives to sharing and making him known in the world around us.
[time=867] Don't let the enemy lie to you and distract you from the urgency of the gospel because the end of all things are at hand.
[time=874] And we are, listen, we are never promised tomorrow.
[time=876] Some of you, I've done funerals this year.
[time=879] Some of you've loved ones.
[time=880] There was a pastor, I preached in his church, talk about God's timing.
[time=883] I preached in his church on last Sunday.
[time=885] And I didn't even know.
[time=886] He had so much joy, he had just lost his brother.
[time=889] And he was going to preach his brother's funeral.
[time=891] And he couldn't go with me to his other church's campus 'cause he had to go preach his brother's funeral, but he came to be with me because I came to preach at his church.
[time=898] And I see hurting people, but I see the joy of the Lord.
[time=902] And I'm reminded, I'm reminded that we're never promised tomorrow.
[time=905] So let's live every day like it's our last chance to be a living representation of the gospel of Jesus.
[time=910] Can I get an amen?
[time=911] Number two, the universality and the unity of God's love.
[time=916] The urgency of the gospel, but now two things.
[time=918] The universality and the unity of God's love.
[time=922] Verse eight gives us a picture of that where Peter writes love covers a multitude of sins.
[time=926] He says above everything, show everybody this kind of love 'cause love covers a multitude of sins.
[time=931] And I watched God's love in action.
[time=933] And it was moving beautifully in South Sudan.
[time=935] And I wanna talk about what I saw Corbin mention.
[time=939] How many of you hear last week?
[time=940] Corbin, raise your hand at home too, God knows.
[time=942] Don't lie, he knows.
[time=945] But Corbin talked about humility, and he talked about moving your chair.
[time=948] This week, my chair got moved.
[time=950] I didn't really pick it up on my own and move it over, but God picked me up in my chair and said, look at things from a new perspective.
[time=959] And I've got a new perspective, a renewed, refreshed perspective of the love of God.
[time=963] I just wanna share it with you for a moment and give you a couple of examples of it.
[time=966] God's love is universal.
[time=968] It overcomes every barrier.
[time=969] I watch it overcome language barriers.
[time=971] There's I think 64 tribes in South Sudan.
[time=974] Each of them have their own unique tribal language.
[time=977] There's Arabic, it's actually an English speaking country, but kinda sorta sometimes.
[time=983] And I watch so many language barriers, but God overcame it by his love.
[time=988] Sometimes you just don't need words.
[time=990] That's the power of God's love.
[time=991] I watch it overcome differences.
[time=992] I watch it overcome so many different things.
[time=995] This last week, John 3 16, God's love is global for God so loved the world.
[time=1001] He loves all of us.
[time=1002] And guess who that includes?
[time=1003] Do this.
[time=1004] Just remind yourself.
[time=1006] Just pat your chest for a moment, remind yourself.
[time=1008] Some of you can't even do it 'cause you don't believe it.
[time=1010] And my heart goes out to you.
[time=1011] I really want you to know God loves you.
[time=1014] And I watch his love and it's universal and it's global.
[time=1017] And I could talk all day about it, but instead, I'm gonna let you watch something, watch worship.
[time=1022] Corbin talked about preferences and worship.
[time=1024] Raise your hand if you've got preferences and worship and preaching styles and all that stuff.
[time=1027] He taught them how they did a great job.
[time=1029] But I watch, all of that get washed away by the universal love of God.
[time=1034] Check it out.
[time=1035] (upbeat music)
[time=1060] [AMEN]
[time=1066] Give it up for Jesus.
[time=1067] [AMEN] Man, I was so refreshed, just free worship.
[time=1073] And may we be encouraged just to worship God in spirit and in truth with all of our heart and realize that all of the styles and the preferences, they all get washed away when we just love Jesus with all that we are.
[time=1085] And I pray we can be that kind of church.
[time=1087] It's not just a universal love, it's a unifying kind of love too.
[time=1089] The unity of God's love.
[time=1091] Man, when the universal global love of God spills out in our lives, it looks like unity.
[time=1096] And listen, some of you have been, I have too, been buying the lie, buying the lie.
[time=1102] If you notice this kind of a divided time, not if you agree, I do agree.
[time=1105] I'm just not a trick question.
[time=1106] It is politics and theology, philosophy.
[time=1109] We get divided over so many things.
[time=1111] But the enemy would have you to believe that everything and everybody is divided today.
[time=1117] And I came to say, God says no.
[time=1121] Because I watched the unity that comes from the universal global love of God at work this week.
[time=1127] And I want to remind us today that God has called us to be unified, that the world will know that we are His disciples by our love for one another.
[time=1135] And I want to show you a picture of that.
[time=1136] These are the five of us that we did a lot of serving together.
[time=1140] This is the five brothers, we'll call them.
[time=1142] We became brothers.
[time=1143] And boy, we're different.
[time=1144] We are so different.
[time=1145] We ate dinner together many of the nights.
[time=1147] You know me, I'm just honored to be even in this picture.
[time=1151] If God can use me, He can use YouTube.
[time=1152] But I'm about as white of an American pastor as you're going to find, okay?
[time=1156] And so there I was in the midst of these other four brothers.
[time=1159] This is Bassam, by the way, just, I mean, try to not smile looking at that guy.
[time=1163] He's full of joy everywhere he goes and God's hands on his life.
[time=1167] And he just gives everything he's got as a modern day Paul to go encourage the church, to go in places.
[time=1172] He shouldn't be going.
[time=1173] And he's got health issues, he shouldn't be in the sun.
[time=1176] And he's in Africa, he was 100 degrees there, by the way.
[time=1179] And by the way, ha ha, that I left you with a big snowstorm last week.
[time=1182] You're welcome, you're welcome.
[time=1185] But look at that joy.
[time=1186] So Bassam is Egyptian.
[time=1188] So he's just an Egyptian, he was born south and lived south of where Joseph grew up.
[time=1192] And Joseph speaking of is an Egyptian born American citizen.
[time=1196] He moved here when he was 19 years old.
[time=1198] So they're both from Egypt.
[time=1199] Then you've got Dr. Min.
[time=1201] Now this is crazy.
[time=1202] We didn't even know we were gonna be teaching together.
[time=1204] We didn't know we were gonna be in a wheel of all places.
[time=1206] A wheel south Sudan.
[time=1208] But he is a pastor, he started a church 30 years ago get this in Illinois.
[time=1212] So he's a neighbor of ours.
[time=1213] And he is in the same area where my little Kaya Grace was born.
[time=1217] I mean, you can't write this stuff.
[time=1220] And we taught together and we couldn't have taught the way that we taught if we both weren't there at the exact same time.
[time=1225] And it's almost like God knew.
[time=1227] It's almost like God sent us.
[time=1228] But we're different.
[time=1229] He's a Korean born American.
[time=1231] And then my brother, Wool, who you'll meet in a greater detail in just a moment is a South Sudanese guy that I just was blown away by.
[time=1238] And so listen, we're all very different.
[time=1240] Not if you agree.
[time=1241] Yeah, we're pretty different guys.
[time=1242] Different backgrounds, different perspectives.
[time=1244] And we would talk about things, you know, then we'd be like, say what?
[time=1248] You believe that?
[time=1249] You think that really why?
[time=1250] And then we'd say, cool, let's eat dinner.
[time=1253] Because we were there to serve Jesus.
[time=1254] And we were tied together by Jesus.
[time=1256] Different perspectives, different backgrounds, different skin colors, different nationalities.
[time=1260] You name it, it's different.
[time=1261] But we were one in Jesus.
[time=1264] This is a picture.
[time=1265] And I'm not worthy to be in the picture.
[time=1267] But let it be a reminder of how God wants to use us as the body of Christ to make us one together in a world where the enemy's ripping us to shreds.
[time=1275] May the church be one.
[time=1277] And may we be unified to show the universal love of God.
[time=1281] And I'm so glad that I got to be a part of seeing that.
[time=1284] And a couple of examples of that love overflowing.
[time=1286] Don't you want to see the orphanages that you helped to build?
[time=1288] We got to visit two, surprise.
[time=1290] We didn't get to go to the prisons, COVID, national rules, and things that they changed there.
[time=1295] We couldn't go in there.
[time=1296] But we got to go to another orphanage.
[time=1297] And so I'll show you both.
[time=1298] The first one is True Light Orphanage.
[time=1301] This is a picture we posted it on our social media.
[time=1303] Maybe you've seen it.
[time=1304] This is Maria.
[time=1305] Maria started these orphanages.
[time=1306] I think they've got maybe four locations now.
[time=1308] We sent $10,000 from our give light offering way to go Blackhawk to help build this location.
[time=1313] It had just been open about two weeks after we got there.
[time=1317] And we just got to see the love of God overflowing towards those little babies.
[time=1322] I'm not going to cry.
[time=1324] Man, I love how God's love is shown in children.
[time=1328] And so instead of trying to tell you, I want to show you these kids singing to us about the love of Jesus.
[time=1332] How about that?
[time=1333] Check this out.
[time=1334] [MUSIC]
[time=1347] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[time=1377] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] That'll preach.
[time=1386] That'll preach.
[time=1387] The love of God was so evident.
[time=1389] And this is what you got to support.
[time=1392] And I was honored to be an ambassador from you.
[time=1394] So thank you for sending me and allowing me to be there just as your representative.
[time=1399] But we got to help build and be a part of this ministry.
[time=1401] And then we got to meet another orphanage where the love of God was on.
[time=1404] This is Andrew and Susanna.
[time=1405] So we've got Bassam, Joseph.
[time=1407] And then I'm on the end.
[time=1408] And this is Andrew and Susanna.
[time=1410] And they're Egyptians that moved to South Sudan.
[time=1412] They've got three amazing kids.
[time=1413] We're going to be finding ways to hopefully partner with them in new ways as a church too.
[time=1417] And they are at an orphanage and run it in Juba.
[time=1420] So the true light orphanage is in a wheel.
[time=1421] This orphanage is in Juba, both the two places that I mentioned to you.
[time=1426] And they have a group of almost 50 girls in their orphanage.
[time=1430] And we got to go-- our last day, they're perfect cap to the trip.
[time=1434] We got to go.
[time=1435] And they typically will get out of their orphanage maybe once a year.
[time=1438] And we got to go take them to the edge of the Nile River and just sit outside.
[time=1442] And by the way, 100 degree weather.
[time=1445] You'll see my red face.
[time=1446] And just, I mean, actually, let's look at it.
[time=1447] Here we are.
[time=1448] Look at that red face.
[time=1448] Yeah, you didn't have that.
[time=1449] It's like, hey, I'm coming from minus two.
[time=1451] Why do I need sunscreen?
[time=1452] Well, I did.
[time=1454] But this is us.
[time=1454] We got to share in a ministry time of them just eating some pizza and ice cream.
[time=1459] It was just a wonderful time that we got to share.
[time=1461] So just, yeah, what a beautiful picture of the love of God.
[time=1465] The urgency of the gospel, the universality, the unity of God's love.
[time=1470] Number three is eternal perspective.
[time=1473] Eternal perspective.
[time=1474] Write that down, eternal perspective.
[time=1477] Verse number nine tells us to show hospitality without grumbling.
[time=1481] How many of you grumble sometimes?
[time=1484] I'm a grumbler.
[time=1485] So if going on a trip like this does nothing else for me, it always helps me realize I need to quit grumbling about the things I often grumble about and be a little more grateful.
[time=1493] So maybe God wants to turn some of your grumbling into gratitude like he has for me today.
[time=1498] But it helps us grow.
[time=1499] And when we zoom out, this is what a trip like this does for me.
[time=1502] I zoom out and I see the world for what it is.
[time=1505] Quite literally, physically in the airplane, you see the world differently.
[time=1508] But spiritually, here's what happens.
[time=1510] I start to notice that in my life, I get so consumed and all of my time goes to things that are very earthly, that are not eternal, they have no kingdom, eternal significance at all.
[time=1522] And maybe you can find things like that in your own life to zoom out and see where your time is going.
[time=1528] And I'll tell you, one of my favorite perspective builders was this podium.
[time=1532] This was my favorite podium maybe that I've ever preached from.
[time=1534] This one's pretty nice, right?
[time=1536] But this one's better.
[time=1537] And what made it better is the perspective that I got from the podium.
[time=1541] And if you can't tell, it's just a speaker in a box with a microphone sitting on top of it.
[time=1545] And the people that I got to preach to there, hungered for the word of God in a way that reminded me that I'm there to teach them the word of God, but I'm not sure I hunger for the word and the glory of God the way that those I am teaching hunger for the word and the glory of God.
[time=1560] And it gave me a new perspective.
[time=1561] And maybe God wants to give you a new eternal perspective that you have been missing.
[time=1565] And here's what God wants to do in our lives.
[time=1567] Now, I promise he wants to do this in at least one way.
[time=1569] He wants to redefine what matters, redefine what matters.
[time=1574] Maybe you've been making things matter that don't matter.
[time=1577] Maybe it's time to redefine what matters so that you make what really matters for all of eternity, really matter and the things that don't, just kind of push them to the side.
[time=1584] It doesn't mean they're not significant, but it may be that they don't matter eternally and you're making an earthly thing an eternal issue in your life.
[time=1592] So here's the question I've been answering or trying to answer and I encourage you to join me in this.
[time=1596] And the question is simply, what earthly thing is robbing?
[time=1601] Is robbing your time from what is eternal?
[time=1604] What earthly thing is robbing your time from what is eternal?
[time=1608] Be a great question for all of us to answer this week.
[time=1611] And a good picture of an eternal perspective comes from this guy.
[time=1615] I wanna show you a picture of his family.
[time=1616] This is wool.
[time=1618] Wool is my buddy now.
[time=1619] It's crazy how the love of Jesus with all of our differences is it's like we can feel like we've known each other our whole lives and we spend a few days together.
[time=1626] But that's what I felt with this guy is my age and wool was born in a civil war.
[time=1631] Should have died many times.
[time=1632] Should have died.
[time=1633] He watched people be burned alive on trains.
[time=1637] The stories I could tell you are amazing.
[time=1639] But God spared his life for a purpose.
[time=1645] And I got to go see.
[time=1646] I got to go see that purpose.
[time=1648] This is his family.
[time=1649] That's him on the M.
[time=1650] And I watched him have an eternal perspective.
[time=1653] Comes from what we would say comes from nothing.
[time=1656] But yet he has everything spiritually.
[time=1658] The joy that he serves the Lord with is something I'll never forget.
[time=1662] And I pray that you can be inspired by him just like I have been inspired by him.
[time=1667] Here's a couple of pictures.
[time=1668] This is us in his church.
[time=1669] He started this church.
[time=1670] So he comes from all this.
[time=1671] Now listen, he's a leader in a Bible school.
[time=1674] He's fluent in three languages, at least three.
[time=1677] Maybe there's more.
[time=1677] He probably was holding out on me.
[time=1679] He speaks this tribal language.
[time=1680] He speaks Arabic.
[time=1681] He speaks English.
[time=1682] I'll prove it to you in just a minute.
[time=1683] But here's this church.
[time=1685] He started this church.
[time=1687] He's a teacher, a leader, a staff member in a Bible school now that trains others.
[time=1691] And I'll teach you about that in just a moment.
[time=1693] But this is his church.
[time=1693] I got to preach there.
[time=1694] Here's me preaching in his church.
[time=1697] One of the joys of my life was preaching.
[time=1699] That's where you saw the worship just a few minutes ago.
[time=1702] But instead of me telling you about him, he wanted to say something to you.
[time=1704] Would you like to hear from him?
[time=1706] All right, well, let's hear from Pastor Wool.
[time=1709] This is what he had to say to you.
[time=1710] It'll be an audio.
[time=1711] - Hello everyone, brothers and sisters in Christ, the church of the Lord uses Christ at Black Hawk to Ministries in the United States of America.
[time=1721] Greetings to you from South Sudan.
[time=1723] My name is Walcon.
[time=1725] A South Sudan is living in South Sudan.
[time=1728] Just a few days back, we were together with Pastor Kevin Carlton and Brother Dictor Joseph Amin, accompanied by our brother Pastor Basim Sart from Egypt.
[time=1740] We were together here in South Sudan for the sake of the glory of Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1746] And it was really amazing time.
[time=1749] Pastor Kevin, a man full of the word of God, farewell in the Spirit.
[time=1754] In four days, he spoke to the pastors and the young ministers of the gospel.
[time=1760] With the different topics about the Great Commission and the discipleship plus so many others, we were blessed by him.
[time=1770] And we are grateful and thankful to you, the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ, Black Hawk Ministries, for sending him together accompanied by Dictor Joseph Amin and Brother Basim Sart from Cairo.
[time=1782] It was really a great blessing to us here in South Sudan.
[time=1787] In four days, Pastor Kevin spoke strong words of the Lord Jesus Christ, which influenced and inspired the hearts of many people, including me.
[time=1796] And I believe that this strong ministry is not in vain, but I believe that some people behind there in the Church are praying for him and asking God to strengthen him and to make his way for the Spirit.
[time=1812] In the same way, brothers and sisters are the Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=1817] We want to encourage you to continue following what the Lord have put into your hearts by sending Pastor Kevin to continue pray for South Sudan.
[time=1827] And not only that, but also to continue a thing for South Sudan, how to make the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ reached everywhere in South Sudan.
[time=1838] And also, I will be praying for you.
[time=1840] And actually, we will be praying for you that in the next few months to come that the Lord might send you
[time=1848] again, Brother Pastor Kevin and Dictor Joseph, plus any other people that can come and bless us again, because the need really is very big here in South Sudan.
[time=1860] And I think the coming of Pastor Kevin was an answer to one of our prayers that we have been asking for some people than the Lord consent to South Sudan, to strengthen and help the people that give their life to Jesus, how to share their faith,
[time=1879] and how to share the gospel with others.
[time=1881] Once again, we want to thank you for the great sacrifice that you did by sending your beloved people to South Sudan during the time of pandemic COVID-19.
[time=1893] It's not easy, but still you decided to send them.
[time=1896] They were really a great blessing to us.
[time=1899] And we thank you very much.
[time=1900] May the Lord Jesus Christ bless you.
[time=1902] We will keep you in mind and always praying for you.
[time=1905] Bye-bye.
[time=1907] Let's show them some love.
[time=1908] Can we thank them for-- Will, we love you.
[time=1913] And Will, I know you're probably watching, or we'll see this at some point.
[time=1917] You talked so much about how I was a blessing.
[time=1919] You, my friend, were the blessing to me.
[time=1920] And you're now blessing our church.
[time=1922] Can I get a name in?
[time=1923] We love you in the name of Jesus today.
[time=1925] And what a picture of an eternal perspective that his story is, that his family is, that his church is.
[time=1931] Even today, my friends, there are some of you who are going through terrible things.
[time=1936] I just had the privilege to pray with a brother in Christ who's battling cancer.
[time=1939] Our elders got together and prayed over him.
[time=1942] And his only prayer was that the joy of the Lord, that the will of the Lord, that the purpose of the Lord would be clearly seen through his journey.
[time=1951] I thank God for people like that.
[time=1953] I pray that I can have that kind of eternal perspective.
[time=1956] I pray that I can steward the grace of God in that way.
[time=1960] And that's number four I want to teach you about from verse 10.
[time=1963] Number four is stewardship of God's grace.
[time=1967] Not just of your money, not just God's money, not just God's joy, not just God's blank, his creation.
[time=1973] But stewardship of the very grace of God by which we are saved.
[time=1976] It's what we get to be a part of today.
[time=1980] And I pray that I can steward it the way I'm seeing so many examples in my life.
[time=1984] Verse 10 tells us that and gives us that pictures why it's why I go to leadership verse.
[time=1988] It's a go to revival verse for all of us.
[time=1991] And I want to tell you something that, listen, the enemy doesn't want you to know.
[time=1994] And the media really doesn't even want you to know.
[time=1997] I want to tell you today that there is a revival sweeping across the Middle East and Africa.
[time=2003] I washed it.
[time=2004] Don't believe for a second that the gospel is dead, that the gospel's not on the move.
[time=2008] And if it's on the move there, it's on the move here.
[time=2011] And many times the enemy wants to convince you and have you believe the lie that we're on a losing team and I've been refreshed in my spirit and reminded of the winning team that the Lord Jesus Christ is leading and we get to be a part of that.
[time=2024] I want to give you some pictures of that.
[time=2025] Here's the first one.
[time=2026] There's a picture of a mountain in Juba in South Sudan.
[time=2030] And you'll see, it's just a kind of normal looking mountain, but this mountain is often called even today, the mountain of black magic, witchcraft, sorcery, and things that the enemy is using of evil like that have deep roots there.
[time=2044] But here's what I want to show you.
[time=2046] I want to zoom in to the top of the mountain.
[time=2047] I don't know how well you can see it, can you see that?
[time=2050] That's a cross that Christians there took and put and erected on the top of this mountain of black magic.
[time=2056] And they will often make the trek up there to go and pray.
[time=2059] And now many people, especially the Christians, but is spreading instead of the mountain of black magic, is being called the mountain of Jesus.
[time=2067] His name is the name above every name.
[time=2071] He is on the throne.
[time=2073] The gospel is still alive.
[time=2075] God's word is alive and active and sharper than any two-edged sword.
[time=2080] And the name of Jesus still prevails, my friends.
[time=2083] And if it's true on the top of the mountain of black magic, it's true for your life and it's true for my life.
[time=2090] He's on the throne.
[time=2092] There is a revival that God wants to bring about.
[time=2094] Let me show you another picture.
[time=2095] This is a picture of me preaching from the same Bible, from the same page and the same passage.
[time=2100] First Peter chapter four, it's the first message I had.
[time=2102] There's a group of young adults there that had just gotten a certificate for a month-long discipleship training.
[time=2107] In addition to many pastors, many of them walked more than three hours one way to come and be with us and let us teach them about the word of God.
[time=2115] And so we're all together and I got to share the word of God.
[time=2117] And I told them, and they shared stories 'cause get this, the young adults had just come back, not just from training, but part of their training was to go out in groups.
[time=2125] Many of them slept on the streets for a whole month and they went out and shared their faith and saw God do miracles and saw God heal and saw God turn people who were completely consumed by evil, by sorcery, by witchcraft and give their life to Jesus.
[time=2142] And they share their stories and then they're like, now you preach.
[time=2144] And I told, this is my first thing I told them.
[time=2148] I said, let's remember this day.
[time=2149] I know I'll remember this day and then we took this picture.
[time=2152] But I told them, I said, I don't really need to preach now because you already did.
[time=2156] And man, what a picture of the moving gospel that we saw there with this group.
[time=2160] But this is the young adults, this is me teaching with them, just the young adults together.
[time=2164] Let's flip the picture there, young adults, there we go.
[time=2166] This is just the young adults.
[time=2168] And they just blew my mind.
[time=2170] The questions that they asked, the hunger for the word, they asked no passive philosophical questions.
[time=2176] It was all active, actionable verb items of like, okay, what do I do with this relationship in my life right now today?
[time=2183] Because I'm going home and applying this now.
[time=2186] And I was convicted and encouraged and inspired and all kinds of things.
[time=2190] And when I look at revival, teaching you about revival lessons from South Sudan, when I think of revival, I think of a lot of common denominators.
[time=2198] One is prayer, and these people are a people of prayer.
[time=2200] May we be a people of prayer.
[time=2202] I'm thankful for prayer warriors in our church.
[time=2204] May we always boldly approach the throne of God and be a people of prayer.
[time=2207] That's always as they are.
[time=2208] Repentance is another common denominator of revival.
[time=2212] We turn from our wicked ways and we turn to God and humble ourselves enough to seek the face of God.
[time=2218] But another thing that's a common denominator I've noticed in revivals is young people.
[time=2222] And many of you who are watching, maybe overseas, and many of you who are here, that doesn't mean God only uses young people, but it means God uses a multi-generational church like ours to inspire and raise up and to train a new generation like this one, who will take the world by storm and do things, maybe generations beyond us that we're not even here and we're in glory with Jesus one day.
[time=2241] And I see that happening in South Sudan.
[time=2243] And I thank God that through places like our school and our youth and our kids ministry that we can be a part of that kind of things as well.
[time=2251] Write it down this way, what does God wanna do?
[time=2253] God will use.
[time=2254] God will use your stewardship of His grace to spread the gospel, but here's what it'll turn into into the flame of revival.
[time=2261] God wants to do that in your life.
[time=2262] God wants to do that in your neighborhood.
[time=2264] God wants to do that in the one-five zip code all the way to the 15 regions all around the world.
[time=2268] That's our vision, to light the one-five across the streets and around the world as we make disciples together.
[time=2275] Last thing I'll share with you is number five is hunger, hunger for God's glory.
[time=2279] Verse 11 tells us if we speak, let it be with the oracles of God.
[time=2283] The oracles of God.
[time=2284] And if we serve, let it be with the strength that God supplies.
[time=2287] But then it says that all of this would be done for the glory of the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=2292] And I saw that in South Sudan.
[time=2294] I see that here and I want more of that in my life.
[time=2297] Say amen if you agree.
[time=2298] I want to hunger for the word of God.
[time=2300] I want to hunger for the glory of God above everything else.
[time=2304] And many of you thought I forgot the Bibles, didn't you?
[time=2307] I just told you, I've saved it for last though.
[time=2309] You sent Bibles to South Sudan through our give light offering as well, $5,000 worth of Bibles.
[time=2314] Here's a picture of the Bibles.
[time=2315] There's an Arabic Bible and an English Bible.
[time=2317] Here's the picture, here's Arabic, here's English.
[time=2319] And they're even doing things with audio for people who are illiterate or can't read so that or even in the tribal languages where it can be played where the audio version of the Bible.
[time=2328] So the word of God is spreading folks, do not be deceived.
[time=2332] And so these are the Bibles we got to give out that you got to help send through our give light offering.
[time=2336] I want to show you some pictures about this.
[time=2338] But before I do, hold on, this is so cool.
[time=2340] I could tell you so many stories.
[time=2341] And you got one more minute?
[time=2342] You got an extra one minute in the sermon?
[time=2344] Or would you other them hurry up and get to them so you can get to the lunch?
[time=2346] One more minute, raise your hand.
[time=2348] Okay, yeah, like you're going to raise your hand for the other one, all right.
[time=2350] You know I'm doing it anyway.
[time=2351] All right, so here's the story.
[time=2352] When these Bibles were delivered, I saw the picture and they were all beating up kind of bloody and dirty but the truck that delivered long before we came.
[time=2360] A lot of these Bibles were delivered.
[time=2362] I found out that they were robbed.
[time=2364] And basically everything that they had, these guys that drove the truck full of these kinds of Bibles that I got to give out and be a part of and you got to send together, that everything they had was taken from them except not even one Bible.
[time=2380] And they looked so joyful and happy.
[time=2383] And I was wondering why?
[time=2383] And they were like, didn't they just get robbed?
[time=2385] You know, like I think I'd probably frown.
[time=2388] But instead they had the joy of the Lord 'cause they were like, oh, we've accomplished our mission.
[time=2392] We don't care about that stuff.
[time=2393] The Bibles made it.
[time=2395] Man, praise God for what he's doing.
[time=2396] I want to show you some more pictures of the Bibles.
[time=2398] Here's a picture of the line to get the Bibles like Christmas morning.
[time=2401] I had to be here for this.
[time=2402] It was amazing.
[time=2403] You got to be here for this.
[time=2404] We got to be a part of this.
[time=2405] Here's us giving some of the Bibles out.
[time=2408] Just don't know if I've had much more of a joy of giving out something and giving out the word of God in the ways that we did.
[time=2413] Here's another picture of the pastors.
[time=2415] These are the pastors.
[time=2416] Many of them didn't have a Bible and they're a pastor.
[time=2419] The ones that did have a Bible.
[time=2420] We gave them a Bible and say, give one to a leader in your church who does not have a Bible.
[time=2424] And so they all were able to do that.
[time=2426] So these are pastors.
[time=2427] See, Bassham there, Joseph's in there with me somewhere.
[time=2429] Here's the young adults.
[time=2431] And oh, the joy of this picture.
[time=2433] You should have seen how long it took to just even get this picture because they were so excited.
[time=2437] There we all are as Joseph there and Bassham and myself.
[time=2440] And it's just such a beautiful picture of what God did there.
[time=2444] And here's maybe my favorite experience.
[time=2446] You want to see it?
[time=2447] My favorite experience.
[time=2448] Yeah.
[time=2449] This is Pastor Kevin's Bible delivery service.
[time=2452] We had to translate, that's Joseph and me.
[time=2455] We have a box of Bibles.
[time=2457] And so this is a wheel, South Sudan, Uber.
[time=2460] Really, we called the taxi.
[time=2463] This was the taxi.
[time=2464] And we got to go deliver Bibles and spread them around.
[time=2466] But here's what I want to do.
[time=2467] I want to use this picture to remind you of a truth that maybe you came today just to hear this one truth.
[time=2471] And this one truth is that the glory of God and God's good news, the good news and the gospel of Jesus is on the move.
[time=2481] It's on the move.
[time=2482] Be encouraged church, be strengthened church.
[time=2486] Know that if the gospel is on the move, on motorcycles in South Sudan, with my Bible delivery service, that the gospel of Jesus Christ is on the move in your life too.
[time=2497] He's not done with you.
[time=2498] He's got great things in store.
[time=2500] They only give you three applications real quick.
[time=2502] Just to tie it together, three applications.
[time=2503] Number one, steward God's grace through growing.
[time=2509] I often tell you go biblical before you go digital.
[time=2511] Spend time with the Lord in prayer.
[time=2513] Seek God with all that you've got.
[time=2515] He will answer, he will speak to you.
[time=2518] He'll speak to you through his word.
[time=2519] So may we have that kind of a hunger for the word of God, for the love of God that I often miss in my life.
[time=2525] And I get consumed by everything, but what God wants to teach me about.
[time=2528] So hunger for him, thirst for the word of God.
[time=2531] Go biblical before you go digital.
[time=2532] Don't fill your mind with the lies of the scrolling and all that, that stuff's fine.
[time=2536] Get there later, start with the word of God.
[time=2538] Start with the truth.
[time=2539] Grow in your personal faith and relationship and walk with Jesus Christ.
[time=2543] And it's gonna overflow into these things.
[time=2544] Steward God's grace through giving.
[time=2546] When you give to the Lord through Blackhawk, you support over 30 missionaries.
[time=2549] Just like what you're seeing today, ministries like what you're seeing today.
[time=2553] Maybe God wants you to start giving through the local church, that's where his heart is.
[time=2556] I say that unapologetically, not because I'm supposed to, because I'm the pastor of this church, but because I believe in it.
[time=2561] And I know I've watched God multiply resources and bless and multiply the work of the local church.
[time=2568] Jesus said, I'll build my church and even the gates of hell won't prevail against it.
[time=2572] And so even more than just giving to the Lord through your local church, is just having a lifestyle characterized by generosity.
[time=2579] Perhaps you could give up a coffee or a lunch this week and give towards something, and then you have to be in South Sudan or overseas.
[time=2585] It could be something across your street.
[time=2587] There are needs all around us.
[time=2589] And oftentimes the smallest little gestures of giving and generosity will open up the greatest doors for the gospel.
[time=2596] So maybe steward God's grace by giving.
[time=2598] And then lastly, steward God's grace through going.
[time=2601] Yeah, I'm not trying to say that going on a short term, mission trip is for everybody.
[time=2608] Maybe you should consider that.
[time=2612] But in the meantime, if you don't agree with me just yet, then I would challenge you, can you serve in our kids ministry?
[time=2618] Can you use your gifts with technology?
[time=2620] Can you serve across your streets?
[time=2622] Can you make a difference with the gifts that God has given you locally and globally?
[time=2626] We're a part of a local and globally minded church.
[time=2629] I think God that I'm a part of that kind of a church family.
[time=2631] If I have anything to say about it, that'll never ever, ever change because it's a picture of the gospel.
[time=2636] But also I would challenge you.
[time=2637] Maybe you also invite somebody to Easter.
[time=2639] Easter's was spring break this year.
[time=2642] But you know what?
[time=2642] Jesus is just as risen on spring break as He is anytime.
[time=2645] So maybe invite somebody at Easter, Easter and Christmas are the times where maybe you can get people to join you the most to hear the good news of Jesus.
[time=2652] Maybe that's one of the things you can do.
[time=2654] Or consider going on one of our upcoming trips.
[time=2656] BlackhawkMinistries.org/go.
[time=2658] You can go there.
[time=2659] You can see all of our ongoing partnerships.
[time=2661] You can see our upcoming trips.
[time=2662] We've got a trip to New York where you can reach international people without even crossing the U.S. border.
[time=2668] So that'll be an easy way to do that.
[time=2670] We've got local partnerships.
[time=2671] We've got other trips.
[time=2672] We've got Egypt.
[time=2673] We've got Kenya coming up.
[time=2674] We've got Israel trip coming up in next year's time.
[time=2678] And you can also go to our go table, which if you're in the building, you can go there and they will have all that information.
[time=2683] But if you're online, just go to slash go and you'll find all of these opportunities.
[time=2688] But let's grow, let's give, and let's go.
[time=2690] Can I get a name in?
[time=2692] Will you bow your heads with me today?
[time=2693] I wanna give you a chance to respond.
[time=2696] Man, I just pray that God would in our hearts and lives give us an urgency for the gospel.
[time=2701] I pray that we would see his love, how universal, how unifying it is, that it would give us a new perspective.
[time=2708] That we've steward the grace of God in a new way this week, that we would hunger for the glory of God in ways we never have before as a church.
[time=2715] That revival would happen in and through.
[time=2718] Since some of you are believers today and God's prompting your next step, and some of you today, you would say, you know, my next step is to trust in Jesus as my Lord and savior.
[time=2727] I've never truly surrendered to him.
[time=2729] Jesus, listen, the gospel is very simple.
[time=2731] It's that we're all sinners and we all fall short of the glory of God, but Jesus, he who knew no sin, lived the sinless life that we couldn't live.
[time=2738] He came in the form of a little baby to walk that sinless life.
[time=2742] And at the age of 33, he died on the cross, paying a penalty for your sins and mine, the sins of the world.
[time=2748] He took upon his shoulders.
[time=2749] Jesus paid it all and he rose from the dead.
[time=2753] And because he lives, we can have eternal life.
[time=2756] He's alive.
[time=2757] He conquered death hell and the grave.
[time=2759] He conquered your sin and you need to trust in him and him alone for salvation.
[time=2763] I'm not here to force you to do that, but I believe the Holy Spirit is drawing you.
[time=2766] Somebody right now on a screen in the room, wherever you might be, I wanna give you a moment to respond to what God is calling you to do.
[time=2773] Ask him to save you, he will.
[time=2774] him to empower you for revival and he will do just that.
