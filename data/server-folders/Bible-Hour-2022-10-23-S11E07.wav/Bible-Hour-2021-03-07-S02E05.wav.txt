[time=0] I wanna talk to you about un-resentful forgiveness.
[time=5] Un-resentful forgiveness.
[time=7] We'll be in 1 Corinthians 13.
[time=8] We'll recap real quick and read.
[time=10] All five verses will be particularly in verse five today.
[time=13] And then I'll take us to Ephesians chapter four and chapter five where Paul helps us unpack this even further.
[time=19] So I got a question for you, Black Hawk.
[time=21] Are you ready for the word today?
[time=24] Are you sure you're ready for the word today?
[time=26] Because sometimes we think we're ready, but then we realize the word's gonna dig into our heart and change things about our life when we feel like, well, maybe I wasn't as ready as I thought.
[time=34] But God's got something for you today and I can't wait to share with you about this un-resentful forgiveness.
[time=40] I've been praying for you.
[time=42] I've been praying that God would set you free through forgiveness and I try to always internalize and practice what I preach as God pours it on me.
[time=49] And I gotta tell you, this is gonna be a message that can dig deep into your heart, but if you'll allow God to work, if you'll allow His word to penetrate Him, you'll leave different than when you came in and this week will look different.
[time=60] Not necessarily so much better with all the circumstances, but so much better in terms of joy and peace and power of the love of God.
[time=68] Are you ready for that this morning?
[time=69] First Corinthians chapter 13, let's read the first five verses and then we'll hone in on verse five.
[time=75] The word of God says, "If I speak in the tongues of men "and of angels but have not love, "I am a noisy gong or a clanging symbol.
[time=84] "And if I have prophetic powers "and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, "and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains "but have not love, I am nothing." Verse three, "If I give away all I have "and if I deliver up my body to be burned "but have not love, I gain nothing." And then the content that overflows into our relationship begins verse four, love agape, self-sacrificial, others first, love that only comes from the Father.
[time=112] Love is patient and kind.
[time=115] Love does not envy or boast.
[time=117] It is not arrogant or rude.
[time=119] It does not insist on its own way.
[time=122] It is not irritable or resentful.
[time=126] And so today I want us to talk about this very phrase at the end of verse five.
[time=130] At the end of verse five, you see this phrase that love, love is not irritable or resentful.
[time=136] How many of you tend to be irritable sometimes?
[time=139] All right, well here's why Paul would link these two words together, did you know that the overflow and the content of your life will always be irritability if you are carrying around any resentment or bitterness?
[time=152] And those things go together and Paul says love, it is not, this is agape love.
[time=156] It's self-sacrificing others first kind of love that we only can get through the supernatural power of the Holy Spirit.
[time=163] That kind of agape love, unconditional love, it's not irritable and I think you could even say because it's not resentful.
[time=170] It's not irritable or resentful and un resentful forgiveness.
[time=174] Listen, it's not just something that God displayed to us through Christ.
[time=178] He did that, can I get an amen?
[time=180] And aren't you glad that God displayed this?
[time=182] It's not just that though.
[time=183] When it comes to following Jesus, this kind of un resentful forgiveness is not just something that we experienced from God, it's something that we live out in our own relationships.
[time=193] It's something that we embody as the body of Christ, as the church of Jesus.
[time=198] And did you know church is not about a building?
[time=200] Has 2020 not reminded us of that?
[time=203] Church is not about a building, it's about a body, it's about being the church, not just coming to a church building.
[time=209] And this is the call of God is to embody that.
[time=211] And Paul in Ephesians chapter four talks about this in great detail.
[time=215] And I wanna give you one of my favorite, one of the most powerful verses on forgiveness, Ephesians chapter four and verse 32.
[time=222] Paul says this, the same Paul who wrote to the church at Corinth, the love chapter, 1 Corinthians 13.
[time=227] He said, be kind to one another.
[time=229] Tenderhearted, forgiving one another.
[time=233] How, as God in Christ forgave you.
[time=238] Powerful verse, powerful relationship verse that God wants us to see.
[time=242] What we see in this verse is we see the model.
[time=244] How, as God in Christ forgave you.
[time=247] That's the model.
[time=249] And that model turns into methodology in our life.
[time=252] You want to have a method for forgiving in your life.
[time=255] Today, we'll follow the model that God set forth.
[time=258] And it's the model that he sent his son while we were yet sinners, we did not deserve it.
[time=262] That's the model of forgiveness that leads to the methods that we can employ in our lives to forgive.
[time=268] And I read a quote this week that I think just so well captures how God forgives us.
[time=274] The model of God's forgiveness through Christ.
[time=276] And the quote went something anonymous quote.
[time=278] Not sure where it even comes from.
[time=279] It said, the devil knows your name, but he calls you by your sin.
[time=283] But God knows your sin yet he calls you by name.
[time=287] Isn't that so true?
[time=289] The devil, he knows your name.
[time=291] If you're a follower of Jesus, he knows who you are.
[time=294] And that you're a child of the king, but he calls you by sin so that you live this condemned life where you never realize the potential of God's purpose in your life.
[time=303] Yet God knows your sin.
[time=304] And while you were dead and your trespasses and sin, he knows every skeleton in your closet.
[time=310] Even though he knows that, he still calls you by name, and that's why he sent Jesus.
[time=315] Does that not give you a picture of the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus?
[time=320] And now what I wanna do with that is help you to have some action steps to employ this verse Ephesians 4-32 in your life.
[time=327] It's one of the most powerful practical steps I've ever seen in terms of forgiveness.
[time=331] But the thing you've gotta realize about forgiveness is the person that hurts you the most.
[time=336] They may have never, or they may never, ask for your forgiveness.
[time=342] And so I ask you a question, does that mean then, following the model of God through Christ Jesus?
[time=347] Does that mean that we don't forgive?
[time=349] God forbid.
[time=350] God forgave us before we even knew we needed a savior.
[time=353] God sent Jesus to be the remission of our sins, this perfect atoning sacrifice while we were yet sinners.
[time=361] While we were dead in our trespasses, you weren't even born.
[time=365] And God, before he formed you in the womb, he knew you'd be a little sinner when you came out and took the world by storm.
[time=370] Yet he still sent Jesus.
[time=373] That's the model of forgiveness.
[time=374] And God, listen, some of you, you can't even sit down with that person that you need to forgive perhaps.
[time=380] Maybe they hurt you as a child, and maybe they've passed away.
[time=382] They're now deceased.
[time=384] And whether you're in a spot where you can sit down with someone who's asked for your forgiveness or not asked for your forgiveness, or whether you can't even do that, here's a method that I've used personally in my own life.
[time=394] And I've walked with many others to do.
[time=395] And it involves writing a letter.
[time=398] This is gonna get personal today, but that's what God's word does.
[time=401] And you're gonna be better forward if you listen to the word of God today.
[time=404] So write a letter of forgiveness to that person that hurts you.
[time=407] Is it even applies yes to them?
[time=409] And so the question is, who's the them in your life?
[time=411] Who is that person that you need to release?
[time=414] Because really, I heard it said this way in the past, that unforgiveness, resentment, bitterness, it's like drinking poison, hoping that it affects and hurts the other person.
[time=425] But all it does is tear you apart on the inside.
[time=427] And some of you've been living in that.
[time=429] So I challenge you this week.
[time=430] Write a letter of forgiveness to that person.
[time=433] And God may lead you to give it to him, or to sit down and talk through it with him, or he may not, or you may not even be able to, but there's still power in this.
[time=438] Write a letter of forgiveness.
[time=441] And then spend some time in worship.
[time=443] Spend some time in prayer.
[time=444] Put on a worship song.
[time=445] Read as many verses like Ephesians 4.32 on forgiveness as you can find, and ask God to give you the power to let it go.
[time=452] So don't forget it.
[time=453] You're scarred by that.
[time=454] Jesus showed the scars to Thomas.
[time=455] Why?
[time=456] Because the scars, they don't go away, but they build us and make us who we are so that God can do something new in our life.
[time=461] And God's ready to do that.
[time=463] And after that time of worship, I want you to light the letter on fire.
[time=466] If God leads you to read it and share it with him, do that first, or write too.
[time=469] Make a copy of it.
[time=470] But for you, I want you to light it on fire.
[time=472] And as you watch it burn, I want you to watch God burn away.
[time=475] All of the resentment, and all of the bitterness, and all the things that the enemy's been doing to hold you back and to imprison you in this terrible place where you have not yet forgiven.
[time=486] So when you're like, wow, it's a pretty deep pastor for the first part of the intro of the sermon today.
[time=492] But I wanted to start with this real application for you.
[time=495] And I challenge you to take that step this week.
[time=497] But now what I want to do is walk with you through some foundations of forgiveness, because here's what I know.
[time=502] Some of you're like, yeah, this sounds good.
[time=503] Pastor, it's Sunday.
[time=504] I'm fired up, but then Monday comes, and it is really hard to go out and actually do what we just said.
[time=509] You intend to do it within the next five days, but before you know it, five years has passed, and you still harbor resentment and unforgiveness.
[time=518] Can I get any, man?
[time=519] It's what we do as humans.
[time=521] We naturally turn inward.
[time=522] We naturally get distracted, and the enemy's trying so hard to distract you from living in the freedom of God's forgiveness that overflows into the freedom of forgiving other people in our lives.
[time=532] And by the way, maybe you need to ask somebody for forgiveness too.
[time=535] It's not just about forgiving that person who hurt you.
[time=537] Maybe you need to ask for it as well.
[time=538] Whatever it is that God's doing, I believe that a lot of times we just say, well, we just got to do it.
[time=543] But we really don't know how.
[time=544] And I think a lot of times we lack the building blocks.
[time=546] We lack the forgiveness foundations, the Christ-like foundations that really helps us implement these things.
[time=553] So I want to spend the rest of our time looking at a few ways to help you build some forgiveness foundations in your life by going or continuing in Ephesians.
[time=560] And here's what I tell you about it.
[time=562] Is that if you want, if you want or even need, if you want unresentful forgiveness, it is going to take unstubborn submission.
[time=571] I told you last week to bring the most stubborn person you know with you to church this week.
[time=575] I told you I was going to talk about stubbornness.
[time=576] And then I told you, as you bring that person, that person is probably you.
[time=580] Because I'm a pretty statement, sister.
[time=582] I'm probably the most stubborn person I know in my life sometimes.
[time=586] But if you want unresentful forgiveness, it's going to start with unstubborn submission.
[time=591] As we talk about this, this key concept really follows what Paul says in Ephesians chapter four.
[time=597] Now in Ephesians chapter five, what we see in Ephesians chapter five is this discourse about how you can live a life verses one through 20 of Ephesians chapter five.
[time=605] Read it this week.
[time=606] It's a discourse of living a life full of the spirit, letting the spirit have control of your life, letting the spirit lead you to renounce ungodliness and live a life that is full of integrity, a life that is full of character.
[time=618] And then he gets to Ephesians chapter five and verse 21.
[time=621] He's talking about how it looks in relationships, but then he gets the meat of the picture.
[time=626] In verse 21, Ephesians five, 21 says this.
[time=629] Submitting, say that to your neighbor, submitting.
[time=633] Submitting, that's the key.
[time=635] Submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.
[time=640] We're going to spend the rest of our time looking at how to submit to one another.
[time=642] What does that even mean?
[time=643] A lot of your squirming already is you're thinking, okay, well, the next verse, your husbands are like, yeah, read the next verse.
[time=648] He says, wives, submit to your husbands.
[time=650] That's to the Lord, yeah.
[time=652] And you're like, let's read that, say a prayer and go home.
[time=655] Thank you, Lord.
[time=657] And but, you know, we joke about that, but some of you, some of you, it's verses like the next verse that have caused you to get disillusioned with the church and with the word of God.
[time=665] And a lot of times we miss the real meeting and the real meat behind all of those things.
[time=670] And we're going to look at those roles in a minute, but we're going to unpack how do we submit to one another?
[time=674] What does that mean?
[time=675] But first, you got to understand what does it mean to do it out of reverence for Christ?
[time=678] This is a fear of the Lord.
[time=679] Not where you're trembling.
[time=680] Afraid God's going to strike you down, but where you have a reverence.
[time=683] Reverence is a worshipful awe, where you're just an awe of God, where that he's forgiven me, why would God forgive me?
[time=691] And if a God that is so holy, a God that is so far above where I am, so superior to me would stoop to forgive me.
[time=702] I'm in awe of him, and it's out of that awe, it's out of that reverence, it's out of that worship that we let it overflow into our relationships by submitting to one another.
[time=712] This word, submit.
[time=714] Paul uses it here, it really has the last item in his chapter five list of how we can live a life consumed by the Spirit.
[time=722] And in verses 19 and 20, you see these four present participles that are used.
[time=726] And what that is, just these ongoing actions that believers are supposed to embody in relationships and in our relationship with one another.
[time=733] He says it's addressing.
[time=735] One another is singing.
[time=736] We're doing a lot of these today, thanking God, but then the last one, submitting, submitting to one another.
[time=743] The first three were like, yeah, we talk to each other, we address each other as the church should do, and we thank God, and we sing songs and hymns and spiritual songs as we are announcing God is, but we submit to one another.
[time=753] What does this even look like?
[time=755] The word is hupatazzo, and it's used some 40-ish times in the Bible, and it's always used in a meaning, something like to place an order or to arrange in an orderly fashion.
[time=764] It gives this picture of like aligning things, lining things up like military style, in a military orderly fashion, like soldiers lining up to serve a greater purpose.
[time=774] Another couple of illustrations of that picture, hupatazzo would be something like an orchestra or a sports team, where if I'm in an orchestra, I play my instrument, but I don't play my instrument to be louder than everybody else and to get in front of everybody else, I play my instrument so that it blends in and makes a complete picture.
[time=793] I take a back seat as an individual so that the group sounds like and magnifies the right kind of sound, the right kind of result.
[time=802] The same thing's true of a sports team, just like our basketball team did last night, winning sectionals, whoop, whoop.
[time=808] Yeah, winning the sectional championship.
[time=810] That doesn't happen, coach, does it?
[time=811] If we don't play as a team, if somebody wants to be an individual and steal the show all the time, it throws everything off.
[time=818] The same thing is true in the church.
[time=820] We have to be working together as a team.
[time=824] We take a back seat as an individual so that our gifts, just like our hands and our feet, they're totally different, but we need both to be a complete picture, to be a complete team, a complete orchestra, a complete army of soldiers, to be a complete body of Christ.
[time=839] And that's the beginnings of what we're looking at here of submitting to one another.
[time=843] It's the meaning of this word.
[time=844] And really, when you think about this concept, here's what you should know.
[time=848] Paul is saying this to a group of people, that it would be very common.
[time=852] It'd be very old news to children with their parents, to slaves and masters or employees and employers and even to women.
[time=860] Did you know Jesus did more?
[time=861] We're living at a time where equality is a big thing.
[time=864] And we're gonna talk about those roles in just a few moments and people constantly ask, "Well, what do we do in this world that values us?" First of all, I tell you, Jesus did too.
[time=873] He knows that we're all created in the image of God and Jesus did so much more for women than anybody in history, in case you didn't know.
[time=879] Ladies, you should love Jesus, men we should too.
[time=882] But Jesus, 'cause he spoke about submission and women and children and these people, they would have been like, yeah, we know, we gotta submit to our husbands, they didn't have rights, a husband could divorce a wife for looking at them wrong.
[time=894] Just say it three times and it's over.
[time=896] Really, this is the kind of culture Jesus is speaking into.
[time=898] But the fact that, 'cause the next verse, by the way, is verse 22.
[time=903] And I told you, men are like, yeah, just preach that and stop.
[time=905] But I always use this passage in weddings because verse 22 is wives submit yourselves to your husbands as unto the Lord.
[time=912] Then he goes into this discourse about the men and there was a concept in this Roman century, the century of Roman families that Paul was speaking into called pater familias.
[time=922] And what it really is just a head of household, a male head of household, the oldest male in the house would be the boss, he'd be the head of the household.
[time=930] So everything that Paul was saying is like, yup, makes sense, it's old news, until he gets to this fact of starting after verse 22 of Ephesians five where he then says, and husbands love your wives, is Christ love the church and gave himself for her agape, self-sacrificing.
[time=948] It's like, now, wait a minute, I'm not supposed to have restrictions and rules and expectations, but he applied it in a way that went way deeper than the commonly known and applied concepts of submission.
[time=959] And dare I submit to you today that I think we don't get quite the depth of this concept of submitting to one another as much as even sometimes the Romans did.
[time=970] This word, here's what it takes us to.
[time=972] You notice it says submit, here's it say submit to, submit to one another, submit to one another.
[time=979] You know what it doesn't say?
[time=980] Submit to people I agree with.
[time=982] Submit to people that think like me, believe like me, look like no, it's just says submit to one another, it's really deep in the Greek.
[time=989] You know what one another means in the Greek?
[time=991] What another, them, people, general population, and that's what Paul is teaching us about.
[time=998] And every time Paul tells us to do something, he points back to Jesus.
[time=1001] Ephesians 4.32, forgive how, as God in Christ forgave you, submit to one another just as Jesus has done.
[time=1007] And I'll show you that as we go through, we'll go to the book of Philippians to help us with that.
[time=1011] But what we see, when it comes to submission and we'll break it apart what it is and what it isn't in just a moment, is that Christian submission in our relationships today really should become a competition of submission.
[time=1022] Bet you hadn't looked at your marriage like that lately.
[time=1025] All right, your kids and things like that.
[time=1027] Like, I don't submit in that relationship, don't I?
[time=1029] Oh, says to one another and Romans 12 talks about competing in giving honor and it's the same kind of concept and principle of we compete, a competition of submission.
[time=1040] And this is, it comes from a mutual selfless submission that flows out of this sacrificial agape, non-conditional love.
[time=1050] Here's what I wanna do.
[time=1051] I wanna give you two things that selfless submission, mutual submission, Ephesians 5.21 is not and then I'll give you two things that it is.
[time=1058] Let's start with what selfless submission is not.
[time=1060] Number one, selfless submission is not.
[time=1064] It is not surrendering to ungodliness.
[time=1069] A lot of times when we think, we'll submit, so you're saying I'm supposed to submit to people who don't believe like me.
[time=1074] What if they're going against the word of God?
[time=1077] Does it apply there?
[time=1078] And we'll say, well, see, I can't submit to anything like that because that means I'm being ungodly.
[time=1083] Quite the contrary, in verses one through 20 of Ephesians chapter five, and by the way, that's right before verse 21, again, so we're gonna look at before and after.
[time=1092] Paul gives this great list of how to live this uncorrupt, life full of Christian character and integrity and how to deny ourselves and deny ungodliness.
[time=1100] So it's quite the contrary.
[time=1102] Paul is teaching us selfless submission.
[time=1104] It's not surrendering to ungodliness and conforming to things that go against God's truth.
[time=1109] It's that you adhere to the things that are true.
[time=1111] It's you adhere to the word of God so much that you learn the model of Jesus and how he forgives and how he submits and how he, we're gonna look at Philippians two in a moment.
[time=1120] It's gonna rock your world.
[time=1122] How he chose to make himself nothing as he held to the truth of the scripture, he still put other people first, no matter what.
[time=1131] And I came to remind you, if you find this difficult, Jesus put you first way before you knew the truth of scripture and even began to live it.
[time=1140] So selfless submission is not surrendering to ungodliness, quite the contrary.
[time=1144] Secondly, selfless submission is not sacrificing God's definitions of relational roles.
[time=1151] Many times it's like, well, if I submit to people and put them first and all, well, I'm gonna be ungodly for number one, but then number two, God has given us unique roles, pastor, and I can't surrender to those things.
[time=1162] I can't sacrifice those things to which I say, amen.
[time=1165] It's exactly right.
[time=1166] Listen, Jesus, God created all of us with an equal mindset.
[time=1171] Humanity was created in the image of God.
[time=1174] And look at me, I don't care what you look like.
[time=1176] I don't care what your gender.
[time=1177] I don't care where you come from.
[time=1179] God loves you so much.
[time=1183] And he has given to us with that equal, equal standing before God, that equal value before God.
[time=1189] God has given us all universal roles, one of which is to submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
[time=1196] But just as much as God has given us this universal role and this universal togetherness of being one in humanity and in value to God that every single life matters so much to God, he has given us unique roles as well.
[time=1211] There are universal roles, there is this universal value, but he has given us unique roles as well.
[time=1217] And following verse 21, starting in verse 22 of Ephesians 5 all the way through chapter six and verse nine, Paul breaks apart three of those roles.
[time=1227] He does husbands and wives in marriage.
[time=1229] He talks about children and parents and he talks about slaves and masters or in our context that you could apply it to employees and employers.
[time=1237] And so I came to remind you today, look at me for a minute.
[time=1240] I know people ask, well, what do we do?
[time=1242] What do we do about all the equality movements and stuff?
[time=1246] I mean, there's good things, there's things that it's getting twisted and what do I do in that?
[time=1251] And I constantly say, live the gospel.
[time=1254] You're not surrendering to ungodliness.
[time=1256] And number two, don't sacrifice the unique role that God has given you, but put everybody before yourself.
[time=1262] That's where we're going to next.
[time=1264] But it starts with this idea and this concept.
[time=1266] Listen, that before God formed you in your mother's womb.
[time=1271] He gave you a unique purpose under the umbrella of this universal value as you are all, as we are all created in the image of God.
[time=1282] But he gave you something unique and he gave you roles to play.
[time=1285] But before he even formed you in the womb, he knew you.
[time=1288] He gave you a gender.
[time=1290] He gave you a role to play in the relationships.
[time=1293] And even though this world is so full of things that pull us away from those kinds of identities, our role is no matter who veers off that path, is to live out and live a life of godliness that puts others before ourselves that shows the love of God.
[time=1309] Play your unique role knowing that you are universally valuable to God.
[time=1314] That's what selfless submission is not.
[time=1316] It is not sacrificing God's definitions of unique roles.
[time=1321] And it's not surrendering to ungodliness.
[time=1323] Let's talk about what selfless submission is.
[time=1326] Selfless submission is.
[time=1327] And to give you a picture of this, I want to read Philippians two, three through eight, because Paul, every time he tells us to do something, he tells us to focus on what Christ did.
[time=1336] He's the model.
[time=1336] We get our method from his model.
[time=1338] And this is one of the best passages in all scripture that gives us the model, not just of forgiveness, but of putting others first, selfless submission.
[time=1345] Philippians chapter two, starting in verse three, says, do nothing from rivalry or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves.
[time=1356] Verse four, let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.
[time=1362] Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus.
[time=1367] He's giving you his mindset.
[time=1369] Verse six, who though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God, a thing to be grass, but made himself nothing.
[time=1378] Taking the form of a servant, that word servant is literally bond servant.
[time=1382] It means slave.
[time=1383] He took the lowest seed at the table.
[time=1385] Being born in the likeness of man, fully God, fully man, verse eight, and being found in human forming, humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
[time=1396] And then verse nine continues and tells us, and it's because of that, that God then exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name.
[time=1403] And at that name, the name of Jesus, the Lord of lords and the king of kings, every knee is gonna bow, and every tongue is gonna confess that he is Lord to the glory of God, the Father, and all God's people said, amen.
[time=1415] But before verse nine is verses three, the rate.
[time=1419] And in verses three and four, I wanna give you two things that selfless submission is.
[time=1422] Number one, selfless submission is counting others, counting others as more significant than yourself.
[time=1430] Notice that, again, you didn't say count others who think like me, look like me, have the exact same theological beliefs and persuasions and philosophical ideologies.
[time=1440] Count those people as more significant than yourself.
[time=1443] Greek word here again, super deep.
[time=1445] Others, it means others, it means people, it means all of them, it means even people.
[time=1449] This is why, listen folks, this is why people, we say at Black Hawk often, you can belong here even before you believe.
[time=1456] If you're a lost person and you're seeking, trying to figure out how I fit into the body of Christ, if I even believe that Jesus is who he says he is, this is why, because we are called to be a church that counts every person as more significant than ourselves.
[time=1469] It doesn't mean that we submit to the different beliefs, doesn't mean we veer off the path of believing what we believe about the truth of Scripture, but it means that as Jesus did, as God forgave us in Christ, as Jesus counted himself nothing for the sake of us, we put other people first and we love other people with the agape, unconditional love of God, even people we can't see how to eye with, we unconditionally show the love of God and count that person as more significant, more important to me than I am.
[time=1501] It's pretty quiet in here now.
[time=1505] This is hard stuff, isn't it?
[time=1506] Jesus showed us the way, but wow, it's hard to live that way.
[time=1510] And so number one, selfless submission is counting others as more significant than ourselves.
[time=1515] Philippians two, three shows us.
[time=1517] That Philippians two, four is the second thing.
[time=1519] It is considering the interest, it's considering the interests of others as well as yours.
[time=1526] Have you noticed, how many of you been on social media lately?
[time=1529] I try not to look, my blood pressure goes up a whole lot when I look there sometimes, but we live in a world, it's not true of everybody, 'cause I see some of you post great unifying posts about just who Jesus is, and I praise God for people like you, we need more of that kind of give name in.
[time=1544] So some of you need to do that some more, but what I see is a world that's full of considering my interests, making sure that I'm heard, making sure that I'm right, making sure that my point is the loudest, making sure that I win the argument in Jesus name, amen.
[time=1558] That's kind of how we look at things, but that's not in Jesus name, you know what Jesus said?
[time=1561] He said show unconditional love of God, count others as more significant than yourself, and consider their interests, I mean you don't have 'em, says in addition to yours as well as yours.
[time=1571] We consider the interests of others, this leads us to a posture of listening, leads us to a posture of learning, but more than anything, it leads us to a posture of loving, leads us to a posture of looking like Jesus, even with those knuckleheads that you need to forgive, and even those knuckleheads that you don't see eye to eye with, and it may be the most ungodly heathens you've ever met in your life.
[time=1589] That's how universal the love of God is.
[time=1591] We count others, and what it looks like is this, is that we submit to the person, we submit to the person, not their beliefs, not where they've become ungodly, we submit to the person by making them more important to me than I am, and that's the challenge.
[time=1606] That's what selfless submission is, and back to 1 Corinthians 13 and verse five, right before the end of verse five, where we see love is not irritable or resentful, we see this, and Corbin is right back there, he did a great job hitting on this, as he talked about humility and moving our chair if you were here for that.
[time=1622] Love, what does it not do?
[time=1624] It does not insist on its own way.
[time=1630] And I wanna illustrate this for you, 'cause I'm all about giving you something you can look at and remember, so I wanna come back here and introduce you to your relationships.
[time=1637] This is you and your relationships.
[time=1641] I don't know what it looks like for you, some of you are single, some of you are married, so for some of you this will represent a marriage, some of you just represents work relationships, but here we are, aren't we beautiful?
[time=1651] Talking about how we've all got these unique roles and God has given us unique roles and purposes in life that are under the umbrella of the universal value God has given to us, but these are your relationships.
[time=1661] And in our relationships, we have these things, little things called expectations.
[time=1668] And what comes between us, no matter what your relationship and what visual you get when you look at these, this picture of your relationships in life, we kinda struggle sometimes as humans when our expectations and our experiences don't match.
[time=1684] You expected that husband would take out the trash and the house stinks.
[time=1689] You expected one thing, but you experienced another thing and the list could go on.
[time=1694] We got things like how we're gonna deal with our money.
[time=1697] We have expectations about how are we gonna handle our money?
[time=1699] This is true in marriage, this is true in any relationship.
[time=1702] We got things like are we gonna have kids?
[time=1704] What's it look like to have kids?
[time=1706] So I got this baby, what does it look like to find where we live, what house are we gonna live?
[time=1710] This is baby girl and polypocket house.
[time=1713] Hashtag girl dad, they take poor Caleb and I, we don't stand a chance in our house.
[time=1718] These little pink things are everywhere.
[time=1720] But so what expectations do you have about having kids or about where you live?
[time=1724] How are you gonna manage your money?
[time=1725] What sports are we gonna play?
[time=1727] And we're Hoosiers, right?
[time=1728] So of course I brought a basketball 'cause we all expect that, right?
[time=1731] And what kind of pets are we gonna have?
[time=1732] Are we gonna have a dog or are we gonna have a cat?
[time=1735] And some of you, I have lost a lot of friends from this pulpit talking about my feline friends in not so great ways sometimes.
[time=1745] So listen, if I just offended you because I'm not a fan of cats, God created them and you're supposed to submit to me out of reverence to Christ.
[time=1753] And I'm supposed to submit to you too, but dogs are better.
[time=1757] All right, we have all these expectations.
[time=1761] I love cats too, in Jesus name, God created them.
[time=1764] I mean, even though they make me sneeze, I still love them.
[time=1767] We have all, what are we gonna drive?
[time=1769] I mean, there's all, the list goes on, does it not?
[time=1771] We have all these expectations and what comes between us and our relationships is, what happens is expectations don't align with experiences and then guess what happens?
[time=1780] Expectations start to turn into first Corinthians 13, verse five, we insist on our own way.
[time=1787] We put ourselves above the other person and then expectations start to turn into stubbornness, stubbornness.
[time=1798] We get really stubborn as we insist on our own way.
[time=1801] And then what we fail to realize is we're stubborn and we have expectations is that they are stubborn too.
[time=1809] They have expectations and they get stubborn just like me and it comes between us, our expectations and our stubbornness often starts to get in the way of us having a healthy relationship.
[time=1819] And my friend today, I came to remind us today that even when things come in between us, listen, selfless submission, it begins.
[time=1827] Are you ready for this?
[time=1828] It begins with kicking the bucket of stubbornness.
[time=1832] I came to give some new meaning to an old phrase,
[time=1838] kicking the bucket.
[time=1839] What do you think of when you're kicking the bucket?
[time=1842] Dying, I hear dying.
[time=1844] And you're like, well, what a terrible illustration, pastor to which I say, not just yet.
[time=1849] Because I think if we wanna kick the bucket of stubbornness, that's what selfless submission begins.
[time=1855] It takes dying to myself.
[time=1857] Jesus said Luke chapter nine and verse 23, anyone who wants to come after me, he must deny himself, take up his cross daily and follow me.
[time=1867] And so I think dying to self is a great picture of kicking the bucket of stubbornness.
[time=1873] It's not bad to have expectations, but when it becomes stubbornness that leads you to not mutually selflessly submit to others in your life and leads you to this resentful lack of forgiveness in your life, what you're gonna find is that you can't have a Christ-like godly relationship.
[time=1889] It is time to kick the bucket.
[time=1892] You'll never forget that now.
[time=1894] You'll never look at that phrase the same again.
[time=1896] But here's what I know, many times we'll say, well, they gotta go first.
[time=1900] If they kick their bucket, I'll kick my bucket.
[time=1904] Or we might be real spiritual that day.
[time=1906] We might say, all right, on the count of three, we'll kick our bucket at the same time.
[time=1910] We say one, two, no, listen, godly relationships.
[time=1914] Listen, Christians always seek.
[time=1916] In godly relationships, Christians always go first in an effort to be last.
[time=1922] Jesus told us this, he said, if you wanna be the greatest of all, you've gotta be the servant of all.
[time=1927] You gotta go last.
[time=1928] And Jesus showed us what it looks like to go last.
[time=1931] Mark chapter nine and verse 35.
[time=1933] And listen, I came to remind you today that at the cross, God went first.
[time=1940] While we were yet sinners, Jesus, in the Garden of Gethsemane.
[time=1945] In Luke chapter 22 and verse 42, he says, God, if there's any other way to accomplish your will, I'd really like that one, Kevin's paraphrase version.
[time=1954] But then in verse 42 of Luke 22, he says, nevertheless, not my will, but your will be done.
[time=1960] And God went first, just like Corbin taught us with humility, God moved his chair first.
[time=1965] God went first when it comes to selfless submission.
[time=1969] He became nothing, became human.
[time=1972] But he did it without sin so that he could hang on a cross, bleeding to death in the most excruciating of pain that any human could ever endure with the most spiritual pain that anybody could and will ever endure as he took on the sin of the world.
[time=1986] Jesus went first and he submitted to the plan of the Father for you and for me.
[time=1994] So I ask you today this closing question and the question is just simply, how can you, how can you kick the bucket of stubbornness in your life and take the first step?
[time=2005] Take the first step towards forgiveness.
[time=2008] I'm gonna ask you just to bow your heads and close your eyes today and come under how you can kick a bucket of stubbornness, how you can go first, take that step towards forgiveness.
[time=2017] And this is so important, don't miss this moment because believers here, I want you to ask God what step he would have you to take.
[time=2023] And for some of you, you're not a believer today and I want you to know that the gospel is true.
[time=2027] Jesus paid the price for you and for me.
[time=2029] Jesus paid it all.
[time=2032] God went first at the cross so that we could put aside our sin, our stubbornness and live an eternal life.
[time=2040] Jesus, he who knew no sin became sin.
[time=2043] He hung on the cross to pay a penalty for your sin, to become that perfect blood atoning sacrifice.
[time=2049] He took your place, became the perfect sacrifice you could never be for yourself.
[time=2054] And then he rose from the dead.
[time=2055] And because he lives, I can have salvation because he lives, I can walk forever in this love, this unconditional love that God gave to us through Jesus and forgiveness that he has shown to us in Christ.
[time=2068] And we can live out on stubborn submission because we're living in the unconditional love of God, this unresentful forgiveness that God showed us the way and now we can live it out.
[time=2077] But it starts with a personal relationship with Jesus.
[time=2080] All heads are bowed, all eyes are closed in the building, on the screens, in the homes or wherever you might be right now, stop and pray right now.
[time=2087] As believers are praying how God would help them take that step towards submission today, some of you are ready to surrender your life to Jesus.
[time=2095] I mean, it's not about a prayer of words, but I'm gonna lead you in a prayer.
[time=2098] You can pray from your heart with your own word.
[time=2100] Just say, Lord Jesus, please forgive me of my sin.
[time=2103] I know that I'm such a sinner.
[time=2104] I know that I need you so much.
[time=2107] I believe you died for me on that cross.
[time=2110] I believe you rose again.
[time=2111] I believe you are alive today.
[time=2114] And Jesus, I repent.
[time=2115] I turn away from me being the source of my salvation.
[time=2119] I turn away from sin.
[time=2121] I turn towards Jesus and I surrender all of me Jesus to you.
[time=2125] I give you me today.
[time=2128] Today's the day of my salvation in Jesus name.
[time=2131] You cry that out, you pray it to the Father.
[time=2134] And he's gonna hear you and anyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
[time=2138] You take a moment right now and reflect, Take that step if you haven't already.
