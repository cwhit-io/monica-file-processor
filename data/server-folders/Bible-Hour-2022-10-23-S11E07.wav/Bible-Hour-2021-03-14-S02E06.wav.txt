[time=0] All right, open your Bibles with me to 1 Corinthians chapter 13.
[time=5] I've shared some about Easter.
[time=6] We're so excited.
[time=7] But let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 13.
[time=10] And we'll continue this series unconditional today.
[time=12] I want to talk to you about uncorrupt integrity.
[time=15] Uncorrupt integrity.
[time=17] We're looking at the fact that Paul is teaching us 1 Corinthians 12 and 14 about spiritual gifts.
[time=22] That's the context.
[time=23] But the content in the middle in chapter 13, a.k.a.
[time=27] the love chapter, is this overflowing supernatural grace.
[time=32] That's the content that just consumes our life.
[time=34] And guys, how we use our gifts, how we make a difference.
[time=37] And so we're zooming in to look at how relationships, to look at how relationships can be impacted by God.
[time=43] Listen though, undoing some things in our life so that his unconditional love overflows in our relationships and in our world.
[time=52] So God wants to undo some things like corruption.
[time=55] And we live in a world that has fallen and broken and full of sin.
[time=60] And God wants us to be a light in the darkness through integrity.
[time=64] And so he wants to undo some things, but wants to instill some things in you.
[time=67] We'll start at 1 Corinthians chapter 13.
[time=70] And then we will go to Proverbs chapter 4.
[time=72] And we'll just walk through that verse by verse to hopefully embody and apply what Paul is teaching us about, specifically in verse 6.
[time=80] So if you missed last week, you can catch up any time on our website, but let's dig in to God's Word today.
[time=86] Are you ready for the Word, Black Heart?
[time=88] I'm gonna start asking you this second question, 'cause sometimes we just get in the routine.
[time=91] Are you sure you're ready?
[time=93] Because it's gonna undo some things and really dig into your heart.
[time=95] So let's dig in together.
[time=97] First Corinthians 13, starting in verse one.
[time=99] This is our focus for our series.
[time=101] If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging symbol.
[time=109] And if I have prophetic powers and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.
[time=121] Verse three, if I give away all that I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.
[time=129] Verse four, love is patient and kind.
[time=132] Love does not envy or boast.
[time=134] It is not arrogant or rude.
[time=136] It does not insist in its own way.
[time=139] It is not irritable or resentful.
[time=142] That's where we left off last week.
[time=143] Now this week we're focusing on verse six.
[time=145] Here it is.
[time=146] It does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.
[time=153] And I pray that the word of God will just overflow in us and penetrate our hearts this week.
[time=157] And I want us to look at this phrase.
[time=159] It does not, this love, this agape love.
[time=161] That's the word for love.
[time=162] It's a self-sacrificing, unconditional love that always puts others first.
[time=167] It's a love that we can't achieve on our own.
[time=169] It's a love that is supernaturally given to us by God through Christ that we live out to one another because of his strength in us through the power of his Holy Spirit is the kind of love that Paul is talking about here.
[time=181] But it doesn't rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoice is in the truth.
[time=185] I've learned in this world, we kind of are bent this way as humans.
[time=189] We try to push boundaries, don't we?
[time=192] If you've ever been a parent, did you have to teach your kids to push the boundaries of your rules in your home?
[time=197] Well, guess what?
[time=198] All we do is become big kids and we do the same thing.
[time=201] In this world, it's kind of natural to try to kind of see what we can get away with.
[time=205] And that's what Paul's talking about.
[time=207] We don't rejoice at seeing how far we can go, what lines we can bump up against without crossing them, how much we can get away with.
[time=213] We don't rejoice at wrongdoing, but we rejoice at the truth.
[time=216] And so my goal for you today is that as we look at this concept and go to Proverbs 4 in just a moment, I'm gonna fill you with Proverbs 4, but as many other supporting scriptures, I'm gonna fill you with as much truth from God's word as we can squeeze in together because that's what we are to rejoice in.
[time=232] And so one of the greatest things, my friends, if you want your relationships to be impacted, if you want to make a kingdom difference, an eternal impact through your life.
[time=241] And I believe you're here or you're watching today because you just want that in your life or you're at least exploring what that could or should look like in your life.
[time=248] And we're glad you're here nonetheless.
[time=250] But if you wanna make a kingdom impact, one of the best ways you can do that I have learned is to live out an uncorrupt, integrity-driven life on Monday just as much as you do with your church smiles on Sunday mornings.
[time=265] You know what people often say to me when I'll talk about coming to church.
[time=268] It's like, yeah, pastor, I'd come, but I don't wanna go to church.
[time=271] And what do you think they say?
[time=272] Because it's full of hypocrites.
[time=275] Some of you have said it or maybe you're here today because it's like, yes, well, I hadn't been here in a while.
[time=279] Maybe it's why you're just watching online perhaps even.
[time=282] And it's true because we're hypocritical people and I always joke and say, hey, come on, one more won't hurt because we're all in that together.
[time=289] But it's so true, our actions and what we live out on a daily basis, it matters so much.
[time=294] And sometimes we try to go about it through our own self-help efforts.
[time=298] And we think, I'm gonna just try a little bit harder this week and then we fall flat on our face.
[time=302] But the kind of help that Paul is describing is a supernatural-driven power that equips us in life to live out the kind of integrity we're called to live out, even when our strength won't do what it needs to do.
[time=316] James chapter four, verse 17 is about as clear of a picture of this.
[time=320] Remember, it is a sin to know what you ought to do and not do it.
[time=326] Let us pray.
[time=328] I'm just kidding, we can dig into that a little more, but that pretty much sums it up, doesn't it?
[time=331] But that's hard to live out.
[time=333] That is a difficult thing to take into your relationships when they become a knucklehead.
[time=338] And when you become a knucklehead and then when two knuckleheads come together and they butt heads, relationships get hard and life gets difficult.
[time=345] So we're gonna dig into this a little more, this concept of integrity.
[time=348] And I start by telling you this, it is always right to do what is right.
[time=353] It is always right to do what is right.
[time=356] But it is always difficult to do what is right, even though that you know that it is always right.
[time=362] Can I get another amen?
[time=363] It's difficult to do.
[time=364] So let's dig into it together.
[time=365] Today I wanna take you to Proverbs chapter four.
[time=368] This is a passage that really embodies this picture that Paul is painting of uncorrupt integrity in the context of spiritual gifts and how we are to build the body of Christ.
[time=378] And so here's what I got to warn you though.
[time=380] I don't know how much you work out or whatnot, but this passage is a full body workout.
[time=385] You are going to be sore this week if you apply this passage.
[time=389] And you'll see why I'm saying that as we read it, Proverbs chapter four.
[time=392] Let's read verses 18 through 27, starting in verse 18, but the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day.
[time=404] The way of the wicked, the opposite here, corruption, the way of the wicked is like deep darkness.
[time=409] They do not know over what they stumble and maybe that's where you've been.
[time=414] This is the contrast of integrity.
[time=416] It's light and darkness and maybe you've been stumbling in darkness and it's time for God's light to illuminate your heart.
[time=421] And here's the part of the passage that will give you the full body workout.
[time=424] We'll go through it verse by verse, verse 20.
[time=426] My son, be attentive to my words and climb your ear to my sayings.
[time=431] The context here is from Solomon in Proverbs.
[time=434] Why does this man to ever live?
[time=435] And it's the context of a father speaking to a son with wise instructions.
[time=439] So hear it as such.
[time=440] So be attentive to my words.
[time=442] He says, verse 21, let these sayings, let this instruction.
[time=445] Let them not escape from your sight.
[time=448] Keep them within your heart.
[time=451] For they are life to those who find them and healing to all their flesh.
[time=457] Verse 23, keep your heart again with all vigilance for from it flow the springs of life.
[time=464] Put away from you crooked speech and put devious talk from you.
[time=471] Let your eyes look directly forward and your gaze be straight before you.
[time=478] Ponder the path of your feet.
[time=480] Then all of your ways will be sure.
[time=482] Verse 27, do not swerve to the right or to the left, turn your foot away from evil.
[time=488] And you can see where there's this context of a full body workout going on in this passage and how it has to do with integrity.
[time=495] So I wanna give you five indicators of integrity.
[time=498] Five indicators of integrity.
[time=500] The first comes from verse 20 and it is integrity of the ears.
[time=504] Integrity of the ears.
[time=506] In verse 20, we see Solomon writing to us, be attentive to my words.
[time=510] Listen up, my friends.
[time=512] So what you're gonna see is that what goes in here shows up here.
[time=516] Everybody do this for just a moment.
[time=518] Let's get an exercise in.
[time=519] You have a brain.
[time=520] I know some of you are questioning that this morning, but it does exist.
[time=524] And God did give it to you and it is functional.
[time=526] And it's in the center.
[time=528] But on the side do this, are two ears.
[time=531] And what goes in here affects here.
[time=533] And we're learning here this connection between our thought life and what we think and the power of the mind.
[time=540] But it starts with this attentiveness of the ears.
[time=543] Integrity of the ears.
[time=544] And with each of these five indicators, I'm gonna try to give you several questions.
[time=548] You could just jot down.
[time=549] You don't have to write it my way.
[time=550] Personalize it, write it down.
[time=551] However, it makes sense to you that you can ponder as some devotional thoughts this week to apply and to assess these indicators of integrity.
[time=559] For listening, I'll give you this question is, who are water you listening to?
[time=564] And be honest with yourself.
[time=565] Who are water you listening to?
[time=567] What voices are flooding your brain hearing and your thought life has a little bit more to do?
[time=572] And we'll get to the eyes in a moment with perspective and what's consuming you in your life.
[time=576] What's driving you?
[time=577] What are you listening to?
[time=578] Not just with your ears, with headphones and what people are having the opportunity to speak into your life.
[time=584] But what are you allowing to penetrate your mind through your ears, what you hear as a starting place?
[time=589] And that's why this wise, wise father is saying to a son, saying to us like God says to us, be attentive to these words.
[time=597] Really let them penetrate your heart.
[time=599] That's why I asked you twice.
[time=600] Are you sure you're ready for the word?
[time=602] And this is what God wants to do in our heart and in our lives.
[time=605] But here's what I believe about that.
[time=607] That your choices about voices, your choices about voices are gonna determine the course of your thought life.
[time=613] They'll determine the course of your direction in life.
[time=617] Who you choose to listen to?
[time=618] Who's pouring into you?
[time=620] Who are you listening to on the podcast?
[time=622] Who are you clicking on with the links?
[time=624] Who gets the opportunity to give you guidance and wise counsel when you're in tough seasons?
[time=629] And even Bader, I say it.
[time=630] What are you even saying to yourself?
[time=633] What do you, 'cause I always tell you, don't let me be the only long-winded preacher in your life.
[time=637] You preach to yourself.
[time=640] You study the scripture and let God speak to you but remind yourself of that truth.
[time=645] So whose voice or what voice is pouring into your life?
[time=650] The devil is screaming lies at you right now.
[time=652] So I ask you this other question.
[time=654] What lies are you believing lately?
[time=656] My brother, Rayburn, in the back.
[time=657] I ask that question just about to me and anybody he comes in contact with all the time.
[time=661] It's a great question.
[time=662] What lies have you been believing?
[time=664] The enemy screams lies but the father who loves you so much is whispering his truth with a still small voice.
[time=672] But as we talked about clutter today, sometimes we get so flooded with so much through our ears and in our mind that we miss the still small voice of the truth of God in our life.
[time=682] And so the integrity of the ears is not just an indicator but it's a beginning point of us living the life that God has us to live.
[time=689] I think it's Proverbs 23 verse seven that says as you think in your heart that you will be.
[time=695] As what goes in here penetrates here, it starts to show up here and whether you walk with your hands and your feet, what you do with your life.
[time=702] So number one is integrity of the ears.
[time=705] Number two coming from verses 21 through 23 is integrity of the heart.
[time=710] Integrity of the heart.
[time=712] And this is these heart level issues much like what I taught you about last week as we looked at unreasonable forgiveness.
[time=719] This is bitterness.
[time=721] This is anger.
[time=722] This is hatred that wells up in our heart becomes a deep root in our life that often can spring forth all of this bad fruit.
[time=728] These are heart issues in our life and verses 21 through 23 gives us a picture of that.
[time=734] And really through those three verses, we hear two things.
[time=737] The first one is to keep these things, these principles, these wise sayings and instructions.
[time=744] He says keep them in your heart.
[time=746] That's the first thing he says there in verse 21.
[time=749] Later he says, and he says they're gonna well up in you and do all these great things in you 23.
[time=753] He says and keep your heart.
[time=755] So keep these wise instructions and the truth of God in your heart, but keep your heart in the truth.
[time=761] It works both ways.
[time=763] It becomes the cyclical pattern of integrity in our life is what we see being described.
[time=767] It starts with integrity of the ears and it penetrates our hearts and consumes who we are.
[time=773] How many of you have ever heard this advice?
[time=775] Just follow your heart.
[time=778] What should I do in this situation?
[time=781] Just follow your heart.
[time=783] Can I tell you some truth about that and I may bust some bubbles here?
[time=787] That is horrible advice.
[time=789] It's terrible.
[time=792] Why?
[time=793] I'm gonna show it to you in scripture in a moment, but I'll tell you why because really your heart is gonna guide you by what you feel.
[time=798] If you ever let your feelings guide you before, if you ever notice the feelings go (whooshing) and you go left and right and up and down in your feelings guide you.
[time=807] I've got an upgraded version of a picture I've shown you before and this is the train of your life.
[time=811] Everybody say, ooh, ah, it's beautiful.
[time=814] This is the train of your life and the engine of your life has to be Christ.
[time=819] He has to drive, but so many times don't we say, hey, can you scooch over just a little Jesus?
[time=824] Give me that steering wheel for just a moment and we wanna drive, but he's gotta drive and here's what we do.
[time=828] There's the fact, the fact of scripture, the fact of who God is, the fact that he who knew no sin became sin so that we could become the righteousness of God, the fact and the truth of the gospel of who Jesus is and of the word of God and we put our faith in the fact.
[time=845] The driver is the one who wrote it all to begin with, the writer of scripture, the giver of all good things, the creator of the universe and he's put forth some facts that we can base our life on.
[time=856] We can put our faith in the facts of who God is and I'm so glad that there's something factual and foundational that we can put our faith in in a world that feels so shaky.
[time=865] Can I get a name in?
[time=866] But notice, what is the caboose?
[time=868] Caboose, say that with me?
[time=870] Feeling, feelings are the caboose.
[time=873] They follow, you should write this down.
[time=875] Feelings must follow not lead.
[time=880] But so many times with our heart, when we follow our heart, we end up following our feelings and we take the caboose that just swerves left and right, goes all over the place sometimes and we try to make it the engine or maybe it's the first car but then it bumps up to driving our life.
[time=895] This is a powerful principle that can change the course of your life with what you hear with how you think and how your heart gets consumed.
[time=904] And so may your feelings follow and not lead.
[time=907] And it's this process when feelings aren't the caboose and they start to drive that leads you to say things like, you know, I just don't feel in love with my wife anymore.
[time=918] I don't feel the same.
[time=919] My husband doesn't make me feel the same as he used to.
[time=922] I don't feel the butterflies with my spouse like I do with that person at work or if you're not married, you know, I don't feel like loving that person as a parent.
[time=933] I don't feel like being a parent today, can I get a name in a parent sometimes?
[time=937] It's just true, it's just real.
[time=938] I don't feel like doing that and it starts to drive whatever it is in your life, whatever feelings drive, it drives you crazy and it drives you off the course that God has for your life.
[time=948] Let me prove it to you in scripture.
[time=949] Jeremiah chapter 17 gives you a great picture of your heart and it's probably not the one that came to mind earlier.
[time=955] The heart is deceitful above all things.
[time=958] It is desperately sick.
[time=961] Who can understand it?
[time=964] Okay, now I'm not gonna follow my heart anymore, right?
[time=968] We are marred by sin, but God wants to come into our life, consume our thoughts, consume our heart, be our heartbeat and our passion in such a way that He drives and the feelings will end up following in our life and then what it starts to do is overflowing with what we say at least in number three, but before a segue there, let me show you something from Luke chapter six verse 45.
[time=988] This is a great picture of integrity and what the heart does in terms of what we say before I give you number three.
[time=994] A good man brings good things out of the good, stored up in his heart and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart.
[time=1004] So there's the heart part.
[time=1005] Now this last part segues us to number three.
[time=1008] For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.
[time=1013] Number three, indicator of integrity is integrity of the mouth.
[time=1019] And I brought a picture for you.
[time=1022] I used this in the gym.
[time=1023] How many of you were in the gym when we did the tongue as a fire and we looked at what James has to say about words?
[time=1029] Come over there, raise your hand, I'm curious.
[time=1031] Okay, some of you are new and this is something that we used in that series.
[time=1037] Some of you need this in your life because the heart is pretty wicked.
[time=1043] Look at your neighbor and say, you're wicked, just tell them.
[time=1047] You're welcome for that 'cause some of you've been just waiting on that opportunity and you just didn't know it was gonna come in a sermon.
[time=1051] Now look back at that person and say, but I am too.
[time=1056] 'Cause it's true, you need one of these caution, warning, beware of mouth.
[time=1063] Not if you agree that you could use a sign like this.
[time=1066] And I'm gonna preach this whole point in this as uncomfortable as it is because I hope you remember this this week that there's so much power in our tongue and our mouth.
[time=1074] Verse 24 is where we see this, put crooked speech away and away from you put this devious talk.
[time=1080] And so we have a sign like this to remind us of this key verse, Proverbs 18 and verse 21 reminds us that the tongue has the power of life and death and those who love it will eat its fruit.
[time=1092] Some of us love to hear ourselves talk and we eat the fruit of what we talk about sometimes too much.
[time=1097] And in that series, "The Tongue is a Fire," we looked at what James had to say about this whole scenario here.
[time=1102] We had a motion that we did.
[time=1104] So I wanna ask you to do it with me if you remember and if you're new with us, now you'll know for next time.
[time=1108] Are you ready for it?
[time=1109] We had this motion and it's like this.
[time=1111] Be quick to listen, slow to speak.
[time=1115] Let's do it again.
[time=1116] Quick to listen, slow to speak because there's power.
[time=1121] The power of life and death is in the tongue.
[time=1123] And when it comes to your integrity, one of the greatest drivers of having it or not having it, whether corruption or integrity is leading the way is what you say.
[time=1132] And so may we live out this truth and hopefully ask questions something like this.
[time=1137] We've asked the question, who are you listening to?
[time=1139] A good question for your heart would be, where in my life are feelings leading where they should be following, right?
[time=1145] We looked at that, where are feelings leading?
[time=1147] And for this, I ask you this question is, how can my words build up instead of tear down?
[time=1152] How can my words build up instead of tear down?
[time=1155] Will you say, well, what am I building up?
[time=1157] Yes, yep, you're called to build up.
[time=1161] We're not called to tear down.
[time=1162] We're called to build up.
[time=1163] We're called to build the body of Christ.
[time=1165] We're called to build our family.
[time=1166] We're called to build people.
[time=1167] Just like Jesus, while we were yet sinners, He died for us and He came and He spoke truth and life.
[time=1173] And He is the way and the truth and the life.
[time=1174] And we don't come to the Father except through Him.
[time=1177] So how can my words build up instead of tear down?
[time=1181] And I'm going to still keep this on because this is just so relevant for us.
[time=1184] And one of the ways, and maybe one of the greatest ways in today's world, whether it be in your family, in your workplaces, and certainly even in the church that the enemy is using lies, is through lies.
[time=1197] But through gossip and through mouths that just do this.
[time=1201] And scripture has so much to say about gossip and it applies to your work, it applies to your family, it applies wherever you are, it applies certainly.
[time=1209] And sometimes even more so to God's church.
[time=1213] And so I want to talk to you about that for just a moment and help us have some parameters that come from scripture.
[time=1218] Matthew chapter 18 gives us a clearer picture of when we don't like something or we have a problem with someone, we go to the person.
[time=1224] And so we have this mantra as a staff here that we don't talk about, we talk to.
[time=1229] We talk to people, not about people.
[time=1232] And may that be your heartbeat?
[time=1234] And it's not my plan, it's the plan of scripture.
[time=1236] It's the truth because we don't rejoice in wrongdoing but we rejoice in the truth.
[time=1241] And I think it's Dave Ramsey's organization that defines gossip in their organization and speaking to anyone about a problem that that person can't solve.
[time=1249] And so I know that has a lot of different layers, has a lot of different applications.
[time=1253] If you're a CEO, if you're a leader, you've got to listen and have ways to lead your managers.
[time=1258] I get that there's so many layers, but listen my friends, Satan wants to take your words and twist them.
[time=1265] And sometimes we just listen and sometimes listening can be good and you have to use the discernment, but listen, listen.
[time=1271] Sometimes listening ends up fostering.
[time=1273] And we'll say, hey, tell me a little more because you ready?
[time=1277] Because I want to pray for them.
[time=1278] You know what I'm talking about?
[time=1281] We see it so many times and we do this so many times and Satan uses these simple small little things to tear down God's church and the family and all of the great things that God is building.
[time=1293] And may we wear our sign and may we read our sign and instead of fostering and applying those principles, sure, in all the different ways and all the different varying circumstances that you find yourself in.
[time=1305] But always, before you speak, quick to listen, but always quick to redirect, always quick to say, hey, I don't know if you've talked to that person, but if you haven't, you should do that.
[time=1316] I'm gonna go with you if you even want me to go with you instead of talking about we talk to, instead of lying, we press into the truth.
[time=1324] Instead of rejoicing in wrongdoing, we rejoice in the truth and the words are one of the greatest ways that this shows up.
[time=1332] And when it comes to this Proverbs, chapter number 12, verse 22 says lying lips are an abomination to the Lord, but those who act faithfully, sounds like integrity are his delight.
[time=1343] And Stephen Covey wrote a book called The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.
[time=1348] Great book, it's an older book.
[time=1350] I've read through it so many times.
[time=1351] The number five habit there is seek first to understand, then to be understood.
[time=1356] And I'm gonna give you a verse that from the new living translation that I think just captures this and the reality of our world in so many great ways.
[time=1363] Proverbs chapter 18 and verse two says fools have no interest in understanding.
[time=1369] They only want to air their own opinions.
[time=1373] Beware of mouth.
[time=1376] That's our world, isn't it?
[time=1377] A world that screams to be heard first, but Jesus always paused and sat with people and listened, even though he didn't just know the truth like you and me, he was the truth.
[time=1389] And yet he still sought to understand and walk with people and listen so that he could then.
[time=1395] And listen, Jesus spoke hard truth.
[time=1396] We're gonna look at the relationships of Jesus this fall and we're gonna see him and he flipped tables.
[time=1401] He had whips, yes, I said it and I'll show you.
[time=1403] And we'll look at it later this fall, but he always started with this posture of listening and understanding and seeking to love people than agape, unconditional kind of love.
[time=1414] And I can tell you my worst moments in marriage, my worst moments in ministry, my worst moments as a parent, they have come when I have first spoke, second listened.
[time=1424] And so may we pause.
[time=1426] And may this scripture be true of us.
[time=1427] Psalm 141 and verse three, set a guard.
[time=1431] This is what I prayed for you and for myself.
[time=1432] So we wear a sign.
[time=1434] Set a guard, oh Lord, over my mouth.
[time=1436] Can I get an amen?
[time=1437] Keep watch over the door of my lips.
[time=1442] Integrity of the mouth.
[time=1445] Can I take this off now?
[time=1446] It's kind of embarrassing.
[time=1447] Beware of mouth, integrity of the mouth.
[time=1451] And let me go to number four, integrity of the eyes.
[time=1454] Number four, integrity of the eyes.
[time=1455] This comes from verse 25 of Proverbs 4, integrity of the eyes.
[time=1459] And verse 25, we see this picture of looking forward and he says gaze straight ahead.
[time=1465] And so men, women, those who struggle with lust, where we get in trouble, Jesus said if you've lusted after someone, you've committed adultery in your heart.
[time=1472] I mean, that's the standard of God.
[time=1475] And what gets you in trouble is the second look, right?
[time=1477] And this is why, this is a great passage.
[time=1479] We look straight ahead.
[time=1480] But then somebody comes along, it's good looking guy or this good looking girl.
[time=1484] And we glance, but then we glance again.
[time=1486] And then before long, this is straight ahead.
[time=1487] We start to veer off the path.
[time=1492] And you do that not just in relationships or in attraction like that, in lustful thinking, but you do that in every area of life.
[time=1499] I do that in every area of life.
[time=1500] We look to the left or to the right and we lose sight of where we're supposed to be focused and where we're supposed to go.
[time=1506] This is what you truly allow.
[time=1508] Jesus said that the eye is the lamp of the body, saying that it's the gateway into your heart, into your soul, into who you are.
[time=1515] It's not just something that you do with your eyes.
[time=1517] It is a gateway into becoming who God wants you to be.
[time=1520] Jesus reminds us of that.
[time=1522] And that's why I often tell you, go biblical before you go digital.
[time=1526] And so I ask you, what's the first thing that you look at when you get up in the morning?
[time=1531] Is it email or text messages or Twitter or Instagram or Facebook or whatever it might be?
[time=1537] Those things are not bad, but if you consume your perspective by letting your eyes gaze there before you gaze on truth, then guess what?
[time=1544] What's going in here?
[time=1546] Won't be going here.
[time=1547] It won't be penetrating here.
[time=1549] And you certainly won't be speaking it here.
[time=1551] And then you're going to find that you're off course.
[time=1553] And you're looking left and you're looking right and you're missing the point of where we are supposed to focus as followers of Jesus who live out uncorrupt integrity.
[time=1562] So maybe keep our eyes focused where they need to go.
[time=1565] Some of you are here and you struggle with pornography.
[time=1568] And it's time to stop letting your eyes look at things that completely detract from God's plan, from marriage and relationships and sex and to focus on Jesus.
[time=1577] And listen, you can't do it on your own pornography numbers during COVID-19, this year of pandemic.
[time=1583] This is one year, by the way, tomorrow's one year from the first Sunday I got back from a trip and had to come in here and preach just to that with about 10 other people in the room and it was just the craziest year.
[time=1592] But since then, pornography numbers have skyrocketed.
[time=1595] Why?
[time=1596] Because we're isolated, we're locked in a room and we're all by ourselves and listen to my friends, you need community, you need accountability, you need relationships.
[time=1605] This is why we preach life groups.
[time=1607] We're not meant to do this on our own.
[time=1609] We are meant to have friends, to have family members who struggle just like we do.
[time=1613] This is what happens in life group.
[time=1615] But we fix our eyes on Jesus and the truth of his word together and we laugh together and we cry together and we say hard things to each other, but we do it through the context of unconditional love that comes from the Father through Jesus Christ.
[time=1629] If I convince you to get into life group yet, we have great life groups and you should find one and I want to help you be able to do that in our church.
[time=1636] This is why it's so important.
[time=1638] In Hebrews chapter 12 and verse two, we see the picture of Jesus and we're to fix our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer, perfecter of faith.
[time=1645] And here's what he did, he showed us how to do this.
[time=1647] For the joy set before him.
[time=1649] Now we're gonna talk about the cross, joy, cross.
[time=1651] I don't look at it that way, but Jesus did because he was focused on God's plan for his life.
[time=1656] For the joy set before him, he endured the cross, scorning at shame and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
[time=1665] That's what we're called to do, to have integrity of the eyes.
[time=1668] And what you do with your eyes is really an act of worship.
[time=1671] A great quote I read from Bob Coughlin on worship this week says this, that to worship God is to humble everything about ourselves and exalt everything about him.
[time=1682] So here's a good question you could ponder this week about your eyes is how can my eyes be an act of worship this week?
[time=1688] How can my eyes exalt God instead of tear down his work in my life?
[time=1694] Personalize that question and ask how your eyes are worshipful or perhaps the opposite and how God would empower you to take steps toward him.
[time=1701] And so today there's a song about this by the way, I love it, it's a little song that we sing as a kid.
[time=1707] [MUSIC]
[time=1709] Sing it with me if you know it.
[time=1711] [MUSIC - 8 seconds]
[time=1723] My favorite part of that phrase, it's not even the be careful part, that's a good part.
[time=1728] I love for the father up above is looking down with, I thought it often feels like he's looking down with, I'm gonna squash you if you do that again.
[time=1738] Judgment and wrath and hatred towards this because we're so, no, he's looking down, that's so true in scripture.
[time=1745] I saw some of you sleeping by the way, that's why I did that too.
[time=1748] (congregation laughing) You didn't think I could see the lights are bright, but not that bright.
[time=1751] (congregation laughing) He looks down with unconditional love and while we were yet sinners he sent Jesus to die for us.
[time=1758] And it's his empowering that gives us integrity of the ears and of the heart and of the mouth, of the eyes, it's his Holy Spirit, it's his identity instilled and deposited on the inside of us that gives us the ability to live out that love and conditionally in our relationships, to look in the right directions and to follow him with our life and then to take steps to go there.
[time=1783] Number five is integrity of the feet.
[time=1785] This is the last one I'll share with you.
[time=1786] Comes from verses 26 and 27, integrity of the feet.
[time=1789] This is the direction, the course of your life.
[time=1792] In verse 26, ponder the path of your feet, be sure in your way.
[time=1796] This is where integrity turns into walking the talk.
[time=1799] It's one thing to talk the talk, but it's another thing to walk what you talk.
[time=1803] Walk the walk.
[time=1803] That's where the rubber meets the road.
[time=1805] That's where integrity truly gets lived out.
[time=1808] And so a good question for you to ask yourself about where you're going is what is keeping my faith from true center right now?
[time=1814] What is keeping my faith?
[time=1816] Not just my focus with the eyes, but my feet from true center, from staying on that narrow path of integrity.
[time=1821] What's pulling me off to the left or to the right?
[time=1824] Proverbs 10, 9 says, "Whoever walks in integrity walks securely, but he who makes his ways crooked will be found out." What we do in the dark, eventually light is going to shine and it's going to come to the forefront.
[time=1840] And so I want to live in the light.
[time=1842] I want to walk in the light, but I can't do that on my own.
[time=1846] I need the strength of God's Holy Spirit power inside of me and I need others to walk alongside of me.
[time=1850] It's almost like God knew what he was doing when he instituted the church and said, "I'm going to build my church and even the gates of hell won't prevail against it." It's like God knew that we needed him and we needed each other.
[time=1859] Amazing how God's so far ahead of us.
[time=1860] It's because he did know that.
[time=1862] And it's because he did build his church.
[time=1863] And even when it feels like it's losing and you're not in the winning team kind of predicament, he's still on the throne.
[time=1871] He's still alive.
[time=1873] He's still building his church and I still want to follow him.
[time=1876] Verse 27 says, "Don't swerve right or left, but turn your foot away from evil." So integrity of the feet.
[time=1882] The Apostle Paul wrote to a lot of churches.
[time=1884] Most of his letters are to churches and he's like a master mechanic.
[time=1888] Have you ever had a car alignment?
[time=1890] As you know, your car was going left and it was veering to the right.
[time=1892] Well, Paul was like a master mechanic.
[time=1894] He would write these letters to churches like the churches at Galatia who maybe they were veering off to the right.
[time=1898] They veered towards legalism.
[time=1900] Or he wrote to the church at Corinth, which is 1 Corinthians 13, the love chapter.
[time=1904] He wrote about veering off to the left, which is liberalism, legalism, liberalism, all the other isms and all the other problems and stuff that we bring to the table.
[time=1912] And he said, it's time to get some alignment.
[time=1914] It's time to get back true center.
[time=1915] Stop veering to the left.
[time=1918] Stay true center.
[time=1919] Stay focused and keep moving towards the heart of God for the church and may we be the church because we've learned this year in a pandemic.
[time=1926] The church is not about something we go to.
[time=1928] It's about something that we are.
[time=1930] It's what we do with our lives is who God has made us through the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1935] And as I thought about integrity this week, a lot of times we'll say things like integrity is what you do and no one's looking.
[time=1941] Great true statement.
[time=1942] But I'll try to unpack that in my mind.
[time=1944] And here's a statement for you.
[time=1945] I believe what you do in your leisure time.
[time=1948] This is when no one's looking and you could do anything you want to.
[time=1951] What you do in your leisure time?
[time=1952] Somebody saw this early this morning who shall remain nameless and said, in all my leisure time, I nap.
[time=1958] And I was like, well, hey, that's a pretty good biblical rest and Sabbath.
[time=1964] I mean, these are great things, right?
[time=1965] So that's good.
[time=1966] But what you do in your leisure time is an indicator of your integrity.
[time=1972] Well, nobody's looking.
[time=1973] I found in my life where I veered off course just usually in those times when no one's looking and I could be doing anything I want.
[time=1978] Instead of keeping my eyes fixed on Jesus and following him and his word, I'll end up thinking about or doing things that have nothing to do with eternity and have everything to do with Kevin.
[time=1988] And so maybe you can relate and maybe we keep our eyes fixed on Jesus and keep following after him.
[time=1994] And if you don't value your time, you'll always end up wasting it.
[time=1997] I've learned that.
[time=1998] Maybe you need to value your time in a new way this week and look at leisure time, look at intentional time being invested in going the direction of God.
[time=2007] And then integrity is gonna show up, not just publicly with the church smile or we put on the church smile on Sunday.
[time=2012] It'll show up on Monday, even privately, when no one else is looking and we know that God always is.
[time=2018] It is always right to do what is right.
[time=2022] In Proverbs chapter 20 and verse seven, says the righteous who walks in his integrity, blessed are his children after him.
[time=2030] Generational blessings and impact happen when we follow our Lord together.
[time=2034] I wanna ask you to bow your heads, close your eyes.
[time=2037] I don't know what has spoken to you the most if it's integrity of the ears, integrity of the heart, integrity of the mouth, or the eyes, or the feet, or all of them.
[time=2045] But if you're here today and God has immediately put on your heart something that you've gotta do, a step you've gotta take to really follow after him.
[time=2051] Would you lift your hand so I can pray for you in a moment?
[time=2053] So man, I just know it's burning in my soul.
[time=2055] I see you all over the building.
[time=2057] I praise God for you.
[time=2058] Put your hands down at home, do the same.
[time=2060] God sees you even when I can't.
[time=2062] But some of you are here and you would say, you know, Jesus lived out that integrity and I realized that I have none.
[time=2068] I'm a sinner and I need Jesus.
[time=2071] And I've never, I've trusted in my good works to save me, but I realized today I really need to trust in Jesus.
[time=2077] The gospel is simple, it's good news because it's already happened.
[time=2079] Jesus already paid it all.
[time=2081] Jesus paid the price for our sin.
[time=2083] He who knew no sin became sin so we could become the righteousness of God.
[time=2087] He paid it all by dying that brutal death on the cross.
[time=2091] He rose again to feeding death hell and the grave.
[time=2094] He's alive today because he lives.
[time=2096] You can have salvation, you can have eternal life.
[time=2099] And the Bible reminds us of the words of God that simply tell us anyone.
[time=2105] And yes, that is you.
[time=2106] Anyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
[time=2110] So in your own words, if you don't know that you know, that you know that you know that you know, that if you were to die today, you would spend eternity with God in heaven because of a personal relationship and surrendered trust in Jesus for salvation.
[time=2122] In your own words, from your heart to his, we cry out to him right now as all of us pray together in this moment of silence to respond.
[time=2128] Don't wait another moment to take that next step.
