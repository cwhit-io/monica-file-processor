[time=0] All right, how are we doing today?
[time=4] Yeah, spring's in the air.
[time=6] It's almost April, spring breaks a couple of weeks away.
[time=9] So man, I'm excited.
[time=10] I'm excited to be here.
[time=11] My name is Weiz.
[time=12] I'm one of our pastors here at BlackHawk.
[time=14] I have the honor and the calling to work with our high school students and our young adults.
[time=19] And so if there's high schoolers in here today, and young adults in here today, you self-identify if you're a young adult, first of all.
[time=25] Okay, I'm not gonna say if you're young or not.
[time=27] But if you're here today, let me hear you.
[time=29] Come on, let me hear you.
[time=31] Oh, that was really, really weak.
[time=33] It's really, man, I got a lot of, pray for me, I got a lot of work to do with these young people, okay?
[time=38] Anyway, it's good to be here with you today.
[time=40] Our pastor, Kevin, and his lovely wife, Jessica, are celebrating their 15th wedding anniversary.
[time=47] And so they are not with this today, but continue to pray for them.
[time=50] And when they come back next week, just shower them.
[time=53] Like, just let them know how much we really, truly appreciate them.
[time=56] They do so much for so many of us.
[time=59] And Jessica is the support system behind our pastor, and sometimes our wives don't get that credit.
[time=65] And so when they come back, just make them go home next Sunday and be like, man, what was up with that?
[time=70] They really missed us.
[time=71] We must not have done a good job preaching or something.
[time=74] Like, let them know how much we love them, all right?
[time=77] Hey, we are continuing our unconditional series this week.
[time=82] And we're in the first Corinthians chapter 13.
[time=85] It's when Paul writes to the church in Corinth about love.
[time=89] And today's title is Unyielding Perseverance.
[time=92] Now, love's an interesting thing because I love pizza.
[time=96] I love tacos.
[time=97] I love naps.
[time=98] I'll probably take one today.
[time=100] Hopefully, kids, leave me alone so I can take a nap.
[time=103] I love basketball.
[time=105] I loved yesterday going to Elkhart and watching our Blackhawk Christian boys win semi-state, right?
[time=111] You're good for our coaching staff and our players.
[time=115] Love that.
[time=116] Cheer them on in two weeks down in Indy.
[time=119] And so I love a lot of things, but I can't love my kids or my wife the same way that I love pizza.
[time=126] That would not go well for me in my marital relationship.
[time=130] But we do that, right?
[time=131] We throw this love word out there.
[time=133] It's okay, but sometimes we can cheapen what love really is and what love really means.
[time=138] Sometimes we choose to withhold it.
[time=140] Sometimes we say, well, they don't deserve my love because they did X.
[time=145] And so today, get your pens ready.
[time=148] Get your phone out.
[time=149] The Blackhawk app, if you don't have that, download it.
[time=152] Go to Android, go to whatever it is, iPhone, whatever those things are, I'm not good at that stuff.
[time=156] But download it because we got a lot of notes for you here today.
[time=160] And just so you, just so full disclosure, this was a really hard message for me to prepare.
[time=167] Because any pastor that gets up and teaches on anything, we first have to try and strive to live out what we're teaching, what we're communicating, what we're hearing from the Holy Spirit.
[time=177] And so it's been a year, y'all.
[time=180] It's been a hard year.
[time=181] So how do we love well?
[time=183] How do we love people that just annoy us a little bit?
[time=186] How do we love people that voted differently than we voted?
[time=190] Right?
[time=191] How do we vote?
[time=192] Or how do we love people that maybe sin differently than we sin?
[time=196] We all sin, we all fall short.
[time=198] But how we love is how people in this world will see that we have Jesus in our life.
[time=204] It's a big deal.
[time=205] So we've got to get this right.
[time=206] All right.
[time=207] So Paul writes this letter to the church in Corinth.
[time=210] So he's not writing it to just any Joe Schmo guy or gal.
[time=214] Like these are believers.
[time=216] It's us.
[time=217] And so remember that as we walk through this.
[time=220] And then last thing before I dive into this, I want you to think of somebody in your life right now that maybe they're not an enemy of yours, like enemies are a pretty strong word.
[time=228] But it's somebody that right now you're just doing this with conflict, your button heads.
[time=235] And you love them, but you don't always like them, one of those types of things.
[time=239] And I want you to think about the individual or individuals if there's more than one as we unpack this for the next 30 minutes or so.
[time=246] And just ask when you leave here today, God, what are you asking me to do in that relationship?
[time=253] And then just listen.
[time=257] Just ask, what do you want me to do?
[time=261] And then it's on us to be obedient to whatever it is that we are hearing from the Holy Spirit, to take that first step or whatever it is that he's asking us to do.
[time=270] All right, I want to tell you about the city of Corinth before we get to the church in Corinth.
[time=274] Now the city of Corinth was a massive city.
[time=276] It was a big city.
[time=277] It was a seaport.
[time=278] It was a trade center.
[time=280] Sailors would come in and out of the city.
[time=283] And they were known for idol worship, Aphrodite.
[time=288] They worshipped Aphrodite, who ironically is the goddess of love.
[time=291] And here's Paul writing about love, the love chapter.
[time=295] And these people are just bowing down to this false god, or goddess, Aphrodite.
[time=302] There was over 1,000 prostitutes that worked their trade on the streets of Corinth day after day, after day after day.
[time=311] This was in a moral city, essentially.
[time=315] In the Greek language, there was a word that actually was created because of how immoral Corinth was.
[time=319] And the word is Corinthia zesai.
[time=322] Corinthia zesai.
[time=324] And this word means to live with drunken and immoral debauchery.
[time=328] So if somebody was acting that way, or acting a fool, or living that way, they would say Corinthia zesai.
[time=335] Corinth was not a good place.
[time=336] Paul knew that.
[time=337] So Paul went to Corinth for about a year and a half or two years, and he planted a church.
[time=342] Makes sense.
[time=343] Light and a darkness.
[time=344] OK, let's do this.
[time=345] Let's change our culture.
[time=348] He leaves.
[time=348] He goes elsewhere to advance the gospel.
[time=350] He gets word back that this church is not doing what it's supposed to do.
[time=355] They're not living out what they're supposed to live out.
[time=359] They had what I would call a lot of chameleons in their church body.
[time=363] I think we have a picture of a chameleon here, don't we?
[time=366] Find him.
[time=367] Where is he at?
[time=369] He's in the tree.
[time=370] That's right, Alan.
[time=370] He's in the tree, isn't he?
[time=373] You found him fairly quickly, but he blends in pretty well.
[time=376] And we've got to be really careful.
[time=378] I have to be really careful as a follower of Christ.
[time=380] In our church, we are the church to not live like this, to not be blended in with our environment.
[time=388] We need to be set apart and different.
[time=390] But this is what the church in Corinth was doing.
[time=394] Not everybody, but enough of them where it became a problem, where their witness was diminished.
[time=401] So Corinthia, Zezai, living with drunken and immoral debauchery.
[time=405] The bottom line is they weren't doing what they were supposed to be doing.
[time=408] Now, if we look at chapter 13, we know it as the love chapter.
[time=411] And if you've been to a wedding, raise your hand.
[time=413] If you've ever been to a wedding before, most of you have, you've probably heard parts of 1 Corinthians 13 read at that ceremony.
[time=422] And that's good.
[time=423] We should take all those things out of 1 Corinthians 13 and plug them into any relationship that we have here on Earth.
[time=430] But Paul is actually not writing about a romantic kind of love here.
[time=434] This is agape love.
[time=436] This is the godly love.
[time=438] This is the way that God loves you and loves me and loves all of humanity and mankind.
[time=442] It's a self-sacrificing love.
[time=445] It's an unconditional love.
[time=447] Paul continues on as he dives into this chapter 13.
[time=451] There's 14 verbs that he communicates of what love does and what love does not do.
[time=458] And I want to read 1 Corinthians 13, 1 through 7, to start out here today.
[time=463] If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but have not love, I'm a noisy gong or a clanging symbol.
[time=469] And if I have prophetic powers and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains but have not love, I am nothing.
[time=480] If I give away all I have and if I deliver up my body to be burned but have not love, I gain nothing.
[time=487] Love is patient and kind.
[time=489] Love does not envy or boast.
[time=491] It is not arrogant or rude.
[time=494] It does not insist on its own way.
[time=495] It is not irritable or resentful.
[time=497] It does not rejoice at wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth.
[time=503] And then our verse for today, verse 7.
[time=505] Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things,
[time=511] endures all things.
[time=513] Love never fails.
[time=517] So the title today is Unyielding Perseverance.
[time=520] What does that even mean?
[time=522] Like unyielding, OK, what does it even mean?
[time=525] I'm going to tell you.
[time=526] Unyielding is defined as not giving way under pressure, unlikely to be swayed.
[time=534] That's a blank in your app if you're doing the app, unyielding, not giving way under pressure, unlikely to be swayed.
[time=540] So you're firm.
[time=543] You're unyielding.
[time=545] Now that can sound like a bad thing to do in a relationship.
[time=547] Sometimes we can be too stubborn and we can be unyielding in that way but that's where we put perseverance and we bring love into it and it changes, so here we go.
[time=555] Perseverance, what's that mean?
[time=557] A continued effort to do or achieve something despite difficulties, failures or opposition.
[time=563] A continued effort, not a, eh, I want to feel like an effort.
[time=569] It's a tenacious effort.
[time=572] Continued effort.
[time=573] Now, if we take unyielding and we take perseverance and we look at not the Webster dictionary but the Wies dictionary, I'm taking these two together in the context of love and here's a definition of unyielding perseverance is for today's message.
[time=587] To have a love that is determined that gives effort and remains steadfast in the face of any and all challenges.
[time=597] Any and all challenges, Romans 5, 3, and 4.
[time=600] Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings because we know that suffering produces perseverance, perseverance, character, and character hope.
[time=610] Love will require us many times to persevere through some hard stuff.
[time=616] We hurt each other, don't we?
[time=619] We do.
[time=620] I hurt people and we've heard it said before, hurt people do what?
[time=624] They hurt people and we just spin it.
[time=628] I mean, we're a mess sometimes, aren't we?
[time=631] Loving others will not always be our first choice but love is a choice, don't miss that.
[time=639] Oh, it's an emotion like, oh, she's perfect and love is a choice.
[time=644] Love is a choice.
[time=647] First down 4.19 proves that.
[time=650] Why do we love?
[time=651] Why should we love?
[time=653] We love because he first loved us.
[time=657] Now, if we look at Paul, he shares four things here in verse seven, we're focused for today on what love actually does.
[time=663] I'm going to read it again, love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things.
[time=670] Now, this word all is important here because we see it four times in a really short verse here, four times, so that's important.
[time=678] That means, OK, what does that mean?
[time=680] All is defined as the greatest possible amount of something.
[time=686] It's not 99.9%, like you're detergent, it's 100%.
[time=691] All, the greatest possible amount of something all comes from the word always.
[time=697] Always, as defined, is having no limits.
[time=703] Love them anyway.
[time=708] That's hard to do, isn't it?
[time=710] When you think about that person again, don't forget to remember to think about that person.
[time=715] That's a little bit hard to love.
[time=717] How do I love him or her or them always?
[time=723] Get to that in a minute.
[time=724] So, bears, believes, hopes, and endures.
[time=729] We do all those things in our human relationships.
[time=731] We hope for good things.
[time=732] We want to believe each other.
[time=734] We want to have trust there.
[time=735] We want to kind of endure through the hard times that we have.
[time=738] But the hard part about living that out is, again, the always in the all part.
[time=742] That's the Christian part.
[time=744] That's the loving, like, Christ part.
[time=746] That's really, really, really difficult.
[time=748] Don't raise your hand, but if you ever said to somebody or thought, like, I've had it up to here with you, or maybe in your heart, you're, like, they're dead to me.
[time=759] It's one time too many, and you check them off your list.
[time=765] I've done that.
[time=767] Absolutely, I've done that.
[time=768] I've had it up to here, because we all have people in our lives that are going to be difficult to love.
[time=774] But again, we have to remember that love is a spiritual gift.
[time=780] We can't love, in our flesh, in our humanness, the way that we're called to love, as 1 Corinthians 13 calls us to love.
[time=787] Can't do it.
[time=788] We're going to fall short.
[time=790] But we're not alone.
[time=791] Remember, he's writing this to believers.
[time=794] He's writing this to the church.
[time=796] And so when we come to know who Christ is, we receive a guest from the Holy Spirit.
[time=801] Or chapter 12, he writes about that.
[time=803] He lists all these things that-- you know what?
[time=805] You can do all that, but you're a claim symbol, resounding on all those things, if you don't have love.
[time=810] Love is the best, most excellent of these spiritual gifts.
[time=815] Now, let's dive into this verse.
[time=816] So the four instructions on how we are to love, and these are all action verbs, which means we have a part to play.
[time=823] There's action that needs to happen here.
[time=826] Love bears all things.
[time=828] Raise your hand if you know somebody in your life.
[time=830] That's just a little bit annoying, OK?
[time=835] Don't elbow somebody, all right?
[time=838] I'm not going to ask you if you're sitting next to that individual.
[time=840] We're all annoying.
[time=841] Let's be honest.
[time=843] We all have our own quirks.
[time=844] I have my own quirks.
[time=846] Like, growing up-- my dad's probably watching right now.
[time=849] My mom and dad love you.
[time=850] Dad didn't ask permission to share this.
[time=852] But my dad's a big 6'5" guy.
[time=854] Believe it or not, like, yeah, like he's 6'5".
[time=856] My mom's 5' foot, that's why I'm short.
[time=858] But my dad, when we would eat, like, it's go time.
[time=862] It's go time.
[time=863] And he'd slurp his soup and he'd chomp his food.
[time=867] And it was just something about that as a kid growing up.
[time=870] It's just like, oh, can you just kind of keep your mouth closed when you chomp your food, right?
[time=877] And that's not that big of a deal.
[time=878] But sometimes there's things like that that we have in people.
[time=881] And I love my dad.
[time=882] I would die for my dad.
[time=883] And he would die for me.
[time=886] But when he drank soup or ate soup, it was like, oh, do you have people like that, though?
[time=890] That's a little bit annoying.
[time=891] Guess what?
[time=892] You're probably that person for somebody else.
[time=896] In some way.
[time=898] Because we're unique.
[time=899] We're created differently.
[time=900] And that's good.
[time=901] So how do we celebrate those things?
[time=903] Instead of having to be things that like are like, oh, and we start to do this over.
[time=908] So love bears all things.
[time=910] Bears means this right here.
[time=912] It means to cover with silence.
[time=915] Love bears all things.
[time=917] Love covers with silence.
[time=919] It suppresses.
[time=920] It doesn't mean that love puts up with everything.
[time=922] It doesn't mean that you have to be a doormat and be wounded over and over and over and over in the same way by the same person over and over.
[time=931] Some of you maybe are in close proximity with people that, quite frankly, are just toxic for you.
[time=937] Or they're unhealthy for you.
[time=939] And you can still love them, but you need to love them at a distance.
[time=943] Proximity is important here as well.
[time=946] In your heart, you can still love them.
[time=948] You don't have to hang out with them 24/7.
[time=951] Sometimes our love needs to bear the pain from a safe and even sometimes a legal distance.
[time=959] Another thing that we see here is that love covers the worst in silence and without complaint.
[time=965] So it covers, it covers in silence, and it covers without complaint.
[time=968] You know somebody that just winds a lot?
[time=973] Again, don't elbow somebody.
[time=979] We all do at times.
[time=981] But they just have kind of like a whining spirit.
[time=984] Sometimes our love, God calls us to still love that person.
[time=987] And that means that our love suffers through that loving but without complaint.
[time=993] First Corinthians 13.5, it does not dishonor others.
[time=996] It is not self-seeking.
[time=997] It is not easily angered.
[time=998] It keeps no records of wrong.
[time=1001] So this is interesting.
[time=1002] We learned this a couple weeks ago, a couple of verses before this one.
[time=1005] And what we do many times is, again, hurt people, and we start to keep records of wrong.
[time=1011] And we pull out this pad of paper and a pen.
[time=1013] We say, "This morning, you were really rude to me "and that really hurt my feelings, "and so I'm gonna put that down in my little, "I'm gonna keep track of that." Okay, write that down.
[time=1022] Whatever.
[time=1025] And then we write down, seven months ago, we were late to pick up the kids from school and, you know, and, you know, I've been guilty of that before BCS staff, I apologize, I'm doing better.
[time=1036] I'm trying to, okay?
[time=1037] But we can keep track of that.
[time=1039] And then we write down, in 2004, we were on vacation and this happened and we just, whatever.
[time=1045] We write down all these things, first of all, if you're actually getting a pad of paper and a pen out and don't do that, that's not good.
[time=1052] This is just for an analogy, like a visual.
[time=1054] But we do this essentially in here, in our heart.
[time=1058] And our heart goes from being really soft and moldable to kind of like, eh, it gets a little bit harder, a little bit harder because we're holding on to things and we get resentful towards people.
[time=1067] And when we hold those things in and don't talk about 'em and communicate about 'em, that turns into anger.
[time=1072] And then we start doing this and it's just, it's a downward spiral, it's not good.
[time=1076] Here's what this looks like.
[time=1078] Think about those things in your relationships with that person that I asked you to think about at the beginning of today's message.
[time=1085] That's just a little bit difficult to love for whatever the reason.
[time=1089] And the things that they've done to you or whatever the case may be are represented with these boxes.
[time=1095] These are sinned, these are shortcomings, these are failures, these are things that are quirky and annoying that you don't understand, whatever.
[time=1102] It could be anything.
[time=1103] In love, bears all things.
[time=1105] Again, it means to what?
[time=1106] It means to cover.
[time=1107] It means that you choose, you choose to say, okay, I'm gonna cover that up.
[time=1114] Holy Spirit helps us do that.
[time=1118] In our flesh, in our humanness, we can't really do that very well.
[time=1121] This could represent forgiveness and bringing relationships back together that are restored.
[time=1126] But you see right here, for those over here, you can still see a little bit of this box right here, right?
[time=1131] And that's what happens.
[time=1132] Sometimes we think we dealt with it, we covered it up and like, okay, we're good.
[time=1135] And then they do the same thing again.
[time=1137] And they do it again the next day.
[time=1139] And then we do it to them the next day.
[time=1140] And we start to kind of maybe do this a little bit.
[time=1143] Oh, it's covered.
[time=1143] And they do it again.
[time=1145] It's like, ugh, okay.
[time=1147] We have to choose love as a choice.
[time=1150] We have to choose to say, nope, nope, nope.
[time=1153] You can do it again, but it's covered.
[time=1155] It's what Christ did for us on the cross, right?
[time=1158] Paid in full, it's covered.
[time=1161] You're good.
[time=1161] Love covers the worst in silence without complaint.
[time=1167] Proverbs 10, 12, hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all offenses.
[time=1173] Next blank, love chooses to cover instead of hover.
[time=1177] So it's similar to that, but it rhymes, so I like it.
[time=1180] But love chooses to cover instead of hover.
[time=1183] What's it mean to hover?
[time=1184] Think of a helicopter that just kind of chooses sometimes to hover over a certain spot.
[time=1190] And we can do that in our relationships with the conflicts that we have.
[time=1194] And we can just be like unyielding in a not good way and just stay in that spot.
[time=1200] But love is an action, which means that love should propel us forward.
[time=1204] And sometimes to be propelled forward, we can't just hover on that thing anymore.
[time=1210] We have to process through it and we need to learn to just let it go sometimes.
[time=1215] Sometimes we just gotta choose our battles.
[time=1217] In this world, you'll have trouble.
[time=1221] There's hard stuff in everybody's life.
[time=1223] Sometimes you just gotta be like, you know what, that's not that big a deal.
[time=1225] Is it annoying?
[time=1226] Is it frustrating?
[time=1227] Yeah, it is, but I'm gonna choose not to make that some big thing and we're gonna move forward and not hover on it.
[time=1236] Ephesians 4 29 to 31.
[time=1238] Let no corrupt talk come out of your mouths but only such as good for building up as fits the occasion.
[time=1245] That it may give grace to those who hear and do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God for whom you are sealed on the day of redemption.
[time=1251] Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, slander be put away from you along with all malice.
[time=1257] May we not grieve the Holy Spirit.
[time=1259] And I read that because a lot of times what we do is we'll go and we'll tell somebody else about the stuff right here.
[time=1265] We think that we covered it and we dealt with it and maybe we really didn't.
[time=1269] We go and we tell other people.
[time=1271] Again, he's writing this to who?
[time=1273] The church.
[time=1275] We gotta get it right in here.
[time=1278] May we not go and gossip and slander and do these types of things against our brother and sister, anyone for that matter.
[time=1287] But we gotta get it right in here first before we can go out there and give them our Jesus.
[time=1295] Next, love believes all things.
[time=1300] The Greek word for believes is pisteio, which means to believe or place faith in or trust.
[time=1307] So love believes the best first.
[time=1311] Now, this doesn't mean that you're naive or that you're gullible or that whatever that somebody tells you that you're just like, okay, yeah, I guess I believe that.
[time=1319] That's not what it's saying at all.
[time=1321] It's instead saying that you believe the best of the other person and you're not second-guessing on if they deserve to be loved by you or not.
[time=1328] Does this person deserve, is your love for somebody else that based on their approval?
[time=1334] I work with young people for over two decades and I have had so many conversations with teenagers that come to me and they're just broken because they feel like their parents love them only when they perform academically.
[time=1347] Or if they go four for four in the baseball game instead of one for four.
[time=1354] So just a quick word for the parents in here.
[time=1356] If you're a parent of anybody of any age, just make sure your kids know.
[time=1361] You love them as we just saying in the mountaintops, when you're four for four or in the valleys when you're oh for five with five strikeouts.
[time=1368] Love believes the best first.
[time=1373] It's also translated as love trusts all things.
[time=1378] But let's be honest, it's hard to trust one another sometimes, isn't it?
[time=1381] Because trusting somebody is vulnerable, it's risky, it might not always be reciprocated back to you in the way that you want it to be.
[time=1388] And we get hurt, we're vulnerable.
[time=1391] But again, this is an agape love.
[time=1393] And so this is how God first has loved us.
[time=1398] So then let's look at what Jesus has done.
[time=1400] He's trustworthy, even when we're not.
[time=1403] Hebrews 12, too, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith.
[time=1407] For the joy set before him, he endured the cross, scorning its shame and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
[time=1415] If somebody lays down their life for me, or at least they're legitimately like willing to lay their life down for me, I'm gonna trust that individual.
[time=1423] I'm gonna trust them.
[time=1426] That's what Christ has done, obviously, for us.
[time=1430] Next point, love is not suspicious.
[time=1433] It's not suspicious.
[time=1435] It doesn't assume the worst of others.
[time=1437] It takes things at face value.
[time=1440] Think of a time in your life, maybe as a child or a teenager, where you were accused of doing something that you didn't do it.
[time=1448] It wasn't you.
[time=1449] You didn't say that, you didn't take that, you weren't there, whatever the case may be.
[time=1453] And somebody that you love came and asked you if you did that thing.
[time=1458] Maybe it was your dad.
[time=1460] Hey, son, did you say that at school today?
[time=1463] Nope.
[time=1464] You didn't do it.
[time=1465] You really didn't do it.
[time=1466] And you're trying to convince your dad, like, I didn't do it, dad, I didn't say that at all.
[time=1469] But your dad looks at you and says, ah, I don't believe you.
[time=1472] You don't feel love in that moment.
[time=1479] Love is not suspicious.
[time=1480] Now flip the script on that same scenario.
[time=1482] And your dad's like, hey, did you do this?
[time=1485] Dad, I promise, it wasn't me.
[time=1487] Okay, I believe you, son.
[time=1490] Wait, lifted.
[time=1494] Breath of fresh air, and you feel love in that moment.
[time=1498] Maybe not be suspicious of people that they always have some underhanded agenda against us at work, or in our family, or whatever the case may be, like, love is not suspicious.
[time=1508] Now if they give you a reason, they're breaking trust, and they are doing some things, you know, you gotta be wise in that.
[time=1514] But how do you love them even in that moment through that?
[time=1517] Luke 631, we all know that we've heard this before, due to others as you would have them due to you.
[time=1524] We gotta sometimes just give people the benefit of the doubt.
[time=1527] We have to look people in the eye and say, okay, I'm gonna choose to believe the best of you first, until at least you give me reasons not to.
[time=1535] Here's, you know, I love the TV show Gold Rush.
[time=1540] And Gold Rush is a bunch of just middle-aged guys that about 10 years ago, they said, hey, we're gonna move for four or five, six months to Alaska, and we're gonna try to mine for gold.
[time=1551] And they get these earth-moving machines, and tons and tons and tons of dirt, and they move all this stuff, and they're looking for that right there.
[time=1559] Just tiny little flakes of gold.
[time=1560] If they're lucky, they get a nugget.
[time=1562] I mean, you know, it's gold, it's valuable.
[time=1565] Love is not suspicious.
[time=1568] We need to start looking at people in our life in the context of relationships and say, you know what, I can see a lot of dirt in you.
[time=1575] And they can probably see a lot of dirt in us too.
[time=1579] But we need to start looking and searching for the flakes of gold in each other, because those flakes of gold are valuable.
[time=1587] And they're in there, you gotta look sometimes harder for some people than others, but they're in there.
[time=1593] And again, he's writing this to the church, so these are believers.
[time=1596] And so when you find flakes of gold, that's, we are image-bearers.
[time=1601] When you find good things in each other, that's, okay, that's a glimpse of who Jesus is.
[time=1606] That's a characteristic of who God is, that we see in each other.
[time=1612] So maybe we find and hunt and look for those flakes of gold in each other instead of the dirt.
[time=1618] Number three, moving on, hope, it hopes all things.
[time=1622] Love hopes all things.
[time=1623] You ever been around, don't raise your hand.
[time=1626] You ever been around a negative spirited person?
[time=1628] Right, like just somebody that's just kind of negative.
[time=1633] They kind of drip negativity like a leaky faucet, and you just want to kind of shut the faucet off.
[time=1637] And you know, I can be that way at times.
[time=1639] I think we can all be that way sometimes in our lives.
[time=1643] But we have to be careful how we present ourselves to each other and to the world.
[time=1647] Again, we are image-bearers of the Most High God.
[time=1650] Matthew 12, 36, I tell you, on the day of judgment, people will give an account for every careless word they spoke, they ever spoke.
[time=1657] And every time I read that verse, I want to close my Bible.
[time=1661] 'Cause I'm like, oh man, oof, that's not a fun verse, y'all.
[time=1666] When I read that verse, even now,
[time=1672] like teaching it, I'm not like, ah, I gotta be slow, slow, slower to speak.
[time=1677] Love is not pessimistic, it is optimistic.
[time=1684] Next blank, love is not pessimistic.
[time=1687] Mm, Debbie Downer, right?
[time=1689] It's optimistic, it's positive.
[time=1692] It chooses to see things as overflowing rather than half empty.
[time=1696] It keeps loving and holds on to hope.
[time=1701] It waits on the Lord to change the hearts of you and that other individual that right now is just really hard to move towards or to love.
[time=1710] Romans 8, 11, the spirit of God who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you.
[time=1714] And just as God raised Jesus Christ from the dead, He will give life to your mortal bodies by the same spirit living within you.
[time=1722] That should give us hope that the same power that raised Jesus from the grave lives in us.
[time=1729] So you have a relationship right now and it feels like a candle that the wick is like, like this big and the flame is just, I mean, it's just barely lit, it's barely lit.
[time=1738] And I want you to know that we're just saying graves in the gardens.
[time=1743] He churns oceans into highways.
[time=1747] He exchanges beauty and ashes.
[time=1752] It's never hopeless if you have Jesus Christ
[time=1760] in that situation.
[time=1761] There's always hope, cling to hope.
[time=1764] Jesus is undefeated, last I checked, is he undefeated?
[time=1769] And I don't think he's gonna catch a nail anytime soon either.
[time=1774] So he can make you a conqueror, we are conquerors because of what he's done for us.
[time=1781] So in that relationship that's really hard and it's like, ah, it's almost out.
[time=1784] You've gotta cling to hope, gotta cling to him.
[time=1787] Next blank, love roots for others to win.
[time=1791] It roots for others to win.
[time=1793] At this game yesterday, the Blackhawk game, you know, I'm sitting there and I'm with my family and six or 700 other Blackhawk faithful fans and we're every play, every tip of the ball, every rebound, like we're just, we're cheering.
[time=1805] We're on the edge of our seat, like let's go.
[time=1807] Let's go, let's do this.
[time=1809] And we'll do that for basketball games and we should and that's good.
[time=1813] But are we doing this for our relationships that we have with people that are just kind of hard to love?
[time=1820] How can we become more that way and cheer for somebody else in our life?
[time=1825] It's the heart of saying, if you win, I win.
[time=1829] If I win, you win.
[time=1831] We're in it together, again, writing it to the church, believers, if you win, I win, you win, I win.
[time=1838] If I win, you win.
[time=1839] And supporting each other in that.
[time=1843] Philippians two, three and four says, do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit but humility count others more significant than yourselves.
[time=1851] Let each of you look not only to his own interests but to the interests of others.
[time=1855] Love will consistently seek what is best for other people.
[time=1863] But if I'm being honest, some of you are here today and you're thinking of those relationships and it doesn't feel like you're winning.
[time=1870] It doesn't feel like they're cheering you on.
[time=1871] It feels like they're playing defense.
[time=1875] It feels like they're trying to prevent you from getting ahead and from having victory in your life.
[time=1881] And that's why this next point for those of you that are in that spot is important.
[time=1886] Love that hopes will sustain your faith in God.
[time=1892] God gives us confidence that he's mighty, that he's capable, that he's big enough, that he can, and that he will, according to his timing, as we do our part, like he can transform and change anything in our life.
[time=1903] Not just relationships, any situation that feels like it's dead or about dead right now, it's not.
[time=1909] Again, there's hope.
[time=1910] God gives us confidence and when he paves away where there was no way, that strengthens our faith.
[time=1918] It develops our character.
[time=1920] It sustains our faith in God.
[time=1924] May the relationship you have right now with somebody that's really hard, may he maybe want to use that hard situation to change your heart and not just change theirs so that you get to a better place with your dependence on him and the Holy Spirit.
[time=1940] I think so.
[time=1941] Not easy work, stretching, but his character developing work.
[time=1946] Psalm 33, 20 to 22, we wait in hope for the Lord.
[time=1951] He is our help and our shield.
[time=1953] In him, our hearts rejoice for we trust in his holy name, may your unfailing love be with us Lord, even as we pour our hope in you.
[time=1963] And then lastly, love endures all things.
[time=1967] It endures all things.
[time=1968] This is actually a military term.
[time=1970] Endures is a military term and it speaks to the fact that sometimes we're gonna be at war, we're gonna be in battle with other people in our life.
[time=1978] But love always pushes forward, it's action.
[time=1983] Love always pushes forward and it's a military term.
[time=1986] So I think about these armies on the side of a hillside and they push forward together to try to conquer and take back land that the enemy has.
[time=1997] And the enemy has tried to take property or take relationships or take land away from you.
[time=2004] Our enemy wants to rob, steal, kill and destroy.
[time=2009] So we have to forge ahead in our relationship, Ephesians 6, 10 to 12.
[time=2014] Finally be strong in the Lord and the strength of his might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil.
[time=2022] For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.
[time=2033] So think about that person again that I asked you to think about at the beginning of today's message, that's hard to love and I will tell you that that person's actually not your enemy.
[time=2040] It feels that way, absolutely sometimes.
[time=2044] It's personal like, well yeah, but they did this and they didn't do that and they said that and they broke trust and whatever.
[time=2050] We have the same common enemy.
[time=2053] So what's really happening is like Satan's just targeting that person and he's targeting us and he always has a target on our back.
[time=2060] How can we come together and say look, it's really not you versus me or us versus them or whatever.
[time=2067] It's really like us getting on the same side, forging ahead, pressing forward, choosing to love each other and combating our adversary.
[time=2077] It flips the script, he's the enemy.
[time=2080] It's really not that other person, but he's having maybe a field day in that situation.
[time=2085] First Peter 2.20, for what credit is it if when you sin you are beaten for it and you endure?
[time=2090] But if when you do good and suffer for it and endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God.
[time=2097] Even when it's hard, you must relentlessly strive to love people and have the characteristics of God they love towards others.
[time=2105] An enduring love will cost you something.
[time=2107] John 15, 13, greater love has no one than this that someone laid down his life for his friends.
[time=2112] What are you willing to sacrifice in your relationship to love somebody the way you're supposed to love them?
[time=2117] An enduring love is not stubborn, it is not proud.
[time=2120] First John 4.8, anyone who does not love does not know God because God is love.
[time=2126] So is your pride getting in the way.
[time=2128] An enduring love moves first, first John 4.19, we love because he first loved us.
[time=2134] What's stopping you from moving first?
[time=2136] Some of you are in a relationship right now and you're at a stalemate.
[time=2139] Well, he needs to come first to me.
[time=2141] He wronged me, he needs to come say sorry.
[time=2143] Or she needs to come say sorry.
[time=2145] Some of you just gotta, just man up, woman up, whatever, stand up and move forward and just be like, I'm sorry, move first.
[time=2154] So all your pride, not easy, not easy.
[time=2156] And then lastly, love remains.
[time=2160] It endures all things, it remains.
[time=2162] This is best portrayed in the life of Jesus.
[time=2165] He remained where God had him out of love for the Father and his love for us.
[time=2170] He remained through mocking, he remained when his beard was pulled out, he remained being spat upon.
[time=2178] He remained having a crown of thorns thrust into his brow.
[time=2189] He remained on the cross, that's not the end of the story, is it?
[time=2194] He remained, he persevered, he endured and he conquered the grave.
[time=2200] Love remains, Psalm 117, two, for great is a steadfast love
[time=2207] toward us and the faithfulness of the Lord endures forever, praise the Lord.
[time=2212] We must persevere.
[time=2216] Hebrews 12, one through three, therefore since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders us, the sin that so easily entangles us and let us run with perseverance, the race marked out for us.
[time=2229] Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer, perfecter of our faith for the joy set before him, he endured across, scorning at shame, sat down at the right hand of the throne of God, consider him who endured such opposition from sinners so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.
[time=2245] May we love like Jesus, may we press on, may we run our race.
[time=2250] In closing, I don't have to tell you that we live in a broken, dark, fallen world.
[time=2257] Turn the news on for two or three minutes and it'll be pretty evident.
[time=2261] But God's word says, again, Paul wrote this to the church, they weren't doing what they were supposed to do, they weren't being light in the darkness.
[time=2269] We talk a lot about that here at Black Hawk, John 1-5, being light in the darkness and darkness cannot overtake it.
[time=2277] 1 Corinthians 5-20 says, "Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us, we implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God." Here's what this looks like, right here.
[time=2289] When we love the way we're supposed to love, we're a reflection of Jesus Christ.
[time=2299] See that?
[time=2304] Everywhere we go, if you're married, what's it look like at home?
[time=2308] If you're a parent, what's that look like as a parent?
[time=2311] You're a place of employment, your neighborhoods, but when we don't love in a 1 Corinthians 13 way, kind of like this.
[time=2320] And we say, yeah, but I go to church, I'm a pastor, I'm a follower of Christ, but we walk around sometimes like this, unfortunately, 'cause we're flawed.
[time=2328] But how can we leave here today asking God, what's an action step that I need to do with today's message where we can become a little bit more like this.
[time=2339] See up there?
[time=2340] Everywhere you go, you're an image barrier, shine light in the darkness.
[time=2345] Maybe you're here this morning and you're like,
[time=2351] okay, we're talking about love and love of God and love of Jesus and you've maybe heard that before.
[time=2356] Maybe you're here today and you're kind of kicking the tires on who Jesus is, but you've just never really surrendered your life to him.
[time=2365] I'm glad you're here.
[time=2366] I don't think that you're here for an accident or by accident.
[time=2369] I think every one of you who is here in the house of the Lord today is here for this moment.
[time=2374] But I'm gonna ask you to just close your eyes, everybody, and just bow your heads and I'm gonna give some of you an opportunity to just come to know Christ in this moment.
[time=2384] And maybe you think about your life, you think about your relationships and they're in the valleys.
[time=2389] Maybe life's actually decent, like, yeah, it's okay, but you just have this empty void in your life.
[time=2396] And that will tell you that there's no amount of money, there's no relationship, there's no thing of this world that will ever fill that void that you have in your heart.
[time=2405] It's only Jesus Christ that can do that.
[time=2407] So if you're here today and you've never done that, but you're ready, it's basically you saying and confessing with your lips that you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that he willingly died on the cross for you.
[time=2421] Despite all your stuff and that he's not dead, that he is alive, that he rose again three days later and as we just read, he sits at the right hand on his throne of God and he loves you so much.
[time=2439] You've had people not love you right, maybe in your life, like you deserve to be loved, but he loves you so much.
[time=2446] And if that's you today and you say, okay, I don't understand all of it, but I understand enough to know that he died from me, that he loves me, that he's alive, that he wants good things in my life and he can transform my life.
[time=2458] If that's you, I just, now's your moment.
