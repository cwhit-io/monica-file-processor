[time=0] Today, I want to talk to you about unending love, unending love.
[time=6] I'm so thankful that the love of God perseveres for me and that it is unending in a world where everything comes to a close, everything is so finite, the love of God, agape, unconditional,
[time=17] self-sacrificing love.
[time=19] It is unending.
[time=20] We'll be in 1 Corinthians 13, we'll finish the chapter today, and then I'll take you to a Palm Sunday passage, the triumphant entry of Jesus into Jerusalem to close our time in John chapter 12.
[time=30] So Black Hawk, are you ready for the Word today?
[time=33] Are you sure you're ready for the Word today?
[time=35] Because it's going to dig in deep on you.
[time=37] So here's the deal.
[time=38] As we dig into the Word of God, we have studied love, and it's this agape, unconditional love, and the flame of that love we know is supernatural.
[time=47] We cannot achieve the kind of love that agape is without the love of God driving the way.
[time=53] God is love.
[time=54] God didn't just create love, God didn't just choose to love.
[time=56] It's not just something God does, it's who God is, it's a fruit of His Spirit.
[time=60] We can't love with an agape kind of love, apart from the empowering, equipping Holy
[time=66] Spirit of God in our life.
[time=68] And if we have not learned that through looking at the characteristics of an agape love, then nothing will.
[time=73] But we live in a world where we know the flame of God's love.
[time=77] It never goes out.
[time=78] Aren't you glad of that?
[time=79] Not if you agree.
[time=81] God's love is everlasting.
[time=82] It is unending.
[time=83] That's what we're looking at today, but we live in a world that's full of spray bottles.
[time=86] We live in a world that's full of an enemy trying to tear apart.
[time=90] And even though we know the flame of the love of God never goes out.
[time=93] The enemy, the devil constantly sprays the love of God in our life.
[time=98] And there's nothing worse than wet wax and a nasty candle.
[time=101] It smells bad.
[time=102] It feels disgusting.
[time=103] But this is what the enemy's been doing in your life.
[time=106] He wants you to think that the light has gone out.
[time=108] He wants you to think that you have nothing burning inside.
[time=110] He wants you to be convinced by the world, distracted by all of the things in the world today to the point that you forget how unending the love of God is.
[time=118] He's been spraying you to death.
[time=120] And I've come to put some flame through the Word of God back into your heart and your walk with God.
[time=126] And we're going to do that through looking at God's unending love, 1 Corinthians chapter 13.
[time=130] And so I'll start by just giving you three things that love agape will outlast.
[time=135] And this is what Paul does in these last verses of our chapter.
[time=139] And so the context we've learned is spiritual gifts.
[time=142] As Paul is teaching us these days, chapter 12, chapter 14.
[time=145] It's all spiritual gifts.
[time=146] And it's like Paul in the middle of teaching about that, got a glimpse of what this discussion of spiritual gifts would end up looking like and went, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, stop, wait.
[time=158] Lest you guys forget the why behind the spiritual gifts.
[time=162] Lest Paul is for a minute.
[time=164] And let me teach you about love.
[time=166] Because love is the driving force of every gift, of everything, of every way that the gifts of the Spirit of God are built up and are in purpose to edify the body of Christ,
[time=178] build up the body of Christ.
[time=179] And that's where we've been now for some eight weeks.
[time=181] And that's what leads us now into what love outlasts.
[time=184] And so let's look at 1 Corinthians chapter 13 and verse 8.
[time=187] First, I'll tell you love number one, outlast all gifts.
[time=190] This is what Paul is teaching us.
[time=192] Three things love outlast, number one.
[time=194] Love outlasts all gifts, all gifts.
[time=197] And we see this from verses 8 through 10 of 1 Corinthians 13.
[time=200] Let's look at verse 8.
[time=201] Love outlasts all gifts.
[time=202] And we see that in the first three words here of 1 Corinthians 13.
[time=206] Love never ends.
[time=207] This is unending love.
[time=209] As for prophecies, they will pass away.
[time=212] As for tones, they will cease.
[time=214] As for knowledge, it will pass away.
[time=217] Verse 9 tells us that for we know in part, it's partial.
[time=221] We know in part and we prophesy in part.
[time=224] But when the perfect comes, and by the way, that ain't you.
[time=228] When the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.
[time=232] Let's go verse by verse through that because through this we see Paul doing really what he did.
[time=237] How many of you were here in week one of the series?
[time=238] And I went through, actually, you know what?
[time=239] None of you were here.
[time=240] How many of you watched?
[time=241] Because that was our infamous snow day.
[time=243] I was here by myself again.
[time=244] There's been a lot of that this last year.
[time=246] It's no fun.
[time=247] I like it when you guys are here.
[time=248] I'm glad you guys are watching online.
[time=249] Some of you saw online and we saw that Paul's teaching us that the love of God is so much bigger than our words, than our wisdom, and our works.
[time=258] That's what we looked at in verses 1 through 3.
[time=260] And verse 8, Paul is teaching us the same thing again.
[time=263] He's going right back to that same concept, saying love, the agape unconditional self-sacrificing love of God outlasts and is bigger than all of the gifts.
[time=270] And then he gives us some examples of that.
[time=272] He talks about prophecies and tongues.
[time=274] And as we say that, some of you just kind of squirm and you tense up a little bit.
[time=278] And here's what I want to teach you about for a moment.
[time=281] For centuries, listen, for centuries, this topic of spiritual gifts, think about what
[time=287] it does.
[time=288] God made the gifts.
[time=289] Did you know you didn't create them?
[time=292] You didn't originate the gifts of the spirit on your own.
[time=294] You didn't just wake up one day and like, I'm gifted in this area.
[time=298] No, God gave, he created the gifts and he gave the gifts to build up and edify the body of Christ.
[time=304] But for centuries, the enemy has used something God created to build up the body of Christ and he's used it to extinguish the flame and the fire that God wants to use to build up.
[time=314] And he has used it to tear apart the people of God and God who authored scripture, but used the hands and the mouth of Paul to do that to the letter to the Corinthians here in 1 Corinthians, he knew that this would rip apart God's church, that it would ravage
[time=330] the people of God and divide the people of God for centuries.
[time=333] And therefore Paul speaks up and says, don't forget the wrapping of these gifts, the driving force of these gifts, it is love.
[time=341] And a few weeks ago, I took us back earlier in Paul's letter to the church at Corinth.
[time=345] 1 Corinthians chapter 8 and verse 1 tells us that knowledge puffs up, but love agape,
[time=352] it builds up.
[time=353] So I want to take you back to that passage, 1 Corinthians chapter 8, right after verse 1 is verse 2, and I want to share it with you.
[time=359] 1 Corinthians 8 and verse 2 says, if anyone imagines that he knows something, you know
[time=366] anybody that imagines they know something, how about you?
[time=369] You ever imagine you know something?
[time=371] You would never be a know-it-all, we're way more spiritual than that.
[time=373] But other people, they tend to do that.
[time=375] If anyone imagines that he knows something, he does not yet know as he ought to know.
[time=383] That's a pretty humbling verse.
[time=384] You want to know the Kevin version of that is quit thinking you're so smart, big boy.
[time=389] You don't know it all.
[time=391] Whatever you think you know, and I'll tell you, I've spent so much time, energy resources, money, effort, knowing the Word of God, and we should.
[time=398] We have a Christian education driven focus here called Black Hawk Christian School because we believe in Christian education, we believe in fostering an environment of academia and knowledge and knowing the Word of God and knowing certainly the heart of God.
[time=412] But listen, sometimes we get so consumed in what we know that we forget to grow, we forget to let God work in our hearts to the point where it really overflows out of his strength instead of our own.
[time=423] Sometimes we think we know something and Paul is saying, listen, if you think you know something, just remember you're here and God is there.
[time=431] Who can understand the mind and the heart of God?
[time=434] Deuteronomy 29, 29 says, "The secret things belong to the Lord, but the things revealed belong to us and our sons forever." And so lest we think that we know more than we do, may we go into the rest of today's message with a humble posture.
[time=450] I know you're thinking, well, I'm glad pastor said that for that person.
[time=453] But if you said that, it might be for you.
[time=455] I'm just going to shoot you straight today.
[time=457] And we all need this kind of a reminder so many times in our lives.
[time=461] And that's the whole point of verses 9 and 10.
[time=464] Sometimes we get caught up in the gifts or different discussions theologically or relational even just in conflicts and who's right and who's wrong for the gifts.
[time=472] We think what gifts are for today and what gifts are not for today and how does this gift manifest in this place versus that place?
[time=479] What about in a worship service and boy, the questions go on and on and listen, I'm all for the questions.
[time=484] I've spent a ton of money in time studying and finding answers and getting knowledge to those questions.
[time=489] But Paul is saying as you do that, don't forget the driving force behind it, it is love, it's love.
[time=495] And if we forget that, we missed the whole point of the gifts to begin with.
[time=498] And I'll tell you, I've been all over the world even recently in South Sudan, as many of you heard me share about.
[time=503] I don't think for a second that our little bubble here is confining God to how He works.
[time=509] I see some nodding from one of our missionaries right here, can I get a name in?
[time=512] God works differently in different places because there's different needs all over the world and that's the beauty of our God and that's the beauty of the spiritual gifts is that God uses them to build up the body in all of the different contexts all over the world doing different things in different ways but built on the same truth of Scripture and the same Jesus and the same Holy Spirit that makes us one together in Him because His love
[time=536] outlasts.
[time=537] It is unending and outlast even the spiritual gifts.
[time=541] The eternally gifted things that we have to live out the love of God in our earthly context.
[time=546] I'm glad that we serve that kind of God.
[time=548] Love outlasts the gifts and that's why verses 9 and 10, we're in the partial.
[time=552] The partial.
[time=553] The partial is going on.
[time=554] What's partial?
[time=555] Everything.
[time=556] Everything you see right now is partial except for the love of God, except for the person of Jesus Christ, the salvation of Him.
[time=562] All of the earthly institutions and things that we put our hope in and hope is going to change one day and get discouraged by that the enemy sprays the candle of the flame of God's love in our life.
[time=571] All of those things are temporary.
[time=572] So why would we who are focused on an eternal kingdom ever get distracted by the partial
[time=578] things that will one day pass away?
[time=581] And so Paul is reminding us we live in the partial, we live in the partial, but the perfect is going to come and I remind you that's not you.
[time=588] Look at your spouse or your friend or whoever you're with, sorry, not you.
[time=593] Jesus is the perfect.
[time=594] What does that mean?
[time=595] It means one day.
[time=596] Listen, one day all of these earthly partial things, when the perfect Christ comes, the kingdom of God, all of my sanctification.
[time=603] What is that?
[time=604] It's a theological term that talks about us becoming like Christ, being transformed into the image of God.
[time=610] We're trying every day to follow after and to live out this kind of love.
[time=614] One of these days, all of that's going to go away and I will go from sanctify and just sanctify, that means that you are made just if I'd never sinned.
[time=622] You're justified by faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=625] One of these days, that'll turn into us being glorified.
[time=628] And that's when the perfect comes.
[time=629] That means that the eternal kingdom of God that Jesus is building is going to be forever built and nothing in no one can ever tear it down or distract us from it.
[time=638] And we will be together as children of God and a perfect kingdom with him forever.
[time=643] That doesn't get you excited.
[time=644] I don't know what exciter is broken on the inside of you, but that is the truth of Christianity that we cling to so tightly.
[time=652] The perfect will one day come and I'm so glad of that.
[time=656] Love out lasts all gifts.
[time=657] Number two, love doesn't just outlast all gift, it outlast all growth.
[time=661] Verses 11 and 12 talks about growth and so Paul's kind of continuing this look at, don't think you've arrived, don't ever think you've arrived.
[time=670] So love out lasts all growth.
[time=671] I'm all about spiritual growth and we should be, but may we never think that we've outgrown
[time=677] the God who gave us the growth to begin with.
[time=679] And Paul reminds us of this in verses 11 and 12.
[time=681] Verses 11, when I was a child, I spoke like a child.
[time=685] Some of us still do that today, don't we?
[time=688] I thought like a child.
[time=689] I reasoned like a child.
[time=691] When I became a man, I gave up childish ways, verse 12.
[time=695] For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face.
[time=700] Now I know in part, you see this contrast here now and then, now I know in part, then
[time=706] I shall know fully, I can't wait for that day.
[time=709] Then we really are know it all because we're with the one who knows it all and he's given us his glory.
[time=714] Even as I have been fully known and what a powerful verse that is in verse 11, you see this picture of growth from a child to an adult spiritually.
[time=723] And then in verse 12, two times, you see this now and a then.
[time=726] And that's kind of where we live, isn't it?
[time=728] As Christians, we hope in the then, but we live in the now and Paul is writing to that very thing.
[time=733] And in part, verses fully and I got to tell you guys, this verse just really did a number on me this week as I've studied it and read it to think that even when I've been a know it all, that when I've been arrogant, when I've been sinful, that my God knows me fully.
[time=752] He knows all of my flaws.
[time=753] He knows everything about me.
[time=759] That he still loves me.
[time=763] That should characterize this week for you as we go into Easter Sunday.
[time=767] That God, as soon as I became a child of his, he fully knows me.
[time=772] And even before he fully knew, but while I was still a sinner, God sent forth his son and he paid the price for my sin.
[time=780] He knows me, yet he loves me.
[time=783] And boy, what a glorious day it's going to be that we go from being fully known as we are now to fully knowing and comprehending all that is the breadth and height and width
[time=795] of the love of God and realize that nothing can separate us from that.
[time=799] The more we live in that today, the more we're going to be a picture of what is to come.
[time=804] And the more we get that now, the more we'll show other people what can be and will be then when Jesus comes back when the perfect comes.
[time=812] I'm so unworthy.
[time=814] My mind is so small, my life is but just an ant on the ground to the superior, king of
[time=820] kings and lord of lords, and instead of stomping me, he knelt down and he picked me up from the dust that I am, from the sinful, shameful person that I am as a flawed human being.
[time=831] And he said, I fully know you, but I love you so much that I'm going to send my son
[time=837] Jesus.
[time=838] I don't deserve it.
[time=840] I don't deserve it, yet the unconditional love of God gives it to us so freely, and I'm
[time=846] so thankful for my God.
[time=848] And he says, for now we see in a mirror dimly, the word of God is like into a mirror several times in Scripture.
[time=854] Mirrors in ancient times, so an ancient mirror did not look like your mirror.
[time=858] An ancient mirror would be some kind of polished metal.
[time=861] It's usually like bronze and they would polish it, and so literally they would look and they would see a pretty dim reflection.
[time=867] The Paul is using a relevant, timely thing that people use in this time and era to which he was writing that also reminds us of some spiritual truth, just like it did them.
[time=877] We only see dimly now, but then we're going to see Jesus face to face.
[time=882] Can you imagine that day?
[time=884] Can you imagine what it's going to be like to look Jesus in the eye of imagine it over and over?
[time=888] And I've thought of all these different scenarios, and I'd like to think that I'm just going to run up and just give him a big hug.
[time=892] But the more I think about it, I think I'm going to end up with my face on whatever ground there will be there.
[time=898] Because I'm so unworthy and I can just imagine a God who loves me so much that lifts up my
[time=904] face, looks me in the eye, and says welcome home and well done my good and faithful servant.
[time=911] Not because I'm really that good, but because he was that good.
[time=915] And his love outlast, every gift I could have, his love outlast, every bit of growth, and every bit of knowledge that I think I've attained, and he's going to pick me up and he's going to welcome me into the house of God forever.
[time=927] Now I see that dimly, but oh, when I see my Jesus face to face, what a glorious day that is going to be, and it's only possible because of the agape, unconditional love of God.
[time=939] Throughout scripture, places like James 1, 23 talks about being a doer of the word of God, not just a hearer of the word of God, and he reminds us, does James, that if you're just a hearer of the word, you're going to go away like someone who saw themselves in a mirror and forget what you saw, forget the truth, and boy I do that so many times in my life.
[time=957] 2 Corinthians 3, 18 tells us that we will with unveiled faces be able to behold the glory
[time=963] of God and he's going to transform us.
[time=966] Scripture goes on and on and on, but I'll share a couple more with you.
[time=970] One is 1 John 3, 2, 1 John chapter 3 and verse 2, you see the now and the then, beloved, you guys okay?
[time=976] Man, this is just powerful stuff.
[time=977] The love of God.
[time=978] Who would have thought it applies to us?
[time=980] David, we are God's children, when, now.
[time=984] And what we will be has not yet appeared, but we know, I'm so glad we can know, we know
[time=990] that when he appears, that's the perfect, we shall be like him because we shall see him
[time=996] as he is.
[time=998] Another verse for you is a follow up to 1 Corinthians 8 that we've already read is verse 3 follows up where we said, hey, if you think you know something, you really don't.
[time=1006] And then he says, but if anyone loves God, he is known by God.
[time=1011] My friends, look at me for a minute, screens wherever you're at.
[time=1014] God fully knows you, yep, that thing that just popped up into your mind, the skeleton near a closet, he knows, he fully knows you, yet he loves you.
[time=1023] Because his love outlasts our gifts, it outlasts our growth and number three, it outlasts the graces.
[time=1028] And so in verse 13, we see a list of three graces.
[time=1031] So the love of God outlasts all graces and these three graces are faith, hope and love.
[time=1036] So let's read verse 13 of 1 Corinthians 13, and this is the last verse that's taken us eight weeks to get here, you've made it.
[time=1042] And so I just got a free warning that I'm about to go to chapter 14 because it's just so good.
[time=1046] Let's just keep going.
[time=1047] Verse 13, so now faith, hope and love abide.
[time=1051] These three, but the greatest of these is love.
[time=1056] And I love this picture and it hit me in just a very powerful way, the picture of totality of time that we see here.
[time=1063] Because faith, faith has really a lot to do with our past.
[time=1067] The past finished work of Jesus on the cross, that Jesus was the theological term as substitutionary
[time=1073] atonement.
[time=1074] It means Jesus took our place.
[time=1076] He paid the price as our perfect sacrifice that we could never pay for ourselves.
[time=1082] And so faith has to do with our past because Jesus finished work on the cross.
[time=1086] When Jesus said it is finished, he meant it.
[time=1088] It is done.
[time=1089] It is finished.
[time=1090] That's the good news of the gospel, it's news because it already happens.
[time=1093] So faith has to do with the past because we place our faith in the saving work of Jesus.
[time=1098] So faith.
[time=1099] And then hope has to do with the future.
[time=1102] The New King James version is how I learned it growing up is that faith and hope, that faith is the evidence, the hall of fame of faith, it's the evidence of things that we hope for, the substance of the things not seen.
[time=1117] Hebrews chapter 11 and so this hope, faith, then hope has to do with the future.
[time=1121] We have our hope in a future eternal kingdom of God that we get to be a part of.
[time=1126] But the greatest of those three is love because love is the driving force that impacted everything
[time=1132] in our past that we put our faith in with the finished work of Jesus on the cross.
[time=1136] It was the agape love of God that sent him there.
[time=1138] And the hope that we long for for the future of being a part of the family of God is the agape love of God that gives us the avenue and the venue and the proper possibility to be a part of that kind of a family.
[time=1150] I love that picture of future past, but right now in the present we are to overflow with
[time=1156] the agape love of God.
[time=1159] I'm so thankful that he loves me in just such a way and the climax of this passage
[time=1165] you say, I thought we were done, I want to take you to verse 1 of chapter 14.
[time=1170] I believe the climax of chapter 13, the love chapter, really comes in chapter 14 in verse
[time=1176] 1 as I read it.
[time=1177] Because remember chapter 12 and chapter 14 are all about spiritual gifts.
[time=1181] But then comes chapter 14, don't miss this here, following all this up, he's about to transition now back into spiritual gifts and say, all right, now we can go back to what we were talking about.
[time=1190] He says, pursue, pursue, circle that in your Bible.
[time=1194] If you've got your Bible, I've got it circled in mine, you'll see why in a minute, pursue love, Dioko is the Greek word for this, and I'm going to tell you exactly what it means in some other places you see it in Scripture, Dioko agape, pursue love, and notice the order,
[time=1210] and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy.
[time=1215] And then he starts to unpack that further, but notice the order, pursue love, and then it's earnestly desire, the gifts.
[time=1222] Don't we get things out of order so many times in Christianity?
[time=1226] We desire the gifts.
[time=1227] We want to be upfront.
[time=1228] We want to get this.
[time=1229] I don't want my dream to come true, but we forget to pursue love.
[time=1231] We forget to pursue the will of God first so that it overflows in and through our lives.
[time=1237] And this word, I love, write down Acts, chapter 26.
[time=1242] I love how it's used other places in Scripture.
[time=1244] Acts, chapter 26, verse 11, Acts, 26, 11, describes Paul.
[time=1248] And this word is translated as persecute, Diokos, persecute.
[time=1251] You're like, no, wait a minute.
[time=1253] That's kind of confusing.
[time=1254] I mean, Acts, chapter 26, verse 11 is describing how Paul is persecuting Christians.
[time=1260] And the word really means this relentless, overwhelming, consuming pursuit with all of
[time=1267] your being.
[time=1268] And you think of the hatred that Paul had towards Christianity's.
[time=1272] He killed Christians.
[time=1274] He was set on eradicating the world of Christianity.
[time=1278] And with all of his being, he persecuted, persecuted and pursued Christians to make sure that
[time=1284] there was no Christianity in the world, with all of this hatred in its heart.
[time=1288] And then as he writes, as a redeemed person, if you don't know Paul's story, he met Jesus on the road to Damascus.
[time=1294] He blinded him and everything changed.
[time=1296] And then this hate field, just overwhelmingly pursuing, persecuting hateful follower of
[time=1304] religion.
[time=1305] And after Christianity, then he writes to the church at Corinth with the same word.
[time=1310] What a picture of redemption that we see here and says, pursue love.
[time=1315] It's really not a, you know, when it's convenient, you know, you should really think of love first.
[time=1320] Yeah.
[time=1321] No, it's pursue love with every ounce of your being to the point I felt when I hated Christianity
[time=1328] and I did everything in my power to eradicate it from the world with all that you've got until you have nothing left, pursue love.
[time=1337] Boy, you'll never look at that word the same again.
[time=1339] You see why it's the climax here of the love chapter.
[time=1344] God wants us to pursue love before we do anything else.
[time=1347] And I love the redemption story that we see of God.
[time=1350] This word that met prosecutors, translated as persecution in Paul's past.
[time=1356] Now he is pursuing with all of his being agape love, the same love we are studying.
[time=1361] And as we look at this, if love is that unending and if it really lasts like that, what does it mean for us?
[time=1367] And I just have a big time on my heart as we look at unending love today.
[time=1370] I think some of you are about to give up on something.
[time=1372] Maybe it's a relationship.
[time=1374] And maybe here's the question I want to ask you, are you about to give up on something that God is not done with?
[time=1380] Now listen, there are ends to things.
[time=1381] I'm not saying, as I asked this question, that some things don't come to an end.
[time=1384] Jesus ended the dominion of sin and the power of hell at the cross.
[time=1388] He came to end some things and sometimes there are seasons that come and go, but sometimes I'm worried that maybe in my lack of faith, like the walls of Jericho, they marched around them seven times, maybe I stopped on lap three or lap four or lap five or lap six when the
[time=1403] walls would have fell down if I would have just kept going a little longer.
[time=1406] So are you about to give up on something, a marriage, a relationship with your kids or your grandkids, a dream that God put on your heart, a career path that God has called you to a ministry, He's called you to be a part of, one that you're about to give up on, but God's just getting ready to start.
[time=1421] And I've got a heart for those of you who are letting failure lead you down this path where you're going to give up because you failed.
[time=1428] And I'm so glad that failure was finished at the cross.
[time=1432] God conquered sin.
[time=1433] He conquered our failures.
[time=1435] And the great theologian maybe you've heard of him, Michael Jordan.
[time=1440] We don't often go to him for theology, but I will today because he talked a lot about failure and maybe you've heard this quote and I just want to share it with you because what theological implication we can gain from it.
[time=1449] He said, I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career.
[time=1452] I've lost almost 300 games, 26 times I've been trusted to take the game winning shot
[time=1459] and missed.
[time=1460] I've failed over and over again in my life and that is why I succeed.
[time=1468] My friends, what makes you think that if Michael Jordan in the context, listen Hoosiers, if you can't get this illustration, come on, right?
[time=1476] If Michael Jordan through the scope and the lens and the avenue of basketball could look
[time=1482] at life that way, what makes us think that the God who created the entire universe, the
[time=1490] God who not just invented love, but the God who is love would be bound and confined by
[time=1497] our failures?
[time=1499] My friends, I came to tell you today, my God, your God is way bigger than your failures.
[time=1506] Stop believing the lies of the enemy and letting him squirt the fire of the flame of the love
[time=1512] of God in your life to remind you and point you back to failures that Jesus already paid
[time=1518] the price for.
[time=1520] Be free, my friends.
[time=1522] That's the beauty of this week and I'm so thankful that God loves me that much.
[time=1525] Because I want to give you a perfect illustration, you say, well, wow, that's pretty arrogant if you pastor, a perfect illustration.
[time=1532] You think you're that good?
[time=1533] No, but Jesus was.
[time=1534] Jesus is my perfect illustration of pursuing.
[time=1536] When you think of 1 Corinthians 14 and verse 1, pursue agape love.
[time=1540] I want to spend our last few minutes on Palm Sunday because we see a pursuit of agape love from Jesus as he rode into Jerusalem.
[time=1548] So John chapter 12 verses 12 through 15, 16 rather, let's read those together.
[time=1553] This is when Jesus now context, Jesus has done all kind of miracles, he's raised Lazarus from the dead, he's got all these big crowds following him.
[time=1559] They think that he's going to come and be the king of Israel, he's going to be this great warrior king, he's going to overthrow Rome, and so he's coming into Jerusalem.
[time=1566] So they have this picture of who Jesus is, they think he's that guy, but Jesus knows the truth.
[time=1571] And so with that in mind, here's what we read, John chapter 12 verses 12 through 16.
[time=1575] The next day, a large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.
[time=1581] So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying out, "Hosanna, blessed
[time=1588] is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the king of Israel." And Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it just as it is written.
[time=1597] And then he quotes, we read a quote here from Zechariah 9, 9, it's an Old Testament prophecy, some 500 plus years before Jesus came along, what we read in verse 15, "Fear not, daughter of Zion, behold, your king is coming, sitting on a donkey's colt, and Jesus fulfilled that prophecy to remind you and me today that his promises are true because he is trustworthy
[time=1618] and he never fails on his promises." Don't miss that part as we look at the rest.
[time=1622] Verse 16, then his disciples, a lot like what we do in our faith, they didn't understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and had been done to him.
[time=1637] The light bulb kind of came on, and I believe that God's going to do some of the same thing in your life.
[time=1642] I'm so glad that we see the promises of God coming true in verse 15, but verse 12, the large crowd, they followed him.
[time=1648] They had palm branches, and our kids have these and our kids ministry today and there's looks way cooler in mind, actually should have stolen theirs, but anyway.
[time=1656] They had palm branches, and these palm branches were going to serve as a powerful reminder
[time=1662] in the present, now to us in the past of what God's going to do in the future.
[time=1666] They said, "Hosanna," and this comes from phrases in the Old Testament like what we read in Psalm 118 and verse 25, let's look at it together, where it says, "Save us," we pray.
[time=1677] That's the meaning of the word "Hosanna," "save us now," "save us now," you could translate it.
[time=1682] From all the way back in the Hebrew text like this one, "save us," we pray, "O Lord," "O Lord," we pray, "give us success." That's what they were screaming.
[time=1689] It was a prayer to God, "save us," "be our salvation," and they worshiped him, and they lifted him up, and they waved their palm branches, and they put their coats on the ground, but I don't want you to miss what Jesus knew.
[time=1701] As they saw this picture of salvation, Jesus knew what the real picture of salvation was going to require.
[time=1707] Jesus knew that, listen, their desperation for a Savior and salvation, that their expectation
[time=1714] for a Savior would soon, in the course of one week, turn into total hypocrisy, and that
[time=1721] many of the people who shouted, "Hosanna, blessed be this King of Israel," would soon
[time=1727] be screaming, "Crucify him," after he carried his own cross, and bled and felt pain like
[time=1734] none of us can ever even imagine.
[time=1737] So as Jesus rode in, and he saw the palm branches, and he saw their celebration, he knew that that desperation and expectation would soon turn into hypocrisy and pain, but here's what my Jesus did, because of the unconditional love of God, the agape love of God that Paul writes about this unending love, compelled Jesus to choose rescue over resentment.
[time=1760] Now if I were riding into Jerusalem and I'd known what Jesus would have known, I would have said, "You can just put those palm branches down." I'm done with you.
[time=1768] There's no way I'm going through all this for knuckleheads like you, not my Jesus.
[time=1777] He could have resented all of that, that he knew was awaiting him, but instead he chose rescue.
[time=1784] And because he did, we now have a model do the same thing, the same unending love.
[time=1788] Get this, the unending love that compelled Jesus, it also compels us to choose grace
[time=1794] over grumbling.
[time=1795] Give me your best grumble real quick.
[time=1800] Some of you just came in today grumbling.
[time=1801] Some of us, we just look for opportunities to grumble and complain and be critical and be negative, but gosh, when we understand this agape love of God that calls Jesus to
[time=1812] choose rescue over resentment, listen, followers of Jesus, it has to change our lives.
[time=1819] It has to change how we love difficult people.
[time=1822] It has to change our perspective, and so we can choose grace over grumbling.
[time=1829] And I love what John 12 does, because I talk to you a lot about past and present and future.
[time=1835] Don't check out on me just yet.
[time=1836] This is one of the most powerful things that I think we can keep in mind as we go from Palm Sunday into this Holy Week, so we go to Good Friday and then into Easter, that these palm branches, they were in the present, here's what I pray for us.
[time=1848] In the present right now today, I pray that in the past, as we look at the palm branches of the past from John 12, that it will help us to remember the palm branches of the future.
[time=1860] John wrote about this vision that he had of the things that are to come in the book of Revelation, and I want to show you the palm branches of the future.
[time=1867] We just read about the ones in the past, Revelation 7, 9.
[time=1869] After this, I looked and behold a great multitude that no one could number from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the
[time=1881] Lamb, clothed in white rose with, what, with what, say it out loud, with palm branches,
[time=1888] with palm branches in their hands, and crying out with a loud voice, salvation belongs to
[time=1895] the Lord our God who sits on the throne and to the Lamb.
[time=1900] So my friends, may we as we look at Palm Sunday and how Jesus chose rescue over resentment as they wave their palm branches saying, "Hosanna, let these palm branches from the past remind us of the palm branches that we will hold in the future as one body, as a group of family,
[time=1916] at the foot of the throne of God, crying out, we have salvation, and we are a part of God's family because he, through agape, unconditional love, chose to love us and rescue us instead
[time=1927] of resenting us and turning his back on us when we needed him the most.
[time=1933] Praise be to my Jesus.
[time=1935] I thank God for who he is and for the future palm branches.
[time=1938] I want to give you two application questions as we ramp up our time together.
[time=1942] Number one is, what am I about to give up on that I should press into?
[time=1947] Take you back to this.
[time=1950] God's ready.
[time=1951] The flame's never going out.
[time=1952] God's the source.
[time=1953] It's still there all the time, no matter what, but God's ready to reignite some things in your life.
[time=1959] God's ready for what was quenched in your life to be reignited.
[time=1962] The flame's been there.
[time=1963] The source has never changed, but the candles of your life tend to go up and they tend to go down.
[time=1968] God's ready to reignite a passion.
[time=1970] God's ready to reignite the flame and the fervor of your faith that maybe you had years and years ago, or maybe he's lighting a flame in the darkness that is your heart right now and he's showing you and convicting you of sin and calling you to be a part of his family today.
[time=1984] So what is it that you're about to give up on?
[time=1985] Don't give up on faith.
[time=1987] Don't give up on a God who can reignite anything he chooses in your life as a believer and certainly as someone who doesn't know what you believe just yet.
[time=1995] God's ready to meet you right where you are.
[time=1997] What are you about to give up on that God says, "Press into it." Number two, how, how can I choose grace over grumbling?
[time=2006] It's a good question.
[time=2007] How can I choose grace over grumbling?
[time=2009] Certainly unending love like agape, that God has demonstrated to us the flames that he ignites in our life.
[time=2015] It compels us to have grace even in the most difficult circumstances.
[time=2019] How can you apply that this week?
[time=2020] Don't ask just about your heads.
[time=2022] Close your eyes.
[time=2023] What does it mean followers of Jesus right now?
[time=2026] To choose grace over grumbling?
[time=2028] What does it mean for you to press into, maybe something you're ready to give up on because God is just getting started?
[time=2036] Believers in the room, maybe some application I haven't even covered today.
[time=2040] Ask God to answer those questions and he's going to meet you where you are.
[time=2043] I also want to speak to those of you who would say, "I just don't know that I know that I know that I'm a believer, that I'm a part of the family of God by grace through faith that I've been saved." It's not of my own works, it's a gift of God and you know those things, but you've never truly trusted in those things.
[time=2060] I'm so thankful for times just like this where you can say yes to Jesus.
[time=2064] When we say that, it just simply means you surrender everything to Jesus.
[time=2068] The gospel has already happened.
[time=2069] I'm not going to lead you in a prayer because your heart's screaming it.
[time=2071] The Spirit of God is drawing you and pulling you, but it's as simple as you believing that Jesus is who he said he is, that he paid that price for your sin.
[time=2078] You know you're a sinner, you're separated from God because of your sin, but Jesus paid it all.
[time=2084] He was that perfect substitute of sacrifice for you, and he rose from the dead.
[time=2089] He defeated death hell in the grave.
[time=2091] That's why there is a flame that can be ignited in our heart through his love.
[time=2095] He lights it, not us, and he's doing that just now.
[time=2098] Your role in salvation is to acknowledge and accept, admit, believe, and confess with the
[time=2104] ABCs of my childhood, admit that I'm a sinner, believe Jesus paid it all, that he rose again, and confess with my mouth and ask Jesus to be the Lord of my life, to come in and take over.
[time=2115] Will you do that right now in your own words as we all reflect, don't miss the power of this moment.
[time=2119] Whatever's going on in your head, nothing's more important than where God's leading.
[time=2121] You take that next step right now.
