[time=0] Today I get to start a brand new series with you called inadequate me and I want to invite you
[time=7] to turn in your Bibles to the book of Judges. It's in the Old Testament toward the beginning of your Bible. Give you a couple of minutes to find it for all of the newbies to this new series that may
[time=17] give you a moment to find it. Judges chapter 6 is where we'll be today. We'll go back to chapter 2 just a little bit and adequate me. Have you ever felt inadequate in life? I know I have. And today we're looking at the life of Gideon for the next six weeks we will do so. And today I want to talk to you about God's call in life's chaos. God's call through life's chaos. Judges chapter 6 will
[time=38] be in the first 16 verses today. And as we do that and prepare for that, I don't know about you,
[time=44] but there are times in my life I feel stuck in my faith. Can you relate? You just feel stuck
[time=50] and stagnant. And maybe you showed up today or maybe you've logged in and welcome all of our online family for on a screen all of you in the room wherever you're at today. We all can relate to this idea of being stuck. And so can Gideon because here's the deal they as the Israelites. This
[time=65] is the nation of Israel. We're going to give you some context in just a few moments, but they've witnessed God do miracles. He has delivered them from Egypt. But it's possible they learn to witness the miracles of God yet not walk in those miracles. It's possible to have a green light from
[time=81] God, but yet we end up stuck in our sinfulness and in our stubbornness. And that is exactly the kind of setting that Gideon finds himself in. I can think of a lot of times where I was stuck
[time=92] in my life. I'm sure you can too. One of which was when I learned to drive a manual transmission
[time=98] vehicle, a straight shift. And my dad is here over to my left and I'll never forget him teaching me
[time=105] how to drive a straight shift. Back when I was a teenager, if you didn't know some of my history, we grew up around farms my whole life. And so we went out into a pasture with his little Chevy S10
[time=115] pickup, straight shift vehicle. And we drove in that pasture over and over and he was patient with me. And I can remember, you know, there's the clutch that's on your left and then there's the break and there's the gas for those of you who haven't had the privilege of walking that journey like I have. And you got to let off the clutch and give it some gas and you learn. But as you're learning the combination of those two things, you can kind of end up doing something like this.
[time=138] And I remember us bouncing through the pasture and always looking over at my dad and he was always so calm with me. I'll come back to that in a minute. But I'll never forget one specific time where here we are bouncing through the pasture. And he just goes, yeah. And I'm angry and
[time=155] frustrated because I felt so inadequate. Like I'm never going to learn how to do this. And I was angry at him. He was like, stop it. Now's not the time for jokes. This is serious. I can't figure this out. And eventually I figured it out. And I'll never forget the time I got stuck.
[time=168] One of the first times I drove by myself. Now I got my license and I drove his little Chevy S10
[time=174] truck straight shift by myself. And I ran into the nightmare of anybody who's just learned to
[time=180] drive a straight shift. I stopped at a red light on a hill. And you know, I would just kind of spin
[time=187] out, you know, make sure you give it plenty of gas. But somebody was in front of me. Somebody was behind me. And you know, you can roll backwards and hit somebody behind you. And so I'm dripping sweat and shaking and I'll never forget the first time that ever happened to me. The light turned green and it went dead. I let it go dead. And I tried again and it happened again. And I didn't
[time=208] run into the people behind me. But the people in front of me had already left. And then the people behind me just went right on around. They just passed me. And then I finally got to moving and it turned red. And I had just been stuck and missed my opportunity to go. I'll still remember that. And
[time=224] praise God. I learned how to drive it better and I could get through red lights and go and it was time to go. But listen, the same thing happens to us in our faith. And the same thing is going on for the life of Gideon. He's a part of a nation, the nation of Israel. God's own people who found
[time=238] themselves stuck. They're literally in the promised land. They've been given the promises and the blessings of God, the land of Canaan that flows of milk and honey. And they've got this amazing green light from God yet over and over there in this cycle of just getting stuck with their own foolishness, their own stubbornness, and their own self-imposed red lights. And people were just going right home by them. Can you relate? Sometimes that happens to us just like it happened to the nation of Israel. And that is the context that we find Gideon in as we dig into this. Because it's possible to witness the miracles of God yet not walk in them. And with that in mind, I walk us now
[time=274] into three things. I'm going to walk us through Gideon's context, life's chaos, and God's call.
[time=280] Let's start with number one today, starting in Judges chapter two. So if you found chapter six, flip a couple of pages back. Gideon's context. Let's start there today. Gideon's context. This will
[time=290] help inform the entire six weeks of the series that we are going into. And I want to take you back to Judges chapter number two, because it gives a great picture of the cycle and of the context
[time=300] that Gideon finds himself in. So I ask you today, Blackhawk, online screens in the room, wherever you are. Are you ready for the word today? I don't know if you're stuck, but God's ready to get you going with some green lights through his word today. Judges chapter two, let's start in verse number seven, and we'll get a picture of the context here. "And the people serve the Lord, all the days of Joshua,
[time=321] and all the days of the elders who outlive Joshua, who had seen all the great work that the Lord had done for Israel, and Joshua, son of none, the servant of the Lord, died at the age of 110
[time=333] years." Verse nine, "And they buried him within the boundaries of his inheritance, and Timnath Harris in the hill, country of Ephraim, north of the mountain of Gahash." Verse ten, and don't miss
[time=344] verse ten. "And all that generation also were gathered to their fathers, and there arose another
[time=350] generation after them, who did not know the Lord or the work that he had done for Israel.
[time=358] And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and served the bales, false God, idolatry is rampant here." Verse twelve, "And they abandoned the Lord, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt. They went after other gods from among the
[time=373] gods of the peoples who were around them, and they bowed down to them, and they provoked the Lord
[time=380] to anger." We'll stop there for just a moment, and I'm going to give you a few things about the context of Gideon. The first thing is timing. I'm going to give you the timing of judges, the book of judges. I'm going to give you the theme of the book of judges, and then I'm going to give you the title of the book of judges. What is a judge anyway? So we'll go through all three of those, starting with the timing. So the timing of all of this setting took place in between Joshua, as we just read. Joshua and Caleb, and they followed Moses and the journey and the wilderness to the
[time=408] promised land. And so we're in that season now, where we're in between Joshua and the kings that
[time=414] would eventually rule over the nation of Israel, which would be Samuel and King Saul. So that's the period of the judges. The book of judges is that. It's a book of your Bible, one of the 66 books in your Bible, but it's also a time period. It's a time period known as the time, the period of the judges in the life of Israel. So that's the timing. It's about a thousand or so, over a thousand years
[time=435] before the birth of Christ. And you see all these events unfold that would eventually lead to Christ, because Jesus is in every book of the Bible. Can I get an amen? He's even in judges, even in this crazy time of the judges. So that's the timing of Gideon's context. The theme now of judges and of
[time=452] this context, it really is this downward spiral of disobedience of the nation of Israel. They
[time=459] constantly went through this cycle over and over of disobedience to the Lord, and they saw really clearly a need for Godly leadership. They were kingless, and they were without leadership that
[time=470] was constantly pushing them forward. We saw the generation of Joshua, Moses, Joshua, Caleb, and then now we're in this season where they're lacking in some of that godly leadership. Idolatry was rampant. They worshipped Baal and all kinds of false gods, and they were priestesses who were prostitutes, and the Israelites were getting wrapped up into these Canaanite women, and all of these false religious, false god paths that are just different than the ones we see today, perhaps, but
[time=497] they're still exactly in the same kind of process that we look at around us. But let me show you
[time=503] maybe visually there's a cycle of the judges. So let's call this our judges cycle. This is what you see throughout the book of judges, throughout this time period, and maybe even a little bit more. So let's look at it. It usually starts with a rebellion where we're following the world. Just like we read, Judges chapter 2, verses 7 through 12, and Joshua raised up this generation that followed the Lord, and then they rebelled, and they didn't follow what the Lord planned for their lives. They didn't remember the Lord who had delivered them from Egypt, so they rebelled, they follow false gods, they do their own thing, and then they run into the results of their rebellion. If you ever notice that happens, whenever you turn away from the Lord, you end up finding yourself in a big pile of mess, and you wonder how did I get into these results, and these consequences. Rebellion leads to results, and then they realize, oh, we imposed a lot of this on ourselves. What were we thinking? And they repent. Repentant shows up where they turn away from the error of their ways, turn to God, ask Him to save them, and do what He does next, and that's bring restoration. Rebellion leads to results, leads to repentance, leads to restoration, and then they have a period of rest. Everybody go, we like this period, but then we kind of get comfortable again, and we think, well, I kind of got myself here. Yeah, I did this, and then your
[time=572] period of rest leads to repeat. So it's rebellion, result, repentance, restoration, rest, repeat. Say
[time=581] it with me one time. Rebellion, result, repentance, restoration, rest, repeat, and that is the cycle
[time=589] of the judges, and that, dare I say, might just be the cycle of humanity. It might be kind of how
[time=595] we still do things, but then comes this Jesus who changes everything, and even in the Old Testament,
[time=601] even in these cycles, we see the grace and the mercy of God show up and bring restoration when the knuckleheads didn't deserve it over and over again, just like God does for us through Jesus Christ, and all God's people said. God is a good, good Father, and this theme of grace is one that
[time=617] the elders and I have felt so strong that we want to be a church in a world that's so divided and
[time=623] so filled with hate. We want to be a church that's characterized as a culture of grace and mercy.
[time=629] Why? Because that's the culture that God created everywhere he went, and every time he dealt with knuckleheads in the Old Testament, in the New Testament, and in our New Covenant Church period that we live in right now. So that's the cycle, and it ends with this last line. This is the book of Judges, the last verse in the whole book of Judges, Judges 21, 25 says, "In these days there was no king in Israel." That would come following this period, but get this. Everyone did what was right
[time=654] in his own eyes. Does that sound familiar? We've kind of repeated that cycle many times too, yet God
[time=661] loves us, and he calls us even in life's chaos. So you got to understand the theme has a lot to do
[time=667] with the setting as well. So this setting for the Israelites, God's own people, are in the promised land. God's delivered them from Egypt. They've wandered in the wilderness, and now they're in the promised land, the land of Canaan, the land that flows with milk and honey. This is the promised land of God, and so don't miss this. They are in the place where God had promised them, yet they
[time=688] were disobediently missing the fruit of the place that God had promised them. Did you know that's possible for you and for me? God's promise was present, but they were not. They didn't take hold
[time=699] of the land the way that God said to do it. They disobediently did things their own way, followed after idols, and no matter where you're at today, here's what I want to remind you of, that God has a purpose for where he has planted you. God has a purpose. Some of you don't like where you're
[time=714] planted, and they would have loved this land flowing with milk and honey, yet they still went off on their own path. I don't know where you feel planted right now, but God has a purpose for you right where you're planted, and even when you're a knucklehead in the midst of it, even when you miss the mark in the midst of it, God will still make his purpose known. You can be in the place though that God wants you to be, but miss his purpose and miss his promises because you end up getting stuck or focused on everything but what God has for your life. Yet God, but God,
[time=742] somebody say but God, but God who is rich in his mercy, who is rich in grace, shows up,
[time=748] and Judges chapter 2 and verse 16, we see his grace and his mercy. Judges 2, 16, then the Lord
[time=756] raised up judges who saved them out of the hand of those who plundered them. This is a picture of
[time=762] God's grace and of his mercy, he sends these judges. So we've looked at the timing now, the theme,
[time=768] but let me give you the title of judges. When I hear the phrase judges, I think of somebody in a black robe with a big gavel, hammer, and a courtroom kind of thing, right, but that's not really the best picture of what we're looking at. These people are leaders that God raised up. And so we're going to talk a little about who they are that these leaders stepped forward. Judges are leaders who led Israel during this time between Joshua and then King Saul. And here's how you
[time=792] could define them. And it's a lot like what God does with us today. They're people, leaders that God called and then God equipped them. Did you know that God doesn't always call the equipped, but he always equips the called? That's what he did with these people. They weren't very equipped.
[time=806] They were a mess. But God called these people and he equipped these people to lead the people of God against the enemies of God, to do the work of God. That's a judge. That's the title of a judge.
[time=818] It's leaders for God's people who stood in the gap and led people to follow after the heart of God. But here's the thing about these judges. Gideon was the fifth of some 12 plus, depending on how you make your lists from the book of Judges. Judges, Gideon's the fifth one. None of them, including Gideon, were this perfect exemplary leadership material that was a perfect,
[time=839] exemplary picture of what it looks like to lead God's people. They were a mess. They made big
[time=845] mistakes over and over again, yet God called them. And yet God lists many of them, like Gideon, in the Hall of Fame of Fate, as we often call it in Hebrews chapter 11. Hebrews 11 verse 32. Let's see it together. Hebrews 11, 32. And what more shall I say? For time would fail me to tell of
[time=862] say it. Gideon, there's that guy. That's our guy. And he's a real guy, just like you and me. He's
[time=869] not a character, a cartoon character. He's a real person who lived and breathed in history and got written down in the Hall of Fame of Fate to tell of Gideon, Barack, Samson, Jeff the of David and
[time=880] Samuel, and the prophets, verse 33, who through fate conquered kingdoms and forced justice obtained
[time=886] promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword.
[time=893] I love this part, were made strong out of weakness, became mighty, in poor, put foreign armies to
[time=902] flight. That's what God was calling even through these people that don't seem like they had it all
[time=908] together. So that's the context of Gideon. It gives you the title, it gives you this theme and the timing. And now that we see that, let's talk about number two, it's life's chaos.
[time=917] So we find Gideon in the context now of chaos. And maybe you find your life in the context and
[time=923] the cycles, if you will, of chaos as well. This comes from Judges chapter 6. Flip over a couple of pages. This is where we'll camp out. Judges chapter 6, and I want to read to you about Gideon's context now that turns into the picture of life's chaos. Maybe you can relate. Gideon
[time=939] shows up on the scene later in verse 11, but let's read the first 10 verses to see how chaotic life
[time=945] was. You guys doing okay? Let's dig in. Verse 1, "The people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord gave them into the hand of Midians seven years.
[time=955] And the hand of Midian overpowered Israel. And because of Midian, the people of Israel were made
[time=962] for themselves, the dens that are in the mountains and the caves and the strongholds. For whenever
[time=968] the Israelites planted crops, the Midianites and Amalekites, and the people of the east would come up against them. They would encamp against them and devour the produce of the land as far as Gaza
[time=979] and leave no sustenance in Israel and no sheep or ox or donkey." Verse 5, "For they went,
[time=985] for they would come up with their livestock and their tents. They would come like locusts in number,
[time=991] both they and their camels could not be counted. So they laid waste the land as they came in.
[time=997] And Israel was brought very low because of Midian. Perhaps you can relate. And the people of Israel
[time=1004] cried out for help to the Lord. The cycle shows up already here. Verse 7, "When the people of Israel
[time=1010] cried out to the Lord on the account of the Amideonites, the Lord sent a prophet to the people of Israel.
[time=1016] He said to them, 'Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, I led you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of bondage, and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all who oppressed you and drove them out before you and gave you their land. And I said to you,
[time=1032] I am the Lord your God. You shall not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell,
[time=1039] but you have not obeyed my voice." Sounds a little chaotic, doesn't it? So I want to introduce you
[time=1045] now to the Midianites. And so as we look at the Midianites, I want us to look at the who and the who and the when of their pillaging, of their plundering that they would come in, because they would come in after harvest. And the Israelites would do all this work. And for seven years Gideon shows up about the eighth invasion, as we'll see in just a moment. But let's talk about the who of the Midianites. This is interesting. If you study the Midianites, you're going to find that they trace
[time=1069] their lineage and ancestry all the way back to Father Abraham, just like the nation of God, just like the Israelites. And so what does that make them? That makes them. You ready for this?
[time=1079] Distant cousins of the people of God. They're related. Sometimes your Midianites in life
[time=1085] might be related to you. And not if you can agree, but don't nod too much because they might be
[time=1091] watching. They may be in the building with you. Sometimes the Midianites, the problems that come about in your life, the ways the enemy attacks you may come from within your own camp, may come from people that you think it would never come from unexpected places, unexpected people, and even when unexpected times. That's the other thing. These Midianites would come in. The Israelites would work the entire season sewing and watering and planting and doing all of the work that would bring about a harvest. But when harvest time came, then would come the Midianites. The Israelites did all the work, but the Midianites would come in, take all of their hard labor, and leave them with
[time=1127] nothing. So before you start judging Gideon too hard, he was a pretty fearful guy. You can have that. But what would you do if you lived in that setting? That's the chaos that is life. The
[time=1139] problems are coming from the unexpected places, the unexpected people. And just like the enemy does, did you know we have a real enemy as we stand up for Jesus? And he fights and he's ready to still kill, destroy, and devour every ounce of the work of God in your life. Just like those Midianites
[time=1154] who came and leave no sustenance for Israel, he wants you to walk around a dead person walking.
[time=1159] He's ready to tear down everything God's doing in your life. And sometimes he will just like the Midianites did with the Israelites. He will send the biggest problems into your life right when you finally get your feet on the ground and your nose above water. And then boom, something hits again.
[time=1174] Can I get an amen? So maybe you can relate to the chaos that is life for the Israelites, for the
[time=1180] context of Gideon's story, the cycles that they've lived in. But I've got to draw out when we look at this chaos where it came from. Sometimes we don't ask for chaos. Sometimes things that we didn't bring on ourselves come about, right? We usually go to that. But sometimes we just bring
[time=1196] some things on ourselves. And sometimes God gives us an opportunity to invest. So I want to challenge you my friends. Generations was a word used several times in Judges chapter 2. The generation of Joshua and then came this generation who knew not the Lord. They didn't know the Lord or the works of the Lord. And they certainly didn't walk in the ways of the Lord. And so I challenge you today, Church, do not underestimate the power and the possibilities that come from one generation pouring into the
[time=1222] next generation, the word of the Lord and the ways of the Lord and the will of the Lord. If you're a
[time=1229] parent, if you're a grandparent, if you're around people at work, or if you have an opportunity to invest in people, raise your hand if that's you. If you're not raising your hand, you're asleep, somebody elbow them. If that is you today, then you need to take note from what happened in the nation of Israel. Because Joshua led this generation that was built on truth. It was built
[time=1250] on obedience. But in one generation's time, the investment slowed down. And before along, they became this generation who didn't know the Lord and didn't follow after the ways of the Lord. And so what that tells me is that the disarray of this season came from the disobedience
[time=1265] and was poured into by the investments of the previous generation. You could learn it this way that today's investments become tomorrow's impact. So I ask you today, what investments are
[time=1277] you making today? And those that you're parenting, listen, all the parenting that you're doing right now, at least what's going to pour into tomorrow's impact, tomorrow's potential in your kids and in those people you're investing in. What investment are you making today that will lead to tomorrow's impact? Good or bad or in between? We can't neglect that picture that's here. So what investments are
[time=1297] you making? Now the Israelites, they'd really come to expect problems. You ever been that way? We just
[time=1303] got into a negative headspace. You just expect there's going to be a problem. It's like things are going pretty well right now. So I wonder when the bad thing's going to happen. You ever been in that spot? You ever lived with that person? You ever know what I'm saying? We all get to those spots. We just expect problems. We look for issues. We look for sometimes controversies,
[time=1322] opportunity to be critical, opportunities to be negative. We look for the bad while God is trying to bring about the good. And if you can relate to the Israelites, they expected the Midianites to come. It's like here they come. That's why Gideon's in the winepress. We'll look at that in just a moment. Here they come again. But here's a verse for you Psalm 112 verses 6 and 7. If that's where you're at, read it from the new international version. It says, "Surely the righteous will never be shaken." They will be remembered forever. Don't miss verse 7. They will have no fear
[time=1352] of bad news. Their hearts are steadfast, trusting in the Lord. I want to, even in the middle of cycles
[time=1361] and contexts of chaos that life brings about, I want to live that out. I don't want to fear bad
[time=1367] news. I want to look for God in such a way that the next generation can look to my shoulders and can stand on the shoulders of my faith that I invest in them today so that tomorrow's impact
[time=1378] comes from me living out and following the call of God even in the midst of life's chaos.
[time=1384] Who's with me? I want to be that kind of church. I want to have that kind of faith.
[time=1390] And now we enter Gideon. You're like, I thought this was a series about Gideon.
[time=1393] Well, now you know the context and the cycle. Now you know the chaos that God's call comes from.
[time=1398] Now let's go to the third thing and that is God's call. Judges chapter 6 verses 11 through 16.
[time=1404] We're going to dig into these verses and this is going to get real personal, just like it was for Gideon. So let's dig into God's call. Judges chapter 6 starting in verse 11.
[time=1414] Now the angel of the Lord came and sat under a terrible at Ophra which belonged to Joash,
[time=1420] the abi is right. Well, don't you love these names? Just read them confidently. Nobody will ever know the difference. While his son Gideon, there he is. There's our friend Gideon.
[time=1429] While his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the wine press to hide it from the Midianized.
[time=1434] Now you know why. Verse 12 and the angel of the Lord appeared to him and said to him, "The Lord is with you, almighty man of valor." And Gideon said to him, "Please,
[time=1444] her, if the Lord is with us, why then has all this happened to us?"
[time=1450] Can I get an amen if you've ever asked that question? And where are all his wonderful
[time=1456] deeds that our fathers recounted to us saying did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt, but now the Lord has forsaken us and given us into the hand of Midian.
[time=1463] And the Lord turned to him or some virgin say looked at him and said, "Go in this might of yours."
[time=1469] I love that. "Go in this might of yours and save Israel from the hand of Midian. Do not I send you."
[time=1477] And he said to him, "Please, Lord, how can I save Israel? Behold, my clan is the weakest in
[time=1483] Manasseh and I am the least in my father's house." Inadequate me. Verse 16 and the Lord said to him,
[time=1491] "But I will be with you and you shall strike the Midianized as one man." We see God's call and
[time=1499] this is about the time of the eighth Midianite invasion that was coming. They all knew it was coming. I want to give you three words that will characterize the rest of our series as God called Gideon. Here's who he called. Chapter 6 Gideon was a coward. It's a coward. Maybe you can relate.
[time=1514] You can write these down if you want to have an outline of Gideon. In chapter 7 he became a conqueror, coward, conqueror. And then in chapter 8 you'll see he became again a compromiser. So he goes through
[time=1524] this up and down journey, this inadequate me kind of journey, but God still does his mighty work through this coward turned conqueror turned a compromiser in chapter 6 through 8. God used his
[time=1536] inadequacies to overcome the impossibilities that his nation was facing. Yeah, I just said that. Look
[time=1543] at me again. He used his inadequacies. You thought God gave up on you because of those, right? But
[time=1549] God's just getting started with you, my brothers and my sisters, just like he was with Gideon. And so as we look at Gideon there's a hundred verses in the book of Judges about Gideon. That's more verses about Gideon in the book of Judges than any other judge. So that's interesting, but what strikes me the most is that Gideon is really the only judge whose personal struggles and his fate
[time=1570] really get documented at an in-depth level in the book of Judges. And so that's why he's probably my favorite judge to read about in this book. We see the struggles of others, but man we really see into the heart and into the internal part of the struggles of Gideon. So let's go verse by verse through 11 through 16. Verse 11, Gideon's in a wine press, a wine press. And he's got his wheat
[time=1591] and he's hiding for fear of his life and for fear of his goods. And it's interesting to know that you would not ever really beat out your wheat because you would beat the wheat out and the
[time=1601] chaff, the Bible talks about this in many places too, the chaff would blow away with the wind and
[time=1607] then the wheat would fall to the ground and then you would gather up the wheat. So you would never do that in a wine press because that's an enclosed kind of hidden area, airtight, more area. You would typically do that in what's called a threshing floor which is usually going to be this open air area where the wind can come through, blow away that chaff, the wheat can fall down. But before you judge Gideon, book of Judges, we're a lot of judges sometimes. We judge Gideon before we can think about the context and the chaos that he's in that God calls him into. What would you be doing?
[time=1635] He's trying to feed his family, he's trying to figure it out. Is he a coward? Absolutely.
[time=1639] Is he living in fear? Absolutely. But that was kind of the season. A lot like what we look around and see in our world today. But yet God's call comes and listen, meets Gideon in the place
[time=1650] that he really shouldn't have been. He was doing it in the hardest way possible. There's no wind, but he's doing it there. He's doing the best that he can do. And God, even though it feels like, even though it feels like you're in the wrong place at the wrong time, God can come and redeem the wrong place at the wrong time for the wrong reasons and do the right thing at the right time for the right reasons and is for the kingdom of God. And that is exactly what God's call looks like in the life of Gideon. He shows up in this winepress where Gideon shouldn't have been to begin with. And he meets him there and he calls him to follow after him. He meets him in his difficulty.
[time=1683] He meets him in his isolation. And even in the problems, God made it so that Gideon was poised
[time=1691] for his calling, poised for the purpose of God in his life. Some of you think crisis means that God has left you. And I came to share with you today that God has not abandoned you.
[time=1703] In fact, crisis are often the times that God likes to show up and show out the most. I believe that crisis, when it comes to your calling, crisis is often what cultivates calling more than convenience. We think, well, God will call me when things get convenient, when I get comfortable in my faith. But God likes to show up in crisis. And it often cultivates a call out of the fire that refines us. God calls us to a purpose and a plan in our life that we wouldn't have gotten to
[time=1729] without the crisis. Whatever it is that you're going through, I don't know what it is, but whatever it is that you face today, I can tell you this, that God has either allowed it or arranged it in your life. But whatever it is, he is using it. He is using it. God doesn't waste
[time=1744] pain. God doesn't waste crises in his economy. He's got a plan and a purpose for whatever baggage,
[time=1751] whatever chaos of life you brought in with you today. And I can prove it to you. In verse 12,
[time=1757] God renames Gideon. Oh, it's about to get good. I love this part. God renames Gideon. He says, how are you, oh, mighty man of valor? And I can tell you there's zero verses to support that Gideon
[time=1768] had done anything that even began to resemble a mighty warrior, a mighty man of valor. But yet he
[time=1775] says, how are you, you, almighty man of valor? He calls him in the midst of this chaos. And here's
[time=1781] what God does and it's what he wants to do with us. He named Gideon based on what he saw and what he could and would put in Gideon, not based on what Gideon was or was not or had done or had not done.
[time=1794] And God does the same thing with us. Gideon was hiding in fear, but God saw courage welling up
[time=1800] inside through his spirit and his power. And as we look at this today, here's what I want to remind you of. I don't know who's been naming you. I don't know who you've been giving naming rights to. What they said you are or would be. But I want you to know you are who God says you are.
[time=1814] God looks at us as his kids as we follow Jesus and he says, you are holy. You're a saint. You're a
[time=1820] son. You're a daughter. I have chosen you. I love you. And so my friends, if you've been believing the lies of the enemy or listening to them, whoever them may be and naming you and calling
[time=1831] you all of these things, maybe it's even in the mirror that you call yourself. You are who God says you are and he loves you even through life's chaos and even through the cycles and the context
[time=1842] of our mess and our sinfulness in life. And Gideon's story reminds us of just that, that my problems
[time=1850] don't dictate my potential. My past doesn't dictate. God's promises we're not big enough or more
[time=1857] powerful enough to thwart the plans and the purpose and the call of God. Yet verse 13 comes and we're
[time=1864] a lot like Gideon. Verse 13, Gideon says, well, hey, and notice the angel says, Gideon, the Lord
[time=1870] is with, who's, what does it say? Verse 13? Look it up real quick. Remind me. I just want to get it right. The Lord is with you, right? You, the Lord is with you. And then Gideon says, well, hey, if the
[time=1882] Lord is with us, hmm, I don't think that's what the angel said. And it's like, well, that's just a minor difference. I don't think so. I don't think it's a minor difference at all because I think Gideon, God's wanting to give a special specific message to the heart of who Gideon was and yet
[time=1896] Gideon zooming out and looking at the big picture context of us and the nation of Israel and the chaos that has befallen their nation. But God says, I want to do something in you, Gideon and you,
[time=1909] Gideon, as we look at this, I'm so thankful that when we ask like Gideon then ask, what did he say next? He said, well, if God is with us, why has he allowed this to happen to us? Why are all these bad things happen? Why are bad things happen to good people? It's a fair question, isn't it? So the problem of evil is one that theologians and scholars have wrestled with. And the bottom line is you can get all scholarly about that. That's just real life. Can I get a name in? It's hard to understand why God would allow or even arrange things in life that would bring pain. And we know that God doesn't do any of that. He's not the author of those things, but sin has entered this crazy world of ours and it's torn up to shreds. But God in all his richness of grace and mercy
[time=1948] redeems even all of that to have a message for us. Here's what we learned from Gideon. Here's what we can learn about us that God, listen, God is more interested in changing you than changing your chaos.
[time=1959] God said, the angel of the Lord, a messenger, a representative of God said,
[time=1966] the Lord is with you, Gideon. He says, well, if the Lord is with us, then why are all these problems?
[time=1970] To which God is saying, no, I want to change you. I want to do something in you before I do something through you that will make changes around you. Because sometimes God needs to use the crisis
[time=1980] and the chaos to bring about our calling. But when we focus more on our situation than we do, our Savior, we lose sight of the goodness of God, the faithfulness of God, the call of God that we've
[time=1992] sung about and talked about today. But my brothers and sisters, listen to me when I tell you today that no amount of resistance can put you out of the reach of your God. He still comes after you.
[time=2003] He still calls you. He still wants to change you and do something in you. I don't care what happened.
[time=2007] I don't care what you did. God is big enough to redeem any sinful mess that we can create.
[time=2013] That's the beauty of Gideon's story and of ours. But then I love verse 14 because then it says, the Lord turned to Gideon or looked at Gideon. Some virgins will say looked at him. It's a good translation either way turned to him or looked at him. But there's this progression in the passage.
[time=2028] In verse 11, we see that the angel who's a messenger, a representative of the presence of God,
[time=2034] that the angel appeared or he came. The angel came in verse 11. He appeared in verse 12,
[time=2041] and then God turned and looked. God turned to Gideon in verse 14. So here's what that reminds us.
[time=2047] It means that God is with me even when I'm unaware of verse 11. The angel came. Gideon didn't know that God's presence was there. Gideon didn't know he's sitting under this big tree at the time, just kind of observing Gideon. Gideon doesn't realize that the presence of God, that the angel of the Lord had come near at this point. He didn't know that the presence of God was there. You ever been through a time where he felt like God was a million miles away and you couldn't sense his presence no matter how hard you tried. Verse 11, the angel came. That reminds us that God is with me
[time=2075] even when I'm unaware of his presence. Then the angel appeared. Gideon goes, oh, there's an angel there. The presence of the Lord is near. Then we realize God is with me even when I see him at work.
[time=2086] But then I love verse 14 because then God himself, it doesn't say the angel, God turned, turned.
[time=2092] God looked at Gideon. It reminds me that God sees me. When I realize these around, when I don't
[time=2100] realize these around, when life is chaotic, when life is calm, God sees me in every season of my life.
[time=2107] And my brothers and sisters, God sees you and he loves you, just like we see in this passage. Yet
[time=2114] we end up in verses 15 and 16 a lot like Gideon, don't we? Then he says, oh, but I'm so inadequate.
[time=2120] And basically what he says is that, but you got to understand, I'm the least of the sons of the least family of the least tribe in all of Israel. I'm the least of the least of the least of the
[time=2130] least God. I am so inadequate. How can I do with to which God responds and says, I will be with you.
[time=2137] I am the great I am. So listen, no matter your inadequacy, all you need to know is that the
[time=2143] great I am goes with you. No inadequacy can contend with the great I am. You ought to be
[time=2151] excited about that today. I'm excited about that. No inadequacy of mine. I always said I'd never be a pastor like my dad because I felt inadequate and I had proof I couldn't speak. They told me never
[time=2162] to do anything with public speaking in my aptitude tests in high school. And then God said, I want you to be a preacher that one thing you always said you would never do, but I'm an adequate.
[time=2170] I can't do that. God says, do you think I really need you to begin with? I'm the great I am.
[time=2175] And if this is true, everyone will personalize this for you as we tire time together. Here's a question for you. What is God's calling in the midst of my current chaos?
[time=2184] It's a great question for you to ask yourself this week. If no inadequacy of mine can contend
[time=2190] with the great I am, then what is it God? What is it that is your calling for me right now
[time=2197] in my current cycle context that's full of chaos? God's got a calling for you and I believe he's
[time=2204] ready to make it known and I believe you're ready to walk in it. Not because you're ready, not because you're an adequate, you're an adequate little old me, but God's ready to empower you
[time=2213] and equip you just like you did, Gideon. I want to ask you to bow your heads, ponder that question.
[time=2217] God, what is your calling for me in the midst of my current chaos? Believers, pray and ask God what is that calling that he has for you? And some of you are here today, though, and you would say, I know what God's calling me to us to a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ. I've realized that I sinned just like that cycle of the judges.
[time=2234] It's a cycle of me. I am inadequate to save myself. I need to repent and turn from me being the source
[time=2242] of salvation in my life, trusting in me or my good works or the faith of my parents or my grandparents or that I might maybe sort of kind of maybe be good enough one day to enter into heaven. No, none of us are good. We all sinned and fall short of the glory of God, but today God has called you in the midst of life's chaos to recognize your sin, to realize that Jesus paid at all. He was
[time=2263] your atoning, substitutionary sacrifice, a perfect sacrifice that paid the price for all of your
[time=2269] sin to build a bridge between you and the Father. When He rose from the dead, He conquered death hell and the grave. And you can trust in Him today for salvation and become a child of God.
[time=2279] Yes, inadequate you can even take that step. God can save any center who's just ready to turn to
[time=2285] Him. Will you do that right now? Maybe you need to pray something just like this from your heart to Him. Say, Lord Jesus, I need you to save me. I recognize that I fall so short through my sin.
[time=2295] I believe you are who you say you are. I believe you paid the price for my sin as my perfect sacrifice.
[time=2303] Jesus, I know you rose from the dead. I know you're alive. Thank you for winning that victory.
[time=2310] I turn to you. Will you forgive me? Will you save me? I give you all of me. All of the inadequate
[time=2317] me that I have are put it at your feet. I surrender to you as my boss and my Lord. In your own words, we crowd to Jesus as believers are praying. Will you not just reflect on what guys do? We respond
[time=2328] to it in this moment. Don't wait another second.
