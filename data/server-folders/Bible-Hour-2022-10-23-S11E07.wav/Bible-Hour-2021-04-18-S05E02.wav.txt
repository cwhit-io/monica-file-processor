[time=0] You ever feel like this as you shoot for the will of God?
[time=10] You ever feel like this when it comes to fighting the battles that is life?
[time=15] We're in a series called An Adequate Me, An Adequate Me.
[time=20] And I want to talk to you about God's will today.
[time=22] We're looking at the life of Gideon.
[time=24] If you brought your Bibles, you can go to Judges chapter 6.
[time=27] And as you ever feel inadequate, like this is kind of your life, spiritually speaking, today I want to talk to you about God's will through our weakness.
[time=35] God's will through our weakness.
[time=36] Last week we looked at the call of Gideon, and God's call through life's chaos.
[time=40] But today I want to teach a little bit from the life of Gideon, Judges chapter 6.
[time=44] We'll start in verse 17 in a few moments about God's will through our weakness.
[time=48] And maybe you, like this, feel like this is your life.
[time=51] As you shoot for the will of God, as you try to discern how He's leading you.
[time=54] And if God's will is kind of like a target, you know, maybe this is what it looks like for you.
[time=61] You're lining up, you ready?
[time=66] You ever been there?
[time=68] Man, there's times in my life where I feel like this is my weapon, this is my capacity, this is my adequacy, this is my ability to find and follow the will of God in my life.
[time=78] And Gideon certainly felt that way.
[time=80] And as we look at the will of God, if it's a target in life, I want to teach you about what the Bible says, first of all, some context for God's will.
[time=86] As I get asked a lot of times, pastor, how can I find what God's will is for my life?
[time=91] How can I find and follow God's plan for my life?
[time=94] And we're going to learn some lessons from Gideon of what not to do, but also some things that we can learn to do.
[time=99] But to start, let me give you some context about God's will in the Bible and in history and in life.
[time=104] It starts with the outer ring, and that outer ring is purpose.
[time=107] Theologically speaking, theologians will say things like this is the sovereign will of God, or this is the providential will of God.
[time=115] I call it the purpose of God.
[time=116] It's the outside circle that is the bullseye of getting to the personal will that we'll get to in just a moment, is that the will of God that is sovereign and providential, the purposes of God
[time=126] cannot be thwarted by humans.
[time=128] I'm glad of that, because if so, I probably would have done that many times by now.
[time=133] But God is in control.
[time=135] He is on the throne.
[time=136] Some of you came today, maybe just to hear that great word.
[time=139] He's still on the throne today.
[time=140] I think it's Jay Vernon McGee who once said it this way about the sovereign, the providential, the purpose of God, the will of God in this ring.
[time=147] He said that this is God's universe, and he does things his way.
[time=152] You may have a better way, but you don't have a universe.
[time=155] And I need to be reminded of that sometimes that I am not powerful enough to thwart or to
[time=162] ruin the purpose of God.
[time=164] And that's the outer ring that encloses the rest.
[time=166] The second one is the path of God.
[time=168] It's the next ring in as we target in on the bull's eye.
[time=171] And sometimes we miss the target over and over.
[time=174] The path of God is often called the moral will of God, theologically speaking.
[time=178] This is the word of God.
[time=181] The things that we know we are always called to, even when God's plan and God's will, it seems like it's a moving target sometimes.
[time=188] The purpose of God cannot be thwarted or changed.
[time=190] And the path of God stays the same.
[time=192] He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[time=194] We're always called to be humble.
[time=196] We're always called to put others first.
[time=198] We're always called to be generous.
[time=200] We're always called to display the love of God.
[time=202] No matter what God's plan has looked like in your life, where God has you planted today, the path of God is the ways of God that you walk in wherever you're planted.
[time=212] And it is enclosed and captured by the purposes of God.
[time=216] Now let's go to the plan of God, bull's eye.
[time=219] This is what many of us spend so much of our time trying to figure out.
[time=222] God, who do you want me to marry?
[time=224] How do you want me to spend my money?
[time=226] What house do you want me to buy?
[time=227] What career path should I go into?
[time=229] God, what are you calling me to do?
[time=231] Should I leave here and go there?
[time=232] Should I do this or do that?
[time=234] What does it look like for me to follow your will?
[time=236] We spend so much of our time here, but so many times we forget that all of that is wrapped up in the purpose and the path of God.
[time=244] As we shoot for that bull's eye, we've got to remember that God's purpose remains and we can trust it.
[time=249] That God's path is steady.
[time=251] And no matter where you're planted, you can walk in it as you wait on God to show you His plan specific, personal for your life.
[time=259] Gideon is a great picture of this because as we go through this, we realize that just like it is for getting it's the same for us, even like my arrow, when you end up outside of the will of God, you ever feel like you've just been like my arrow somewhere over there?
[time=271] Now you just miss the mark and you're so far off course.
[time=275] I don't know where you've landed today, but even when you're far off course, even when you're inadequate, even when you're the knucklehead that doesn't listen well and you get veered off to so many side dirt roads, when you're shooting for the bull's eye, you're never out of God's reach and Gideon is a picture of just that.
[time=293] As we see Gideon stepping into God's plan, we realize really quickly that God's purpose is that outer ring that's holding it all together and that Gideon, even though he's doing it so inadequately and so imperfectly that he's still choosing in his up and down
[time=309] crazy kind of manner with all of his doubts and weaknesses to walk the path of God as he seeks the plans that God has for his life and God's will comes about despite the doubts of Gideon, despite the weaknesses of Gideon and just like Gideon, I think I'm at my weakest when my doubts
[time=325] dominate. Your doubts ever dominated your life, sometimes your doubts will end up dominating your direction in life, your doubts will end up dominating your determination in life, they dominate your disposition in life, they dominate your drive in life, they dominate maybe your dreams in life and how well you shoot at that target and listen for what God is trying to teach you and what we've learned is that faith, listen, faith is not the disappearance of doubts, raise your hand if you doubt sometimes and now the rest of you raise your hand too because we all know the truth, we all have doubts. Gideon has doubts and listen, faith
[time=360] is not the disappearance of doubt, it's trusting God throughout the doubt, it's trusting God even
[time=366] though we have doubts and Gideon is a perfect picture of that for us, he's not adequate but God is adequate and God uses his doubts and his weaknesses even though I'm at my weakest when my doubts
[time=377] dominate, Gideon had so many doubts, we're going to look at them today that in all of those weaknesses and doubts God brought about his will even through those weaknesses and Gideon is in a process maybe
[time=388] like you of discovering God's will and doing God's will and so let's go into that story together,
[time=394] you ready for the word today? I want to give you four doubts that God overcame in Gideon's life, from Judges chapter 6, meet me there, Judges chapter number 6 and we're going to look at four doubts that Gideon had that maybe you can relate to, you ready for number one? Here it is, number one is God's concern, this is a doubt Gideon had, it comes from Judges chapter 6 verses 1 through 16, I won't read that because that was our passage from last week as we looked at God's call through life's chaos, so if you missed that go to blackhawk.fyi, you can look at God's call of Gideon but even through that we see he doubted God's concern for his people and maybe you've been there and the question, I'll give you a question with each of these doubts that maybe you asked sometimes, does God really care about me? Does he really care? And we looked at that last week, blackhawk.fyi,
[time=437] I gave you great context that's going to inform all of the rest of this series, so if you missed that check it out from last week but nonetheless here we are today, does God care about me?
[time=447] Judges chapter 6 verse 13, before we get to our passage today, tells us this, we see Gideon's doubt of God's concern, does he really care? And Gideon said to him, this is the angel of the Lord who came to represent the presence of God and call Gideon to be the deliverer of Israel from the hand and the oppression of the Midianites who were coming in and stealing their harvests for seven years, and he says, "Please sir, the Lord is with us, why then has all this happened to us,
[time=472] and where are all his wonderful deeds that our fathers recounted to us saying, did not the Lord
[time=479] bring us up from Egypt, but now the Lord has forsaken us and given us into the hand of Midian. He doubted God's concern, why is all these bad things got to happen? God, why are they happening if you really care about me? And if you missed last week, check it out, I gave you a lot of reasons why, but look at me for a minute, you need to know God deeply, fully cares about you.
[time=501] He has not given up on you, he's not given up on his concern for you, he loves you and and cares for you so much and is so concerned over your calling that he'll bring and cultivate
[time=513] the calling that he has for your life, even in the midst of and even built on the platforms of whatever the crisis is or whatever the chaos is that you face in your life. Can I get an amen?
[time=523] God's concern is number one, that's the first doubt that God overcame. The second one is this,
[time=530] God's credibility. Judges chapter 6, and this is where we'll pick up where we left off last week, verse 17, although through verse 24. And the question is, does God really know what he's doing?
[time=539] Is he really who he says he is? Does he really know what he's doing, choosing me? Get in, it's like, I'm already doubting God's choice of me as the deliverer of Israel. I'm doubting, does he really care enough to even deliver Israel anyway? Because by the way, where's he been these last seven years? Anyway, I doubt God's concern, I doubt God's choice of me to deliver. But now, I really doubt God's credibility. The angel is here supposedly, but it's really God.
[time=561] Do you ever struggle to discern your voice, God's voice, the devil's voice, his voice,
[time=568] and her voice? Sometimes the life is so full of voices that we don't know what's credible.
[time=574] We don't know what's really God, and that is exactly where Gideon finds himself.
[time=577] Judges chapter 6, we'll pick up in verse 17. You ready to dig in church? Verse 17.
[time=585] And he said to him, "If now I found favor in your eyes, then show me a sign that it is you
[time=591] who speak with me. Please do not depart from here until I come back to you and bring out my present
[time=597] and said it before you." And he said, "I will stay until you return." So Gideon went into his house and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes from an e-path of flour and meat, the meat he
[time=608] put in a basket and the broth he put in a pot. And he brought them out under the terrible, this is where the angel first met Gideon if you were with us last week, under that tree where he ran into the presence of God and presented them. Now verse 20, "And the angel of God said to him, 'Take the meat and the unleavened cakes and put them on this rock and pour broth over them, and he did so.'" And then the angel of the Lord reached out the tip of his staff that was in his
[time=633] hand and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes and fire sprang up from the rock and consumed
[time=640] the meat and the unleavened cakes. And the angel of the Lord vanished from his sight. Verse 22, "Then Gideon perceived that he was the angel of the Lord," I bet he did. "And Gideon said, 'Alas,
[time=651] O Lord God, for now I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face, but the Lord said to him,
[time=657] 'Peace be to you, don't fear, you shall not die.'" I'll explain that more in a moment. Verse 24,
[time=663] here's his response, "Then Gideon built an altar there to the Lord and called it the Lord his peace." To this day it still stands at Ophra, which belongs to the Abia's rights. Now let's talk about this passage because you see Gideon's question of the credibility of God. God, is it really you? Are you really intending to carry out this plan, the will of God that you have now
[time=683] given to me, this call that you've placed in my life? Can I really trust that you know what you're doing here? And we know that because of verse 17, he says, "Hey, show me a sign that is you who speak with me. Let me know it's really you." And then he gets the sign through the signs. And how
[time=698] many of you have insecurities in your life? Let's just clear that up real quick. Again, the rest of you raise your hands too because we all have them. And Gideon had plenty of them and it's what makes us oftentimes inadequate. But listen, the plans of God are not thwarted by our inadequacies, our
[time=712] insecurities. But here's what they do. Insecurities, as we see with Gideon, leads to inaction. Insecurity breeds inaction. It paralyzes you. It makes you stuck. You've ever been stuck as you had your bow
[time=723] trying to shoot for the will of God. And you just sat there, aim, aim, aim. Some of you been aiming for years. And it's time to let go. It's time to trust God that he is capable, that he is credible,
[time=735] that he is concerned. And that's where Gideon is at. But he wanted this sign. And so he goes and makes this present, this little offering of the food. And he puts it on the rock and does what the angel says. And okay, let's picture this. Fire from heaven came from the rock and burnt up the offering.
[time=752] And then the angel disappeared. I'd be pretty sold at that point, right? And so was Gideon, for the moment, but doubts kind of tend to creep in. And Gideon is again kind of consumed by fear because in Old Testament times, if you saw the face of God, you would die. No one can look on the face of God and live. And so he remembered that like, oh, this is the Lord. And I think
[time=773] I kind of just saw him. I'm probably going to die. He didn't say anything, but the Lord speaks to him and says, no, no, no. Peace be with you. I'm not going to kill you. I don't kill those that I've called. I've called you. I'm sending you. And here's peace. And Gideon responds by building
[time=789] an altar to the Lord there in that place that says the Lord is peace. And I came to remind some
[time=795] of you today as you question and you have doubts about the credibility of God, his voice, his leading, his guiding in your life, what he's allowed in your life, perhaps, that God is peace.
[time=804] He's ready to bring some peace into your life right now. And that leads us to number three.
[time=808] God's concern, God's credibility. God, do you really care about me? God, is it really you?
[time=815] Can you really do this? Now to capability. God, can you really protect me? If I go and do what you say, am I really going to be able to see your hand guided me? Are you really going to go with me?
[time=825] Are you really able to do all these things through a guy like me? Little old and adequate me? It's
[time=831] God's capability that Gideon now doubts and maybe you can relate. Verses 25 through 32.
[time=835] This is before we get into the big battle where he's going to go to battle with the minionites. God does something a little closer to home. Don't miss this. He does something a little closer to home for Gideon before he sends him out to these public battles and victories that he's going to send him to. Let's read verses 25 through 32. Here's what the Lord said to him.
[time=855] That night the Lord said to him, take your father's bull and the second bull, seven years old, and pull down the altar of Baal that your father has. Now you got to understand that Baal worship was the predominant false God and idol of this time. And his father's house was the primary shrine in this area for Baal. And there's two things there. There's the altar of Baal and there's this ashara that we'll read about just in a second. It's usually a plant or made of wood. A lot of times it was carved in sexualized images which would be very common in Canaanite gods and worship
[time=886] of gods like Baal. And it's a wood thing that would stand there beside this altar. And we'll talk more about the altar. So now that you know that. So cut down the altar, pull down the altar of Baal your father has. Cut down the ashara that is beside it. Now to verse 26. And here's what you should do. And build an altar to the Lord your God on top of the stronghold here with stones laid in due order. Then take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering with the wood of the ashara
[time=912] that you shall cut down. It's going to fuel the fire to make an offering to the Lord. Verse 27.
[time=918] So Gideon took 10 men of his servants and did as the Lord told him. That part's good. But because he was too afraid of his family and the men of the town to do it by day he did it by night. Verse 28.
[time=930] Then when the men of the town rose early in the morning behold the altar of Baal was broken down
[time=936] and the ashara beside it was cut down and the second bull was offered on the altar that had been built. Then they said to one another who has done this thing. And after they had searched and inquired they said Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing. Then the men of the town said to Joash
[time=952] bring out your son that he may die. For he has broken down the altar of Baal and cut down the ashara beside it. But Joash said to all who stood against him will you contend for Baal
[time=964] or will you save him? Whoever contends for him shall be put to death by morning. Surprising response.
[time=971] He says if he is a god let him contend for himself because his altar has been broken down. Therefore
[time=977] on that day Gideon was called Jerubel that is to say let Baal contend against him. Let Baal
[time=984] contend against him because he broke down his altar. Crazy part of the story let's unpack it
[time=991] together. It's really through this lens of Gideon questioning and doubting the capability of God.
[time=996] Are you really going to go with me through all of this? And God says well let's start a little closer to home so you can see my hand of protection and he starts Gideon out in this inner circle.
[time=1005] But in verses 25 and 26 you notice the offering that he was to give. He was to pull down this altar made to Baal. And by the way let me go and tell you about the altar. There was an altar by archeologists found in Megiddo and this altar of Baal was some 26 feet in length and four and a
[time=1023] half feet high and it was built from big large cemented stones with this big wood ashara beside
[time=1030] it. So it's not like a little statue that Gideon was called to go and kick over. He had to work
[time=1037] no telling how much through the night. That was the call of God and then he was to build an altar to God and sacrifice these bulls and the second of which was to be seven years old. Now if you're
[time=1047] familiar with biblical studies seven is oftentimes the number of completion in the Bible and that's a neat picture but the coolest picture to me in this is that the age of the bull the age of seven
[time=1058] just so happens just so happens coincidentally. There are no coincidences with God did you know
[time=1064] that it's no coincidence that the age of the bull seven is also the exact same number of years that Midian has been ravaging the Israelites. And so here was the time where God is saying that
[time=1076] stops today. That seven year period comes to an end now it comes to an end for the poor seven years
[time=1082] for the bull but it also comes to an end of this attack this ravaging this pillaging of the Midian
[time=1089] ites in the nation of Israel in verses 26, 25 and 26 there we see that picture and Gideon obeyed
[time=1096] verse 27 by night. You think well God told him at night he did it at night quick obedience is a good
[time=1102] thing. Yeah it is and again you see Gideon following the path of God although so imperfectly because
[time=1108] he did it at night right when God said it no time like the present that's good but then verse 27 reminds us well he did it though because he was afraid of his own family and he was afraid of the men and the people of the town that they would do what they actually end up trying to do which is kill him for doing what he had done but he's doing this at home and here's the thing before God would bring about this external public victory over Midian. God would first bring about a victory
[time=1134] over some internal private doubt that Gideon had in his life some internal inside his home
[time=1140] right close to home in his circle some things that were going on there and Gideon's calling in his ministry would start there at home would start there in his heart before it would be expanded
[time=1150] to the battlefield that God had called him to. God starts from the inside and works out you can
[time=1158] say it this way that it's a prerequisite this private obedience that's the stuff we do in our heart we allow God to get rid of and do inside of us. God does something in me before he does something through me. Private obedience is a prerequisite for a public opportunity. Before God
[time=1173] does something through you around you and in the calling and purpose and plan that he has for your
[time=1179] life he's going to want to ask you to walk the path and walk in his ways in some private ways when nobody's looking before the lights are on before the mic gets put in your face before you get to actually perform all of the great things God has called you to he's going to want you to display some private behind the scenes at home integrity when nobody is looking and that's where
[time=1199] he starts with Gideon because revival starts on the inside. It's kind of like David you know we remember David because he fought okay just checking to make sure you're awake everybody shake it out
[time=1211] and it's all right you can talk you can get it wrong there's grace here. David fought Goliath there's not a trick question but before he fought Goliath as you know what he did his brothers were in the battlefield and he wanted to be in the battlefield he was a runt at home a shepherd who was staying at home and his father sent him with a basket full of food for his brothers who were
[time=1229] in the battlefield where David would end up and call out and get called out by Goliath and slay him with just this little smooth stone and a slingshot but before he fought Goliath he had to
[time=1240] carry the basket he had to let God do some private little non-big non-explained obedient things inside
[time=1247] of him and threw him in a small circle before his circle would get expanded in the same way Gideon would have to tear down some idols at home before he could tear down the enemies in the battle
[time=1259] field. The same thing happens in our life it's pretty difficult to start at home if you ever notice that when the mission field God calls you to is real personal or God calls you to you know
[time=1269] like it's one thing to go to people you don't know that's hard enough you got people going on mission trips and you go to people you know you're gonna leave and you're not gonna know them but when God calls you to your house or even more difficult when God calls you to your heart to do something in you or in the lives of those you're closest to that know you the most those can be the most difficult assignments and that's exactly what God calls Gideon into before he sends him to
[time=1291] the battlefield and usually I give you an application question at the end of the sermon I want to give it to you now here it is what family idol or personal idol has God called you to tear down
[time=1301] Gideon went to his father's house and tore down something that took his father years to build
[time=1307] but he had to go tear it down before God would do the great things through him and around him so
[time=1314] what is it in your life maybe men it's an addiction to pornography that's become an idol in your life maybe ladies it's your kids I'm not suggesting you go cut your kids down by the way I am suggesting
[time=1326] though that if you've allowed anything like an addiction like kids or sports even to become an
[time=1332] idol in your life things that are good things I think it's Tim Keller that once said that idols are simply good things that become ultimate things sports and kids and all these things they're good
[time=1343] or maybe it's your career maybe it's your bank account or maybe a success I don't know what it is for you but there are personal idols and probably there are idols even in your home that God is calling you to tear down today these are anything that supplants the king of kings
[time=1358] and the lord of lords to whom the throne of your life always belongs maybe you've pushed him aside
[time=1364] and you've put something else there that's the call that was on Gideon's life that was the will of God through the weakness of Gideon but that's also what God calls us to do as well so what family idols or personally idols has God called you to tear down it won't be easy but it's so important
[time=1381] and when you do be warned when you tear down idols there'll be friction there'll be problems
[time=1387] there'll be people upset with you just like it was with Gideon they wanted to kill him after that and his father had to respond and ended up with a strange response you know it shows maybe a progression of God working in his life to come back to the true God the true and living God we don't know we don't learn much about joe ash here but he says instead of yeah get him go kill him he deserves it he said well if bales a god then let him contend for himself the new kevin version my paraphrase is well if bales such a big boy let him handle his own business and then what we learn from that is that idols the same's true in our life just like it was with
[time=1423] bale idols have a pedestal but they don't have any power they have eyes but they really can't see
[time=1430] they have arms but they really can't reach only the king of kings and the lord of lords the true king of the universe can do those things with that kind of power but maybe you've been giving the throne to a powerless idol in your life and so Gideon back to his story they're trying to kill
[time=1447] him now they're after him but let's let bale contend for himself because he is a god and here's what's going to happen you want to destroy and get defeat the the insecurity and inadequacy in your life it's going to start with demolishing idols demolishing idols is the beginning of defeating insecurity it's the beginning of defeating inadequacy and that is where Gideon finds himself why because don't miss this when you are secure and your identity comes from christ and christ
[time=1472] alone then doubts start to dissipate so let us be secure in christ and christ alone
[time=1480] Gideon's name verse 32 has changed a few times we started as Gideon and then in the first 16
[time=1486] verses he goes from Gideon to mighty man of valor or mighty warrior like that guy are you sure but
[time=1492] his name changed his identity is shifting and it's overcoming these insecurities and inadequacies that he lives with but as we watch this progression his name changes again in verse 32 they call him
[time=1503] jerry bale jerry bale everybody say jerry bale that's his third name the meaning of that
[time=1509] literally is just let bale contend or let him contend against him and so you think well okay well that could make that was kind of meant for good right well i don't know maybe for some but for most of them it was probably sarcastic facetious like bale's gonna get this guy because bale is
[time=1524] powerful and bale's gonna bale's gonna contend against him he's gonna tear him down just like he tore down the altar the idol that is bale and so don't miss this oh it's so powerful this is
[time=1535] what my god does when we doubt his capability he reminds us just how powerful and capable he is
[time=1541] because he uses this little nobody who goes from Gideon to mighty man of valor this mighty warrior now to jerry bale which was meant to harm him because they thought bale would harm him and they gave him a name that would probably shame him for the rest of his life but not only did bale not show up and do anything because he is powerless against the god whose hand was on Gideon to begin with but god redeemed what was meant for evil in this renaming of Gideon i
[time=1568] don't know whose named you stuff in your life i don't know what you call yourself when you look in the mornings in the mirror in the mornings but god redeems what was meant for evil against Gideon
[time=1577] and now uses it for his good and for his glory because Gideon literally physically becomes a
[time=1583] walking billboard with this new name of the fact that idols are inadequate but my god is capable
[time=1590] and god will take whatever it is that has been holding you back and causing you to doubt and
[time=1596] paralyzing you in your insecurity and he'll redeem it for his glory and for his good and he'll bring
[time=1602] good in and through your life not that you're always going to be blessed you'll have to tear down idols people may want to kill you but god will be with you and if god goes with us what can stand against
[time=1614] and that's what Gideon is learning about as he doubts god's capability in his life and for you let's make that personal how many of you are not where you want to be just yet still pretty
[time=1626] inadequate right not where you want to be i want you to think about where you used to be for just a minute can you remember that you're not where you want to be no that's okay but you're not where you
[time=1638] used to be you remember that old you right god has done great things in your life and my friends
[time=1644] he's just getting started he's not done with you hasn't given up on you the chapter six has to happen in judges so the chapter seven the victories on the battlefield can begin and he's doing the same thing in your life even through your doubts god's concern god's credibility god's capability
[time=1661] but now lastly god's character like you would think all right now we go to the battlefield right well not quite because you know you know so number four is god's character judges chapter six versus
[time=1671] 33 through 40 will read through the end of the chapter the question that's being asked here really is can god really be trusted can i really trust god you know the fire from the rock and the angel
[time=1681] and all not quite enough yet but here's where we pick up our story so let's go there together
[time=1687] because the enemy was big but god's plan for getting was even bigger and we see how big the enemy is as we pick up in verse 33 says this now all the Midianites and the Amalekites they're
[time=1696] coming to plunder again so the eighth time at this point after seven years here and the people of these came together and they crossed the Jordan and camped in the valley of jesaro but the spirit of the lord clothed Gideon he sounded the trumpet and the as abia's rights were called out to follow him
[time=1712] and he sent messengers throughout almanasa and they too were called out to follow him and he sent messengers to asher and zebulan and neftali and they went up to meet him verse 36 light so then
[time=1723] they fought and the battle was over well verse 36 then Gideon said to god if you will save israel
[time=1730] by my hand as you said can i trust you god behold i'm laying a fleece of wool on the threshing floor
[time=1738] by the way quick pause we went from a wine press to a threshing floor did you notice that he started in the wine press in the beginning at least he's at the threshing floor now god brought him not to where he's going to be but far from where he used to be little side note no extra charge you're welcome and then he says i'm going to lay this fleece of wool on the threshing floor and if
[time=1756] do is on the fleece alone and it's dry on all the ground then i shall know that you will save israel by my hand as you have said and it was so and when he rose early the next morning and squeezed the fleece he wrung enough do from the fleece to fill a bowl with water then Gideon said to god let not
[time=1772] your anger burn against me let me speak just once more doubt much please let me test just once
[time=1780] more with the fleece please let it be dry on the fleece only and on the ground let there be due the opposite and god struck him down in anger and said i'm through i'm patient with you and i'm done with
[time=1791] you know it's not what verse 40 says let's read verse 40 which says and god did so that night
[time=1798] and it was dry on the fleece only and on all the ground that was due just so happened to have a
[time=1804] fleece this was gifted to me it's literal sheep's wool and it was gifted to me by a dear friend from
[time=1811] Georgia uh steve thank you for this this is a prayer mat it's what it is but it's actually sheep's wool and so people talk about well what was the fleece he allowed it's probably sheep's wool we don't know but he laid it out and he said all right so make it wet and everything else dry
[time=1825] and then he wrung it out well okay that worked well let's make it dry and everything else wet and he just kept on with these doubts of can god really be trusted and don't we do the same thing with fleeces and by the way you should know this fleece he's not trying to discern what is the
[time=1839] will of god because that was already declared he's not trying to discover what god's will is god
[time=1845] already told him what his will is he's really doing this to say god i'm going to test you because i don't know if i can trust you and we do the same thing in our life don't we uh we'll go this is a modern day fleece we'll do things like this like god i really want to ask that girl out or god i really want to buy this house or really want to do this big expense and i think my dad and
[time=1863] i don't know maybe charles stanley where we got this from but this is an illustration that we've talked about for a long time and so we'll do things like this like all right god i want to do this thing and i've got this ball and i'm going to throw this ball up in the air and if it comes down
[time=1879] then i know you want me to buy that thing whoo we're set don't we and you say well that's just
[time=1885] silly pastor but i say is it because sometimes in our doubt we get paralyzed in the same way but
[time=1891] god every time pauses god every time says i'm going to walk with you anyway the enemy was big
[time=1897] god was doing something bigger and Gideon and he was patient with Gideon and i'll take you back to all of those rings his purpose was still true his path was still solid and his plan even though Gideon was struggling to find it he laid this fleece out and so here's what i want to challenge you to do when it comes to the fleeces of doubt in your life i want to challenge you to turn the fleece of doubt whatever it is in your life to a kneeling place of dependence maybe all those doubts you keep bringing to the table it's okay god's not afraid of him he's bigger
[time=1927] than him he already knew you had him anyway but maybe the fleeces of doubt in your life god's ready to turn them into a kneeling place a prayer mat for dependence doubts can become
[time=1938] dependence when we just hit our knees and some of you back to the bow and arrow let's grab our bow
[time=1944] here it is yeah this has been you you're just shooting you're tired of shooting and missing and you're outside of the will of god maybe god is ready to take the bow that you are shooting with
[time=1956] the effort you keep pouring into following god's will and say turn this b-o-w this bow
[time=1962] turn it into a bow b-o-w bow on your knees turn your bow to a bow stop trying so hard start resting
[time=1973] in the fact that my purpose is something you can trust my path stays the same and i know you're
[time=1979] struggling with what my plan is for you but rest and have peace in who i am because i love you
[time=1986] and i'm for you and when i am for you nothing can stand against you so rest and that drop the bow
[time=1993] bow to your knees turn this fleece of doubt into a kneeling place a prayer mat of dependence i don't know where you're at in your life today but i'll take you back to our rings for just a moment you're looking for the unknown will of god in your life i want to challenge you to start with the known will of god you know his purpose is true you know he's the king of the universe you know his path stays the same you don't know what it's going to look like but listen if you trust god's purpose and wherever you're planted you walk in god's path doing things his way he will lead you
[time=2024] in his plan and his time and it may not look like what you want it to but do the known will of god
[time=2030] if you want to find the unknown will of god if you want to discover god's will for your life for tomorrow do god's will today start where you are let god use you where you are and what you're
[time=2042] going to find is when you bow you can rest psalm chapter 37 tells us this verse 23 and 24
[time=2050] the lord directs the steps of the godly walk in his path he'll show you his plan he delights in every detail of their lives though they stumble like get in and like you and me
[time=2060] they will never fall for the lord holds them by the hand ask you just to bow your heads for a moment
[time=2066] and just process this we're going to spend a few moments in communion in just a few moments or we just remember the faithfulness of god but before we do today I want to give you an
[time=2077] opportunity just to pause to bow drop your bow and trust god believers maybe it's time for you just
[time=2085] to bend your knee make this a symbolic bowing of your knee in this place and ask god how you can
[time=2091] trust and follow in his path his plan for your life just like get in even through your inadequacies
[time=2097] may we tear down idols so that we can follow after the identity god's called us too but some of you today would say i just need to trust jesus is my lord and savior i need to hit my knees and acknowledge that i've sinned and fall short of the glory of god but jesus was my perfect sacrifice he paid it all and because he lives because he rose from the dead i can take part in his victory
[time=2117] even though i am full of death and defeat i'm inadequate he paid the price i don't know where
[time=2123] you're at right now but if you trust in jesus for salvation ask him to forgive you ask him to save you you shall be saved anyone who calls on the name of the lord shall be saved it's a promise from god and he is trustworthy i don't know what your doubts have been
[time=2137] about god's concern or his credibility or capability or his character his trustworthiness in your life but you can trust our savior there's an old song that said if you want to trace his hand
[time=2148] trust his heart trust the heart of god today for salvation wherever you're at take a moment cry out to him let him know that today is the day of your salvation because you're trusting him and then nothing else to save you and he'll meet you right where you are pause and reflect and respond to god in this moment
