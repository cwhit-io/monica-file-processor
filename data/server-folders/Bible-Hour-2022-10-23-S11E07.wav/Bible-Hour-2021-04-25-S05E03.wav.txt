[time=0] He used to be our worship pastor, so we would share the stage about 10 years ago.
[time=6] Corbin has not changed in 10 years.
[time=10] Some of us have changed, but I was just so grateful to see him again at the microphone
[time=16] here this morning, and I wanted to make sure.
[time=18] Can we thank the band again for leading us to worship this morning?
[time=21] So ready to hear from God's word today.
[time=24] We're in Judges chapter 7, which comes after Judges 6, where Kevin's been with us the last couple of weeks.
[time=29] Would you turn there with me, please, to Judges chapter 7?
[time=33] I must tell you that Kevin has given me the fun part of the story of Gideon.
[time=43] Chapter 6, not so fun, I mean, there's some fun in there.
[time=47] Chapter 8 next week, just spoiler alert, there's a lot going on there.
[time=51] So for a couple weeks now, we get in chapter 8, just prepare yourself.
[time=55] It's not the story of Gideon is unfortunately not going up and to the right.
[time=61] That's unfortunate.
[time=62] But it's a real story, and so that's the way it goes sometimes.
[time=66] Judges chapter 7 is where we'll be today.
[time=70] We'll get to the first half of Judges 7 this morning and the second half next week.
[time=75] 15 years ago, a film came out called 300.
[time=81] It is a graphically violent, cartoonishly violent film.
[time=84] It's retelling the story of the Battle of Thermopylae from 480 B.C.
[time=89] 300 Spartan warriors stand against an invading Persian army, maybe 100 times their numbers.
[time=96] The Spartans stand the tide of Persian invasion due to their courage and their skill and their battle under the leadership of courageous King Leonidas.
[time=106] The Spartans have long been famous for their military prowess and are a favorite mascot
[time=112] of athletic teams around the country, Homestead, Spartans, Michigan State, Spartans, for example,
[time=118] many, many others.
[time=119] The story of Gideon that we're entering into next week's is a very different story.
[time=127] The actors in the movie 300 trained for months of time, eight hours a day, to get these extraordinarily
[time=134] muscular physiques.
[time=136] That's not what Gideon is like.
[time=138] There's no six hours a day for 12 weeks for Gideon.
[time=141] This series is called inadequate me.
[time=144] The story of Spartans, Michigan State has on all of their go blue, Michigan State has
[time=150] on all of their marketing, Spartans will, Spartans will, that's their motto.
[time=160] And they did.
[time=161] The Spartans kind of did.
[time=162] They did remarkable things against all odds.
[time=164] But God isn't looking for Spartans, respectfully.
[time=169] He's looking for simple, imperfect obedience empowered by his grace.
[time=173] Can I repeat that to you this morning?
[time=176] The only similarity in this story is the number of soldiers involved.
[time=180] The only similarity, 300, 300, we'll get there eventually.
[time=184] God's not looking for Spartans, muscular, courageous, powerful, let's go get him, you
[time=193] know.
[time=194] God's looking for simple, indeed, imperfect obedience.
[time=198] All we had about Gideon was chapter six.
[time=200] Chapter six of Gideon's like, he's all over the place.
[time=204] God says, go.
[time=205] And Gideon's like, really?
[time=206] Are you sure?
[time=207] Is this a wrong number?
[time=208] You know, a new phone.
[time=209] God, who's this?
[time=210] That's what Gideon kind of does with God.
[time=213] Spartans will, but Gideon can't.
[time=215] He literally just can't over and over again.
[time=218] He cannot get out of his way.
[time=220] The overwhelming takeaway from the story of Gideon is Gideon's inadequacy and God's complete
[time=230] and utter adequacy, sufficiency, faithfulness in all of these things.
[time=235] I cannot wait to walk you through the first half of chapter seven this morning.
[time=240] Let's read the story.
[time=241] We're going to read through verse 12 today and then we'll go back and talk about some different elements of the story that I think will be very helpful.
[time=248] God's triumph through our trust in case you don't know me.
[time=251] I have met people the last couple of weeks who have told me something very sad.
[time=255] They said, hey, I'm Steve.
[time=257] I don't think we've met.
[time=258] I've been here for two years.
[time=260] I'm very sad about that and I feel very inadequate to be sure.
[time=264] I'm grateful that you're here and grateful that you're watching online.
[time=268] My name is Steve Webster.
[time=269] I'm not Kevin Rivers.
[time=270] I've been here for a long, long time.
[time=272] My daughter's going to graduate from high school in a few weeks.
[time=275] We got here 18 years ago to the school and I serve at the school in the morning and church in the afternoon.
[time=280] So I'm very, very grateful to serve as your care and adult ministry's pastor, help out in the Bible department at the school day by day.
[time=286] So just quick introductions.
[time=288] That's who I am.
[time=289] Can we pray before we open God's word together this morning?
[time=291] Let's pray together.
[time=293] Father, I feel very ready to hear from you and your word this morning, having sung over
[time=302] and over again, you're greater, greater than anything in front of me.
[time=308] God, I know that people in this room, I know it, are facing very difficult things.
[time=314] I know that the people that are watching, wherever they are watching, however they are watching are facing difficult things.
[time=321] And I know also, God, that you are greater than anything that we are facing.
[time=328] And so I pray that that truth would sing out to us in some way here in the first 12 verses
[time=334] of Judges 7.
[time=335] God, would you give us eyes to see and ears to hear what you want us to see and what you want us to hear today.
[time=339] I pray all of those things in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=344] Judges 7, then Jerabel, that is Gideon, and all the people who were with him rose early
[time=351] and encamped beside the spring of Herod.
[time=354] Herod is a Hebrew word that means trembling, so it's the scaredy cat spring.
[time=361] We'll come back to that later.
[time=363] Verse 1, "The camp of Midian was north of them by the hill of Moray in the valley."
[time=369] Verse 2, "The Lord said to Gideon, 'The people with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel boast over me saying, 'My own hand has saved me.'"
[time=383] Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, "Whoever is fearful and trembling,
[time=389] let him return home and hurry away from Mount Gilead." Then 22,000 of the people returned, 10,000 remained.
[time=399] Verse 4, "The Lord said to Gideon, 'The people are still too many.
[time=403] Take them down to the water, and I will test them for you there, and any one of whom I say to you, this one shall go with you, shall go with you, any one of whom I say to you,
[time=413] this one shall not go with you, shall not go.'" So he brought the people down to the water, and the Lord said to Gideon, "Everyone who
[time=422] lapsed the water with his tongue like a dog-laps, he shall set by himself, likewise everyone who kneels down to drink." The number of those who laughed, verse 6, putting their hands to their mouths, was 300 men, but all the rest of the people knelt down to drink water, and the Lord said to Gideon,
[time=441] "With the 300 men who lapped, I will save you, I will save you, and give the manyites into your hand, and let all the others go every man to his homes, the people took provisions
[time=452] in their hands." Verse 8, "And their trumpets, they sent all the rest of Israel every man to his tent, but retained the 300 men, and the camp of Gideon was below him in the valley."
[time=463] That same night, the Lord said to him, "Arise, go down against the camp, for I've given
[time=469] it into your hand, but if you are afraid to go down, go down to the camp with purer, your servant, and you shall hear what they say, and afterward your hands shall be strengthened
[time=480] to go down against the camp." Then he went down with purer, his servant, to the outpost of the armed men who were in the camp, and many knights, and the Amalekites, and all the people of the east lay along the valley like locusts in abundance, and their camels were without number as the sand on
[time=497] the seashore is in abundance.
[time=500] Let's go back to verse 1 real quick.
[time=502] It's quite a story.
[time=503] The first part of the story, we'll come back to it next week, back to verse 1.
[time=507] Of course, Jerabel means something like, "We'll let Baal deal with it," because of course last chapter in Dead to Six, Gideon tears down the statue of Baal at his dad's house at great personal cost to himself, but he does it, and his dad's like, "Hey, listen, if Baal's going to be upset, let Baal deal with it.
[time=523] If Baal's really Baal, then that's fine." But the prophets of Elijah, so prophets of Baal with Elijah, Elijah's like, "Hey, so if Baal's real, then maybe he's sleeping," because of course he prays that there be
[time=536] the sacrifice, and it's wet, and it's dry, and Baal never shows up.
[time=541] So Gideon says, "Same thing, let Baal deal with it." All the people who are with him takes us back to chapter 6 in verse 1, and Gideon's messengers to his own tribe and the other northern tribes.
[time=553] The spring of Herod is a national park in Israel, it's a real place.
[time=558] It's on Google Maps, I looked it up, as Gideon's spring, it's a real place.
[time=564] Some of my former students are in the room, so my curtain students may be in the room are watching, and this is not Narnia, or Middle Earth, or a galaxy far, far away.
[time=575] It's a real place, and you can look it up on Google Maps, and I think it's important for us all to just anchor that, friends, that Gideon is a real person, he lives in a real place, and he has real problems, just like you and I.
[time=587] Again, Herod is very close to the Hebrew word for trembling, so scaredy cat people go to
[time=593] scaredy cat spring, or something like that, in verse 3.
[time=597] In verse 2, 32,000 people respond to Gideon's message.
[time=603] It appears that Gideon's message found an overwhelming response, and God tells him it was in fact too great a response.
[time=611] Israel is not in a good place spiritually, the book of Judges, if you're keep reading in the book of Judges, it is very, very, very bleak.
[time=621] The last verse of Judges says, "In those days, there was no king in Israel, everyone
[time=627] did what was right in his own eyes." That's the narrator of Judges' assessment of what's going on in Israel during that point.
[time=635] God knows that self-sufficiency is a real possibility and a real danger.
[time=642] My own hand, verse 2 says, "Lest Israel boast over me, saying, 'My own hand has saved
[time=652] me.
[time=653] I did this.
[time=656] God is going to work really, really hard to completely destroy any possibility of that being the case.'" That's why he does what he does in chapter 7.
[time=666] It sounds very familiar to people living in the West.
[time=671] I did this.
[time=672] I worked hard.
[time=673] I deserve this.
[time=675] I deserve whatever I have in front of me.
[time=678] I worked hard, those people didn't, so I deserve it.
[time=682] The events we're reading about in life of Gideon probably take place about 1,100 years before Christ is born.
[time=690] This millennia across the world, the danger of faithlessness and the myth of our own adequacy, it's always before us, friends.
[time=699] And so I love that this study is framed as inadequate me.
[time=702] I can't do it.
[time=704] We're not Spartans.
[time=707] Verse 3, "Here in verse 3, the Lord begins to remove all ground for boasting," again, back to verse 3, "all these people show up in the hearing of the people." God tells Gideon, God tells Gideon, just come back that for a minute, "to go before all those who have answered his call and to let them off the hook," whoever's fearful and trembling sounds an awful lot like Gideon last chapter and as you're going to find out this chapter as well, "Whoever's scared you can go, the law provides for people who are scared they can leave and not fight the battle because that fear could be infectious." 70% of those who responded turn around went home.
[time=743] If you're scared, oh, thank you, they're gone.
[time=745] It's like that.
[time=747] This is, again, Israel at the time.
[time=749] They're not in a good place.
[time=750] These are not, again, people ready to go muscular warriors, it's not what's going on.
[time=756] The people of the village of Gideon's own village, a few verses ago, wanted to kill him
[time=762] for tearing down an altar to bail.
[time=765] So things are not, again, going, well, please note this, if you would somewhere have your taking notes, the phrase the Lord said to Gideon, quote, "occurs five times in some
[time=777] form in these 12 verses." The Lord said to Gideon five times in 12 verses.
[time=784] God has never spoken to me in an audible voice.
[time=788] I was 19 years old at a chapel service at Ticcoa Falls College in Ticcoa, Georgia and
[time=794] I heard an invitation to salvation.
[time=797] Do you know where you had spent eternity if you died today?
[time=799] I had a Christian upbringing, I had a Christian family, and I had no answer to that question.
[time=804] I had no righteousness of my own, and God saved me that day, and I had assurance of salvation imperfectly to be sure.
[time=811] God's never spoken to me in the last 30 years, that's how long ago it was now, 30 years in
[time=817] an audible voice, never once.
[time=820] But God is speaking to you, would you please hear me, friends?
[time=824] When we read God's word, God is speaking to you in his word.
[time=830] That's why it's called God's word.
[time=833] And so if God speaks to you in an audible voice, he never has to me.
[time=837] You don't have to worry.
[time=838] I just wish God would say something to me.
[time=840] He is right now in his word.
[time=843] God's people, God's word, God's spirit speak to us every day if we are listening.
[time=851] If we are in a posture of listening to receive things from him, all of those things, all of those ways that God speaks to us are available to us all the time.
[time=861] And we may choose to listen or not.
[time=864] In your notes, there's three points for today.
[time=867] And number one point in your notes, friends, is just that, that God speaks.
[time=873] God speaks.
[time=874] God wants you to know what he wants you to do, the Lord said to Gideon, the Lord said
[time=881] to Gideon, the Lord said to Gideon, the Lord said to Gideon, the Lord said to him, over and over and over again.
[time=887] You don't have to wonder what God wants you to do.
[time=889] He has spoken to you in his word.
[time=890] The Bible is not a pamphlet.
[time=891] Look how big this is.
[time=894] I've got a lot of notes in here and stuff.
[time=895] It's a beefy Bible, to be sure.
[time=899] But there's some other things in there.
[time=903] There's a lot in there.
[time=904] I'm not sure if you've, when the last time you just read through the Bible, if you can't get through it in a weekend, it needs time.
[time=911] So God has a lot to say to us about a lot of things, and we can spend time being shaped
[time=917] hearing from him in very real ways.
[time=921] Verse four, verse four, there's still too many.
[time=926] God remains the hero and the prime mover of the story of Gideon throughout.
[time=933] God will test the remaining 10,000, and he gave you the way he'll do that there.
[time=938] And then God will tell Gideon, God will test, God will tell, God will speak, God throughout.
[time=944] God will tell Gideon who will go with him and who will not.
[time=947] Verse five, this is the first time that Gideon obeys without questioning or requiring further
[time=955] clarification.
[time=956] Maybe there's some growth in his life, I don't know.
[time=960] If nothing else, he seems to be beginning to trust the Lord in all this, which is good.
[time=964] God sets the terms for who will go and who will not go.
[time=969] Have you ever heard someone talk about this story about, because there's different kind of the guys that stoop down and drink this way, or guys that go like this, and he picks the guys that go like this, because they're ready to fight, you know, they're kind of looking around, you know.
[time=981] Everything, literally everything else in this story goes the other direction.
[time=985] The test isn't about who's worthy and ready to fight and, you know, has this kind of awareness.
[time=991] The whole thing is about God's removing any chance of boasting.
[time=996] So it's an arbitrary test.
[time=998] Who's going to go?
[time=1000] I'm going to choose the least amount of people possible.
[time=1004] The test God proposes is not about worthiness.
[time=1006] Every detail of the story again works against that.
[time=1009] The test is arbitrary.
[time=1010] To whittle it down to the least amount of people that's possible, it's not about separating the doggish people from the rest.
[time=1017] You know, I want these guys.
[time=1018] I want Spartans to go fight.
[time=1020] That's not what it's about.
[time=1022] So 97% of the men gone.
[time=1026] Just like that.
[time=1027] I'm sure Gideon's feeling great about this.
[time=1029] Like I'm just so, I'm Gideon's like, thank you, thank you Lord, for all the things you've done to get me ready for this.
[time=1034] There remain 300 men to go out with Gideon against maybe 100,000 mini-nights.
[time=1039] Those are not very good odds.
[time=1042] God speaks to Gideon in verse seven now.
[time=1044] For the fourth time in seven verses, the Lord, there it is again, the Lord said to Gideon, with the 300 men who lapped, he says, I will save you.
[time=1056] The second point of your notes friends is that God saves.
[time=1061] God saves.
[time=1062] This story, the Bible is about the prime moving of God.
[time=1065] He is the one who moves first from beginning to end, God speaks and God saves.
[time=1072] And I would just want to encourage you with this, that our obedience will always be met
[time=1079] with God's resources.
[time=1081] Our obedience, imperfect to be sure, maybe even half-hearted sometimes, will always be
[time=1088] met with God's perfect and complete resources.
[time=1092] Not only does God want you to know what He wants you to do, God's going to empower you to do what He wants you to do.
[time=1098] And Gideon's story is great evidence of that.
[time=1102] God will save Gideon and Israel from the mini-nights with an impossibly small group.
[time=1109] That's the point.
[time=1111] In Exodus 14, people of Israel have left Egypt and they're on the shore of the Red Sea.
[time=1117] And they are like, Moses, what have you done here?
[time=1120] I would rather have died back there than die here.
[time=1124] What do you think you're doing, Moses?
[time=1125] You must have lost it.
[time=1126] They say this, "Leave us long that we may serve the Egyptians for it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness." And this is what Moses says in verse 13 of Exodus 14, "Fear not, stand firm, and see
[time=1142] the salvation of the Lord, which He will work for you today.
[time=1147] The Egyptians whom you see today, you shall never see again.
[time=1151] The Lord will fight for you, and you have only to be silent."
[time=1158] Being silent literally requires nothing.
[time=1161] And so the story goes there before the Red Sea and the sea parts and they walk through
[time=1168] as it was dry land.
[time=1170] See the salvation of the Lord.
[time=1173] The Lord will fight for you.
[time=1176] The Lord saves.
[time=1178] Some year later in Jonathan, the son of the first king of Israel, Saul, this is first Samuel 14.
[time=1184] This is a remarkable story.
[time=1185] I wanted to read it with you because it illustrates this truth remarkably well.
[time=1191] One day Jonathan said to his armor bearer, "Come on, let's go over to where the Philistines have their outpost, but Jonathan didn't tell his father what he was doing." Meanwhile, Saul and his 600 men were camped on the outskirts of Gibia around the pomegranate tree at Migron, very specific, around one tree, it's a remarkable how specific it is.
[time=1209] This is first Samuel 14 and verse 3.
[time=1212] Among Saul's men was a hygien of the priest wearing the Ephod, the priestly vest.
[time=1216] The hygien was son of Ichabod's brother, another people, verse 3.
[time=1221] No one realized that Jonathan had left the Israelite camp.
[time=1223] To reach the Philistines outpost, Jonathan had to go down between two rocky cliffs that were called Boses and Sanne, very specific.
[time=1231] The cliff on the north, this is verse 5, was in front of Mikmash and the one on the south was in front of Giba.
[time=1236] Let's go across to the outpost of those pagans Jonathan said to his armor bearer.
[time=1241] Please listen.
[time=1242] Perhaps the Lord will help us, for nothing can hinder the Lord.
[time=1247] He can win a battle whether he has many warriors or only a few.
[time=1254] Worth repeating.
[time=1256] Nothing can hinder the Lord.
[time=1258] He can win a battle whether he has many warriors or only a few.
[time=1266] Someone needs to hear that this morning.
[time=1268] This is what, this is who God is and what he does.
[time=1271] Perhaps the Lord will help us.
[time=1275] So Jonathan goes down, our armor bearer goes, I'm with you man, whatever you decide, I'm with you.
[time=1280] They go down and they chase the Philistines into a panic.
[time=1286] His faith is met with the confidence of a trusted friend who says I'm with you, Gideon will be there too.
[time=1293] Our obedience will always be met with God's resources.
[time=1296] There may not be camps of Philistines or many nights in your life, but you are facing hardships in your life which cause you to be afraid, fear not, stand firm and see the salvation
[time=1307] of the Lord.
[time=1309] This is your destiny as God's people.
[time=1311] Verse 9, verse 9 again, the Lord said to him, there it is again, the outcome has already
[time=1320] been decided by the Lord.
[time=1322] I have given it into your hand, but Gideon still has to get up and go.
[time=1328] Can I repeat that?
[time=1330] God says, I will do this, I will do this for you and I will go before you.
[time=1335] It's already, it's already done, but you have to get up and do it.
[time=1338] There's something to be said for that, friends, in Nehemiah, there's this remarkable story in Nehemiah where he goes back to rebuild the wall around Jerusalem and there are enemies closing in around them and it says in Nehemiah, I believe it's chapter 4, so we pray to God
[time=1354] and we post it a guard.
[time=1357] Pray to God, post it a guard.
[time=1359] God's going to deliver them, but you've got to get ready too, you've got to go.
[time=1364] There is a place for our obedience.
[time=1367] And again, my obedience, it flows out of a heart that's been changed or it's strengthened by God's grace, it never goes the other direction.
[time=1376] The reader of the story will understand why Gideon might still be reluctant, you and I.
[time=1381] He is overlooking a valley filled with enemy soldiers and he has three hundred guys with
[time=1387] trumpets.
[time=1390] Let's go, Gideon's like, let's get him, guys.
[time=1394] Let's trumpet him to death or something.
[time=1397] Does it remind you of Jericho?
[time=1399] The walls came a tumbling down, can you, I don't know if you ever thought about actually being there and hearing those instructions and you're looking at Jericho, right, and there's these massive walls in front of you, this massive city and then you hear, here's the plant, we're going to walk around a bunch of times and then yell real loud and you're
[time=1419] like, okay, you know, that sounds, that sounds good, you know, the only, the only explanation
[time=1426] is that's impossible, that isn't, that's exactly the point, it's impossible.
[time=1432] There are no odds with the Lord.
[time=1437] Verse 10, if you are afraid to go down, this God's grace, I read this story over and over
[time=1447] and over again and overwhelmed by the grace of God.
[time=1452] Gideon's in a wine press, you know, hey Gideon, let's go, he goes, I don't know, you know,
[time=1458] fleeces and dry fleeces and wet fleeces and he's just, Gideon is a mess, he is a mess.
[time=1465] And God here again says, if you are afraid, God's grace, he's been reluctant and afraid,
[time=1472] it's a preview of the victory, he says, go down, verse 10, go down to the camp with the purr of your servants, God's grace is amazing, God's grace is amazing.
[time=1484] I would have given up on me a long, long time ago, long time ago, and God doesn't, friends.
[time=1492] By the way, this is very much the Old Testament, I'm not sure if you've noticed that before, very much the Old Testament and the God of the Old Testament, I'm, we're told, is mean and vengeful and angry and throwing lightning bolts from the sky and zap, zap, zap thunder and lightning and wrath, and he is so patient with Gideon, unbelievably patient.
[time=1515] And by the way, very, very patient with you and me as well, aren't you glad?
[time=1521] Are you glad?
[time=1522] Okay, me too.
[time=1524] He relentlessly pursues and empowers Gideon despite his doubts and inadequacy over and
[time=1532] over and over again.
[time=1534] He tells him to take a friend with him.
[time=1537] I thought about 1 Timothy chapter 1, the saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance
[time=1543] that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners of whom I am the foremost, but I receive mercy for this reason that in me as the foremost Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience.
[time=1555] As an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life, to the king of the ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever, amen.
[time=1567] God knows everything that is going to happen in this story with perfect clarity.
[time=1576] If you are afraid to go down, verse 10, go down to the camp with your friend, you shall hear verse 11 what they say, and afterward your hand shall be strengthened to go down
[time=1586] against the camp.
[time=1587] Everything is a surprise to the Lord.
[time=1590] Gideon will hear about their plans and Gideon's hands will be strengthened.
[time=1594] So God says, if you're afraid, go down and listen.
[time=1598] So what does he do in verse 11?
[time=1602] He goes down to listen.
[time=1604] So Gideon is afraid.
[time=1604] Hey, Gideon, if you're afraid, go take a friend and go listen, so there he goes, I have to listen.
[time=1609] I thought all the scaredy cats were sent home.
[time=1612] Hey, if you're afraid, go home, guys, Gideon's shaking his boots.
[time=1619] To be fair, Gideon is now scared after his 32,000 guys become 300, but now he's afraid,
[time=1628] but Gideon gets to stay.
[time=1632] There's just grace and mercy, friends, all over the story.
[time=1635] This guy would have been fired from his job chapters ago.
[time=1640] He's not very good at his job.
[time=1644] And God just shows him grace, and he's so patient with him.
[time=1648] Verse 12, all of those gathered together to fight against the Israelites may have numbered
[time=1654] again a hundred thousand people, it's hard to say.
[time=1657] The imagery of locusts, verse 12 says they were like locusts and a dramatic, you know, 300 guys versus a valley filled of locusts and like the sand and the seashore.
[time=1670] I was vacuuming out the sand from the back of my car from spring break, but a week and a half ago, and there's a lot of sand back there, gets everywhere.
[time=1681] This is the exact same group that was listed at the outset of Judges 6, the ones who had come in harvest time and steal the Israelites' produce.
[time=1689] Chapter 6 begins with describing this campaign of terror.
[time=1692] Again, if you're just joining us, this campaign of terror that these people had waged against Israel.
[time=1698] Those are the people.
[time=1699] These nights, the Amalekites, the people of the East, they all came together and it was easy pickings.
[time=1704] They were defenseless, or so we thought.
[time=1708] All of the language of verse 12 is supposed to serve as contrast with the force that Gideon
[time=1714] has assembled.
[time=1716] Look at verse 12.
[time=1718] It says twice, they were in abundance.
[time=1720] It says, "Without number," it says, "as the sand on the seashore, whatever shall they
[time=1726] do, 300 guys versus that Gideon has no chance."
[time=1739] Or does he?
[time=1743] The third point in your outline, friends, is that God strengthens.
[time=1747] God strengthens.
[time=1748] God speaks.
[time=1751] God saves.
[time=1753] God strengthens.
[time=1755] This is the way I would invite you, friends, this morning, into this way of reading the scriptures.
[time=1762] If your starting point, when you read the story of Gideon, is how can I be a better person?
[time=1768] Then there's a lot of the story that will seem very strange to you, but if you start everything in the Bible with what is it speaking to me about what God is like, then, oh boy,
[time=1778] it's going to explode everywhere.
[time=1781] If your starting point is self-improvement, you'll be disappointed.
[time=1784] There's nothing to do with you.
[time=1787] I think the story does, to be sure, but we start with what's God doing here, and God is speaking, and God says, "I will save you, Gideon," and God says, "I will strengthen
[time=1797] you to do what I've asked you to do." His power is made perfect in weakness.
[time=1806] There are gospel threads in this story everywhere.
[time=1810] I've showed you just a few of them.
[time=1812] His power is made perfect in weakness.
[time=1816] The perfect patience of our Lord Jesus on display, certainly in Gideon's story, certainly
[time=1823] in mine, probably in yours too.
[time=1827] In 2 Corinthians chapter 12, Paul talks about a struggle that he was having.
[time=1831] He calls it a thorn in the flesh.
[time=1834] I want to read that with you here this morning.
[time=1837] In Corinthians 12 verse 7 says, "So to keep me from becoming conceited, because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, probably
[time=1848] something wrong with his eyes," what we think about there, it's a different story.
[time=1852] "A messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited.
[time=1857] Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave me." He said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.
[time=1871] Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly, Paul says, of my weaknesses, that the power
[time=1877] of Christ may rest upon me, for the sake of Christ, and I am content with weaknesses,
[time=1883] insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities, for when I am weak, then I am strong."
[time=1892] There is so much friends in all over the scriptures that are so counter-cultural, so counter-cultural.
[time=1901] You've got to do it, you've got to work hard, you've got to get ahead, all those things.
[time=1907] And God says throughout all of these verses, he says, Gideon cannot do this, and that's
[time=1913] exactly why I'm doing what I am doing, to show him that I will fight for you.
[time=1918] You can't part the Red Sea on your own.
[time=1920] I will do it for you.
[time=1922] You can't beat this army, Gideon, but I will do it.
[time=1925] And just so you know, I'll make it abundantly, almost inescapably clear what I'm after here.
[time=1934] God speaks, friends.
[time=1937] Every time you open His Word, He is speaking to you.
[time=1940] Every single time in God's Word and His people, by His Spirit, God speaks to us every day
[time=1947] if we have ears to hear, and He wants you to know what He wants you to do.
[time=1952] My dad would always say, God is not the author of confusion.
[time=1955] I believe it.
[time=1956] I believe His Word supports that.
[time=1958] He wants you to know what He wants you to do.
[time=1961] And so if you are wondering here today what I ought to do, cry out to Him.
[time=1969] He wants you to know.
[time=1972] God saves.
[time=1975] The Word saves is not a word that we like very much, again, because it implies I need to be, I got to be helped out, saved, we might say, saved from my gated community.
[time=1986] Saved from my 401k, well, maybe on that front, I don't know, but saved, I got everything
[time=1992] I need.
[time=1993] And the Bible uses this word over and over again.
[time=1996] And being saved, in this case from the many nights, but in our lives, saved from the power of sin and death and hell is something only God can do.
[time=2005] You can't do that yourself.
[time=2007] For most of my life, for the first half of my life, not most of my life, I turned 48
[time=2013] a couple of days ago, so not most of my life anymore.
[time=2017] But anyway, I thought I wanted to be a good person and I had, I like to think of it as
[time=2024] booster rockets.
[time=2026] So I try to, I used to live in Florida, so I could actually see, when the space shuttle Challenger voted in 1986, I could see it from my high school.
[time=2035] And you can see that when it went up and then with the rockets, when I thought it was a harrowing day, I'll never forget it.
[time=2040] And I thought I had enough strength in myself to, I was a pretty good person and I had enough
[time=2046] strength to escape the gravity of my sin and I couldn't do it and I was miserable.
[time=2049] I wanted to be a good person, but I couldn't manufacture it in my life.
[time=2053] And in 1992, I heard what I heard, heard, I'm sure I heard it 50,000 times.
[time=2062] What would you say, Steve, if you had to stay before God today and I had no answers?
[time=2064] I had my own goodness.
[time=2065] I was a pretty good person, I had a sensitive conscience and I wholly trusted, just like
[time=2071] Sam, I wholly trusted in Jesus name.
[time=2075] And you can do that today too.
[time=2078] That invitation is available to you all the time.
[time=2082] God saves.
[time=2083] He can do it.
[time=2084] He can do what only he can do.
[time=2086] God strengthens.
[time=2088] God speaks.
[time=2089] God saves.
[time=2090] God strengthens.
[time=2091] His power is made perfect in weakness.
[time=2094] The only way to victory, for Gideon, was to strip away any chance that he could take credit for it.
[time=2101] And the way to salvation is exactly the same.
[time=2103] I can't save myself.
[time=2107] And God has done everything necessary for your salvation in the person of Jesus Christ totally and completely forever.
[time=2114] I'm saying that just this morning earlier, now is an opportunity for you to receive that from me again.
[time=2120] I read these verses from Romans 16, then we're going to pray, and I'll give you an opportunity to respond.
[time=2126] Romans 16 says, "Not to him who was able to strengthen you, according to my gospel in
[time=2132] the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery that was kept secret for long ages, but now has been disclosed and through the prophetic writings has been made known to all nations, according to the command of the eternal God to bring about the obedience of faith to the only wise God be glory forevermore through Jesus Christ, amen."
[time=2151] I'll ask you, friends, to buy your heads and to close your eyes as we close this morning.
[time=2156] I'll just, we'll run through it again.
[time=2160] The here in Judges 7, God speaks to Gideon, and God may be speaking to you right now.
[time=2164] He's calling you to himself in ways that only he can.
[time=2169] If you have ears to hear, God is speaking to you.
[time=2172] And maybe he's crying out to you, look, you cried out to me in September so many years ago to respond in faith to say, "God, I can't save myself because God saves, and I can't
[time=2182] do it.
[time=2183] I can't save myself.
[time=2184] Today can be the opportunity for you to respond in that way, and God will give you the strength to do what he wants you to do.
[time=2190] His strength is made perfect in weakness.
[time=2194] This morning I want to give you the opportunity and the quietness of this moment, wherever you are, to respond to that offer.
[time=2201] God, I cannot save myself.
[time=2203] I have tried.
[time=2205] I'm going to fall short.
[time=2207] Your expectation is perfection.
[time=2208] I can't get there, but I believe that Jesus did it for me.
[time=2213] And if you would say that this morning, then God promises that he will save you.
[time=2217] It gives me great joy to tell you that this morning, great, great joy.
[time=2221] So wherever you are in this moment, I'll give you a chance to respond in that way.
[time=2226] God is speaking to you, God will save you, and God will strengthen you.
[time=2231] Heavenly Father, this morning I pray for the courage it takes to admit I can't do it.
[time=2238] I pray, God, for my brothers and sisters, wherever they are, listening, that you would give them the strength to respond to the invitation to be saved by your Holy Spirit, God.
[time=2248] I pray that if they did respond in that way, that they would tell someone that they can be walked alongside someone in this place, God, even though we can walk alongside them and help them on this journey of faith, God, thank you for each person in this room, thank
[time=2262] you for all those within the sound of my voice, God, that have heard this story of inadequate Gideon and completely, wholly adequate, our wholly adequate Heavenly Father, who has provided
[time=2274] for us completely to be saved on the merits of his Son, Jesus, in whose name I pray, Amen.
