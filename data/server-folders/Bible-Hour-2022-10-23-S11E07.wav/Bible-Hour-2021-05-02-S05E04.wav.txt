[time=0] Well good morning everyone. My name is Steve Webster. I share my time here on campus with
[time=7] the church and the school. I've been here for a long time. Long enough to see lots of my former students around the room. It's so good to see all of you. Some of you with families. Praise God. So great. We'll be in Judges 7 this morning so take out your devices
[time=23] or your Bibles and we'll be there. Judges 7 is after Judges 6 and before Judges 8. So
[time=29] there we go. I had a bit of a revelation this morning as we were singing that song. I've
[time=35] heard that song maybe not 100 billion times but a lot of times I've heard that song. I
[time=41] love that song and two lines stuck out to me because the story of Gideon, this story
[time=47] that we're in, this series that we're in with Gideon inadequate me is the story about God's grace. Every painted sky the song says, the canvas of his grace. And I'm grateful because
[time=63] there are, there are no other kinds of people that God uses friends but inadequate people.
[time=68] And every, every whisper of this story is a demonstration of God's grace. The only kind
[time=74] of people that God can use are broken and confused and hurting people just like Gideon
[time=81] and just like me. I've been a little bit hard on Gideon. I have to be honest, I read this story and Gideon is kind of like me. He just kind of loses his way and he's a bit of a meridue well shall we say. I see myself in this story and then I stopped in that song
[time=96] and said, "Grace, God's grace, grace that is greater than all my sin." And I am grateful
[time=104] for that this morning. Are you grateful for God's grace this morning? This story is for you. If you are grateful for God's grace in the midst of this story about this horribly
[time=114] inadequate person, and I can't wait to talk with you guys this morning, my grandfather
[time=121] was involved from my mom's dad, was involved for many years with an organization called the Gideon's, Gideon's International. You guys ever heard of the Gideon's? Raise your hand for the Gideon's. Very famous for putting Bibles in hotel rooms. They're really responsible
[time=137] for Bible distribution. We know the mostly from hotel rooms, but all over the world in all kinds of places they distribute Bibles. It's their calling, their mission. This is the
[time=147] icon of the symbol for the Gideon's organization right out of our passage for today. And in the
[time=154] literature for the Gideon's organization, I found this description which talks about why they chose the name. For there, and in this description is heaps and heaps of grace. So here's what it says.
[time=167] Gideon was a man who was willing to do exactly what God wanted him to do, regardless of his own judgment, ask the plans or results. Humility, faith, and obedience were
[time=180] his great elements of character. I read that and I was like, really? The last couple chapters have
[time=187] not been easy on Gideon. And by the way, wait until next week. So hang on for that, for the great
[time=193] conclusion. This is the standard they say the Gideon's International is trying to establish in all its members, each man to be ready to do God's will at any time, at any place, in any way, the Holy Spirit leads. My story has not been written in the pages of Scripture. Gideon's is,
[time=209] for all of the ugliness is there on display for everyone to see. And so I am grateful for that.
[time=216] Perhaps you are too, that your life isn't a slideshow for all to see, but Gideon's life is.
[time=223] So I think I'm a little bit too hard on Gideon, but the point of this story, all the points for last week, all the points for this week, friends, begin with God.
[time=231] And any Bible story that you read that doesn't lead you to treasure Christ more,
[time=237] my invitation would be to read it perhaps with different lenses. Our reading of Gideon's story
[time=243] this past week reveals anything but a man full of courage and ready to be obedient, he was reluctant. God drags him along, literally in some cases. His story is a great display of the
[time=255] grace of God to use the most unlikely people to accomplish his purposes in the world. I told you
[time=262] before about 10 years ago, for some reason they asked me to speak of commencement at my high school down in Florida, and there I was on stage, and I know my pre-calico teacher was like, what on earth is he doing up there? Like how did he get him off the stage? The most unlikely people, friends, are the only kind of people that God did use this. How many times do you pass it up to tell you? Well, Kevin has told you many, many times. God, anything but that, anything but a pastor God, I'll do anything you want. Unlikliness, reluctance. God uses people,
[time=294] and he arms them with his grace. I thought of these verses from 2 Corinthians chapter 4 that you have heard before. This is 2 Corinthians 4 verses 5 through 7. For what we proclaim is not ourselves,
[time=306] but Jesus Christ as Lord, with ourselves as your servants, for Jesus' sake. For God, who said,
[time=313] let light shine out of darkness, has shown in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. Here it is in verse 7. But we had this treasure
[time=324] in jars of clay. I hadn't thought about the jars of clay connection, but there it is.
[time=331] This treasure in jars of clay to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us.
[time=338] That is the story of Gideon. The surpassing power, this victory belongs to God, not to us. He uses
[time=345] us. He doesn't need to use us, but he does. And this morning friends, I don't know how you got here.
[time=351] I'm not sure how you're watching, how you came to be in this place or within the sound of my voice, but I want to encourage you this morning that God is at work in the world. God's at work in your life, despite your failures, despite your weakness. Gideon is anything but a model
[time=371] with apologies to my friends and the Gideon's. But he is a way forward for us to say that God
[time=377] can use anyone to do what he is going to do. Let's pray this morning as we begin. We'll read our passage and then break it down as we go. Would you please pray with me? God, the song says,
[time=387] every star, a signal fire of grace, every painted sky, a canvas of your grace. Your grace, oh God,
[time=396] is amazing. Your grace is favor that I don't deserve. It got sometimes in church. We feel like
[time=405] we have to put it on. We have to put on appearances and seem like we've got it all together. And God,
[time=412] I want to just say publicly that I don't and we don't. We entrust ourselves to you. This story,
[time=421] inadequate me, the story of Gideon is a story of your complete and total sufficiency in all things
[time=429] and our complete inadequacy. And there, God, we find an opening for the gospel that you have done,
[time=437] everything necessary to save us already in the person of your son Jesus. And so I pray this morning
[time=443] that we would see him, that we would see you with more clarity. I pray all those things in Jesus' name.
[time=449] Amen. Judges 7 starting with verse 13. Let's read our story this morning together.
[time=457] Before we jump in, last week we ended with Gideon on the hill, looking down the valley.
[time=462] He's got 300 guys. There are hordes of Midianites in the valley. And Gideon's got 300 guys. And so
[time=470] God says, "Hey, if you're still scared, Gideon, take a friend, go down to the camp, stick on there, listen to what they're saying, and you'll be encouraged." So here we go. Verse 13, "When Gideon came,
[time=480] the whole man was telling a dream to his comrade." He said, "Behold, I dream to dream, and behold,
[time=487] a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian and came to the tent and struck it so that
[time=493] it fell and turned it upside down to the tent lay flat." His comrade answered, "This is no other
[time=499] than the sword of Gideon, the son of Joash, the man of Israel. God has given into his hand Midian and all the camp. As soon as Gideon heard the telling of the dream and interpretation,
[time=510] he worshipped. And he returned to the camp of Israel and said, "Arise for the Lord has given the
[time=516] host of Midian into your hand." He divided it 300 men into three companies and put trumpets into their hands of all them and empty jars with torches inside the jars. He said to them,
[time=529] "Look at me and do likewise when I come to the outskirts of the camp, do as I do. When I blow
[time=535] the trumpet, I and all who are with me then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and shout for the Lord and for Gideon." Verse 19, "So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him
[time=548] came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch when they had just set to watch and they blew the trumpets and smashed the jars that were in their hands. Then the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the jars. They held in their left hands the torches and their right hands the trumpets to blow. They cried out, "A sword to the Lord and for Gideon. Every man stood in
[time=571] his place around the camp and all the army ran. They cried out and fled. When they blew the 300
[time=577] trumpets the Lord said every man soared against his comrade and against all the army. And the army fled as far as Beit Shetah toward Zerah as far as the border of Amal-Abel-Mecholah by Tabat." Verse 23,
[time=590] "The men of Israel were called out from Naftali and from Asher and from Al-Manasseh. They pursued after Gideon." Verse 24 says, "Givians set messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim."
[time=600] Saying, "Come down against the Midianites and capture the waters against them as far as Beit
[time=607] Barah and also the Jordan to all the men of Ephraim were called out and they captured the waters as far as Beit Barah and also the Jordan. They captured the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeb. They killed
[time=620] Oreb at the rock of Oreb and Zeb they killed the winepress of Zeb. They pursued Midian and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeb to Gideon across the Jordan. This is God's word. Let's jump in. Go back
[time=634] to verse 13 everyone. Let's take a look. So back in verse 11 from last week God told Gideon that he
[time=641] would hear what was said and his hands would be strengthened. That literally means that he would
[time=647] be encouraged. Gideon is afraid so he says he has a friend with him to go down to the outside of the Midianite camp. He overhears a man recounting his dream and then the person with him interprets
[time=660] the dream. I could not help but wonder how long ago did this person have this dream?
[time=665] Who knows what was that work? How long ago was the dream had for him to say,
[time=671] oh by the way I had this dream about a barley bread loaf tumbling into our camp. Days ago?
[time=677] Who knows? God is at work. I'm amazed friends at how God is at work in our lives and then we live
[time=685] our lives and how all that comes into intersection and here it is. Everything goes exactly as God
[time=694] has planned. Everything will always go exactly as God has planned. That great theologian Garth Brooks
[time=703] is echoing in my ears this morning. Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers. I had plans for
[time=711] my life. Maybe you did too and it hasn't maybe gone the way you planned or the way you thought
[time=721] and I am so glad that it hasn't because so much things I could not have imagined friends including
[time=728] this right now. Things I could not have imagined for my life. I'm so grateful that God has plans
[time=736] that he is working out for us that work irrespective of all the ways I try to make things go.
[time=742] God doesn't need Gideon to do any of the story that we read. He needs him to do none of it.
[time=747] In fact he is working throughout in spite of Gideon and his reluctance and his fear and his
[time=754] inadequacy. Dave Roser here comes your C.S. Lewis reference for the morning.
[time=760] This is from a little pamphlet that he wrote about the efficacy of prayer which is about
[time=766] that prayer does what it's supposed to do and first hour I kind of refer to it but I want to read
[time=772] it to you because I won't do it justice. Can we believe that God ever really modifies his action
[time=779] in response to the suggestions of men? For infinite wisdom does not need telling what is best
[time=785] and infinite goodness needs no urging to do it but neither does God need any of those things that
[time=792] are done by finite agents living or inanimate. He could if he chose or pair our bodies miraculously
[time=799] without food or give us food without the aid of farmers, bakers and butchers or knowledge
[time=805] without the aid of learned men or convert the heathen without missionaries. Instead he allows
[time=811] soils and weather and animals and the muscles, minds and wills of men to cooperate in the execution
[time=818] of his will. He allows us to be involved in the working out of his will in the world but doesn't
[time=826] need us to but allows us to. God says blazed Pascal instituted prayer to lend to his creatures
[time=836] the dignity of causality. That I get to be involved in the working out of God's will in the world.
[time=842] Have you thought about that lately and how marvelous that is that God doesn't need you at all but he allows you to be involved in what he's doing in the world as an exercise of his grace.
[time=853] We had this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all surpassing power is from God and not from us. That's the message. This dream like a lot of dreams I have makes no sense.
[time=864] A barley bread loaf comes tumbling into a camp and knocks over a tent. Okay. It makes no sense
[time=871] at all but the end is the most important part the end of the midnight camp. I can't help but wonder this is so you can press pause for a minute. This is my speculation. I can't help but wonder
[time=882] if Gideon like tumbled into his ministry like the loaf tumbles into the camp in the many nights.
[time=887] You can press play again. This is my thought. I don't know. He isn't marching into the camp like a four star general. Let's go guys. You know. He kind of tumbles in. He tumbles into all of the
[time=898] things that he's got to do. Sort of like what you and I sometimes do. The word tumbled here literally means it turned itself over. Gideon turns himself over. Okay God. Okay God.
[time=911] Okay God. Oh no. All over and over again. God overturns the midnight camp with this tumbling judge
[time=920] Gideon. Verse 14 says the many nights interpretation of this dream is instant. Well I know what that's
[time=927] about. I know what that's about. He knows exactly who Gideon is. Gideon's reputation precedes him.
[time=936] The reader of judges knows a lot more about Gideon than these guys do. These guys are like oh Gideon. You mean Joash's son? Gideon? That guy? We're done. We're done.
[time=948] In verse 9 God tells Gideon that he has given the camp into his hands. That's exactly what the many nights soldier tells his friend. The Lord works in mysterious ways and God speaking to this
[time=963] Midianite through his friend. Gideon and his friend makes it all go. The Midianite soldier
[time=970] announces in Gideon's hearing what God already told him. The dream provides the confirmation
[time=976] that Gideon needed in light of his earlier fear. In verse 15 Gideon worships. The word for worship
[time=984] he falls down on the ground. He just falls down. He is overwhelmed at what God, overwhelmed I would
[time=993] say to your friends at God's grace. Look at what he has done. I was scared. God says okay Gideon
[time=999] you're still scared. Go with the friend and go over here. And so he does over here this whole story. He prostrates himself down to the ground in the humble acknowledgement of who God is.
[time=1011] I thought about Hebrews 12 this morning when it comes to worship. Hebrews 12 says therefore
[time=1021] let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken.
[time=1025] And let us offer to God acceptable worship with reverence and awe for our God is a consuming fire.
[time=1033] Hebrews 12 comes after Hebrews 11. Hebrews 11 you're welcome. Hebrews 11 is where Gideon is
[time=1040] mentioned by name as a hero of the faith. And friends this is his legacy. The Midianite soldier
[time=1049] says oh Gideon I know about him. Hebrews 11 says oh Gideon. Oh him. And I read judges like this
[time=1056] Gideon is a knucklehead. And yet God doesn't evaluate us in that way. He sees us beyond those
[time=1062] things. And I'm so grateful that's at the last word. My own failures. Gideon worships after he
[time=1069] gets external confirmation of what God had already and repeatedly said to him. The Lord has given
[time=1076] into your hand this whole camp. Watching the story how the focus begins to change for Gideon
[time=1082] moving forward. The first point in your notes friends if you're taking notes is God's gift.
[time=1087] And again God's grace hovering over all of this. God's gift ultimately of grace and Gideon's worship
[time=1093] in response to it. Worship is a clear understanding of who God really is. That's a working and very
[time=1101] elementary definition of what worship is. Worship is a clear understanding of response to a clear understanding of who God really is. It's not always singing. It often is but not always singing.
[time=1112] It's my life. This worshipful response in my life is expressing in my life. I really do think
[time=1121] that God is the God of the universe. I really do think that all the things that we sang a minute
[time=1127] ago are true and they inform my life. The risen one has overcome that's past tense. He has
[time=1135] overcome and living that way is worship. Verse 16. The battle strategy that Gideon seems to
[time=1144] employ here is all his own. I've got it. 300 guys. Torches, trumpets and jars. That'll get him.
[time=1151] This is his strategy. He can take full credit for that. The number of men that Gideon will send
[time=1158] against the camp and what they do once they get there removes forever any possibility
[time=1164] of him taking credit for it. Torches are inside the jars. They'll break the jars. Then you see the
[time=1172] light come out out of nowhere. 300 trumpets would be jarring in the middle of the night. It says
[time=1179] that they came in the middle watch in verse 19. We'll get there in a second. That would indeed be jarring. Verse 17. We see Gideon finding his confidence, finding his courage. Hey guys,
[time=1191] look at me and do likewise. He says, do as I do. But look at verse 17 and 18 with me again.
[time=1200] Look at me and do likewise. When I come to the outskirts of the camp, do as I do. Verse 18. When
[time=1207] I build the trumpet, I and all who are with me, there's a lot of first person pronouns there.
[time=1214] I think this is foreshadowing for what happens next week and the week after next.
[time=1218] I am not untroubled by that, friends. Say it's for the Lord and for Gideon in verse 18.
[time=1228] In Joshua 6 and the battle of Jericho, the battle of Jericho is a bunch of guys walking
[time=1237] around a city with trumpets and shouting and the walls came and tumbling down. Very much, this reminds me of this story, very acutely. It's ridiculous. It's absurd.
[time=1247] In a normal situation, the leaders would build trumpets. So if there are 300 trumpets,
[time=1254] that means they'll hold much people behind these people. So there could be a huge army. This is all part of the confusion. For the Lord and for Gideon may not be a problem, but it also may signal
[time=1264] future levels of distraction that will harm Gideon and will harm Israel. God, Gideon knows the Lord
[time=1272] gave Gideon into their hands and Gideon goes into this confrontation, knowing that his absurd plan will succeed because God is with him. So Gideon is known as a fearsome leader to the people of
[time=1284] Gideon, but this is way beyond. It's very disproportionate to the actual story that we see
[time=1291] here. So verse 19, here we go. It's the beginning of the middle watch. This is the middle of the night, maybe about 11 p.m., which is late for me. Maybe not for you, but 11 p.m. is late for me.
[time=1302] I'm usually in bed by then. So kids, maybe you're wide awake, but I am asleep. You usually at 11 o'clock. And I must say, if 300 people with trumpets came to, if I was camping,
[time=1313] I haven't been camping in quite a while, but if I was, and 300 guys came and surrounded my camp
[time=1320] and blew trumpets and broke jars, I would probably freak out. I would probably freak out in all
[time=1326] fairness because 300 trumpets is a lot of trumpets. Have you ever heard that many trumpets all at once? That must be overwhelming. All pointed at you. Remarkable. Whatever weakness or fear in
[time=1340] fairness may have paralyzed Gideon before, this plan works out perfectly. It's executed flawlessly.
[time=1348] So the many nights have substantial confusion and problems. Here, look at verse 20 again.
[time=1354] Three companies blew the trumpets, broke the jars, they held their left hands, the torches,
[time=1361] the right hands, the trumpets, the blow. And here it is. They cried out, "A sword for the Lord
[time=1367] and for Gideon." There are no swords. There are no weapons. There's a torch and a jar.
[time=1378] And a trumpet. They strike fear into the hearts of the many nights. Do you remember last week
[time=1385] when the army was whittled down from this to this to this? Do you remember that last week?
[time=1389] Not your head if you were here. Remember that? Anybody in the room? Notting your head? Are you with me? Very good. Thank you. Okay, good. So there were 3,000 people, then that was whittled down to this many. Then all at the end, there's 300 guys. It's the whole force that Gideon has
[time=1404] at his disposal. He says, "If you guys are afraid, you can go home." And a lot of them go home. The
[time=1410] majority of them go home. This same thing has happened in the midnight camp. They hear about the dream
[time=1417] and the dream circulates. And oh no, there's a guy up in the hill. He's coming for us. It's Gideon,
[time=1424] Joash's kid. Gideon, he's coming for us. Gideon's coming for us. Fear pervades their camp. It has
[time=1431] this viral effect, forgive me, in the camp. It spreads throughout the entire camp. It reminds
[time=1437] me of Joshua chapter 2. This is what Rahab says, "As the people of Israel gather outside Jericho,
[time=1443] with massive walls." She says, "We have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea before
[time=1450] you when you came out of Egypt. And what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan, to Saihan and Ag, can be devoted to destruction. As soon as we heard it,
[time=1461] our hearts melted. And there was no spirit left in any man because of you. For the Lord,
[time=1468] your God, he is God," she says. In the heavens above and on the earth beneath. The Canaanite
[time=1476] Rahab, who's in the light of Jesus, by the way. Look at Matthew chapter 1. The Canaanite Rahab
[time=1482] and the people of Jericho heard what the Lord had done. They recognized that he was God and they freaked out. People of Midian in the camp, every man stood in his place, verse 21, around the camp,
[time=1493] and all the army ran. Three verbs, they ran, they cried out, they fled. The Bible loves to stack
[time=1500] verbs. They ran, they cried out, they fled. They are in panic. This is the new living translation,
[time=1511] verse 21 is really great here. I just want to read it to you. It says, "Each man stood at his position around the camp and watched." They watched, as all the Midianites rushed around in a panic,
[time=1523] shouting as they ran to escape. Verse 22, friends, says, "The Lord set all the Midianites' swords
[time=1531] against each other," because the Israelites don't have any swords. A sword, the Lord, and
[time=1538] for Gideon. They don't even have any. It reminds me of the story of David and Goliath a few years
[time=1546] in the future. In 1 Samuel 17, Goliath is a giant. My son is right now playing in a basketball game
[time=1553] across town against a 15-year-old, 6 foot 9, 6 foot 8, 6 foot 7, right this very moment.
[time=1560] So I'm sympathetic to him in real time. Go get him, buddy. Goliath is breathing out blasphemies
[time=1570] against God, Israel. And David's like, "Enough." Verse 46, 1 Samuel 17 says, "This day the Lord
[time=1577] will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down and cut off your head." Daniel is a kid. Goliath is not. He's eight feet tall, maybe taller.
[time=1588] I will give the dead bodies of the hosts of the Philistines. This dates the birds of the air and the wild beasts of the earth, and all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.
[time=1597] All assembly may know that the Lord saves, not with sword and spear. The Lord saves,
[time=1604] not with sword and spear, but with trumpets and jars, if I may. The battle is the Lord's,
[time=1613] and He will give you into our hand. The Philistine arose, came and journeyered to meet David. David
[time=1620] ran quickly toward the battle, lying to meet the Philistine. David put his hand in his bag, took out the stone, swung it, and struck the Philistine on his forehead.
[time=1628] The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground.
[time=1632] At Jericho, with Gideon, with David. God, there are no odds with him.
[time=1639] There are only unlikely heroes in our minds, but God has, he says, you will know there is a God
[time=1645] in Israel. This is the point. So we saw in the first part, friends, God's gift of grace.
[time=1652] Now we see here, this is God's victory. The second thing you notice, God, this is God's victory, and the battle says David. The battle belongs to the Lord. Say it to yourself this week,
[time=1663] when you feel inadequate, not if you feel inadequate, but when you feel inadequate,
[time=1669] the battle belongs to the Lord. Something you feel very inadequate for.
[time=1673] The Lord will go before you, and he will fight for you, have only to be silent for that last week.
[time=1680] Men of Israel blew their trumpets, and they watched. They didn't do a thing all the many nights, ran in confusion, in a panic.
[time=1688] The Lord loves you that much, friends. He loves you enough to give you exactly what you need
[time=1694] to do what you have to do. This is his promise, this is how much he loves you.
[time=1700] Here we come to the end of our story, this part of the story, verse 23.
[time=1706] So the men of Israel were called out from all the northern tribes of Israel, from Naphtalee,
[time=1712] Asher, and Manasseh. They pursued after Midian, verse 24, Gideon sent messengers through all the hill country saying, let's go. They're on the run. They're literally on the run.
[time=1724] The same men who very recently went home afraid are now, with them on the run,
[time=1731] not so afraid. This is what Thomas Paine would call summer soldiers and sunshine patriots.
[time=1737] When everything's going well, oh, sure I'm with you Gideon, but beforehand, the locust on the valley, they're like, oh, I don't know about that.
[time=1745] The victory was clearly gods.
[time=1754] Verse 24 of these princes received justice for what they have done for years of terrorizing Israel,
[time=1762] stealing their crops, causing starvation and discouragement.
[time=1766] But I want to pause here for a minute, friend. This is hard. It's a hard truth.
[time=1774] But it's true that we don't want to live in a world without justice.
[time=1782] And God fights on behalf of his people and brings justice. And these two princes of
[time=1788] Midian had unleashed a campaign of terror and dehumanization on God's people. And God says,
[time=1796] enough, enough. And he uses his people to be instruments of that justice. And so I would
[time=1804] just say to you this morning that this is the God of the Old Testament. This is who God is.
[time=1809] Hebrews 12, so our God is a consuming fire.
[time=1811] My friend, Kim Holloway, this week read from my favorite minor prophet, Nahum,
[time=1819] in chapter one. He read these verses and they'll be on the screens in front of you.
[time=1824] Before we start reading, Nahum is a prophet to Nineveh, the capital of Assyria.
[time=1831] Nahum comes to Assyria 100 years after Jonah gets spit out onto the Assyrian shores. Remember that?
[time=1838] And delivers his message. And in Jonah, there's an unbelievable response. Even the animals repent
[time=1844] in Nineveh, according to Jonah. It's unbelievable repentance and turnaround. Well, 100 years have
[time=1850] passed and they have reverted back to their own ways. The Lord is a jealous and avenging God.
[time=1856] The Lord is avenging and wrathful. The Lord takes vengeance on his adversaries and keeps wrath
[time=1864] for his enemies. The Lord is slow to anger, great in power. The Lord will, by no means,
[time=1871] clear the guilty. His way is in whirlwind and storm and the clouds are the dust of his feet.
[time=1879] That means one of two things and they're both awesome. It either means that God is walking around on the clouds, which is awesome, or it means that he is so massive and mighty and
[time=1889] powerful that he kicks up the dust like its clouds. He rebukes the sea and makes it dry. He dries
[time=1896] up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel, wither. The bloom of Lebanon withers. The mountains
[time=1902] quake before him. The hills melt like the enemies of Israel's hearts melted. The earth heaves before
[time=1911] him. The world and all who dwell in it. Who can stand before his indignation? Who can endure the heat of his anger? His wrath is poured out like fire and the rocks are broken into pieces by him.
[time=1922] The Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble. He knows those who take refuge in him.
[time=1931] But with an overflowing flood, he will make a complete end of his adversaries and will pursue
[time=1937] his enemies into darkness. What do you plot against the Lord? He'll make a complete end.
[time=1943] Trouble will not rise up a second time for all the ways that these people had
[time=1949] terrorized his people, God says enough. And to nay him, to Assyria, God says enough.
[time=1957] God is a God of justice, friends. He is slow to anger, but great in power.
[time=1965] It's important that we keep those two things together. They hold together. He isn't one or the
[time=1971] other. He's both working together. In Psalm 146, the psalmist says, "Blessed is he who's
[time=1980] help is in the God of Jacob, who's hope is in the God, Lord his God, who made heaven and earth, the sea and all that's in them, who keeps faith forever, who executes justice for the oppressed, who gives food to the hungry." The third and final point, friends, this morning is this.
[time=1995] It's God's justice. And like worship at our first point, here is a short but workable definition
[time=2003] for justice as that word is used in the Old Testament, as you see it here in Judges 7.
[time=2008] God intervenes on behalf of the vulnerable. God steps in on behalf of those who can't help
[time=2017] themselves to help them and restore them. Israel is despondent. They have no hope
[time=2026] year after year. They plant their crops. These guys swoop down and steal them, year after year,
[time=2034] after year. You ever written a paper and thought you saved it, but you didn't actually save it?
[time=2039] Has it ever happened to anybody in this room? A few of you have. That's a very bad feeling.
[time=2045] And you lost it. This is year after year. They worked on it for months of time, every year.
[time=2052] And God says enough. Enough. And the heads of Orab and Zeb are brought to Gideon. And it's not
[time=2062] fun to read. But God will take vengeance on his adversaries. And this is an opportunity for the
[time=2069] gospel friends. The song says till on the cross where Jesus God, the wrath of God,
[time=2076] was satisfied. Every sin on him was laid. We don't want to live in a world without justice.
[time=2085] We don't. And justice was done when Jesus Christ willingly gave himself up for us all.
[time=2096] As a demonstration of God's love on the other end of that justice shown to Jesus on our behalf
[time=2105] is salvation, friends. And I cannot tell you how encouraging that is. Gideon says earlier in the
[time=2112] story in chapter six, he goes, God says, I'm going to save Gideon. I'm going to save you from Gideon, and he goes, are you sure about that God? Because where are you? Like you saved from the
[time=2122] Egyptians. Where are you now? In Isaiah 10, years in the future, we read this. In a little while,
[time=2131] my anger against you will end and then my anger will rise up to destroy them. The Lord of Heaven's
[time=2137] armies will lash them with his whip as he did when Gideon triumphs over the Midianites at the rock
[time=2143] of Orab or when the Lord's staff was raised to drown the Egyptian army in the sea. God will
[time=2150] break the yoke of slavery for his people. So as we conclude, friends, I leave you with this. I
[time=2159] saw something on the internet this week that got my attention and it said someone was asking on some social media service. Why are you still a Christian? It's a good question. Maybe the right
[time=2172] question. I don't know. And my answer, I told my students this week, my answer starts with I have
[time=2178] not lost confidence in God's Word. I have not. And leading in and leading out of this story,
[time=2187] all over the Bible are these stories. And God says, because you came through like this in the past,
[time=2193] I will trust you in the present time. That's what Isaiah 10 is doing. That's what God does with Gideon. I saved the Egyptian, saved the Israelites from the Egyptians. I'll save you too, Gideon.
[time=2204] God's action in the past leads to confident worship in the present time. This story is a story of God's
[time=2211] gift, of God's grace, of God's victory. The battle belongs to him. It's a story of God's justice
[time=2218] that God intervenes on behalf of the helpless to help them. This is the gospel.
[time=2223] So I'll invite you in this moment to maybe buy your heads and to close your eyes at me, please.
[time=2229] Please buy your heads and close your eyes. I want you to consider that and the quietness of this moment. Jesus on the cross cried out. It's finished.
[time=2244] And God's Word interprets those words by saying everything necessary for your salvation has been
[time=2254] done in the person of Jesus Christ. And so in the quietness of this moment, however you are engaging with this service, I would invite you to respond to that invitation.
[time=2265] That this story of Gideon from the Old Testament leads us to the cross of Christ.
[time=2272] Gideon's inadequacy, my inadequacy, lead us to a place of the complete sufficiency of Jesus.
[time=2283] So cry out to him this morning and ask him to save you. May today be the day of your salvation.
[time=2289] Father, I pray for anyone in this room, anyone with an sound of my voice,
[time=2297] give him the faith God to believe. Those who are gathered around this service God,
[time=2305] however they are gathered, would you please encourage them with these words. The battle
[time=2311] belongs to you. You have and you will intervene to help those that can't help themselves.
[time=2318] And we all stand God as recipients of your grace. So may it be so.
[time=2323] All these things got to commit to you in Jesus' name with great thanksgiving. Amen.
