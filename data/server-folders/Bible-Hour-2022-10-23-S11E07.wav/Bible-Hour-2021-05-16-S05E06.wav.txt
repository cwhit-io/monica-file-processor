[time=0] is sent you to this moment for, is to know that whatever is going on in your life,
[time=7] hopelessness may be that you feel that we know the hope of all eternity and he has
[time=15] And that is the hope that we're digging into in this series,
[time=21] because we realize how inadequate our health is.
[time=30] That we are, we feel so inadequate just like Gideon.
[time=33] And in this series, inadequate me, we're looking at the book of Judges.
[time=36] You can turn to Judges 8, because today I want to talk to you about God's challenge.
[time=41] God's challenge to finish well.
[time=44] God's challenge to finish well, we're looking at Gideon.
[time=47] Gideon was a real person throughout history and we see his account of his life in Judges 8.
[time=53] And this passage, verses 22 through 35, is the account of the end of Gideon's life.
[time=59] And this is following two really big victories where the Lord has used a guy like Gideon, an inadequate guy like Gideon, like me, like all of us to do the unthinkable to deliver the nation,
[time=69] the people of God from the Midianites who under whom they were in oppression for over seven years.
[time=75] And these battles have happened, the victories have been won.
[time=78] We go from Gideon the coward in chapter 6 of Judges to Gideon the conqueror in chapter 7.
[time=83] Now to Gideon the conqueror in chapter 8, and we're at the end of his life.
[time=88] And I want to think about good endings to stories, usually when I like movies.
[time=93] How many of you like the fairy tale endings to movies?
[time=95] That's where you're going, right?
[time=97] So in the chat online and in the room, shout out a few of your favorite happily ever after movies or stories.
[time=102] Go on, shout them out.
[time=104] Cinderella!
[time=105] Cinderella, all right, what else?
[time=107] You really like Cinderella, don't you, me too.
[time=109] Does that snow white?
[time=110] Yeah.
[time=111] All right, what else?
[time=113] Write it in the chat, too.
[time=114] Let's look at it today.
[time=115] And I'll give you one of mine.
[time=116] Here's one of mine.
[time=117] Beauty and the Beast.
[time=120] Oh, just ends so well.
[time=122] It's just everything's made right.
[time=124] And here's the thing, Gideon's story, it ends nothing like that.
[time=130] At all, really not at all.
[time=133] But remember, this is just a sliver of the history of Israel and the grand picture and the story of salvation and redemption that God is writing.
[time=141] And so I want to give you the question of the week.
[time=143] We've posted it in the chats and even in the room, you can log in and give us some answers.
[time=146] I want you guys to help me preach today.
[time=148] And here's that question.
[time=149] When I'm gone, I hope I am remembered as blank.
[time=152] And in the chat, write that down.
[time=154] You're going to help me preach.
[time=155] I'll come back to those in just a few minutes.
[time=157] I'll pull them up and we'll talk about them on the spot together.
[time=160] And I really am going to read your answers, too, so be nice.
[time=162] All right, so we'll look at that.
[time=164] This is the question we're digging into, though, today as we look at God's challenge to finish well.
[time=169] And as we think about it, I want you to think about this picture.
[time=172] This is a tombstone.
[time=173] And one day, if Jesus doesn't come back, and he can come any time, but if he doesn't, one day, you'll have one of these.
[time=181] Your name will be written across the top.
[time=183] It'll have a date of your birth, your birth date, and it'll have your death date.
[time=187] But I want to point out, right there in the middle is this dash.
[time=190] And here's the question I want to ask you today.
[time=192] What will I do with my dash?
[time=194] That's the question we want to explore when we're looking at God's challenge to finish well.
[time=199] How do we live in the dash in such a way that we will honor God?
[time=203] And today I want to give you two dash decisions that are ultimately going to define your legacy.
[time=208] And we see those in the story of Gideon in a lot of ways, in most ways, the what not to do version.
[time=213] But I want us to look at two dash defining decisions that will really ultimately build your legacy.
[time=219] Number one is your worship.
[time=222] This comes from Judges 8 verses 22 through 27.
[time=226] And we see this picture of worship that's going on, or lack thereof, or worship that goes in the wrong direction as we'll look at in just a moment.
[time=234] So write that down to these dash decisions we've got to make.
[time=237] Your worship is number one.
[time=239] Judges 8 will read verse 22 all the way through verse 27.
[time=242] You ready for the word today, Black Hawk?
[time=244] Let's dig in.
[time=245] Verse 22, this is following the brutal killing of the Midianite kings, the victory that had come, and all the personal revenge that Gideon has pursued.
[time=253] Pride has sunk in, and we'll see a continuation, unfortunately, in this non-fairy tale ending starting in verse 22.
[time=259] This says, "Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, rule over us, and you and your son, and your grandson also, for you have saved us."
[time=268] Underland the word, "you," is an important word.
[time=271] "You have saved us from the hand of Midian." Verse 23, Gideon said to them, "I will not rule over you, my son, and my son will not rule over you.
[time=280] The Lord will rule over you." And Gideon said to them, "Let me make a request of you." And I wouldn't start the word though, though, and he says, "Every one of you give me the earrings from his spoil, from these victories and battles, for they had golden earrings because they were Ishmaelites."
[time=297] Verse 25, "And they answered, 'We will willingly give them, and they spread a cloak, and every man threw in it the earrings of his spoil, and the weight of the golden earrings he requested was 1700 shekels of gold, besides the crescent ornaments, and the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian, and besides the collars that were around the necks of their camels."
[time=320] Verse 27, "And Gideon made an Ephod of it, and put it in his city, Ophra, and all Israel hoored after it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and to his family."
[time=336] And again, in chapter 8 we go, "Ooh, that's a lot to unpack, but let's unpack that together because it all has to do with our worship, which is going to define the legacy that we live, and when we talk of worship, here's how I would describe it to you.
[time=349] First of all, you need to know you are a worshipper, you are a worshipper, and worship is not just a song you sing, it's a life you live.
[time=357] Here's how I know, you say, "Well, I'm not religious, I don't really pursue faith, you worship." We all worship because here's what worship is, is you could define it, "Worship, worship."
[time=367] It's where you ascribe worth, it's where you put weight, it's what you put your values towards, it's what you value the most, it's the weight that you lean into and prioritize in your life.
[time=378] This could be a career, this could be your kids, this could be a relationship, this could be so many different things, your path to success.
[time=386] I don't know what it is that you put the most weight into, what you lean into the most, what you value the most, but whatever it is, you worship it.
[time=395] We are all worshippers, we are created to worship, but sometimes our worship goes in all kinds of directions, it doesn't need to go and Gideon's story unfortunately is a picture of that.
[time=405] Let's go through a few of these verses, starting in verse 22, what we just read.
[time=409] We'll go verse by verse through this as we've been doing, and in verse 22 Gideon has really offered this dynastic rule, meaning it's a dynasty kind of kingship, where he would be king, his son would be king, his grandson, and it would get passed down from generation to generation.
[time=423] And you know, we've got to be honest, if a nation offered you that, you'd be kind of like, "Yes, right, I deserve that."
[time=431] And unfortunately, that's a little bit of where Gideon is, but he theologically knows that Israel is God's people, and that God is the ruler of those people.
[time=440] He is to be king, not a person, and so he does theologically know the correct answers, but it feels kind of good, and the segue part of verse 22 that we've got to underline, and I challenge you to do so, is the word to you.
[time=452] They say to Gideon, "You have saved us from the hand of Gideon."
[time=458] I don't know about you, but everything else I've read in Judges 6 and 7 makes it really abundantly clear that Yahweh, the Lord is God, that Yahweh, the God of all guys, the king of kings, the creator of the universe, that God was to deliver his people from the hand of the Midianites.
[time=474] But now we're shifting in the nation of Israel saying, "You, Gideon," remember in chapter 7 they said, "We do this for the Lord, and for Gideon."
[time=482] And then now Gideon has delivered us from the hand of the Midianites. Do you not remember Gideon in chapter 6?
[time=488] They must have forgotten, but he's been the leader that has delivered them, and here's what Gideon does.
[time=494] He does something right, and he does something wrong. He does something right because he theologically knows that he's got to refuse that, that the Lord is to be king.
[time=500] He's to be the rule. So verse 23, that's what he does. He says, "No, no, no. We're not doing that. We're not doing that. The Lord is king."
[time=507] But you know what he doesn't do? The omission here is he didn't correct them for saying, "And you have delivered us from the hand of the Midian."
[time=514] Because it's kind of like, did all right.
[time=519] Yeah, we'll just leave that part alone. And he leaves that alone and it slips him into the slippery slope that we move into now.
[time=525] He doesn't correct them. And then verse 24, he kind of wants to get paid too.
[time=529] It's okay to skim a little off the top of the Lord's work that I just got credit for, right?
[time=534] And so he says, "But you know what? I'm not going to be king, so I'll do that right because theologically I know the right thing to do.
[time=539] But then I'm going to kind of contradict that with my actions. I'm glad I never do that, aren't you?
[time=543] But don't we? Oh, Gideon does that too. And then he starts acting like a king and even doing some of the modes of a king like taxation and saying,
[time=550] "Hey, let me skim a little off the top. It won't hurt you guys. Give me the earrings." It's like I've got some plans for them. And certainly all those plans are for everybody else and not for him, but here's the thing.
[time=559] No other judge before Gideon and no other judge after Gideon is recorded as taking part of the punder or the spoils of the war and the victories that God had given to his people.
[time=572] But Gideon does that. And what does he do with it? That's what we're going to dig into now.
[time=575] But before we get into what he does with him, support it to note that he theologically did the right thing.
[time=581] Theologically meaning about God, the things concerning God, he knew the right thing, yet his actions did not line up.
[time=591] He refused the kingship, but he did not let his life match. And for us, it looks something like this.
[time=596] For us, you can have correct theology. Sorry to burst your bubble, but still live as a hypocrite. Can I get a day, man?
[time=604] Because sometimes we get so much more consumed with being right, winning an argument, saying the right things, but my friends, Jesus has called us not just to talk about what he said, but to do what he did.
[time=619] Because we don't have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with us in our weaknesses. Instead, he's walked where we have walked, yet he's done it without sin.
[time=627] He didn't just tell us a message, he gave us a model, but so many times we get so consumed with being theologically correct, and doctrine matters, and it will always matter.
[time=637] But it does not take the root that Jesus came to plant it to take when we don't allow our actions to live out what we say we believe.
[time=646] We can be theologically correct, yet let our lives have nothing to do with that correct theology.
[time=652] May it not be said of us. May we look like the Jesus who has called us, not because of our effort. What's the name of this series again?
[time=660] Say it. It adequate me. I'm not adequate. I can't, but it's his strength through me.
[time=667] And I'm so thankful that he gives us that opportunity. Being right and living right, those are two totally different things.
[time=674] It's one thing to be right, it's another thing to live it out, and what Gideon did is the opposite of worship.
[time=681] Verses 25 and 26 show us what he did with this act of worship that went the wrong direction.
[time=686] He said the right thing, but then he pursued the benefits and taxation of a king, and they get 1700 shekels of gold.
[time=693] Now that is about approximately 43 pounds of gold, so pretty significant, pretty big offering here that turns into Verses 26 what we'll see is this e5.
[time=704] But I told you last week in verse 21 there was this crescent ornaments.
[time=708] I found this interesting. You can do your own research here. I won't spend a lot of time here.
[time=712] But when researching this, it's just interesting to see little turns of worship that turn into centuries and centuries of turning away from God.
[time=720] And these crescent ornaments to this day, the crescent is a moon.
[time=724] A crescent moon symbol is a symbol of Islam and of Allah.
[time=728] And as we look at the history of that in Islam, their apologetics will refute a lot of these histories.
[time=734] And so as you look at it though, what I found is that throughout history, we will find that people like the Midianites and Arab nations from centuries past, including though the Midianites.
[time=744] This story would take this crescent moon shape and they would use it as a symbol of worship of the moon God, also at times in history known as Allah.
[time=754] And today we still see that shape of worship taking place through the lens of Islam.
[time=760] And my point is not to hate on anybody else, but to point to the fact that listen when we go down roads of false worship, when we miss the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords, the way, the truth and the life who is none other than Jesus Christ.
[time=773] You can see centuries and generations of impact.
[time=777] And through this story, we today still see the trickling of impact of nations that turned away from God.
[time=784] So may it never be said of us church.
[time=787] Verse 27, we see what he did.
[time=789] He made this vest.
[time=790] It's an Ephod.
[time=791] And in Exodus chapter 28, you see the description of an Ephod.
[time=795] It's a high priestly kind of vest.
[time=797] That's what he turned it into.
[time=798] It will be made of gold and as all the Exodus 28, if you're interested and you want to see the history of all of it, you see all of the details, the ornate details.
[time=806] It would be like a vest that someone would put on, but Gideon had this Ephod made.
[time=810] And really Gideon is veering off the path.
[time=812] He didn't have religious authority to do that.
[time=814] He's not a Levite.
[time=815] He's not in the priesthood during this time.
[time=817] It was actually inappropriate for him to have done that to begin with anyway.
[time=821] But he takes that authority because again, hey, I'm offered the kingship.
[time=824] I'm saying no, but I'm going to act like one.
[time=826] That's just like what we do in life.
[time=828] And that's what Gideon is doing.
[time=830] So he makes this Ephod and he sends it to his own home so that it and ultimately him could be revered.
[time=837] And as he goes home, we'll look at that more in a minute.
[time=839] This Ephod verse 27 became a snare, a snare to his household, a Gideon's family and ultimately to the nation of Israel, the people of God.
[time=848] And that word snare literally means a lure, like a fishing lure, a lure or a trap.
[time=854] So what Ephods, lures and traps is the enemy using to take your worship off course.
[time=860] I love Tim Keller's definition of idolatry.
[time=863] That's where you're worshiping these false gods.
[time=865] He says that idolatry is when good things become ultimate things.
[time=868] And so what good things?
[time=870] Nothing wrong with gold, right?
[time=872] Nothing wrong with these priestly Exodus 28 kind of things.
[time=875] But when you turn it into something that doesn't honor the Lord, the good thing becomes an ultimate thing.
[time=880] And it takes over the same is true in our own lives, our schedules, our families, our sports, our you name it.
[time=887] There's so many things that are not bad in and of themselves that become ultimate things and therefore we become idolatrous just like the nation of Israel.
[time=896] And it also affects unity does your worship.
[time=898] Did you know that?
[time=899] I talk about church unity in a world that so divided Francis Chan wrote a book called Until Unity.
[time=904] And here's what he said, check this out.
[time=906] He said our lack of praise may actually be the biggest cause of our divisions.
[time=910] Once we stop worshiping, all hope for unity is lost.
[time=915] This is what unites us.
[time=916] We can't stop talking about the treasure we have in Jesus.
[time=922] I want to be known for that.
[time=924] And I just won't stop talking about what I want to be known for.
[time=927] I want to be known for a God that wouldn't shut up about Jesus.
[time=930] All of his life and that kind of a focus will unify the church of God together in a world that is so divided.
[time=938] So may we not let our worship veer off course.
[time=940] And when I look at today's culture, here's what I noticed.
[time=942] I think self worship in today's culture is one of the greatest forms of idolatry.
[time=947] Do you know you can worship yourself?
[time=949] Some of you did it this morning.
[time=951] You didn't even know.
[time=952] Self worship, where it's all about whatever pleases me and whatever I can get out of this and whatever makes the most sense for me and my life and my family.
[time=962] Well, what about saying God the answer is yes.
[time=964] Now, what's the question?
[time=966] What about God?
[time=967] Here's my blank check.
[time=968] That's what Gideon started with in some ways.
[time=971] There are all his fears and doubts, but it's not where we land things together.
[time=975] And I told you Exodus 28 was where the E5 used to see these descriptions of that.
[time=979] But four chapters later is Exodus 32, and that is the story.
[time=982] It's just like this story in Gideon's timeline in Judges 8, where Aaron builds the golden calf.
[time=988] This is Exodus 32.
[time=989] Moses has gone off into the mountainside, and as Moses is there, they start to look elsewhere other than God.
[time=996] When God felt silent, which by the way, those are prime times where the enemy will strike and get you distracted and your worship will veer off course, two to three similarities there.
[time=1004] That's one of them.
[time=1005] Another is that they had just come off of a big victory.
[time=1008] Gideon's story, they've just come off of Judges 7 where the Midianites are defeated.
[time=1012] The kings are dead, all of these things.
[time=1014] In Exodus 32, God has done miracles, and he's delivered the people of God the same nation different times, same people, same miracles, same God, and unfortunately same idolatry.
[time=1024] And they build a golden calf, and they worship it.
[time=1027] Just like in this story, they worship this golden E5.
[time=1030] They were longing for God, but they were reaching for gold.
[time=1035] And I think we do the same thing sometimes.
[time=1038] They reached out and worshiped this tangible shape instead of the intangible source of life.
[time=1044] And so their worship, that's number one, got off course.
[time=1047] Number two, this is a dash defining decision is your witness, your witness.
[time=1051] This is in verses 28 through 35, this is the end of our series where we see the witness of Gideon coming to fruition.
[time=1058] We see the legacy that he's leaving through the dash that he defines.
[time=1063] And it starts with verse 28, and verse 28 really is where coming off of chapter 7, we should have just done verse 28, and that could have been it.
[time=1070] But instead we had all these other things at play, the flaws and inadequacies of Gideon and others.
[time=1075] But verse 28 says this, let's start there, and then we'll go into what happens through the death of Gideon.
[time=1080] Verse 28, "So Midian was subdued before the people of Israel, and they raised their heads no more.
[time=1086] And the land had rest, forty years in the days of Gideon." And don't miss that verse nestled into all the inadequacies and flaws and sins.
[time=1093] We'll come back there in a minute. Let's go to verse 29.
[time=1095] Jerabel, which is again Gideon here, "The son of Joash went and lived in his own house." Now Gideon had 70 sons, that's a bunch of kids, y'all.
[time=1104] I can't even keep up with my three.
[time=1106] And that's just sons, by the way, you noticed that, yeah.
[time=1109] Now Gideon had 70 sons, his own offspring, if he had many wives, I can only keep up with one of those two, by the way.
[time=1115] She's in here, so I've got to be careful.
[time=1117] Verse 31.
[time=1118] "And his concubine," these were second wives of second class nature and their kids didn't even get the rights of the rest of the household.
[time=1125] Just quite an interesting setup here.
[time=1127] "And his concubine, who was in Shechem, also bore him a son, and he called his name Abimalak." We'll come back there in a moment.
[time=1133] Verse 32, "And Gideon, the son of Joash, died in a good old age and was buried in the tomb of Joash, his father at Ophra of the Abia's rights."
[time=1141] As soon as Gideon died, the people of Israel turned again and hoored after the bales and made bale bereath their God.
[time=1148] And the people of Israel did not remember the Lord their God, who had delivered them from the hand of all their enemies on every side.
[time=1155] And they did not show steadfast love to the family of Jerabelle that is Gideon in return for all the good he had done to Israel.
[time=1165] And there's your happily ever after, the end.
[time=1170] And thankfully it's not the end, because the witness of Gideon, and our witnesses we're going to talk about in a minute, but a witness, or I think of that word, I think of a witness stand.
[time=1178] I think of the courtroom, a witness comes on to stand, and what do they do?
[time=1181] They tell about what they saw, they tell about the fact that they saw and witnessed these things, and now they're a witness to that effect.
[time=1189] And so as we think of that, I challenge you to think of what you worship, now leading into what you've witnessed, because when we worship the God of God, the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords who is Jesus, we are called to be a witness.
[time=1201] We are called to be a witness of what we have seen and who we have experienced in Jesus Christ.
[time=1207] And that is what Gideon unfortunately does not do in so many ways, but it is what we are called to do.
[time=1212] And in verse 28, what we see here in verse 28 is that God was faithful.
[time=1218] Don't miss verse 28. When I read this story, this verse 28 just nestled in between all the idolatry and the prostitution
[time=1225] and all this stuff that was going, it's horrible, horrible list of sinful behavior, but there's verse 28.
[time=1231] And God saw all of this, and I just want to tell you all something. It's a good thing I'm not God.
[time=1237] Because if I was God in this instance, I'd be like, okay, that's how you want to roll?
[time=1241] Well, you just go do your own little thing there, big boy.
[time=1244] And I would just leave you beat, but God doesn't do that because God is faithful even when we are faithless.
[time=1250] 2 Timothy chapter 2 and verse 13, I shared it with you last week.
[time=1253] If we are faithless, he remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself.
[time=1258] God saw all of these horrible things going on, but he kept his promises to his people,
[time=1264] and he still delivered them from the hand of Gideon, and there was at least what they called rest here in Scripture politically and military wise for 40 years. Why? Not because of these knuckleheads, because God is a promise keeping way making light in the darkness kind of God.
[time=1281] That's what we get to be witnesses to even in the midst of this horrible ending of a non-fairy tale ending,
[time=1287] non-heavily, happily ever after story.
[time=1290] It's a good thing that God's faithful to this story.
[time=1293] We would not really want to gather and hear anything about it today. Can I get a name, man?
[time=1297] Verse 29 and 30, though we see that Gideon goes home, kind of maybe to at least outwardly deny the kingship.
[time=1303] I'm just going home, but he takes this E5 there with him and they worship it.
[time=1307] And he becomes a hypocrite, really, because what he does is he follows practices of monarchs and kings,
[time=1313] even though he had just denied to become one.
[time=1316] He just said I'm not doing it, but then he starts doing all these things spiritually.
[time=1319] He leads them into, first of all, he's not the religious leader, he's not the church, he's leading the nation of Israel into syncretism or this multiplicity of gods where you worship multiple gods all at one time.
[time=1331] Morally, I mean, do we need to go any further? He's got 70 signs, he's got all these concubines, and he's just morally showing everything, but I believe what God would have him to do.
[time=1340] He has a, first of all, to afford that, a king's harem like that.
[time=1344] I mean, good grief. What a mess of moral example that we see going on.
[time=1349] And in verse 31, I think it's the height of hypocrisy.
[time=1353] Verse 31, you say, why? He just had a son and he named him Abimelech.
[time=1357] You remember, this is the Gideon who said I won't be king. My sons won't be king, their sons won't be king.
[time=1362] I'm not going to do it, the Lord is king, he will rule over you.
[time=1364] Well, he names his son through one of his concubines, Abimelech.
[time=1368] You ready for this? The word Abimelech, the name Abimelech means my father is king.
[time=1374] Hypocrisy much, but no laugh at Gideon because we do the same stuff.
[time=1380] What happens here is Gideon's public pronouncements did not match his private practice.
[time=1386] And the same thing happens in our lives too.
[time=1389] And in verse 32 Gideon died and was buried there in his hometown.
[time=1392] I'm going to go back to our question, our question that I asked you, the question of the week is when I am gone, I hope I am remembered as blank.
[time=1400] When I am gone, I hope I am remembered as what?
[time=1404] I'll go back to that. Let's look at a few responses we had online, maybe some of you.
[time=1408] Wow, you guys flooded us today. This is awesome.
[time=1411] Can't read all of them, but let me go through a few.
[time=1414] Caleb says, I want to be remembered as a good and God-fearing man.
[time=1418] Anna says, someone who showed Jesus through her struggles.
[time=1421] Man, I love that. I love you too.
[time=1423] Anna, Erica, I want to be remembered as a loving and caring woman after God's own heart.
[time=1427] Brittany, Godly, Katie, fateful, Sam, someone who brings joy to people.
[time=1433] Sarah, a good wife, friend and mother.
[time=1435] Jamie being kind to all.
[time=1437] Rick, an imperfect example of Jesus worth following.
[time=1441] I love that. Rachel, kind, generous and selfless as a reflection of Jesus.
[time=1445] Marr, a good woman. Craig, I'd love to be remembered as an all-around good person.
[time=1449] He was a good guy. Erica, a loving, caring woman.
[time=1452] The list goes on. I so agree.
[time=1454] I want to be remembered as these things as well.
[time=1456] And as we think of those things today, I want to remind you that it, that your legacy, that blank, the dash, it all goes back to.
[time=1465] It all goes back to every little decision.
[time=1467] Your legacy will be the sum total of all these small decisions of what you decide to do with your dash.
[time=1472] I'd say it to you this way that today's decisions become tomorrow's destinations.
[time=1476] So let's make some good decisions.
[time=1478] Let's make some godly decisions with our worship and with our witness.
[time=1482] And it's why Paul said it this way in 1 Corinthians chapter 10 and verse 31.
[time=1486] Paul tells us that whatever you do, whatever you eat or drink, whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
[time=1494] Do all to the glory of God.
[time=1496] So if you write anything down in your notes, don't miss this statement right here.
[time=1500] The statement is simply that God honoring worship will always generate Christ-like witness.
[time=1505] Your worship and your witness go together.
[time=1507] If you live a life of worship that honors God and you focus on Him when everything is going awry in your world,
[time=1514] then it's going to generate a witness that looks like Jesus.
[time=1517] And those legacy things that you all pointed out, that I pointed out, they'll become realities not because you're adequate.
[time=1523] You're all inadequate.
[time=1524] But Jesus is adequate.
[time=1526] His strength is enough.
[time=1527] His grace is sufficient for us.
[time=1531] And if you missed all of that, I want to give you a couple of pictures of it here.
[time=1535] We'll paint it together.
[time=1537] But starting in verse 33, we see that as Gideon died here, Israel turned and they worshiped.
[time=1542] Bail, barif.
[time=1543] And that word literally just means a covenant with Baal.
[time=1546] And then the beginning of the story, you notice that Gideon was this picture of a champion.
[time=1551] God's champion against Baal.
[time=1553] His name was Jerubel, which means Baal, contend, let him take care of his own business.
[time=1557] And then he followed the Lord and the Lord took care of Baal and the Lord wanted all of these victories.
[time=1561] So he goes, he starts well, but he doesn't finish well.
[time=1564] Because the same Gideon, who was a champion against Baal in the beginning of the story, now becomes a champion of just go to Baal, go wherever you would like, for your worship.
[time=1575] And let your witness be squandered.
[time=1578] And in chapter 9, we see a picture of some of that, how Jerubel becomes the only way that Gideon's referred to.
[time=1583] And then Abimelech is in chapter 9.
[time=1585] And God is no longer in chapter 9 referred to as Yahweh.
[time=1588] It's a more generic term for God that comes in chapter 9.
[time=1591] We just veer off the course with our witness, with our worship, and then our witness follows.
[time=1596] And as we look at that, I'm reminded of our cycle.
[time=1599] Remember the judge's cycle?
[time=1601] If this was week one, if you missed this, you call it back up.
[time=1603] It's rebellion.
[time=1604] And then we see, uh-oh, there's results to our rebellion.
[time=1607] And then we have repentance.
[time=1609] We turn away from that, we turn back to God, and God brings restoration through his grace and mercy.
[time=1613] And then there's a time of rest, just like in this passage.
[time=1615] And then what did I tell you to say last time?
[time=1618] Repeat.
[time=1619] So let's say them together.
[time=1620] The rebellion.
[time=1621] Result.
[time=1622] Repentance.
[time=1623] Restoration.
[time=1624] Rest.
[time=1625] Repeat.
[time=1626] And is that not just judges?
[time=1628] That is us too.
[time=1629] That is the history of mankind because we are flawed and inadequate and sinful.
[time=1634] And if this doesn't catch your attention, if this doesn't make sense to you, I want to point you now to a video that's been going viral on social media.
[time=1641] And I think maybe you can relate.
[time=1643] Check this video out because I think this is us.
[time=1647] And my friends is a sheep.
[time=1649] And you thought you were having a bad day.
[time=1655] I'm going to have you came today and you're kind of in the ditch.
[time=1658] Well, glad God shows up just like this little fella.
[time=1669] Out.
[time=1674] And yes, Jesus has freed me.
[time=1676] I'm running in my freedom.
[time=1681] This is Jesus leaving the 99 for the one.
[time=1687] And I'm the one.
[time=1689] And I run through my cycle and I end up right back in the ditch.
[time=1693] Yes.
[time=1694] Splat.
[time=1695] Right back into the ditch that I go.
[time=1699] Cycle personified.
[time=1700] Can I get a name in?
[time=1701] All right.
[time=1702] That's where we are.
[time=1703] That's who God redeems.
[time=1705] As we go through the rest of this story, verses 34 and 35, ties it all together.
[time=1709] What we see in those verses is they forgot God's faithfulness, but they also forgot the family of Gideon.
[time=1715] They forgot both, verses 34 and 35.
[time=1717] And in Judges chapter 7, verses 18 and 20, they said, "For the Lord and for Gideon." And now they've forgotten the Lord and they've forgotten Gideon.
[time=1727] They're the sheep in the ditch.
[time=1729] So am I.
[time=1730] Look at your neighbors.
[time=1731] They say, "So are you." All are in the ditch together today.
[time=1736] And as depressing as this story is, I'm so thankful that it wasn't the end of Israel's story.
[time=1741] It wasn't the end of my story.
[time=1743] It wasn't the end of the people of God, children of God and our story together.
[time=1746] Because Hebrews chapter 11 is the hall of fame of faith and Gideon's name is listed there, even though he has all these inadequacies and all these flaws and all these sins.
[time=1755] Hebrews chapter 11 starting in verse 32 says, "And what more shall I say, for time would fail me to tell of Gideon."
[time=1762] Barack, Samson, Jephthah, and David, and Samuel, and the prophets who through faith conquered
[time=1769] kingdoms and forced justice obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the power
[time=1775] of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, we're made strong, I love this, we're made strong out of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight.
[time=1787] And church, I believe, with all of my heart, one of the great reminders of this series, inadequate me, can be this, that as we look at that passage, as we look at the fact that God loves us so much in all these inadequacies, his grace is bigger than our gaps.
[time=1802] I don't know how you started.
[time=1804] You may have started really poorly, but you can finish well in Jesus' name.
[time=1810] Today is a new day.
[time=1812] His mercies are new every single morning.
[time=1815] I don't know how flawed you've been or what skeletons are in your closet, but I do know his grace is sufficient.
[time=1820] I do know that his grace is bigger than our gaps.
[time=1823] Even when we're the mess that we are, the inadequate me, that is.
[time=1827] God's grace is bigger than our gaps.
[time=1830] So I go back to our original question, that blank that we've been working to fill in, and now I make this question personalized.
[time=1835] What is God asking me to do with my dash?
[time=1838] That's the question I want to ask you to take home with you this week.
[time=1841] What is God asking me to do with my dash?
[time=1843] Let's start with your worship, let it move into your witness, and let God consume the dash that you're living in the midst of now, because it is leaving a mark.
[time=1851] And I believe in Jesus' name.
[time=1853] Even if you started well, you're finishing poorly, you can go back and start again.
[time=1858] If you started poorly, you can finish well in Jesus' name, not through your strength, because we're the inadequate me that is getting in, but through the strength of the Holy Spirit, through the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1870] Can I get a name, man?
[time=1872] Buy your heads with me, close your eyes.
[time=1874] Believers ask, what is that step?
[time=1875] What can I do with my worship?
[time=1877] What can I do with my witness that would leave a mark through the dash that I'm pursuing right now?
[time=1883] As believers are praying, some of you right now, you're watching us online, you're in the room, and you know that the Holy Spirit is drawing you right now to salvation.
[time=1890] You realize you have fallen so short, and your sin has separated you from God.
[time=1894] But God's grace is enough for those gaps.
[time=1896] And Jesus came and lived the sinless life that you could never live.
[time=1900] He did that to pay a price you could never pay.
[time=1902] He was a perfect sacrifice for all of us sheep that have jumped right back into the ditch, time and time again, over and over and over again.
[time=1912] He meets us there.
[time=1913] He didn't just die on that cross.
[time=1915] He rose from the dead, and in so doing he defeated death, he defeated hell, he defeated the grave, and he holds the keys to victory in all of eternity.
[time=1924] And he invites you to become his kids today.
[time=1926] It's not about a perfect prayer.
[time=1928] It's about the condition of your heart.
[time=1930] It's about you asking him to forgive you, and to save you today.
[time=1933] To trust in him for salvation.
[time=1935] Not your good works.
[time=1936] We're saved by grace, through faith, not of work.
[time=1939] So then we would end up boasting about it.
[time=1941] And let's don't do it that way.
[time=1943] Let's trust in Jesus, Jesus alone.
[time=1945] In your own words, would you cry out to him right now in this moment of pause?
