[time=0] I want to share with you today about a vision of ambassadors.
[time=3] A vision of ambassadors.
[time=5] And you've got your Bibles, and just a few minutes will be in Second Corinthians chapter number five.
[time=10] Second Corinthians five versus 14 through 21.
[time=13] A vision of ambassadors.
[time=14] And today, I'll start with this question.
[time=16] Many of you have already engaged in it, perhaps.
[time=18] And it is this, that vision matters because.
[time=21] This is our question of the week.
[time=22] Vision matters because what?
[time=24] Why does vision matter?
[time=27] And you can write in the chats and any of our online platforms there.
[time=30] Your answer to that question, as Curtis and Christian have shared with you about that today.
[time=34] You can join even in the room.
[time=35] And especially those of you who are already on a screen.
[time=38] Help me preach a little later.
[time=39] I'll share a little bit about that answer a little later in today's message.
[time=43] But that is a great segue into why we're here.
[time=45] This is us.
[time=46] We kind of take a pause every year, and we look at the mission and vision of God's church.
[time=50] And then we build on that with a strategy that we have adopted here at Black Hawk, which is gather, connect, and go.
[time=56] So for four weeks, we'll start today with a mission and vision of God's church.
[time=59] We'll look at gather.
[time=60] We'll look at connect.
[time=61] And we'll look at go because those are all Jesus' ideas.
[time=64] And I think it's a good thing when we just do things Jesus' way.
[time=68] Can I get a name in?
[time=69] Today I want to share with you that God, listen, God has a vision and a mission for His church.
[time=75] And that means God has a mission and a vision for you because we are God's church.
[time=82] So be encouraged today to know that.
[time=83] And just before Jesus ascended after defeating death hell and the grave, by dying that brutal death on the cross, He rose from the dead, and He spent time appearing to people.
[time=92] And I'm so glad that we can know through eyewitness account that Jesus has risen.
[time=96] But before He went home to heaven, before He went to glory and ascended, He gave us a very clear set of marching orders.
[time=103] We call it the Great Commission.
[time=104] I was reading this last week, and I found it was a survey done of churchgoers.
[time=108] And it said that over 51% of today's churchgoers are not that familiar with certainly not the content, but even the phrase, the statement, the Great Commission, the term Great Commission.
[time=120] Not so at Black Hawk.
[time=122] Now today we know what it is.
[time=123] Let's say it together on three, say Great Commission.
[time=125] One, two, three, Great Commission.
[time=128] It's great, it's a commission, but it's the commission.
[time=131] And it's the marching orders for God's church.
[time=133] Jesus said it this way, Matthew chapter 28, verses 19 and 20.
[time=137] Jesus said, go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son.
[time=145] And of the Holy Spirit.
[time=147] Teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.
[time=151] And behold, I am with you even to the end of the age.
[time=155] And aren't you glad of that?
[time=156] That's our Great Commission.
[time=157] And that's why our mission at Black Hawk is very simple.
[time=160] It is to make disciples, that make disciples, that make disciples, that make disciples, that make disciples, that, no, I'm not a broken record.
[time=168] This is what it turns into.
[time=170] We're called to make disciples.
[time=171] We believe Matthew 4, 19, the words of Jesus.
[time=174] He said, come follow me, I will make you fishers of men.
[time=178] Disciple of Jesus is someone following Jesus.
[time=180] Someone who's being changed by Jesus.
[time=183] And someone who's committed to the mission of Jesus.
[time=185] And so we want to be that ripple effect of making disciples.
[time=189] It's really that simple, but sometimes we knuckleheads that call ourselves the church, tend to make what is very simple in God's definition and book very complicated.
[time=199] So we're back to the basics today.
[time=201] You ready to go back to the basics with me?
[time=203] Here's how we go about that mission.
[time=204] We say it this way, it's our vision.
[time=206] Vision comes into your specific context of how you apply and live out that mission.
[time=210] And we call it Light the One Five.
[time=212] Light the One Five.
[time=214] Everybody say that with me.
[time=215] Light the One Five.
[time=216] And here's how what that looks like.
[time=217] It starts with scripture.
[time=218] John 1 chapter five is how we like to say it.
[time=221] John one five.
[time=222] And that simply says that the light shines in darkness.
[time=225] And the darkness has not overcome it.
[time=228] And we believe we are called to be that kind of light in a world that is filled with darkness based on the truth of God's word and his empowering, powerful Holy Spirit inside of us.
[time=237] We get to represent the light that is eternal in a temporary dark world.
[time=242] And so that is our vision of Light the One Five.
[time=244] But it's built on three premises, three distinct areas we say across our street among our city and around the world oftentimes.
[time=251] Starts in our own zip code.
[time=253] The 46815 zip code is where it all begins.
[time=256] This is where we are strategically and intentionally planted by God.
[time=259] This is our home base.
[time=261] This is us.
[time=262] This is where we start.
[time=263] But it doesn't start or stop there.
[time=266] It continues and branches out across our city, our nation, our state, our nation all the way around the world.
[time=271] It's the Acts one eight strategy, Jerusalem, Judea, Sumeria to the ends of the earth.
[time=275] What does that mean in simple terms, pastor?
[time=277] Glad you asked.
[time=278] Here, there, everywhere.
[time=280] That's what we're called to make disciples.
[time=281] But it starts across our streets in the 46815 zip code.
[time=286] And then it branches to our 15 surrounding zip codes.
[time=289] And we have a very strategic plan and vision for having life groups in the neighborhoods as many as possible in the 15 surrounding zip codes.
[time=298] And then some all across Indiana, it's 92 some counties that we have.
[time=303] But we want to start in these 15 surrounding zip codes.
[time=306] And so let me show you what that looks like.
[time=308] Here's Fort Wayne.
[time=309] The little black dot is us.
[time=311] This is us.
[time=312] Everybody say this is us.
[time=313] There we are.
[time=314] That's Blackhawk.
[time=315] And then here is our zip code along with the other 15 surrounding zip codes.
[time=319] And so here's where we are.
[time=320] These are our vision.
[time=321] This is the 46815 zip code.
[time=323] And then here's-- this is going to blow your mind.
[time=325] This is awesome.
[time=326] We did a study recently of where all of our people, where all of the Blackhawk family located, where we planted.
[time=333] And so we did a study of who's active participants, active members, giving, serving, being a part of our Blackhawk family.
[time=341] Where are we located?
[time=342] So how good of a start do we have?
[time=344] Wow.
[time=345] Not only are we in every one of the 15 zip codes surrounding the 46815, but let me get out of the way.
[time=351] We're over here.
[time=353] We're cutting some off.
[time=354] Let me zoom out a little further.
[time=355] Let's look at the United States.
[time=357] Look at us.
[time=359] We're all over the eastern part of the United States.
[time=361] And even in different places, it blows my mind.
[time=363] God has given us a great, big family to be a part of.
[time=367] And I'm glad to be a part of this amazing family.
[time=371] It starts in our zip code.
[time=373] It goes to these counties across our state, across our nation, and then globally.
[time=377] It's local and global.
[time=378] Back to these, the zip code, our surrounding zip codes, and then our 15 global regions.
[time=383] We've identified 15 regions in the world in which we want to plant churches, send missionaries, support ministries, let the gospel have its way and its impact and that we get to be a part of it, not just financially, but with going, with serving, with supporting, with resourcing, and all of the ways you can imagine every verb I can come up with.
[time=402] And that's a lot, 'cause I can come up with a lot of words.
[time=404] We want to do all of those words.
[time=406] And so here's our 15 regions.
[time=407] Let me show them to you.
[time=408] They're all color-coded for you.
[time=409] There's 15 of them.
[time=411] And it's amazing.
[time=412] We have a good start.
[time=413] We're in a lot of them.
[time=414] In fact, let me show you.
[time=415] Here is where we are, the little white specks.
[time=417] Can you see those?
[time=419] God is so good.
[time=420] Can you imagine being a part of a church where little old me, little old you, get to be a part of having this kind of a global impact?
[time=430] Well, imagine no further, we are.
[time=432] Not because you're good.
[time=433] Certainly not because your knucklehead pastor's any good, because God is good.
[time=438] He's given us an amazing opportunity.
[time=441] So there's your snapshot of our vision.
[time=443] And when we look at these, it's interesting.
[time=445] There's so many things.
[time=446] This is that thing I was telling you about, the annual report.
[time=448] One of my favorite things, you need to get this, by the way, blackhawk.fyi, hard copies at the desk today.
[time=453] On the back though, a few things stand out.
[time=454] We now support 41 missionaries or ministries locally and globally.
[time=460] I love this, this blew my mind.
[time=461] And not only do we give over $210,000 in a pandemic year to local and global missions, not only did $415,000 plus of our budget go to local and global missions this last year because of your generosity and God using us so greatly.
[time=476] Guess how many people groups that represents?
[time=479] Guess how many people groups we've been able to impact with the good news and the gospel of Jesus because of those things?
[time=485] Over 100 people groups.
[time=489] Don't tell me that the word of God that our Jesus, that his church is not alive and well, we get to be a part of just such a church.
[time=498] Can I get an amen?
[time=500] I love being a part of such a family.
[time=502] Those things are good.
[time=504] They're clear, that's kind of the what.
[time=505] Let me answer this question now, the how.
[time=507] So we say light the one five.
[time=509] We say make disciples that make disciples that make disciples that make disciples.
[time=512] How?
[time=513] What does that look like?
[time=514] You know, we like, well, I know it.
[time=515] Maybe I've heard that phrase, but what does that mean?
[time=517] How does that flesh out in our lives as people who are a part of God's church?
[time=522] And it really to me goes back to a seat for everyone.
[time=525] How many of you remember the red chair?
[time=527] I brought this baby out in the gym.
[time=530] How many of you are with me in the gym over there?
[time=532] Well, we were renovating in here.
[time=533] Literally, we set a seat for everyone and we said we want, I see you moments where people really enter the family of God and they accept Christ as their savior.
[time=541] And we talked about the red chair representing that person in your life that God wants to do a work and that God wants to send a picture of Jesus into their life and that picture would be you that we could make room, that there would be a seat for everyone.
[time=554] While we were in the gym, we literally were renovating in here.
[time=557] And if you look around, there's at least four or five different types of seats.
[time=561] And we did that on purpose.
[time=562] There's these seats, the pews.
[time=563] There's those, the cushy ones back there.
[time=565] Shout out to my platform, people back there.
[time=567] They came early and got those wonderful seats back there.
[time=569] We have a seat for everyone and we see a representation of visible, tangible, practical representation of different seats.
[time=577] But I got to make a confession to you.
[time=579] I'm gonna really work hard for a few minutes to make you feel really uncomfortable in those seats.
[time=586] And I'll explain why.
[time=587] So hang with me for a minute.
[time=587] I want to start with this question.
[time=588] When we say this phrase, a seat for everyone.
[time=592] I want to ask you, is there really a seat for everyone?
[time=594] In our church, in your life, is there really a seat?
[time=600] It sounds good and we can amen it all day, but is there really a seat for everyone?
[time=605] Could they really come?
[time=606] Here's a good gauge for that.
[time=608] Are you comfortable?
[time=609] Everybody say, it feels good?
[time=612] You're like, no, oh, I'll see where this is going.
[time=614] Are you comfortable?
[time=617] What would it look like if our church decided, you know what, this year, we're gonna get uncomfortable?
[time=623] We are gonna make sure that there's a seat for everyone knowing that we got to follow the methods of Jesus.
[time=629] Did you ever notice that Jesus kind of had a way of making people uncomfortable?
[time=633] He made people comfortable, it was so interesting that Jesus was always comfortable around sinners, but it's way more interesting to me that sinners were always comfortable around Jesus.
[time=642] He knew what it looked like to make a seat for everyone, but in the religious circle, raise your hand if you're in a religious circle today, if you're watching, you're hearing me.
[time=649] Sorry, that's you, that's me, that's us.
[time=651] The people in religious circles though, Jesus had this way of making them feel kind of uncomfortable.
[time=655] They would be in the seat kind of going.
[time=659] Squirming around, that's what some of you look like, by the way, you didn't think I saw you.
[time=663] But Jesus has this way, do you ever notice he would heal on the Sabbath a lot?
[time=666] I always wondered, well why wouldn't he just do it on Monday?
[time=669] 'Cause he certainly could, but he didn't because he knew he needed to stir the water.
[time=674] He knew he was gonna establish a new kingdom, he was gonna build on what had been, do something so much greater, and to do that, he was gonna have to make some people a little uncomfortable in your notes right down this way.
[time=685] If there's gonna be a seat for everyone, here's what we gotta know, there won't be a seat for everyone until we get uncomfortable in ours.
[time=693] God has called you, not to comfort.
[time=696] I think it was David Platt and his book "Radical" that said something along the lines of, to those of you wanting a safe, untroubled life free from danger, stay away from Jesus.
[time=706] He calls us to be uncomfortable, and so that's my goal today is to make us feel a little bit uncomfortable.
[time=713] This is not in your notes, but you should write this down.
[time=715] Did you know, my brothers and sisters, that there is no theology of comfort in the Bible?
[time=721] There's no theology of comfort in the Bible.
[time=725] Jesus did not give up his comfort in heaven to come to this earth so that we could have ours.
[time=732] He came to show us the way.
[time=735] He came to show us what it looks like to give up my comfort, my preferences, my opinions, to make an eternal difference in the lives of people dying and going to hell every single day.
[time=748] And that is what he's called us to do.
[time=750] And I'm excited about what that could look like.
[time=753] And so before I get there, are you uncomfortable?
[time=756] You sure?
[time=757] This is how I can preach longer on this if I need to.
[time=758] We've got to get uncomfortable with that in mind.
[time=761] Our leadership went on a vision retreat, and we got uncomfortable.
[time=764] We really just asked God, and we saw the face of God together.
[time=767] We took a whole weekend, and we just prayed, and we saw God's face, and his vision, and his direction.
[time=772] And God has given us something that I am so honored to be able to share with you, representing all of us, but mainly the God who gave it to us.
[time=778] And so in this vision retreat, here's what we came up with as we look towards our 60th anniversary in 2029, which is only eight years away.
[time=785] By the way, we just celebrated 50.
[time=787] We're looking to our 60th.
[time=788] So these next eight years, here's what we're praying for over our church.
[time=791] We're praying that our vision is to go beyond the Black Hawk bubble.
[time=796] Because that's what we do, by the way.
[time=798] We create a bubble, and Black Hawk, we're all guilty of it.
[time=800] We just kind of want to create it and just stay in it and not really go beyond it.
[time=803] But Jesus bursts bubbles, it's a comfort zone.
[time=806] So we want to go beyond the Black Hawk bubble by developing and sending 1500 ambassadors for Jesus across the one fives, that's local, and it's global, to reach people far from God, but close to us, far from God, but close to us by our 60th anniversary in 2029.
[time=827] I want to say that again.
[time=828] We want to go beyond our Black Hawk bubble, to develop and send 1500 ambassadors for Jesus across the one fives, across the one fives, here, there and everywhere, to reach people far from God, but close to us by our 60th anniversary.
[time=843] So we're gonna spend some time kind of unpacking this.
[time=845] And here's the thing, that vision, it looks pretty good on paper, right?
[time=849] But this vision is not a paper vision.
[time=850] This vision is a people vision.
[time=852] This vision requires participation from the people of God.
[time=856] And I wrote down a few of the things that we've been working on and we've been dreaming about as a team.
[time=860] We're also glad that in a world that seems to be so hunkered down right now, we have the hope of the world who is Jesus Christ.
[time=866] And because of that, we can dream of greater and better things.
[time=869] That's what our leadership did.
[time=870] And I'll read to you a list of some things that we dream about.
[time=873] We dream of expanding our influence and our zip code and beyond by being a church that burst the bubble of our comfort zone.
[time=879] We dream of having five new one five zip code partnerships in which we can deploy all of you to use your gifts by 2022.
[time=886] We dream of 75% of our weekly attendees being connected or maybe reconnected into what we call life groups.
[time=893] So you can have biblical community.
[time=895] We dream of 500 people taking their next step into the discipleship journey over these next 24 months.
[time=901] That's a pathway that we have created to help you take your next step of faith.
[time=905] We dream of an expanded influence beyond our one five bubble with this home base with two new campus and ministry outpost developed outside of our area by 2023.
[time=915] We dream of a church that has a heart for the city, this evidence by ambassadors who focus on those far from God just like Jesus did.
[time=923] We dream of a day where we're boldly as ambassadors sharing our faith with people so that thousands of people because of the ministry of Black Hawk ministry and our bold witness, they come to Christ.
[time=934] We dream of a day where we're not just baptizing here and there, we're not just baptizing on Sundays.
[time=939] We dream of a day where we're baptizing seven days a week because of ambassadors going out and being the light of Jesus in a world that's hopeless.
[time=947] We dream about those things.
[time=949] We you dream about those things with us.
[time=951] We be a part of what I envision as this tidal wave of ambassadors overtaking our zip code, overtaking our city, overtaking our state and our nation and our world for Jesus.
[time=963] We are a part not just of Black Hawk ministries but of the global church where we are his church.
[time=969] I wanna be a part of that, how about you?
[time=972] But that's gonna take some good ambassadors and that's what I want us to spend a few minutes on now.
[time=976] Let's look at this question now that we've looked at how.
[time=978] Let's look at why.
[time=980] Why?
[time=980] Why does that matter?
[time=981] Why's it gotta be that, Pastor?
[time=982] Why can't it be a little more cushy of a seat for me?
[time=985] Why can't it be a little bit more suited to my preferences?
[time=988] Why's it gotta be this?
[time=990] Why is this so important?
[time=992] Why is this so urgent?
[time=993] Why are you up there hooping and hollering and making a big deal over this?
[time=996] I'm glad you asked.
[time=997] Second Corinthians chapter five, Paul gives us a great example and look at why.
[time=1002] Let's start with verse 14, Second Corinthians chapter number five.
[time=1006] He says for the love of Christ controls us, controls us.
[time=1009] Love that word.
[time=1010] It also is translated compels us in some translations because we have concluded this, that one has died for all therefore all have died.
[time=1020] We lost that old stuff.
[time=1021] The temporary stuff that really doesn't matter.
[time=1023] We got something way better.
[time=1024] The love of Christ controls us.
[time=1026] He didn't say the government controls us.
[time=1028] Politics, yeah, I went there.
[time=1029] Politics controls us.
[time=1031] My problems control us.
[time=1033] My bubble and my comfort zone controls.
[time=1035] No, it's the love of Christ that controls us and compels us and drives us to what God has in store for us.
[time=1042] That's why last week's question of the week was about the end of our life.
[time=1045] We finished Gideon.
[time=1046] How many of you are here last week?
[time=1047] Where's your hand online too?
[time=1048] We see you there.
[time=1050] As we look at that question, it was when I am gone, I hope I am remembered as blank.
[time=1054] And we had a lot of great answers to that question.
[time=1057] I so enjoyed our time together looking at that last week.
[time=1060] And here's what I've learned.
[time=1061] Not just from last week, but from right now, from this vision, if we want to have a lasting eternal impact.
[time=1068] And I know you do.
[time=1068] That's why you're listening today.
[time=1070] You want to focus on the eternal over the earthly.
[time=1072] And if we want that in our life, it's not going to happen unless we prioritize the eternal over the earthly.
[time=1079] It's not going to happen if we build a bubble and build walls around our comfort zone and make sure we build the best life I can possibly have over saying, God, yes is my answer.
[time=1088] Now what is the question?
[time=1090] God, I'll do whatever it is you want me to do, even if it makes me uncomfortable.
[time=1094] And that's what God wants us to dig into.
[time=1096] So the world has plenty of agendas.
[time=1099] Have you been on social media lately?
[time=1101] If you haven't, check it out.
[time=1103] You'll see plenty of personal agendas.
[time=1105] You'll see plenty of things that are self-focused in the world, but not us in Jesus' name.
[time=1111] We're going to focus on his agenda and his vision and his mission, no matter how uncomfortable that may make us.
[time=1118] Why?
[time=1118] Because eternity is at stake.
[time=1121] Verse number 15, and I've got to tell you, I'm going to get to preaching here.
[time=1124] Am I right, sweat, it just makes me excited.
[time=1126] Verse 15 is a perfect one-five verse for us.
[time=1130] It's a perfect verse about our one-five, light the one-five vision.
[time=1134] Here's what Paul writes.
[time=1135] He says, and he died for all that those who live may no longer live for themselves, but for him who for their sake died and was raised.
[time=1147] Since the love of Christ controls me and compels me, I don't live for me anymore.
[time=1153] The me I used to live for is way too small a thing to live for now.
[time=1158] I want to live for him.
[time=1159] I want to live for something that's bigger than me.
[time=1162] I want my impact and my legacy to last way beyond the little me that I am.
[time=1167] I want that this is us for the church to be way bigger of an impact than any of us can do alone.
[time=1172] We want the Holy Spirit power and fire of God to reign on and through us into the world that it just lights up people's lives all around us, collectively as a family.
[time=1183] But it takes us bursting the bubble.
[time=1186] It's a good one-five verse, but it's a good one-five verse because it bursts our bubble.
[time=1191] It takes us outside of what is comfortable, outside of the black car bubble that we often build and say, you know what, I don't live for me anymore.
[time=1199] I want to live for him and in living for him, I got to live for them.
[time=1203] And that is not always an easy task.
[time=1206] And I thank God that he's called us into that together.
[time=1209] And this vision of going behind the bubble makes me think of the apostle Paul's further writing to the church at Philippi.
[time=1215] Chapter two, verse three, here's what Paul says, "Do nothing from rivalry or conceit, "but in humility, count others as more significant "than yourselves." That means I value relationships more than I value being right.
[time=1229] That means we sacrifice doctrine.
[time=1230] That doesn't mean we sacrifice and compromise truth.
[time=1232] It's because of that doctrine and because of that truth that I now put myself last, because I know the truth is I'm a wretched sinner, but Jesus has met me in my sinfulness and he saved me by his grace and through my faith in him and him alone.
[time=1246] And because of that, I put myself last.
[time=1250] I want to be great by being last.
[time=1252] I want to be the servant of all just like Jesus was.
[time=1256] And here's how you could write it down today is that where there is no kingdom vision or you think beyond me, I rarely see beyond me, there's no kingdom vision where I don't think of eternal things, I rarely see beyond my bubble, rarely see beyond what impacts and affects me.
[time=1273] That's just a normal course of life for us.
[time=1275] But when I live for him, verse 15, I see beyond me to the needs of other people.
[time=1280] And so with that in mind, let's talk about that vision because that is God's vision.
[time=1284] Here's our question again.
[time=1285] When we look at the question of the week, vision matters because, let's see what some of you say.
[time=1294] Oh, wow, you guys really tuned in this week.
[time=1296] This is awesome.
[time=1298] All right, so here we go.
[time=1299] Vision matters because it gives people a hope for a better time.
[time=1302] Amen to that.
[time=1303] Even when the circumstances, Rachel, this is Rachel, even when the circumstances feel like it will not come.
[time=1310] And then through the never ending grace, love and compassion of Christ, the vision and hope can become a beautiful reality that reflects the love, the mercy of our awesome Lord and Savior.
[time=1322] Joe, amen, amen.
[time=1324] I think she nailed it.
[time=1325] Joe says, so you have goals to grow the kingdom.
[time=1329] And then we've got Tammy says, oh yeah, this is awesome.
[time=1332] This one was from our first service.
[time=1334] I don't know if they posted it again, but this is great.
[time=1335] Tammy's 13 year old child, okay, said this.
[time=1339] Vision matters so we don't trip from the mouth of a 13 year old.
[time=1347] I told you you guys are preaching.
[time=1348] We can close our Bibles and go home, but don't do that just yet.
[time=1351] Because here's what that means.
[time=1352] It means some of y'all are tripping.
[time=1354] Hashtag tripping.
[time=1356] We are tripping and following us because we don't have vision.
[time=1359] Vision matters.
[time=1360] I'll give you my version.
[time=1362] Because we trip, because sin has marred us.
[time=1365] Vision matters because God has a plan to redeem us and make us his own.
[time=1370] Vision matters because eternity matters.
[time=1373] Vision matters because God made a way for us to be his family.
[time=1377] Vision matters because God has a plan for his church and we get to be his family and be that church for which he has a vision.
[time=1386] Some of you just needed to know vision matters and that your vision is not crushed because of your bad choices or because of your failures.
[time=1395] God still has a vision for you.
[time=1399] And this is played out some more in Second Corinthians chapter five.
[time=1401] Let's go to verse 16 and 17.
[time=1403] Where Paul says from now on therefore, so what do we do with this vision?
[time=1406] Now that we know it's there, we regard no one according to the flesh, even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh.
[time=1413] We regard him thus no longer.
[time=1415] Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[time=1420] The old has passed away.
[time=1422] Behold, the new has come.
[time=1426] You know what that tells me?
[time=1427] Tells me that God is the ultimate visionary.
[time=1430] God is visionary.
[time=1432] God saw something dead and he brought new life to that dead thing.
[time=1438] God said, I have a vision and a plan to redeem mankind through my son, Jesus Christ.
[time=1443] He makes all things new and he has a vision for us.
[time=1447] And we know that all of this is from God.
[time=1448] Verse 18 and 19, let's look there.
[time=1450] All of this is from God.
[time=1452] That's the beauty.
[time=1452] You thought you had to do it, didn't you?
[time=1454] You can't do it.
[time=1455] That's the beauty of the gospel.
[time=1456] How much of this is from God?
[time=1458] Well, 90%, but you got to do 10.
[time=1459] Nope, that's legalism.
[time=1461] We can't start down that path.
[time=1462] It is all his work, but we just respond to it by receiving it.
[time=1467] Salvation is received, not achieved.
[time=1470] We see this in verse 18.
[time=1471] All this is from God who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us, here's where we do, here's where we go with it.
[time=1478] And gave us the ministry of reconciliation.
[time=1480] That is in Christ, God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.
[time=1490] God entrusted that message of reconciliation to us because he made us ministers.
[time=1497] You thought that was my job, didn't you?
[time=1499] You're a preacher.
[time=1501] You're a minister.
[time=1502] Church is a team sport and we're in this all together.
[time=1506] God has given us this message of reconciliation and put us in the ministry of preaching that reconciliation with our lives.
[time=1515] And I'm glad to be a part of it with all of you.
[time=1517] And this makes me think of what I've often called my favorite leadership verse when I get to lead and pastor and be a part of God's plan.
[time=1523] Verse Peter chapter four and verse 10 says, "As each has received a gift," and you have, if you know Jesus, he's gifted you, even though you don't think so.
[time=1531] Use it, use it to serve one another as good stewards of God's varied grace.
[time=1539] A manager of the grace of God.
[time=1542] I get to be entrusted with this message and this ministry of reconciliation.
[time=1547] So pause and imagine with me for just a moment.
[time=1549] What would it look like if we lived in a world where people put the needs of others ahead of their own?
[time=1556] What would social media look like?
[time=1558] It'd be a lot less arguing to be right and a lot more caring about people, a lot more pointing to the truth of Jesus, wouldn't there?
[time=1565] What would it look like if the eternal mandated commission, mission of God's church superseded always our own personal agendas, bubbles, and comfort zone?
[time=1576] Can you imagine what that would look like?
[time=1577] What if God's church grabbed hold of that kind of a vision?
[time=1580] What could happen?
[time=1582] I say, let's find out church.
[time=1584] Let's dig into that together.
[time=1585] That's our vision.
[time=1586] But that would take some focused ambassadors.
[time=1588] Verse 20 is where we see this word ambassadors.
[time=1591] Verse 20 says, therefore we are ambassadors for Christ.
[time=1595] God making his appeal through us.
[time=1597] We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
[time=1601] Let's talk about this word ambassador, ambassador.
[time=1604] The Greek word for this, it's interesting.
[time=1606] It's a noun in our English language, but it's actually a verb in the original language and it's the same word for elders.
[time=1613] Some of you are like, wait a minute.
[time=1614] That kind of blows my mind.
[time=1615] You're saying that this ministry is that important to be an ambassador, that I as a follower of Jesus, I'm an ambassador and that's equated with an eldership, a shepherding and a pastoring kind of role in my life.
[time=1627] Are you serious pastor?
[time=1629] We just read it.
[time=1630] I didn't say it, God did.
[time=1631] It's so true that God has called you to ministry.
[time=1635] You didn't know you were called to ministry perhaps, but today God's vision for your life is that you are called into ministry, to be an ambassador.
[time=1642] So let's take that a step further and give you a Webster kind of definition, a dictionary definition.
[time=1647] This is a condensed version of several that I read.
[time=1649] I love this word authorized though.
[time=1651] It's an authorized representative in a foreign country.
[time=1655] Oh, I love this.
[time=1656] This is gonna preach because then I think of Paul's writing the church at Philippi, Philippians three and verse 20 that says, but your citizenship is in heaven and from it, we await a savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1668] This is why every single week I preach to you the gospel.
[time=1671] I preach to you about the life, the death, the burial, the resurrection and the coming return of Jesus.
[time=1678] And I came to remind you today, we do await a savior and Jesus is coming again.
[time=1683] And when he does, he's gonna make everything right, but until he does, while we await, we are authorized in this foreign country in which our citizenship does not belong.
[time=1693] I'm a citizen of the United States and I'm glad of that, but more than that, I am a citizen of heaven.
[time=1698] This is a temporary passing through place for me.
[time=1701] One day I get to be with my Jesus forever and while I await that day, not only do I have the hope of that day, but I have the urgency that knowing that day is coming in my life right now.
[time=1713] So I've gotta be an ambassador, a representative, an authorized, empowered representative of Jesus Christ himself in this foreign country in which I now live.
[time=1725] May we do that, may we live that well.
[time=1728] Go ahead and celebrate that, if you're gonna clap, let's clap.
[time=1730] Let's give it up for our Jesus.
[time=1732] He's called us, he's empowered us.
[time=1735] And let me give you lastly with this thing of ambassador here, a Blackhawk application.
[time=1740] We went to the dictionary, looked at the original language, we looked at the biblical applications of that.
[time=1746] Let's talk about a Blackhawk application.
[time=1748] This is our first stab at defining, well, what does that mean, 1500 ambassadors?
[time=1751] Well, we think it's somebody who's taking our discipleship journey.
[time=1754] We're about to come out with 301.
[time=1756] Those of you who've taken 101 and 201, it's about to be ready.
[time=1758] And for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, homepage of our website, click the discipleship journey.
[time=1763] It's a pathway to help you take your next step and not only know who we are as a church, but know where you're going and your walk of faith.
[time=1768] So it's one who's taking the discipleship journey and applies it by intentionally reaching and investing in people far from God, but close to them.
[time=1777] If you notice that phrase popping up, this is what we're gonna be talking about for all of time until Jesus comes back.
[time=1783] Because this is our commission.
[time=1784] This is God's vision for us.
[time=1787] And so what is this message of reconciliation that we get to be a minister of?
[time=1791] Verse 21 answers that question, going back to second Corinthians five.
[time=1796] Paul says, "For our sake, he made him to be sin, "who knew no sin." Why?
[time=1802] So that in him, we might become the righteousness of God.
[time=1807] I don't deserve that.
[time=1810] But that's not only the thing I get to receive, it's the message I get to give out.
[time=1814] And as we look at this, this is the kingdom message of reconciliation that we get to be ambassadors of.
[time=1819] And I believe, you wanna know what the greatest tool, I think is for you to be an ambassador?
[time=1823] Here it is.
[time=1824] The greatest tool God has given you to be an ambassador is your story.
[time=1827] Stories preach very loud sermons.
[time=1830] I know you don't like parts of your story, I know.
[time=1832] But God is redeeming all of your story and he wants to use it for his glory.
[time=1838] So one application of this eight year vision that we have of 1500 ambassadors is what we're gonna call 22 for 22.
[time=1845] You're gonna hear us talk a lot about this, 22 for 22.
[time=1847] We wanna have 22 stories.
[time=1850] And this is where you come in.
[time=1851] This is where we come in as a church.
[time=1853] The stories that will preach the loudest sermons showing a picture of generosity, a picture of expansion, a picture of evangelism, a picture of going beyond our bubble to be representatives of Jesus in this foreign country that we live in today where we get to be an ambassador.
[time=1868] We want second Corinthians five verse 15.
[time=1871] I don't live for me anymore, I live for him.
[time=1874] We want ambassador stories, 22 in the year 2022.
[time=1878] That's what you're gonna be hearing.
[time=1879] We're gonna let stories and I believe yours is gonna be one of them to preach the gospel and the good news of Jesus so that people see what this light in the darkness can truly look like.
[time=1888] So you'll be hearing a lot more about 22 for 22.
[time=1891] But going in ponder, could it be your story?
[time=1894] Who's far from God?
[time=1896] Look close to you.
[time=1897] Speaking of that question, let me go back to how.
[time=1899] Let's make this real personal, how.
[time=1901] We looked at the how and then we looked at the why.
[time=1903] But let's go back to the how and let's make it super personal.
[time=1906] I believe if you're gonna answer this question of how, how does this vision happen in my life?
[time=1910] How is it gonna come to fruition?
[time=1911] We've gotta start with the who.
[time=1912] Knowing that Jesus is the author and the finisher of our faith, knowing today that he is the ultimate who.
[time=1918] But then answering this question secondly to that is who is far from God but close to me?
[time=1923] Let's make that personal.
[time=1925] I wanna ask you to think of that right now.
[time=1926] Don't check out, this is so important.
[time=1927] God's about to do something great in your life.
[time=1930] Who's far from God but close to you?
[time=1933] Do you have a name?
[time=1933] Here's a phone number.
[time=1935] I ask you to grab your phones.
[time=1936] Yes, you can get your phones out in church, in the building, in another country, wherever you're watching.
[time=1940] Let's all do this together.
[time=1941] This is just an amazing opportunity.
[time=1942] I wanna start with prayer.
[time=1944] I wanna start with praying for some names.
[time=1946] So grab your phone, text to this number.
[time=1947] Go to the compose message thing, type in this number.
[time=1951] And what I wanna ask you to do, first name's only.
[time=1952] We're not here to call anybody out.
[time=1954] Just send us the first name of somebody God put on your heart that may be far from God but is close to you.
[time=1961] Would you do that right now?
[time=1962] Don't wait a second longer and here's why.
[time=1964] We're gonna start.
[time=1965] Prayer is not our last resort.
[time=1966] Prayer is the first and most important thing that we do as a church.
[time=1969] So we're gonna start this vision right now because eternity is at stake and we don't have time to wait.
[time=1975] And as we answer this today, we're gonna start right now by maybe you're thinking of inviting them to church and I would ask you how can you connect with them this week?
[time=1983] Those are great questions.
[time=1984] But we're just gonna start by praying for them by name.
[time=1987] And we're gonna do that even right now as you're sending all those in.
[time=1990] We've already had tons sent in already.
[time=1992] So let's stop and pray right now.
[time=1994] They're even gonna show up here on our screen.
[time=1996] So God right now we pause and I pray for Courtney, for Josh, for Evan, for Connie, for Jacob, for Jacob, Eric, Michaela, for Tony.
[time=2006] God, I thank you that these names and I won't be able to hit all of them Lord.
[time=2010] We've had so many sent in already today as they scroll on the screen, it represents so much more, it represents this red chair, people like Mike and Millie and Cam and Dave and Daniel and Thomas, God, they are people that so matter to you and God as they scroll across the screen, God, I just humble that you would wanna use somebody like me to impact people like this.
[time=2033] So for Jackie and Margie and Kelly and Ethan,
[time=2039] for Matt, for Bethany, for all of these people listed, God, we stop and we say, God, you love them so much.
[time=2046] Help us know how we can be a picture of that love.
[time=2050] Help us be a picture of light in their dark places.
[time=2055] God help us follow your vision for your church, for us.
[time=2059] God, this is us, this is what you've called us to do.
[time=2062] May we make a seat for them in our lives.
[time=2065] May we prioritize your work.
[time=2067] We pray all of this in the powerful name of Jesus.
[time=2069] And as these names continue to scroll, God, we continue just to lift them up and we place them into your hands.
[time=2075] And all God's people said we pray all this in Jesus name and you can continue praying.
[time=2080] But as you do, here's what I know as those names scroll across the screen today, some of you've realized today that you're that name, that Jesus is meeting you right in your moment of great need.
[time=2093] And today I wanna stop and give you a moment to respond.
[time=2096] As believers, let's continue just to pray.
[time=2098] Buy your heads, close your eyes.
[time=2099] We're gonna keep praying for these names.
[time=2100] Keep praying for what God's doing in your life right now.
[time=2102] But some of you, you need to accept Jesus today.
[time=2104] You've realized that God has put your name on the wall.
[time=2108] Saying, I came for you.
[time=2110] I died for you.
[time=2111] I rose so you could have eternal life.
[time=2114] That is the gospel.
[time=2115] Jesus paid the price.
[time=2115] You couldn't pay for your sinfulness to bridge you to God.
[time=2119] And the separation that happens because of your sin.
[time=2122] Jesus won the victory when he rose from the dead.
[time=2124] And because he lives, we can have eternal life right now.
[time=2129] Will you stop?
[time=2130] Will you pray and ask God?
[time=2131] He doesn't want a perfect prayer.
[time=2133] He doesn't want your perfect words.
[time=2134] He just wants you to give him, to give him all of you, all of your hearts.
[time=2138] Surrender to him, trust in him to save you.
[time=2140] Not your works, not your parents or grandparents' faith, but your faith being placed in the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords in your own, whereas we cry out to him right now in this very moment.
[time=2151] (gentle music) (gentle music)
