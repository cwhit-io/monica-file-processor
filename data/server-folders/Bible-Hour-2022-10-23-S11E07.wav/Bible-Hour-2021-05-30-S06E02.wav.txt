[time=0] So today I want to talk to you about Gather and answer this question. Why gather?
[time=4] Why gather? Hebrews chapter 10 is where we're going to be in the Word of God. So join me there as we'll get there in just a couple of moments.
[time=10] But why gather? Gathering and the church and what church gatherings look like has been kind of
[time=16] shifted and defined and redefined and it's looked a lot of different ways this last year. And so with all the shifting landscape with why gather that question and what it even looks like, I want us to go back to some of the original definitions of that question or of what it means to gather and be the church of Jesus. And I want to give you our question of the week. You guys get to help me preach those of you who are watching online and in the room in the chats, right? Your answer to this question.
[time=40] How has church changed your life?
[time=44] How has church changed your life? So we're looking at gathering as the church, help me preach that in just a little bit. And as we get ready to unpack some of that, I want to give you a couple of statements or clarity statements about online, television, in person. There's a lot of conflicting, like, which one's best, better? Are they all okay? And we're blessed at Blackhawk because we've been doing television ministry, the Bible hour, online ministry for a long time. We are so blessed. And boy, we had no idea how much a tool for the gospel that would become in 2020.
[time=76] Am I right about it? We had no idea, but the Lord did. And so I can tell you we are a hundred percent in-person gathering. We're a hundred percent in online and television all the time. And I want to explain to you why and how with two answers. Number one, what is television ministry and online? What is it for us? And then what is it not? What it is is an amazing tool for us to be able to a venue rather even for us to reach out to and care for shut-ins or people who are not able physically for whatever reason to gather with us.
[time=108] It's been doing that for us for a long time. People right now are watching in hospitals or watching in places where they are not physically able to gather with us.
[time=116] It's a tool that we can use to invite and engage people far beyond our bubble. If you're here last week, we talked about going beyond the Blackhawk bubble.
[time=124] So our online ministry gives us a chance to do that. How many of you before you came to Blackhawk in person, for those of you in the room right now, looked at us online first?
[time=132] Yeah, right. I know better than that. Some of you have been here a long time. But we look online. That is the gateway these days, isn't it?
[time=140] We look online and we see what the services are looking like.
[time=144] And so these are some of the things that this ministry is for us. It's an amazing tool for us to reach beyond our bubble to help people find and follow Jesus.
[time=152] Let me tell you what, it's not though. What online ministry and television is not for us is a replacement or an alternative to gathering together and being in biblical community with other believers, brothers and sisters in Jesus. Look at your neighbor and tell them right now. Say, you need me.
[time=168] Tell them. We need each other. We are created to be known and to know others. So it's not an alternative for that. It's not an alternative to life groups. Online television ministry is not an alternative, biblically speaking, for using your gifts to uplift and to edify and to build the body of Christ. Use your gifts to serve the body of Christ. It's not an alternative to giving and contributing as we're going to look at in just a few moments. So what does all that mean? It means I would say to you today, and boy, I just got to pause and say, isn't it sweet to be in the building?
[time=200] And I know some of you can't be in the building, and guess what? Here's what I'll tell you.
[time=204] If you can't be here, we're going to meet you where you are. Our own line in television ministry, we're going all out all the time, we're doing question of the week, trying to make sure our family extends far beyond this room. But listen, if you can be in this room, I say it's time to come home.
[time=220] Why? Because the spirit of worshiping together in this room, tell me about it in this room. It is just incredible. I remember I just had tears streaming down my face the first time we got to come back after you all were gone, and I was here by myself, and I'll always preach. I don't care if it's by myself, or if there's three people or 3,000, or who knows how many, but I'm so thankful we can be in the room. So if you can, let's gather together. I want to give you some answers as to why. I'll say that to you today and why we do both. So let's talk about this question. Why gather? Why gather? I'm going to give you six reasons why we gather from the book of Hebrews chapter 10. Number one comes from the first three verses we'll read, verses 19 through 21. Number one is when we gather, we illustrate the gospel. When we gather, we illustrate the gospel. Let me show that to you in Hebrews chapter 10. You ready for the word today, church?
[time=268] Verse 19, Hebrews chapter 10, therefore brothers, since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain that is through his flesh. And since we have a great high priest, or great priest over the house of God, the house of God.
[time=288] So let's talk about that for a few minutes in those verses. We see the gospel.
[time=292] We see that we can confidently enter this place, the holy places, which is the presence of God. We can worship God. We can know God how through the blood of Jesus Christ, who gave us this new and living way through the curtain that is his flesh.
[time=308] Now what does that mean? Let's talk about that. When Jesus died, there was a curtain that divided the regular part of the temple of that day, and what was called the holy of holies. And that was literally the presence of God. It was confined to this place, and there was this big curtain that even the high priest could only enter in through that curtain certain times, certain ways, big regulations, because if you go into the presence of God and it's not through the ways he made for you to do so, you would die. And so this is the curtain that divided the rest of the temple from the holy of holies. And when Jesus died, the moment he breathed his last breath, you know what that curtain did? It ripped from top to bottom. It shows us a picture of God becoming man and paying a price and getting rid of this barrier between us and the presence of God that we could never get rid of on our own. Jesus alone. That is the gospel. And so when we gather, we remember these things. We celebrate these things, because only Jesus could do what Jesus has done in making a way for us to know God. That is the gospel. That is the good news.
[time=372] And it didn't end there. He rose from the dead to defeat death, to defeat hell, to defeat the grave, so that we could partake in his victory as his family. I say that's in pretty good news.
[time=384] That's a gospel worth illustrating. And since we have this confidence, it's only through the blood of Jesus. Hebrews 9-22 reminds us of that, that indeed under the law, almost everything is purified with blood, the Old Testament sacrificial system. And without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins. And since we have this priest, that's a big theme of the book of Hebrews. Jesus says the high priest. He's the ultimate priest. But here's what we'll do a lot of times. Since we have this high priest, since he shed his blood, we can walk straight through the curtain. We can boldly approach the throne, but many of us, we just try to close the curtain back. Some of you are doing that in your life right now.
[time=424] You don't feel worthy. I've talked to people that don't gather with us. Don't come to church.
[time=428] Many times because they just don't feel worthy. They don't feel like they can fit in. You know, I'm not holy enough to walk with people like the church people that go there. And I always say, have you met the church people? Have you hung out? Sorry, I know that was kind of offensive. Like, how are you going to listen to me now, right? But I'll say, I'll say, if you hung out with me, I'm the pastor. We're all flawed. You can come. And what we try to do is we try to close the curtain that Jesus has already ripped into from top to bottom. You have a way to God to a personal relationship with him because of the sacrifice and the blood of Jesus. So what does that look like? Hebrews 4, verses 14 through 16. It says, "Since then we have a great high priest who passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are yet without sin." I love verse 16. So what do we do with this? Let us then with confidence.
[time=488] Some might say confidence. Some of you haven't been living with confidence.
[time=492] The curtain that represented the barrier between you and God is ripped. So let us then with confidence drawn near to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. And the house of God that's talked about here, when Jesus came on the scene it went from a place which is the temple to a people that is the church. And I'm glad I get to be a part of that family.
[time=516] And here's an answer with the gospel of why we gather and it's simply this, that because the gospel produces worshipers and it does. We're here today worshiping because of the gospel. We illustrate the gospel.
[time=528] Because the gospel produces worshipers who are created for and called to community. Corporate worship is an essential demonstration of the gospel for God's church. We've got to gather.
[time=540] And we'll look at it even in more in depth, but the gospel you need to know number one is why we gather. We illustrate the gospel when we gather. Number two, when we gather. When we gather we spark revival.
[time=552] Look at verse 22 of Hebrews 10. We spark revival when we gather. This is a revival verse if I've ever seen it. You see the ordinances or the sacraments we often call them. There's two of them that we observe on a regular basis here is communion the Lord's Supper and baptism.
[time=568] You see those things represented here, but you see a common denominator of revival here.
[time=572] Verse 22, let us draw near with a true heart that means undivided loyalties here in full assurance of faith with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience. And our bodies washed with pure water. Some revival promises that show up in this passage as we draw near. But here's what I tell you about gathering.
[time=592] When we gather we draw near. When we gather we spark revival.
[time=596] And if we're drawing near, don't miss this. If we're drawing near to the same God then our paths will have to cross. If we're drawing near to the same God we're going to converge. We're going to be family. And that's why Jesus said I'm going to build my church and even the gates of hell won't prevail against it.
[time=612] And we get three promises we see in verse 22, full assurance of faith. Couldn't you use that?
[time=616] We're saved by grace through faith. Not of works. Or then we will boast about it. We get full assurance of faith. We're sprinkled clean. We have our hearts internally sprinkled clean from an evil conscience.
[time=628] This used to be external. We would offer sacrifices and we would be clean from the outside in. But since Jesus has come we are clean from the inside out. That's why we do communion. Because God has made that way through the ultimate sacrifice of the body of Jesus and his blood being broken and spilled out for us. You see communion pictured there. You see our bodies. Number three washed with pure water. Baptism. Scholars take that a lot of different ways and you can apply it in so many ways. Water represents the word. It represents the spirit of God.
[time=656] It's presence to be washed. We tell people when they're baptized there are no sins floating in the water up there. There's no little sins floating around. But that water represents being buried with Christ in baptism. That you buried the old self.
[time=668] That Jesus has made you new. That you've given your heart, your life and all that you are to Jesus. And just as he died and was buried we're putting to death the old self. And just as he was raised we come out of the water and we live this new life. It symbolizes outwardly what's already happened inwardly and some of you need to take that step and you've been putting it off.
[time=688] And if you have we want to help you. A couple of weeks we'll have several people doing just that.
[time=692] But as I look at revival throughout history there's some common denominators.
[time=696] When I see the spirit of God moving and powering revival in history and in scripture I always see an authentic repentant committed group of people, the church. But there's a common denominator that they're typically gathering together publicly in some way. And people see that.
[time=712] And that's a common denominator of revival. So when we gather we spark revival. Let me give you number three. You guys doing alright today?
[time=720] This is why we gather. This is us. Number three. When we gather we live our identity. We live out our identity. We live out Verse 23 gives us a great picture of that, where we read.
[time=733] Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering.
[time=739] Hold on to who we are.
[time=740] This is the confession.
[time=741] This is us.
[time=742] For he who promised is faithful.
[time=745] Aren't you glad of that?
[time=746] That he who promised is faithful.
[time=748] That's the source of our identity.
[time=750] It's a faithful God who's brought in unfaithful people, sinners like you and me, but he loves us and he makes us family.
[time=758] That's the gospel.
[time=759] That's why we're here.
[time=760] That's why we spark revival and we want to live out that identity.
[time=764] And so as we look at holding on to the right hope in verse 23, I want to pause and ask you a question.
[time=769] It's really personal, so I'm going to get personal with you.
[time=771] What hope are you holding on to today?
[time=774] Don't write this one in the chat unless you want to.
[time=776] But in your own heart, would you answer right now, what hope are you really holding on to?
[time=780] In a world that gives you so many different things to grasp at, things that change, things that shift.
[time=785] I want to hold on to the right hope, the hope of the gospel, the hope of the God who created the universe, the hope of a God who became man and paid by way, not just to heaven, but into a perfect relationship with him, not because of anything I could do, but because of Jesus, his perfection.
[time=801] I love Hebrews 6, 19 and 20, and we sing it a lot of times in a song.
[time=805] It's for we have this hope as an anchor for our soul.
[time=809] So I pray we can anchor our hope in the hope above everything else.
[time=814] Church gatherings, why do we gather?
[time=816] Church gatherings, I've told you about being an ambassador.
[time=819] 1,500 ambassadors, if you missed last week, we dream of going beyond the Black Hawk bubble by sending, developing and sending 1,500 ambassadors for Jesus to reach people far from God, but close to us, by our 60th anniversary as a church in 2029.
[time=835] So this is an eight-year vision, 1,500 ambassadors.
[time=838] And when we gather as a church, we're coming together to an embassy.
[time=842] We're coming together to this outpost where we can be trained up and sent out.
[time=846] And it's an embassy because we are a representative of a foreign land in a foreign nation.
[time=851] Our citizenship is in heaven, and we're temporarily here.
[time=854] And as an ambassador, we get to come together to this outpost, to this embassy, if you will.
[time=860] And then we disperse, and we live out our mission as a representative of Jesus in this foreign land.
[time=866] That's what we're called to do.
[time=867] That's what we want to develop.
[time=868] That's what we want to develop stories of.
[time=870] 22 stories for 2022.
[time=872] We want to have ambassadors.
[time=873] 2 Corinthians 5, 15 kind of stories by then.
[time=876] This is what we're here to do.
[time=878] When it comes to that identity, write this down.
[time=881] That gathering is not just something we do as God's church.
[time=884] It's who we are, but I'll even tell you, it's what we are.
[time=887] Let me prove it to you.
[time=888] The biblical definition of gathering of the church is a Greek word, Ekklesia, everybody say Ekklesia.
[time=897] Ekklesia is made up of two Greek words, Ekk and Kaleo.
[time=900] Ekk is out of, Kaleo is called out, or called out one.
[time=904] So literally, the word church, Ekklesia, is what they combine to be, is an assembly, a gathering of people called out around an idea.
[time=915] And in this case, it's the only great idea, the only eternal idea, and that is the gospel.
[time=920] And it's so much more than an idea.
[time=921] It's history.
[time=922] It's the good news of Jesus Christ.
[time=924] That's who we are.
[time=925] And if you don't have your sermon notes, you want to get the sermon notes on our app.
[time=929] I've given you a list there of 11 scriptures that show you the history of gathering as our identity comes together.
[time=936] I'll point out two or three of them here, but there's a list of 11 scriptures in your sermon notes on our website or on our app today.
[time=943] If you want to grab these, study them.
[time=945] But here's some Old Testament and New Testament examples of our identity as a church, how we've lived out for centuries, this ecclesia calling, called out people who gather together.
[time=954] Genesis 4, 26, has the godly line of Seth.
[time=957] This is shortly after creation.
[time=959] We see that they started gathering together.
[time=961] The Bible says that people began to call in the name of the Lord.
[time=964] Exodus 1 Samuel.
[time=965] I'll go to 2 Samuel chapter 6 verse 5.
[time=968] This is when the ark of the covenant that contained the 10 commandments.
[time=971] It was brought back to Jerusalem.
[time=973] And David and the Bible says all the house of Israel were together.
[time=977] They were celebrating before the Lord with songs and instruments.
[time=980] I love that.
[time=981] We're doing the same thing, have done the same thing even today.
[time=984] 2 Kings 23 and verse 2.
[time=987] Israel has renewed their covenant with the Lord.
[time=989] And the Bible says that both small and great were all gathered together to hear the words of the book of the covenant found in the house of the Lord.
[time=998] Nehemiah 8 after they had rebuilt the wall of Jerusalem.
[time=1001] They came together.
[time=1002] It says as one man in the square there to hear the word together.
[time=1006] Acts chapter 2 go to the New Testament.
[time=1009] When the day of Pentecost had arrived the spirit has come and in dwell believers.
[time=1013] They were gathered together in one place.
[time=1015] The Bible says in day by day attending the temple together and breaking bread in their home.
[time=1020] So that's worship in life groups.
[time=1021] This is gather and connect for us.
[time=1023] It wasn't our idea.
[time=1024] Jesus came up with it and the church has been doing it for centuries.
[time=1027] Acts chapter 20 says the first day of the week the church gathered and Paul spoke to them.
[time=1031] And Acts 20 and verse 7 is where Eutuchus by the way was his name.
[time=1035] Paul was preaching and he preached a long sermon.
[time=1037] You think I preached long?
[time=1038] That joker started early and he's preaching at night time and he's sitting in the window.
[time=1042] This Eutuchus and he falls asleep and he falls out the window and dies.
[time=1046] You know that's in the Bible.
[time=1048] Acts 20 verse 7 go find it.
[time=1050] You're good to motion material.
[time=1051] And God raises him from the dead there.
[time=1053] And so here's what I say to you.
[time=1054] Don't go to sleep.
[time=1057] I'm watching you.
[time=1058] But even then they're gathered.
[time=1060] They're gathered together.
[time=1061] And then I mean it just continues.
[time=1063] You get the point.
[time=1064] Acts 20 verse 28, 1 Timothy 4.
[time=1066] Paul challenges Timothy to do these same things, to continue to devote himself to these gatherings as we continue doing that.
[time=1072] 11 of those are available to you in the app, in the sermon notes.
[time=1076] If you want to see that history even further broken out.
[time=1078] But let's make it personal.
[time=1079] Let's go back to our question of the week.
[time=1081] How has church changed your life?
[time=1083] And so I want to hear from some of you, I believe we've got some answers.
[time=1089] Whitley says to how has church changed my life?
[time=1092] To have community with people pursuing Christ.
[time=1095] Josh says helped me connect in a deeper way with my own family.
[time=1098] That's beautiful.
[time=1099] Laura says to be a part of an army of believers.
[time=1102] I like that.
[time=1103] Good job Laura.
[time=1104] Working for the Lord and encouragement for these times.
[time=1107] To spur one another on to fulfill the great commission.
[time=1112] This is so powerful as our Lord gives us His unity of believers.
[time=1116] What a beautiful time for us to be unified in a divided world.
[time=1120] Beautiful.
[time=1121] Christi says my parents taking me to church.
[time=1123] My parents taking me to church.
[time=1125] And that's how I found my salvation through the church.
[time=1128] The list goes on.
[time=1129] How has the church changed your life?
[time=1132] Maybe it hasn't.
[time=1133] I believe God's brought you here because I believe today is one of those changing times where your life can be changed.
[time=1139] And church as we continue to build on this, it gives us this connection like nothing else in the world.
[time=1144] It makes the we bigger than the me.
[time=1147] Verse 24 of Hebrews 10 gives us this great picture of that.
[time=1150] Where we see that and let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works.
[time=1157] When we gather, we put we before me.
[time=1160] We consider how we stir up one another to love and to good works.
[time=1166] And as we look at the one another's in Scripture, this is how I wrote it in my notes.
[time=1170] You're going to think Rick and I must have coordinated.
[time=1172] The one another's in the Bible really are one of the most prominent themes you're going to find in the Gospel.
[time=1177] We have to one another each other.
[time=1179] We have to be connected to each other.
[time=1182] We need each other.
[time=1183] Look at your neighbor and say I need you.
[time=1185] Just let him know.
[time=1186] Do it at home too.
[time=1187] Wherever you're at.
[time=1188] Say I need you.
[time=1189] Now return the favor.
[time=1190] I need you.
[time=1191] We need each other.
[time=1193] And these two words, consider.
[time=1195] Let's talk about consider.
[time=1196] Consider how to stir each other up.
[time=1198] This is to think, to observe, to notice, to contemplate.
[time=1201] This is when we consider, it's kind of a consuming consideration.
[time=1205] And then to stir up.
[time=1206] To stir up.
[time=1207] It's to push or provoke.
[time=1208] A lot of times this is used as kind of a negative connotation.
[time=1211] But not in this passage.
[time=1212] It's like this negative.
[time=1213] I'm going to provoke you and push you and shove you sometimes.
[time=1216] But it's being used here in a very positive sense.
[time=1219] And it gives this very powerful view of how we love one another.
[time=1224] How we want another each other.
[time=1226] And my friends, Christian love is going to take work.
[time=1229] If you're going to bear with one another.
[time=1231] First of all, you've got to be with one another.
[time=1234] And if we're going to bear with one another, it's going to take some consideration and some stirring up sometimes.
[time=1240] Have you ever had anybody stir you up?
[time=1242] I've had people stir me up in all kind of bad ways.
[time=1245] But man, I'm so thankful for Christian brothers and sisters who stir me up in good ways, who provoke and even push me.
[time=1251] Hold me accountable to following after Jesus.
[time=1254] So when we gather, we put we before me.
[time=1256] And that's where sometimes it's putting the comfort of staying in my jammies and coming to be together with people sometimes.
[time=1261] And if you're able to do that, I challenge you to do that because we need each other.
[time=1266] We're called to put the me last, the we first, the we is who we are as God's church.
[time=1271] And I'm glad God has made us a family.
[time=1274] Let me give you number five.
[time=1276] Number five is when we gather, we're obedient to God.
[time=1279] We gather, we're obedient to God.
[time=1281] Verse 25, not neglecting.
[time=1284] Not neglecting to meet together as is the habit of some.
[time=1288] Boy, there's been a lot of habits developed by COVID.
[time=1290] Good, bad and ugly and all in between.
[time=1292] But maybe you've neglected community during this time.
[time=1295] This verse is so powerful for us.
[time=1296] Not neglecting to meet together as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another and all the more as you see the day drawing near.
[time=1304] I'll often say things like this that we're not just called to go to church.
[time=1308] We're called to be the church.
[time=1310] I still believe that a hundred percent.
[time=1312] But notice there's the word just.
[time=1314] We're not just called to go to church.
[time=1316] We're called to be the church.
[time=1318] We are called to go to church.
[time=1319] We are called to gather together.
[time=1321] We are called to be connected together.
[time=1323] You can't refute that in this verse.
[time=1325] I love how Mark Devere wrote this.
[time=1327] I was reading this week and he said it well.
[time=1329] He said a local church is more than a congregation or a gathering, but it is nevertheless.
[time=1335] I think that's a very good statement.
[time=1337] Gathering is the starting place of community for us.
[time=1341] And I'll say it to you this way that it's really hard to be the church if we don't even go to church.
[time=1347] And so may we do that.
[time=1349] Online gives us a great ramp to that, but I hope we can be in community together.
[time=1353] We need each other.
[time=1354] We believe not just in these rows, but in circles because a row can't know what you're going through and we get to be obedient to God.
[time=1361] I'll say it to you this way that God has called us to be contributors, not just consumers.
[time=1365] Some of us have been consuming in church and looking at it with a consumer mindset of what I get for a long time, but God has called us to go far beyond consumption to being a contributor.
[time=1375] Gathering is not about what we get.
[time=1377] It's about what we give.
[time=1379] You ever heard anybody say, well, I just didn't get anything out of that service.
[time=1382] All right, that sermon, that sermon stunk.
[time=1385] I didn't get anything out of that.
[time=1387] Well, when I read my Bible, it makes it really clear to me that it's not about what I get.
[time=1392] And David Jeremiah, I think, captured that so well.
[time=1395] Our 50th anniversary, our founding senior pastor, Dr. David Jeremiah, stood on this stage and he talked about how he had a holy hatred for people when they will leave their church because their needs aren't met.
[time=1406] And here's this quote as he followed it up.
[time=1408] He said, it seems to me if people would come to church to meet the needs of others, they would find their own needs get met.
[time=1414] And I have found that.
[time=1416] I found that that happens so much beyond what I can do on my own.
[time=1421] So I want to draw something for you today.
[time=1423] Are you ready for my artistry skills here?
[time=1426] I want to draw something to illustrate that even right now.
[time=1429] And I see it on the screen.
[time=1430] We're going to give this a shot.
[time=1431] We're going to be proud of our tech team.
[time=1432] They're always just fixing things, making things right, making us look good.
[time=1436] In fact, let's thank our tech team real quick.
[time=1437] Can you give it up for them?
[time=1438] Thank them.
[time=1439] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1443] So as I start to draw this image here, this came from a vision or treat that our elders and leadership went on back in April.
[time=1450] I've talked to you about it last week.
[time=1451] And Brian Rose, if you're watching this, he was our facilitator, Oxano, his company that he serves with.
[time=1456] They helped us with this same drawing.
[time=1458] So I'm going to see if I can do it some justice.
[time=1460] I am so far from an artist.
[time=1461] But let's start with this house.
[time=1463] All right.
[time=1464] So here's a house.
[time=1465] Here's your little roof.
[time=1466] Have you ever been like at the beach and you see a house on stilts where the water can wash under?
[time=1471] Have you ever seen those before?
[time=1473] And so this is that house.
[time=1474] Imagine the water sweeping up under.
[time=1476] But here's the house.
[time=1477] And up here, the covering, we're going to call this.
[time=1479] This is our mission is to make disciples that make disciples.
[time=1482] That's our mission.
[time=1483] That's our covering.
[time=1484] That's what covers every bit of this.
[time=1486] But right here in the house, the upper room of the house is vision.
[time=1490] It's to light the one-five.
[time=1491] This is the upper room.
[time=1492] But down below, we see the provision of God.
[time=1496] So vision's up top, but the provision is down below.
[time=1502] And as we look at the provision of God, that includes things like the people.
[time=1508] That's you and me.
[time=1509] That's the place that we sit in right now.
[time=1512] That is the programs that we are all a part of.
[time=1517] We love those things.
[time=1518] And these are the provision of God.
[time=1520] I'll even add to that.
[time=1521] I'll even say the past.
[time=1522] The past is a reminder.
[time=1523] So what we did, we look back.
[time=1525] We looked at where we've been.
[time=1527] We've looked at where we are.
[time=1529] And those things, the people, the place, the programs, the past.
[time=1532] Even the personalities that come in and out of a church.
[time=1535] Just like you can envision the house on stilts.
[time=1537] The thing is, why is the house on stilts?
[time=1540] Because all these things get washed away sometimes.
[time=1543] People, they kind of come and go sometimes.
[time=1545] Places they can even burn down.
[time=1547] Programs, they're relevant for a season, but not relevant for the next.
[time=1550] The past is the past.
[time=1552] It's happened and we celebrate it, but it's the past.
[time=1554] These are the provisions of God.
[time=1557] But what happens for us so many times, don't miss this, is that we will start to focus so much on the provision of God.
[time=1564] And then what happens in churches, especially, is sometimes the vision becomes the provision.
[time=1570] And when the provision becomes the vision, what we have done is we have made an idol.
[time=1576] And I don't want to make an idol.
[time=1578] That's when preferences creep in.
[time=1580] And that's when, listen, when churches focus more on the provisions of God, and those things are great.
[time=1586] But when churches focus more on the provisions of God, then they do the mission and the vision of God, they die.
[time=1593] Because these things, if your hope is built on these things, they will come and they will go.
[time=1598] They'll be washed away.
[time=1600] But we are called to do this.
[time=1602] We are called to come on.
[time=1603] This is what our leaders want to do in this season.
[time=1605] It's why we have a vision Sunday.
[time=1606] We want to build a staircase.
[time=1608] We're constantly, we are doing this.
[time=1611] We are making sure that our passion, our focus, is at the top of this upper room that we climb the stairs from provision to vision so that our passion goes to our mission and our vision.
[time=1621] And that's where we focus, that no matter what goes on here, that our focus is here.
[time=1626] That we're not making idols of things that are not eternal.
[time=1630] And let's be honest, these are some of the reasons some of you came to church.
[time=1633] You like to program maybe a person, you got connected in groups.
[time=1636] Those are good things.
[time=1638] I'm so thankful for the provision of God.
[time=1640] But the Bible says in Proverbs 29 and verse 18, where there is no vision, the people perish.
[time=1646] And I'll give you another application of that is where there is no vision, the people cherish.
[time=1652] And they'll end up cherishing things that are transient, cherishing things that come and that go.
[time=1659] And churches that love their methods more than the mission, all end up dying.
[time=1665] May it never be so for us, Black Hawk.
[time=1668] I want to be the kind of church that when everything else is shifting in life, when COVID comes around, a global pandemic comes around.
[time=1676] When all the changes in my life and changes in a church and all the provisions of God look different from this season to the next season,
[time=1683] that it doesn't matter because we're so laser focused, so passionate about the vision that God has for our church.
[time=1690] And the mission that covers it all is that we cannot be deterred from his mission, from being ambassadors,
[time=1696] from reaching people who are far from God, but close to us, from going beyond our bubble.
[time=1701] While everybody else is hunkering down, we're going to be going.
[time=1704] We're going to be ambassadors because we're climbing the staircase from the provisions of God to focus on the vision that he has for our lives.
[time=1713] (Applause) You never knew a drawing could freak so well.
[time=1720] But I pray that this picture, and I thank Brian for showing us this picture. I'll never forget this picture because it reminds us of this next statement that I want to give to you.
[time=1728] It's what we magnify that will multiply.
[time=1732] So as leaders of the church, we want you to know we're going to magnify the mission.
[time=1736] We are going to magnify our Jesus.
[time=1739] We are going to magnify the vision that he has given to us.
[time=1742] This is one of the most powerful relationship principles that you'll ever find.
[time=1746] Is what you magnify? See, Steve.
[time=1750] What you magnify will multiply.
[time=1753] What you look for, you're going to find.
[time=1756] This is true in your relationships.
[time=1757] If you put a microscope and a magnifying glass to the faults of your spouse, you'll find plenty.
[time=1761] You cannot get an amen.
[time=1763] Jessica, amen harder than anybody else on that one.
[time=1767] But when you put a magnifying glass on the good qualities, when you look for the good things,
[time=1773] when you look for the opportunities to be loved, salt, light, to bear with one another, you're going to find that too.
[time=1779] In the church, if you look for things that you don't like, you'll find them every time.
[time=1783] But if you look to the character of God, if you look to magnify the attributes of God, if you look to find reasons to worship God, you'll end up magnifying God and all the other stuff that washes away will become so far secondary, you'll never hardly even think about it because you are so consumed by this God that you're consumed with magnifying in your life, both at church, at home, in the world, wherever you are, less magnify our mission, less better than that,
[time=1812] less magnify our God, less magnifying because he's worthy to be praised.
[time=1817] What you magnify will multiply.
[time=1819] I've got a heart for people today.
[time=1821] Some of you are in the room or watching online.
[time=1824] Perhaps you're even watching online that'll miss this because you've been hurt in church.
[time=1829] And you know my phrase about the hypocrites, people say, I don't go to church because of the hypocrites.
[time=1833] And I always say, well, come on, one more won't hurt.
[time=1835] You've heard me say that.
[time=1837] And that's cute and funny and all, but here's the reality.
[time=1840] Some of you really have been hurt by the church.
[time=1843] I'm a pastor.
[time=1844] My dad's here.
[time=1845] He was a pastor.
[time=1846] I'm a P.K.
[time=1847] I can tell you, I have been hurt more in church settings than I have ever been hurt anywhere else in my life.
[time=1854] Because there are people in the church.
[time=1856] They're just like me.
[time=1860] They're flawed.
[time=1861] If you're looking for the perfect church as soon as we show up, it's no longer perfect.
[time=1864] And some of you have been hurt by people in the past.
[time=1867] And I've got a real heart for you.
[time=1868] And here's what I want to tell you about today.
[time=1870] I want to tell you about what we can magnify.
[time=1872] Let me grab a moment.
[time=1873] Sometimes we end up magnifying those hurts and say, I'm not going to go to church anymore because that happened.
[time=1878] But what we end up doing is we end up making the people, the slower room stuff.
[time=1882] The provisions of God, our vision and what we see and what we magnify.
[time=1887] But I came to tell you today that if you will do this, it will change your life.
[time=1890] And when it comes to gathering, it will change what you're all about.
[time=1893] I want us to move our focus from him, from them to him.
[time=1896] When we do that, we're going to see that my view of God's church will shift.
[time=1902] If your view of God's church is based on them, it will get washed away.
[time=1906] You mark it down.
[time=1907] But if your view of God's church is based on him, not them, then you'll magnify him.
[time=1911] And you'll want to be a part of God's church, not because of what people did or didn't do, but because God listened to the creator of the church.
[time=1918] He invited us in.
[time=1919] And all of us knuckleheads who get to be a part of it.
[time=1921] We don't define God's church.
[time=1923] He defines his church and he's building it.
[time=1925] And even the gates of hell won't prevail against it.
[time=1927] So some of you, maybe it's time to stop magnifying the hurts of the past and magnify the God who called you to be a part of his family and go to church.
[time=1935] Be the church.
[time=1936] Plug in to your church.
[time=1937] Even if it's not here, if you're listening to this, you're watching this online and it's another church.
[time=1942] Plug in.
[time=1943] Stop letting the enemy rob you through the lower room stuff of the upper room purpose and mission and vision that God has for your life.
[time=1951] This is why we gather.
[time=1953] And I pray that some of you can move through and heal from some of the past hurts in your life.
[time=1959] Ultimately, I'll tell you this, I don't want to be a church person.
[time=1961] Have you ever been called that?
[time=1963] School, I remember a few people because I had those, you know, following Jesus.
[time=1967] They said, "He's the church boy." You know, I didn't like that, not because I didn't like getting picked on it.
[time=1972] I didn't really like that either.
[time=1974] But I didn't like that because I don't really want to be the church boy.
[time=1976] I want to be a Jesus boy.
[time=1978] I'm not really in this to be a church person.
[time=1980] I'm in this to be a Jesus person.
[time=1982] To not just talk about what he said, but do what he did.
[time=1985] And why does this matter?
[time=1986] It's the end of verse 25.
[time=1987] The day is drawing near the day is when Jesus is coming back.
[time=1990] Did you know Jesus is coming back for his church?
[time=1993] And I want to be ready.
[time=1994] And I'm ready because of Jesus and because of his shed blood.
[time=1997] But I want to live the urgency of the gospel.
[time=2000] The day is drawing near, so let us not waste our days.
[time=2004] That's my heart for us as a church.
[time=2006] And here's my favorite part about it all.
[time=2008] When we get to gather, why do we gather?
[time=2010] We gather for all these different reasons.
[time=2011] We put we before me.
[time=2012] We're obedient to God.
[time=2013] We spark revival.
[time=2014] We illustrate the gospel.
[time=2016] But number six, we gather.
[time=2018] When we gather, we practice for heaven.
[time=2020] We practice for heaven.
[time=2023] I love when we practice for heaven.
[time=2025] This is when all people of all tribes come together.
[time=2027] That's what I'll read to you about Revelation 7 starting in verse 9.
[time=2030] After this, I looked and behold a great multitude that no one could number.
[time=2033] What a gathering.
[time=2034] A great multitude.
[time=2035] No one could number from every tribe.
[time=2037] Every nation from all tribes and all peoples and languages.
[time=2041] Standing before the throne.
[time=2043] Before the lamb clothed in white robes with palm branches in their hands.
[time=2047] And what were they doing?
[time=2048] This is what we get to do today.
[time=2050] Verse 10.
[time=2051] And crying out with a loud voice.
[time=2053] The question belongs to our God who sits on the throne and to the lamb.
[time=2058] So when it's all said and done church.
[time=2061] When sin is no more.
[time=2063] When the ultimate victory that Jesus has already won is now come to fruition.
[time=2068] And we live in the fruit of that victory.
[time=2070] And we get to be in the presence of God.
[time=2072] What will the people of God be doing?
[time=2075] They'll be gathering together.
[time=2077] Worshiping the God who made it all possible.
[time=2082] I say we practice now for what will be in our future.
[time=2086] Can I get a name in?
[time=2087] I want to ask you just to bow your heads and ponder how you can be committed to gathering.
[time=2091] How you can be committed.
[time=2093] How you can be committed to worshiping with your life.
[time=2096] So that we can illustrate the gospel putting others before ourself.
[time=2099] Make revival come about.
[time=2101] Be an obedient to God.
[time=2103] Practicing for heaven.
[time=2105] And right now in the silence of this moment I want to ask you just to pause and reflect.
[time=2109] Believers in the room.
[time=2111] What has God called you to focus on?
[time=2113] Or read, adjust your focus perhaps.
[time=2117] Those of you who are here and you would say I just don't know that I know that I know that if I were to die today I'd spend eternity in heaven.
[time=2122] That I've got a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ.
[time=2126] Don't let anything steal this moment from you.
[time=2128] I want to ask you to pause.
[time=2129] The gospel, you've heard it clearly today.
[time=2131] Jesus paid it all.
[time=2132] It's through his shed blood.
[time=2133] That's the good news.
[time=2134] That he paid the price for your sin and for mine.
[time=2137] He rose from the dead.
[time=2138] He lives today because he lives.
[time=2140] You can have eternal life, not just for the future, but for right now.
[time=2144] And he wants you to live in that.
[time=2146] He wants you to be a son or a daughter of his.
[time=2148] He tore the curtain.
[time=2149] Stop trying to close it.
[time=2150] Walk through it into his presence today and ask him in your own words to save you.
[time=2154] Anyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
[time=2157] Right now in the quiet of this moment will you reach out to him through prayer.
[time=2161] Ask him to do it.
[time=2162] And he will do it in Jesus' name.
