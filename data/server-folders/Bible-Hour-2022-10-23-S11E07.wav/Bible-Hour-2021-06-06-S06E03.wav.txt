[time=0] I was talking with a person who was in a small group that my wife and I used to be in this morning
[time=6] And we had a good run there and that met small group. We're another small group Right now, and I cannot tell you friends how the small groups that my wife and I have been and have changed our lives
[time=16] The last few weeks Kevin has been asking you to go on Facebook and weigh in with comments
[time=23] And our question for the week is along those lines. We would love to hear from you How has being in small community in a small group changed your life?
[time=33] I will try my best to go back and revisit your answers I did not go back and visit your answers first service I asked for input and didn't go back and read them. I'll do better this this hour. I promise I will read your answers
[time=46] How has being in a small group changed your life? I know that that's gonna be very different for people in seasons of their lives
[time=54] because of your work because of your responsibilities, but I am Resolutely committed as your care and adult ministries pastor to help you get connected in whatever way that we can
[time=65] And I'll tell you why this morning as we proceed last year We talked about John 15 and abiding Maybe you were here for that we talked about what the word abiding means that the word abiding means something like make yourself at home
[time=80] We had my daughter's Graduation open house yesterday, and we tried our best to be able to feel comfortable in that room My wife worked tirelessly for weeks to get ready for it And it was a triumph and my daughter felt celebrated. We were so so happy to see all of our friends and family all there together
[time=97] Hospitality make yourself at home come be with us come sit come eat come talk
[time=103] That's what abiding means in John 15 that vision of abiding means make yourself at home something like that and
[time=111] Beyond that in John 15. He kind of spells out what abiding looks like on the ground. What does make yourself at home?
[time=117] Look like what looks like finding your core Identity in Christ not in things that you do not in your work Not in the things that not in your your activities, but who you are at the deepest core of who you are shaped by Jesus
[time=133] That's the vision of abiding that he cast for us. It also means to associate With Christ's righteousness this morning before any of you got here my brother Chip Clark
[time=144] On this stage talked with the band and he said that we are when we sing songs together
[time=150] We're tilling the soil For what's gonna happen later in the service and this morning over you my brother Chip in the class of 2005 Chris beta and friends
[time=163] Saying over you the gospel God so loved the world That he say he came among us to save us that whoever believes in him will live forever We associate ourselves with Christ's righteousness This is what he we are called you are ready for that friends You have been prepared to receive that because of the worship team this morning I'm so grateful to associate with that righteousness means that I see myself through that lens what abiding looks like abiding in Christ
[time=194] Looks like I my deepest identity is defined in him and then beyond that my righteousness my right standing with God comes
[time=202] Through Jesus To be a follower of Christ looks like I believe that Christ has done everything please hear me The Christ has done everything necessary for my salvation forever and completely and I associate with that
[time=218] I confess with my mouth Jesus's Lord and believe in my heart that God raised in from the dead the Bible says you will be saved we believe it
[time=226] We believe it. I believe it for you a Biting looks like that to truly lastly to truly understand by way of review the nature of your relationship to Christ that you are
[time=239] Organically connected like the vine and the branches you are and whoever comes to him. He will not turn away
[time=246] He will not turn away Dave rosner this morning jump in Dave I can I can attest that he was jumping without his guitar earlier today. I love you Dave Dave said you mentioned that that that scene the woman caught an adultery running on the ground you guys ever wonder what he wrote in the ground I
[time=264] Do sometimes nobody wonders that bit me? Do you ever wonder Ryan when you're on the ground? Okay?
[time=269] So I don't know what he wrote in the ground, but here's a guess It's fun to think about I think you wrote on the ground mercy triumphs over judgment Great You guys can probably do better mercy triumphs over judgment his brother James was there
[time=290] His brother James was there and he saw him write it and some years later. He wrote a letter and he said those words
[time=297] Mercy triumphs over judgment. I believe it to truly understand the nature of your relationship with Christ is to get that
[time=304] and Abiding being in community looks like all of those things dear friends and now we come to John 21
[time=312] Please go to Facebook and tell us how small groups change life. We'll come back to it later I'll do I'll do better this time. I promise Let's read John 21 the first 14 verses. This is an amazing story You know this story and I can't wait to read it over you this morning as we get started today John 21
[time=329] After this we'll talk more about what that was later on today what the after this was Do you just revealed himself again to the disciples by the sea of Tiberius and he revealed himself in this way?
[time=340] Simon Peter Thomas called the twin Nathaniel of Canada and Galilee the sons of Zebedee and two others of his disciples
[time=346] We're together Take note Simon Peter said to them. I am going fishing. They said to him. We will go with you
[time=355] They went out and got in the boat, but that night they caught nothing I'm sure maybe some of you have been there. I Have at least as Day was breaking Jesus stood on the shore disciples did not know it was Jesus Do you said to them children? Do you have any fish? They answered him? No He said to them cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find some
[time=380] So they cast it and now that they were not able to haul it in because of the quantity of Fish that a disciple whom Jesus loved therefore said to Peter. It's the Lord When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord. He put on his outer garment
[time=396] He was stripped for work and threw himself into the sea The other disciples came in the boat dragging the net full of fish where they were not far from the land But a hundred yards off When they got out on land they saw a charcoal fire in place with fish laid out on it and bread
[time=413] Jesus said to them bring some of the fish you just caught So Simon Peter went aboard hauled the net ashore full of large fish a hundred and fifty three of them
[time=425] And although there were so many the net was not torn Jesus said to them come and have breakfast none of the disciples dared ask him. Who are you?
[time=433] They knew it was the Lord Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them and so with the fish This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead
[time=446] This is God's word. Let's pray as we start God. I pray that you would meet us in this story today
[time=453] It is a story God. It's a true story There were 153 fish It really happened And got all of us come to this room come to this broadcast However, we're here today God become as a jumbled combination of all kinds of experiences and hopes and dreams and doubts and joys and fears and all of it
[time=474] Would you please meet us where we are today?
[time=476] Just like Jesus does with the disciples in this story. I Pray that in his name with thanksgiving amen The first point in your outlines friends if you're following along on the app or you're taking notes is that Jesus reveals himself in
[time=490] community Jesus reveals himself in community The Apostle Paul who wrote half of what we call the New Testament Did meet Jesus on his own? That is true and straight away was commissioned to minister to communities of people and
[time=509] Gathered people around him as his brothers and co-laborers together So don't miss that there are no lone rangers in the kingdom of God none of them
[time=520] I'd defy you to find some this morning to reveal Twice that word is used in verse one. Take a look to reveal is to make visible and I note friends this Jesus
[time=533] wants to be known He wants to be known he isn't hiding out. It's not some cosmic game of hide and seek
[time=542] Do your best, you know here I am He wants to be found known seen they want he wants the disciples to see him
[time=553] We mentioned before after this in John 20 He's revealed himself to them two times already and he invites Thomas to touch him Earlier in John 20 twice after he was somebody's already appeared to them now the disciples have gone back to Galilee
[time=567] The Sea of Tiberius in verse one is the Sea of Galilee But 75 miles north of Jerusalem, so they're back there now. They're back to their routine
[time=576] Which for Peter includes fishing and he meets them where they are The manner in which he reveals himself to disciples. It's kind of what we're gonna talk about this morning
[time=586] In verse two, we see seven of them are hanging out together and know that maybe you're confused by why there are all these names in the Bible
[time=594] I've talked about this before from this from this stage There are names in the Bible because people matter to God People matter to God and the thing you'll matters to God I know it's hard to say something so if you ever come across the name of the Bible and you can't pronounce it Just read the first letter and go on But those those are people that matter to God you guys so don't skip those names as God knows your name He knows your struggles. He knows your fears. He knows you. He knows all about you Whatever else we are to make of the story friends start with the fact that they are hanging out
[time=626] together seven of them In Galilee and Peter goes Let's go fishing and the guys are like alright. Let's go fishing. That's what friendship looks like by the way
[time=638] It's hey, I want to go fishing like me too. We're friends. That's how friendship works Peter announces that he's going fishing they go with him The fishing here looks like they would surround the fish with these nets They would cast our nets to be weighted nets They drop them in the water and kind of corner the fish around they're dropping that on top and pull it out That's how it goes. They didn't do very well They weren't doing very well his friends tell them they'll go with him But you know this doesn't doesn't turn out as you know in this story. They have already seen Jesus They've already touched Jesus. They've received the Holy Spirit from him in chapter 20 and now they've come back to what's familiar
[time=677] Not knowing maybe what when they're gonna see him again. He goes go to Galilee. I'll see you later literally it's what he says and They're just Peter says I'm gonna do what I do. I'm gonna go fishing The disciples don't know what to do so they do what's necessary in taking this initiative They put themselves in a place where Christ meets them Here is the simple truth attested to you by the saints that when we are uncertain what to do
[time=703] We should simply do our duty and God will guide Sometimes obedience has to come first guys and the feelings fall after it. I know you're not gonna feel like it like being obedient
[time=713] But do what do what God has told you to do and the feelings will come Kids in the room. I know this is important. I know that you want to feel it all the time, but you won't You won't feel it all the time and if you would be obedient God will take care of the rest But that's what he requires of us simple acts of obedience. I love it that help comes at sunrise
[time=733] I just like that. It's very poetic in the story. The Sun comes up and there's Jesus on the shore
[time=739] Even though he had appeared to them in John 20. He is at this moment distant from them a little bit
[time=746] But he reveals himself in community back in an axe to which is a little bit ahead of time after the gospel of John
[time=752] We see this in Acts chapter two. It's this is the $64,000 question if you're old, you know that reference if you don't let's just say the crucial question kids
[time=762] The most important question is you guys there nobody responded with that $64,000 question. Are you too young for all that?
[time=768] Okay, got it Acts 2 42. This is what was going on in the early church and 64,000 dark question The most important question is how much this is for them. How much of it is for us?
[time=780] And we'll talk about that. You know our elders our leaders are working this out day by day It's an important conversation verse 42 They devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and the fellowship fellowship the breaking of bread and prayers and
[time=795] awe came on every soul and many wonders and signs are being done through the apostles and all who believed were together and
[time=802] had all things in common and They were selling their possessions and belongings and giving the proceeds to all as any had need and day by day
[time=814] Taking the temple together and breaking bread in their homes. They received their food with glad and generous hearts. They received their food
[time=823] Praising God and having favor with all the people and the Lord added their number day by day those who were being saved In Colossians 1 Paul says that he That these disciples and he had been called to make known to make the word of God fully known in verse 26 says
[time=838] That this mystery has been revealed for a long it was hidden But now it's been revealed for long ages past and he meets these guys on the shore the sea and says
[time=850] I'm here. It's me meets them right where they're at. I love that Verse 5 John 21 He says to them children I think it's kind of sending I think it's like I think it's like hey guys. Hey guys 100 yards away your voice carries a pretty long way on the water. I'm told Hey guys you got any fish and they're like no, can you hear their shoulders? No fish
[time=876] You know and Peter is a fisherman. He's in some yahoo like me going out to fish. He's a professional literally No fish It's probably embarrassing right if you're a fisherman or you get catching a fit. What are you just a man?
[time=891] Not a fisherman He doesn't rebuke Peter fishing with his friends. He doesn't say what are you fishing for Peter?
[time=899] You should be doing the work of the ministry. He doesn't do that He says, how are you doing?
[time=906] How is it going with you today?
[time=908] Are you doing all right?
[time=911] He offers them help After a long night of fruitless labor. He offers them help
[time=919] Something in there guys something in there about following after following the manner of Jesus
[time=925] Verse 6
[time=932] He said cast the net on the right side of the boat and you'll find some Blindly throwing the net in the water is not how this goes That's not how we fish. We do this, right? That's not how they fished. You drop the nets in You surround the fish that goes on top. That's how it works. You don't just cast the net at random But that's what Peter does Verse 6 They cast it and now they were not able to haul it in because the quantity of fish
[time=962] You don't have to even understand fully to obey Just do it do what he says to do. That's not complicated and I think there's value in that friends. I do
[time=973] Simple acts of obedience to Jesus are always the best course of action
[time=979] And you don't have to understand or feel it to be obedient Preaching to myself now That's where we all are friends and I encourage you in that way That just being obedient is what God asks us to do And the rest will follow after it Nobody would throw a net out of their boat at random just I hope we get some that's that's something I would do
[time=1004] But not Peter But he dies Verse 7 The disciple whom Jesus loved therefore is said to Peter it is the lord. It's the lord. It's him
[time=1019] It's him Sometimes we need each other to recognize God at work for our good Sometimes The disciple whom Jesus loved is gotta be john. It's gotta be john And I don't think he's sticking it to people he does that earlier in the gospel where he says that peter and john raised to the tomb and peter
[time=1038] And john got there first and he meant that that's something happens earlier in john's gospel. I think this is how he talks about himself
[time=1044] This is john talking It's the lord when simon peter heard he doesn't even see jesus yet doesn't know it just hears it from john
[time=1055] What's he do?
[time=1057] Just jumps in reminds me that scene in forest gump when lieutenant dan shows up on the on the shore And forest gump is like hey lieutenant dan is jumps in the water And this boat just keeps on going that's my first and last forest gump reference of the day He makes a fool of himself
[time=1079] And that's what peter does too he doesn't care second point you're at one Do whatever you have to do to get close to jesus Do whatever you need to do to get close to jesus He doesn't he's not hiding He's not far from any one of us. He wants to be known he wants to be found All you have to do is reach out draw close to god and he will draw close to you. That's james for and verse eight
[time=1107] Draw close to god and he will draw close to you. That is a promise It's a promise believe it believe it He put on his armory garment strip for work threw himself in the sea peter is a ready
[time=1123] Fire aim kind of a guy. I love that about peter. He just goes He's willing to be made a fool of For jesus sake I think that's that's marvelous. This is the right reaction to recognizing jesus just go Verse eight Other disciples came in the boat Drag in the net full of fish. They weren't far from the land but hundred yards off. I don't know about you
[time=1152] That's a long way to swim And maybe peter hadn't thought it through but I love that about he just doesn't count the cost he just goes The first stage of an iron man he's doing so he's swimming they drag the net full of fish later on peters peters just that guy
[time=1165] Verse eight again, hundred yards off In Judaism a sign of god's favor and blessing was a lot of catching a big catch of fish
[time=1176] I have felt god's disfavor Sometimes out on the lake Haven't quite got that this is a remarkable catch of fish
[time=1189] verse nine When they get out on land they saw a charcoal fire in place jesus's weighed in whether charcoal or gas grilling is better. He's weighed in here. It's charcoal In case you're wondering They didn't have gas back then just so you know that's that's how that works on no gas back then Okay, got it. Good. Okay Who among us has not marveled at the spiritual power of bonfires
[time=1217] It's amazing. It only takes a spark remember that to get a fire going. It's it's it's it's marvelous
[time=1224] It's spiritual. It's powerful and he does it right here There's no big sermon There's no program There's just come sit down by the fire you're tired
[time=1242] Fish laid out on it verse nine and bread he said to them bring some of the fish you've just caught He made the disciples comfortable and welcome around his fire eating breakfast
[time=1255] He practices hospitality Everywhere I go in the world everywhere I have gone in the world I marvel at the hospitality of the church. I marvel at it. I marvel at it
[time=1271] It is a great blessing Making people feel at home is powerful And being in community friends looks a lot like that looks a lot like that It's the hanging out That causes the disciples to see him To see him to know him. It didn't stop with hanging out It wasn't just hanging out. There's more to do But it begins there. It's one of the three ways that he reveals himself to the disciples after his resurrection verse 11 Simon Peter went aboard And hauled that ashore full of large fish that's a lot of fish 153 it says Large fish these aren't sardines That's not a large fish as far as I know Okay, a large fish. That's a lot of fish Jay 150 that's a lot of large fish 153 of them. That's a big fish So I don't know what they were there, but they were big and he hang he hauls him in the shore He takes initiative. He's a leader Upon this rock Jesus said I'll build my church We heard that earlier as well I didn't show Dave my notes ahead of time Verse 12, this is the whole thing What did Jesus say Now listen to you guys. I got something to say You sit down What'd he say come have breakfast Come have breakfast Come be with me Come be with me. That's that's his message. That's his program. It doesn't stop there This isn't the whole story, but right now that's what they need come have breakfast None of the disciples dared ask him who are you they just knew
[time=1384] They knew He offers them his company and his kindness and mark chapter three
[time=1392] When he calls the disciples, there are three things that they're supposed to do and mark three starting in verse 13
[time=1398] He goes up in the mountain. He calls to him those whom he himself desired. They came to him
[time=1404] Verse 14 says he appointed 12 whom he also named apostles. That means the one sent out
[time=1410] That they might be with him Send them out to preach and have authority to cast out the demons the first reason we often skip over this
[time=1420] We go right to preaching and demons, but the first reason is to be with him And he is with him
[time=1431] 75 miles is a long way to go up to galley, but he went up all the way up there Just had breakfast. How far would you go to have breakfast?
[time=1438] How far would you go to meet a friend who is in need?
[time=1444] What would you do?
[time=1446] What have others done for you?
[time=1448] He called his disciples to follow After him and he calls them and he appoints them first of all just to be with him
[time=1459] life on life together At this point, I want to read your responses to the question
[time=1470] Regarding how things how being in small groups has changed your life
[time=1477] Whitley says we are truly in life with our group. We celebrate we mourn we pray our children are connected. We're doing life together
[time=1487] Rick says recently served by our by our class by my sir after my surgery with meals bailing hay
[time=1494] Indiana community is bailing hay After so things I couldn't do physically. I can't do those things myself. You can't do one another's by yourself mark says
[time=1505] Life people life people involvement looks like being fully known and being outrageously supported
[time=1511] It's a great phrase Courtney says for me It's provided a small trusted group to pray to come alongside and bear one of those burdens to celebrate with each other
[time=1523] They are an extension of family to me Friends, this is not some program that we're selling We aren't selling life groups Like it says in the car like some beat up car ice cold air, you know, it's not an ice cold air situation The ceiling for you is very very low without small community and I love that you're in this room I love that you're watching online. I love that you're here. I love that you're here But just this is not going to do it for you circles are better than rose And all those people in my pocket can bear can bear witness and you can too
[time=1558] I I celebrate it with you friends this morning not as an idea not as a theory But in real life with you together that you need to be and I know that it's complicated for you with your work
[time=1568] I know that you're tired. I know it's a sacrifice. I'm telling you every sacrifice you put in for community will be rewarded
[time=1575] doubly My wife and I have our lives have been changed in small community Our small group right now They're indispensable and we're tired on a sunday night We're tired. We've had long weeks. We're getting ready for the work week every single time. I could not imagine not going
[time=1594] I invite you into that. I invite you into that John's gospel begins with a soaring theological prologue that he is the word the word became flash dwelt among us
[time=1607] We have seen his glory as the only begotten from the father full of grace and truth
[time=1614] And it ends with breakfast I think that's amazing The same peter who jumped out of the boat in ax 10 a few chapters later
[time=1626] Says that they ate and drank with geists in ax chapter 10 verse 40 They ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. He says it changed my life literally They were with him there is no conflict in early christianity between
[time=1645] Witness and fellowship they serve each other Being together go make christ known. It's not one of the other You don't have to choose you get both They inform each other on two occasions in john 20. Jesus says peace be with you when he appears to disciples
[time=1662] I think his statement come and have breakfast was basically the same thing It's okay guys Come have breakfast He himself and art is our peace. There is no need to be afraid in his presence Peace be with you verse 13 Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them And so with the fish This was the third time that jesus was revealed to the disciples After he was raised from the dead When he fed the five thousand they were the ones serving other the ones being served by jesus
[time=1702] In earlier in the gospels they needed to be the one serving because they needed to see What's happening? Oh Now they're tired. They're worn out. They're scared. They're on the run from every authority in the land It's gonna be come at breakfast Come at breakfast We don't talk about community of black hock because we're selling something because we're not We are trying to faithfully shepherd Each of you toward a full spiritual life And as I wrap up this morning. I just want to walk you through a couple of things in first john two six
[time=1737] Says Whoever says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked what's that look like looks like this
[time=1746] In part it looks like that looks like being Together and this is not being together. It's good. We're together gathering is part of what we do. It's not all that we do
[time=1758] But community is what we need it friends. I know that you could all bear witness if you've had that in your life I know you could do it You did it already As you wrap up again to some things to think about In john chapter one Uh, there's a remarkable interaction with nithaniel and philip and philip tells us brother nithaniel. Hey, we found him We found the messiah and he goes where's he from nazareth? He goes nazareth
[time=1785] Can anything good come out of nazareth anything good come out of fort wane What's he say?
[time=1793] Here's the four spiritual laws. Nope. He says come and see Come and see Come at breakfast Life groups are the primary means of care in our church and you heard it in those testimonies
