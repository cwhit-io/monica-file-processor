[time=0] Good morning, Blackcock.
[time=3] Yeah, I'm the other Kevin.
[time=6] But I'm privileged to be here with you this morning to talk about the Go team in that third leg.
[time=14] Pastor Kevin talked a couple weeks ago about Gather, which is so important to come together in community and fellowship, and what the church is about.
[time=24] And then Steve Webster, Pastor Steve, talked last week about connecting, and how important it is to connect within that fellowship through life groups, through ministries, children, youth, women's ministry, different things.
[time=41] And then I'm going to share today that third leg, which is the Go team and talking about missions.
[time=48] And we are so excited for where God's leading Blackcock.
[time=55] Amazing.
[time=55] We have 42 ministry partners.
[time=58] And when you came, you probably saw tables out front.
[time=62] And don't worry, it's not money changers.
[time=65] And Pastor Rivers didn't flip tables on the way in.
[time=69] But it's actually ministry tables, and a lot of ministries that are local and internal are represented out there.
[time=78] And I know there's a lot of things going on in this service.
[time=82] It's a little longer than usual, but we're providing lunch.
[time=85] So if you want to go out there and visit, I'll talk more about that.
[time=88] And we have hot dogs and brats and chips and drink and whatnot, so we want you to kind of fellowship.
[time=96] It was great just talking to these different ministries that we come alongside.
[time=102] But before I get into the ministry, I want to thank you guys that have been praying for me.
[time=107] And a lot of you may not know, but there was some emails that went out very vague with my health, because I didn't even know what was going on with me.
[time=117] And somewhere a year and a half, two years ago, something happened with my pleural lining into my thoracic area.
[time=127] And it got compromised with strep pneumonia.
[time=131] And it got in to my right lung.
[time=134] Basically, my right lung was filled and closed.
[time=137] And then my diaphragm became fused to that lining.
[time=141] And only 40% of it was opening up.
[time=143] And I had no idea.
[time=145] I thought I had allergies and couldn't breathe once in a while.
[time=149] And so I'm leading a team in Egypt, just the end of April and into May.
[time=154] And the first day I'm at the hotel, and I fall to the ground, and I can't breathe.
[time=158] And I literally thought I was dying and so did our team.
[time=162] And they brought a doctor to the hotel room.
[time=164] Next thing you know, I'm in a hospital in Egypt.
[time=167] And listen, never brag about not being a patient in the hospital.
[time=172] For six decades, I have bragged that I've never been a patient in a hospital in my life.
[time=177] And then all of a sudden, I'm hospitalized twice in two countries in three weeks.
[time=182] So pride comes before destruction and a haughty spirit before the fall.
[time=187] And I felt pretty hard.
[time=189] And God took care of me.
[time=191] They couldn't figure it out.
[time=192] They thought I'd been a chain smoker in Egypt.
[time=195] And they thought I had three or four organs felling.
[time=199] They gave me some antibiotics.
[time=201] I think they were steroids because I was climbing a pyramid the day I got out.
[time=206] And just connecting with the mission team, I was able to eat and enjoy the trip.
[time=211] But I got back to the states, and I was working at the school.
[time=215] That's where I work.
[time=215] And about four days in, I got up that morning.
[time=219] And there again, I just could not breathe.
[time=221] I fell to the ground.
[time=222] And I felt like I was suffocating.
[time=226] Couldn't even take a little breath.
[time=228] And my wife ran me to ER, long story short.
[time=233] They found all that stuff in there doing what I said.
[time=238] And they tried to get it out with chest tubes and then little cameras and pull it.
[time=243] And finally, they just zipped me open.
[time=245] I got a 12-inch scar, and opened me up and got it all out.
[time=249] And I breathe better.
[time=254] [APPLAUSE]
[time=261] And I know God had his hand on me because I should have died a couple of times.
[time=268] But I'm too onry maybe, or he doesn't want me to go yet.
[time=273] And I never felt pain.
[time=275] I still don't feel pain.
[time=276] I feel really good.
[time=278] They just won't let me golf yet.
[time=279] But I can drive now and all that stuff.
[time=282] So I'm excited.
[time=283] And I'm excited to go to New York.
[time=285] I'll be golfing in a week, I think.
[time=287] But I'm so thankful.
[time=289] And I'm thankful for your prayers.
[time=290] Because I got a lot of prayers and emails and texts from kids in the school and people in our church and family
[time=300] back in Idaho where I moved from a year ago.
[time=302] God just took care of me.
[time=303] So thank you so much for that, everybody.
[time=306] So we're going to talk about go this morning.
[time=309] So let's go to Lord and prayer.
[time=311] Father, we just thank you so much that we can gather here this morning.
[time=315] And then we have all these ministry partners represented as well and that we can just press into how you use Blackhawk in amazing ways, Lord.
[time=325] It's humbling the outreach that goes on through this church
[time=333] throughout the world.
[time=335] And we're so thankful, Lord, that we get to be a part of that.
[time=339] So we ask you to go before us now in our time together this morning in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=346] Well, like I said, 42 partners.
[time=350] Our Go team-- we'll show you a picture here-- is made up of couples and individuals that really have a heart for missions.
[time=360] And you can see in this picture our latest mission every that we're sending out, Kimberly White, who's sitting right here.
[time=366] She's going to go in August back to Uganda with her son.
[time=371] And our Go team is like a mission board in a way.
[time=374] We pray about decisions in our missionaries.
[time=379] We come alongside our missionaries through our prayer email.
[time=383] So if you want to be part of that, go to Blackhawk FYI.
[time=386] And just get on the prayer email.
[time=388] You get information and opportunities to pray for all of our missionary partners throughout the world.
[time=396] It's a great opportunity to learn about them as well.
[time=400] And then we also come alongside our short-term mission teams.
[time=406] We also come alongside missionaries, like Corbin Miller that just came back for six months.
[time=411] We have two vehicles that have been donated to the church for missionaries to use when they come back to the states.
[time=417] We help them with finding a place to live, short-term, if they need that, and make opportunities for them to share here at church in chapels.
[time=429] We use Corbin a lot, worship.
[time=430] I mean, we use them every day.
[time=432] It seemed like in a good way in his family.
[time=435] And we're so blessed to have the kids in the school for that six month.
[time=438] So that Go team is really ground central for our missions.
[time=445] But everybody else, as you'll see, is part of our mission team in one way or the other.
[time=451] So Blackhawk has a great footprint on the world.
[time=455] And you can see that we are throughout the world in so many places and how we're impacting.
[time=461] And I'm going to be sharing with you in just a little bit and give you kind of a pie chart so you can see what we do with our missions, both locally, in the 1.5, to the counties and the city of Fort Wayne and the counties around throughout the nation and then throughout the world.
[time=479] So our Texas morning is Acts 1 versus 1 through 11.
[time=484] And we're going to have it up here on the screen for you.
[time=486] And we're going to see here that Luke, who wrote Acts as a doctor, was very known for detail.
[time=496] And he doesn't miss out in Acts as well.
[time=499] Pick it up in verse one.
[time=500] It says, oh, in the first book, oh, Theopolis, I have dealt with all that Jesus began to do and teach until the day when he was taken up after he had given the commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen.
[time=516] He presented himself alive to them after his suffering by many proofs, appearing to them during 40 days and speaking about the kingdom of God.
[time=526] And while staying with them, he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which he said, you heard from me, for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit, not many days from now.
[time=545] So we have a lot of things going on in there.
[time=550] He talks about Jesus being alive after the resurrection for 40 days.
[time=554] We know historically we have over 200 personal sightings of Jesus being alive after the resurrection.
[time=563] So there's proof, obviously, that he's resurrected.
[time=566] But something else is going on there, right?
[time=572] What has taken place with the disciples?
[time=575] You guys all know the disciples for three and a half years.
[time=579] They were kind of misfits in a way.
[time=581] Pastor Kevin Rivers would call them knuckleheads, right?
[time=585] Because constantly they were lacking faith when Jesus wanted to do something.
[time=590] They were often keeping the people away from Jesus that he wanted to come near him, like children, or a tax collector, or a leper or whatever.
[time=602] And even when Jesus was traveling, heading to Jerusalem
[time=609] for that last week, that passion week, three times Jesus shared, hey, I'm going to Jerusalem.
[time=617] They're gonna arrest me falsely.
[time=620] They're gonna beat me and they're gonna kill me.
[time=623] And how did the disciples react to that?
[time=627] The first time he'd shared it, Peter went over to him and rebuked him.
[time=631] And what did Jesus say?
[time=634] Get behind me Satan, you know?
[time=636] That kind of probably put Peter just, you know, right in his shoes.
[time=641] But the other two times when they were traveling down to Jericho and then up to Jerusalem, Jesus shares that again.
[time=647] And what were the disciples doing?
[time=650] Well, he is sharing that.
[time=652] They were arguing over who is the greatest of them.
[time=656] Which one is the greatest, well, I'm the greatest.
[time=658] Well, no, I'm much greater.
[time=660] And then the third time, not only were they arguing over who was great, but James and John came up to him and asked, can we sit on the right and left a view in the kingdom?
[time=670] This is where these guys, minds were.
[time=672] And so as Jesus gets arrested and he's going to get crucified, they're hiding, they're cowering, they're running, they're denying, all the way up to his death, but then he gets resurrected.
[time=691] And what happens to the disciples from that resurrection?
[time=696] It's right there in the verse we read, right?
[time=701] The Holy Spirit will come upon them.
[time=705] It happens in chapter two at Pentecost.
[time=708] The Holy Spirit comes upon them because Jesus has left and he said we would not be alone.
[time=714] And he gives us the Holy Spirit to dwell within us.
[time=717] And what happens to the disciples from that point on?
[time=720] They begin to speak with great wisdom and confidence.
[time=724] They're bold, they're courageous, they begin to heal, they begin to baptize, they begin to lead the world in the first church and they even get martyred for the Lord.
[time=736] You see, that's the same thing true to us.
[time=739] If we're a believer in Jesus Christ, if we've asked him into our heart, the Holy Spirit comes and dwells in us.
[time=747] And we too have that same power, that same power for the Lord.
[time=751] We don't always tap into it because we allow our flesh to get ahead of it, but if we would back up and allow the Holy Spirit to lead, he will show up.
[time=762] And I can attest, I don't know how many times I've been witnessing with somebody, been out in the mission field and I've said things and I know I didn't know.
[time=770] And some of you can attest to that if you've been in those situations.
[time=773] And things have happened that shouldn't have happened.
[time=777] And I'll even share about some of those, just with me personally coming up.
[time=782] So let's look at our pie chart.
[time=786] This is our missions and I'm gonna just fly through a lot of stuff for you, but feel free to go to our website or Blackhawk FYR, I'm gonna give you some stuff as you walk out the doors, not me personally, but we will to help connect you with different things.
[time=802] And I'll talk about that in a bit.
[time=803] But you see our pie chart, there's really four categories that we give missions to.
[time=808] We give over $200,000 in our budget to mission partners.
[time=813] And then we do our Go funds, Jesus birthday offering at the end of the year.
[time=818] And this year we did over another 200 on top of that.
[time=821] That's a huge commitment.
[time=824] And it just shows the heart of this congregation to be obedient to the great commission like Chip talked about and to go.
[time=834] What a great thing.
[time=835] We have retired missionaries that we support.
[time=838] I'll talk about that.
[time=840] Local Fort Wayne, 9%.
[time=841] I wanna see that number really grow and you'll see those partners out there.
[time=845] 26% nationally and then a big one internationally, 59%.
[time=852] So before we break those out individually and I share with you them, let's continue in verse six through eight of Acts.
[time=860] So when they had come together, they asked him, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?
[time=867] He said to them, it is not for you to know the times or seasons that the fathers had fixed by his own authority.
[time=875] But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you.
[time=879] There it is again, right?
[time=881] The Holy Spirit's gonna come upon you guys, just wait.
[time=884] And you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the end of the earth.
[time=892] So there it is.
[time=893] Verse eight is probably our cornerstone today for go, right?
[time=898] We're called to be the Lord's witnesses and we're called to witness in Jerusalem, in Judea, which is just south of Jerusalem, in Samaria, which is a little further north and then to the ends of the earth.
[time=916] And some of your versions may say the uttermost parts.
[time=921] When I think uttermost parts, I think of Wisconsin, right?
[time=924] That's where most of the dairies are, uttermost, no.
[time=928] Now uttermost is just to the extreme, right?
[time=930] The end of the world.
[time=931] And Jerusalem is ground zero.
[time=934] Your Jerusalem that you're called to be a witness is where you live.
[time=940] It's your neighborhood.
[time=942] And I personally, I moved here a year ago in June and I couldn't reach out to most of my neighborhood, right?
[time=949] COVID and people just kept their space.
[time=952] I think I actually met one neighbor that I met well and everybody else just kind of stayed away and respected people's space.
[time=960] And now this summer, it's the opposite.
[time=963] People are stopping in their cars on the road and getting out and coming over and talking.
[time=968] It's almost nuts, you know?
[time=969] Everybody is starving to connect.
[time=972] And that's so exciting.
[time=974] I use this app.
[time=976] It's been around a while.
[time=977] You may know it.
[time=978] It's called Bless Every Home.
[time=979] And you can download it free on your phone or your device.
[time=983] I have it on my laptop.
[time=985] And this is my neighborhood.
[time=987] That's Google Earth, so it's a little old 'cause everything's filled in now.
[time=990] But you can see the different colors, all those houses.
[time=994] And I know their names.
[time=996] I know who they are.
[time=998] I pray for them.
[time=999] I get five of them sent to me every day.
[time=1001] They even give me the prayers.
[time=1002] I know what they're having for dinner tonight, so I know it's not really that big brother.
[time=1007] But it really helps me know my neighbors and be intentional about knowing who they are and really praying for them.
[time=1014] You know, imagine if every Christian, just in America, did that.
[time=1020] And we became intentional about our neighborhoods.
[time=1023] Now you might live out in the country, but you can still connect with people in the area.
[time=1027] You can get as many as you want.
[time=1029] Bring them in.
[time=1030] But what a great way to be in our Jerusalem and be intentional about impacting the gospel.
[time=1037] So we're gonna look at a sliver of our pie here.
[time=1039] This first one is our local Fort Wayne.
[time=1044] And we have 12 of these represented out there today when you go out there to the right.
[time=1049] And these local partners, we help financially, but we help donating things, right?
[time=1055] You guys donated some raincoats and underwear backaways for the rescue mission.
[time=1064] You know, I kind of joke, we equipped all the flashers in Fort Wayne, but that really didn't happen.
[time=1070] They got to use those really well and I talked to them about it.
[time=1073] But you can see here in these collages, we got a lot of pictures of these local ministries.
[time=1080] They need people to come serve with them.
[time=1082] And it was so good to talk to so many of them after first service.
[time=1087] And just so many neat ways that you can connect.
[time=1091] Very easy with a minimal commitment.
[time=1093] We have out there, we have in as much, which is helping people get on their feet, giving them food, clothing, but also not just giving it to them, but guiding them through counsel and help to make better decisions so they don't have to be in that position again down the road.
[time=1114] We have the Hope Center helping with unplanned pregnancies and coming alongside young gals and even families and helping them with education and health issues and different things.
[time=1127] We have the rescue mission, which I talked about, but it's helping the homeless and getting them meals, but also there's a men's ministry.
[time=1135] There's just great opportunities to connect with them.
[time=1138] We have the Allen County Jail chaplaincy.
[time=1141] And these guys and gals that are incarcerated, they've sinned, they've made mistakes, they've broken laws, but they still need Jesus, right?
[time=1151] And we need to go.
[time=1153] I've gone into jails a lot.
[time=1154] I love going in there because you have a captive audience when you teach, you know.
[time=1158] And yeah, they can't walk out on you, you know, it's really good.
[time=1162] So, but you can make a huge impact, because they're focused and they want to hear and they're looking for answers and they need truth.
[time=1173] We also have a greater Fort Wayne campus ministry and they're part of Fort Wayne Purdue and they've been part of the Tech campus reaching college students.
[time=1183] And of course COVID's hampered a lot of these ministries, but we also have the 410 ministry represented out there.
[time=1191] And I got to visit their new building that they're going to revamp.
[time=1196] And it's just coming alongside these women that are in adult entertainment, you know, sex clubs and whatnot and how they come alongside them, pull them out, help them get jobs, take care of their kids, daycare, what a great vision.
[time=1214] The International House is out there and great opportunity to connect with refugees and people new to Fort Wayne.
[time=1223] And, you know, they look for people to do ESL, people to just come alongside and mentor and disciple.
[time=1231] Great opportunity and a great work they're doing there.
[time=1234] They even have a men's, just recently just got done with a men's cave, so to speak.
[time=1239] It's full of tools and refugee men and people like us can come alongside them and build things and fix things and work on a car.
[time=1251] Great opportunity, city life.
[time=1254] That's working down in inner city and Fort Wayne, working together with youth, helping them make good choices, giving them options and opportunities to do things.
[time=1267] We also have a Samaritan initiative, Bailey Bated just finished the class.
[time=1271] I was part of that and it's just cross-cultural stuff that we're doing.
[time=1276] It's very similar to what we're going to do in New York.
[time=1278] We're going to cross over to other cultures.
[time=1281] There's over 800 people groups just in the five boroughs in New York.
[time=1286] And it's amazing, all of them, three and a half million that were not born in the United States that lived there.
[time=1293] That's more people than in Chicago.
[time=1296] So a great opportunity.
[time=1297] We're going to do a lot of training and then bring that back and tie it in with our Samaritan initiative.
[time=1302] We also have Safe Families, which is coming alongside families, a new partner, helping them get on their feet, donating a lot of things to bless them in a mighty way.
[time=1316] We have Renew, which is upscale donations.
[time=1321] So if you have anything that you want to donate, that's something you would buy probably, but you just don't want any more, right?
[time=1328] Like kind of like a yard sale, but a little better quality.
[time=1330] And we've been blessed by Renew.
[time=1332] It was started by some school people like a decade ago, a little over, I think, and the profit has gone to the school endowment.
[time=1342] And we've raised over 700,000 to date just from people fighting stuff, you know?
[time=1349] And God has blessed that we can use for scholarships and blessing families.
[time=1354] So that's a great one.
[time=1356] So I just encourage you on these local partners to invest.
[time=1360] And if anything, if you go out there and you don't want to commit a lot of time or you don't want to sign up, you just want to get a hot dog and go, that's okay.
[time=1369] But stop by some of those tables and just tell them, thank you for serving.
[time=1375] Thank you for making our community a better place to live.
[time=1379] The next slice of pie is our USA, our local,
[time=1386] it's about 26% and it accompanies like translators, Wycliffe translators, translating the Bible.
[time=1395] There's so many groups that don't have the Bible in their tongue, their native tongue, so there's still long ways to go.
[time=1403] Counseling services, they reach out to pastors and missionaries.
[time=1407] We also have a marriage in the raw, which is marriage ministries that help do events and help people strengthen their marriages.
[time=1416] Crew, you're probably familiar with crew, I was part of the first chapter ever, ever created with Campus Crusade for Christ at UCLA.
[time=1426] And now it's over 200 locations worldwide, just impacting that age in a mighty way.
[time=1433] Mission Aviation Fellowship, that's a cool, cool ministry.
[time=1438] It's actually right near my hometown in Idaho, where their headquarters are, but they own and support all these small planes that have bush pilots that fly mission teams and missionaries into the uttermost parts of the world, into villages and places that you can't get to, unless you have a really good pilot that knows how to land in very small places.
[time=1466] And if you ever saw the movie "End of the Spirit," you know, that was using one of those planes as well.
[time=1471] So nationally, it's not just the United States, Canada, Mexico, but doing things more local, but yet stepping out, I'd encourage you to connect with a missionary, go on a short-term mission like our New York trip, you'll be changed in a big way.
[time=1490] I had the opportunity growing up in Southern California, and so our church constantly went across the border in Mexico and come alongside orphanages and a lot of the churches that were very poor and just helped them with programs, helped them build something, do a VBS, just come alongside them.
[time=1510] And one of our pastors, I wasn't there, but I was on that team and he was with a bunch of people from our team and they were watching these kids play with toys.
[time=1519] And kids in Mexico, they have nothing.
[time=1522] So when they get something, like these kids had tops.
[time=1525] And I think they got these tops given to them like three years ago, but they could still spin those tops on dirt and make them spin, you know?
[time=1534] They just cherished them.
[time=1536] And as they were playing with these tops, a score pin came out and a score pin came over by the kids and the kids grabbed some sticks and started taunting the score pin.
[time=1546] And the score pin gets its tell, you know, and it's just like, trying to sting them and go after the sticks, you know?
[time=1552] Their dad came out and this is the neat thing about missions is God reveals truth out of such simple things.
[time=1561] Their dad came out and he took the two sticks and he took one and he pushed down the score pin and then he took the other stick and he scraped the stinger out.
[time=1570] And then he picked the score pin up and it's just sitting there in his hand, do, do, do, do.
[time=1575] But what happened?
[time=1576] The stinger's gone, right?
[time=1578] It can't hurt anymore.
[time=1580] And we're all just standing, I wasn't there, but they're all standing there and like, that's the gospel right there, right?
[time=1588] Jesus Christ did that for us.
[time=1590] He took the sting out of death.
[time=1592] It says in 1 Corinthians 15, 55, oh death, where's your sting?
[time=1597] And we have used that story in so many funerals to give hope for people because for a believer, death doesn't have a sting anymore.
[time=1608] Yeah, this body, it's gonna end.
[time=1611] I mean, mine should end it several times in the last month, but eventually it's gonna end, but I'm gonna be with the Lord to die his gain.
[time=1619] That death has no bondage on me.
[time=1623] My future is in eternity, right?
[time=1627] So I just encourage you, the mission will teach you way more, any capacity you get involved in, than what you give.
[time=1636] It will give back to you, tenfold.
[time=1639] It's like God says, whenever you can't, you can't beat me in, is you can't outgive me.
[time=1645] God says you can't outgive me.
[time=1647] I will always give back more to you.
[time=1649] That's a promise.
[time=1651] I love that.
[time=1652] The next pie we have is our international.
[time=1656] And this is a biggie.
[time=1659] We have 14 international partners right now.
[time=1663] And obviously they take up 59% of our overall budget,
[time=1670] but obviously it costs a lot to travel and to be in international countries and all the things that go with it.
[time=1679] And our international partners, man, it's great to get these stories from them.
[time=1684] It's great to send teams and come alongside them and do ministry with them.
[time=1688] Some of our partners are in the Canary Islands,
[time=1694] Italy, North Africa, France, Papua New Guinea.
[time=1700] We have two in Slovakia, South Africa, Poland, two in Uganda with Kimberly going.
[time=1706] Kenya, we have two, Jordan.
[time=1710] We've just established some in South Sudan.
[time=1714] We have some in Egypt and even Israel.
[time=1719] I connect with a former pastor in Utah.
[time=1723] He's a Bible scholar now and a biblical archeologist.
[time=1729] And he's actually leading our team next March that's going to Israel, we still have some opening.
[time=1734] So if you'd like to do that, please talk to me.
[time=1737] But man, he brings it all to life and you never read the Bible the same again when you go with Joel Kramer.
[time=1744] Great guy and his family's there.
[time=1745] They actually live in Jordan now, but he spends half his time in Israel.
[time=1749] But a great, great ministry, big time.
[time=1754] I've had a great opportunity to go on probably over 20 short-term missions in my life.
[time=1760] And I just want to share you just a great story because when you step out into the mission field, miracles happen.
[time=1770] And maybe it isn't fire coming down from heaven or it isn't maybe somebody being healed, but they're still miracles.
[time=1780] And you really see God work.
[time=1781] He opens doors, he shuts doors and he moves before you.
[time=1785] And I was on a mission trip just in the early 80s, I'd just gone out of college.
[time=1790] And I was the youngest one on this team, but they made me in charge, which I thought was kind of weird.
[time=1796] I felt kind of weird, but whatever the reason, we went into China and we were smuggling Bibles.
[time=1801] And I'll just give you a story of what happened.
[time=1805] We're in Beijing and we're in an airport and we got our Bibles, we got one suitcase, crammed full of Bibles and the other one's got our clothes.
[time=1815] And we're in line and we're going out of the airport.
[time=1818] And there's guards all over with machine guns.
[time=1820] Back in the early 80s they had what was called the crime campaigns and so China was really at high alert.
[time=1826] And we're going through a door and the door we're at has a red light above it.
[time=1833] And then over here's the green door, green light, and nobody's in that line.
[time=1837] They have us all in this line.
[time=1839] The neat thing about us going at that time, we were one of the first groups ever to go into China on an independent visa, which means you're not assigned a government official with you at all times.
[time=1853] Which is pretty hard to smuggle Bibles in China, which is illegal when you have a communist government official with you, right?
[time=1860] So that was great that we could do that.
[time=1862] And a lot of countries are still that way, like Vietnam.
[time=1865] You get assigned, have had assigned Cambodia, different ones still, you have that assignment.
[time=1871] But China, you can do it.
[time=1873] And so we're in this line and as we're going through the line, we look up ahead and everybody in line is having to take their suitcases and put them on the table.
[time=1883] And they're opening them up.
[time=1885] And we're like, you know, we're in deep, do, do, right?
[time=1889] You know, we're like, oh, this ain't good.
[time=1891] We're going to, we're going to get nailed here.
[time=1894] And as we get closer, everybody kind of huddles together.
[time=1898] And so we start praying, you know?
[time=1899] And you pray like you're driving, right?
[time=1902] Because you don't want them to know you're Christian.
[time=1904] Because then they'll know if we close our eyes and we all start praying.
[time=1908] So we're all just praying and we get about 20 people away.
[time=1911] And a guard comes out of nowhere.
[time=1914] And he taps me on the shoulder and he points at just our group.
[time=1919] And he walks us over and he takes us out the door with the green light, right?
[time=1924] What is that, right?
[time=1926] I know, yeah.
[time=1927] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1929] That should not happen.
[time=1931] And it can happen the other way because let me tell you.
[time=1934] So we're in airport in Shanghai.
[time=1938] Same thing.
[time=1939] We're going through with our Bibles.
[time=1941] But this time everybody's in the line to the green light.
[time=1944] Great.
[time=1945] This is good.
[time=1945] And people are just walking through.
[time=1947] And I'm so thankful.
[time=1949] And a guard comes over to just our team.
[time=1953] I'm not making this up.
[time=1954] And he takes our team.
[time=1956] And he takes us over to the red light.
[time=1960] And I have one suitcase that was overweight.
[time=1962] I had to pay extra.
[time=1963] Just packed with Bibles.
[time=1967] And I have a layer of clothes just over the top.
[time=1969] And I'm the first one.
[time=1970] So I put my clothes up there, open it up.
[time=1973] And then I'm really slow about opening the other one.
[time=1977] I'm just like a kid caught red-handed and oh, man.
[time=1982] And I open it up.
[time=1983] And he shifts the clothes.
[time=1987] And he sees one of the Bibles.
[time=1990] And they're about that big.
[time=1991] Mandarin Chinese.
[time=1993] That big.
[time=1993] So he grabs one.
[time=1995] And he flips it over.
[time=1998] And he starts reading.
[time=1999] And then he looks at me.
[time=2001] And you would have thought that stare was like for hours, right?
[time=2006] And then he reads a little bit more.
[time=2008] And then he shut the Bible.
[time=2011] And he closed my suitcase.
[time=2012] And he said, go.
[time=2014] And we went.
[time=2022] But I don't know what happened there.
[time=2025] I know God showed up.
[time=2028] I don't know if that guy was a Christian.
[time=2031] And he knew what he read.
[time=2033] He's part of the Underground Church.
[time=2036] Or I don't know if God blinded his eyes and didn't let him see what he saw.
[time=2043] But what I do know is my Lord showed up.
[time=2052] And we were able to drop our Bibles off, go to 10 makers that connected with the Underground Church.
[time=2058] And we never got caught.
[time=2061] And that's our Lord.
[time=2064] John 1240 says he has blinded their eyes.
[time=2068] And I truly believe that, unless that guy was a believer.
[time=2071] Right now, God is doing amazing things throughout the Middle East and North Africa.
[time=2080] We just got back from Egypt.
[time=2082] In Egypt alone, 10 years ago, they had 300,000 Christians in Egypt.
[time=2089] Mostly Coptic Christians, which are kind of like Greek Orthodox.
[time=2094] A lot of ritual, a lot of icons.
[time=2096] Now today, 10 years later, 10 million Christians in Egypt.
[time=2108] And the majority is evangelical Christians.
[time=2112] I mean, there's amazing stuff happening in these countries where God wasn't even allowed.
[time=2118] Even the government is turning and saying, come, build the church, be in our cities.
[time=2126] And we built the church.
[time=2128] We have the SOHAG church that you guys are familiar with.
[time=2131] You guys help build this church.
[time=2134] Matter of fact, Blackhawk has given $100,000.
[time=2136] There I am preaching on the stage.
[time=2138] $100,000 to this church already.
[time=2142] They're only shy about $40,000 to finish it.
[time=2146] And we can have a pastor in there.
[time=2148] We met with the mayor of this new SOHAG city.
[time=2151] They're building new cities away from the Nile so they can recoup the Nile River and grow crops because they can't even feed their nation because the cities have overcome the only good soil.
[time=2163] Once you go like 10 miles from the Nile, you can't grow anything, right?
[time=2166] It's desert.
[time=2167] And so now they're building these new cities, incredible cities.
[time=2171] SOHAG church is dead center and the mayor is saying,
[time=2179] we want you there.
[time=2180] We want you to be a community center for all our people.
[time=2185] That just doesn't happen or it shouldn't.
[time=2192] But it is.
[time=2194] A great revival.
[time=2197] The door is open right now.
[time=2199] You just need to go.
[time=2200] Lebanon right now has 40% Christians.
[time=2207] Lebanon, Iran is averaging and probably the fastest growing Christian population on the globe, they estimate under severe persecution, 5% a year, Christian growth.
[time=2222] And the more they slam down, just like in China, the more that it grows.
[time=2228] Amazing.
[time=2231] Syria is opening up now.
[time=2233] Yemen, Sudan, South Sudan, where Pastor Kevin went, back in February.
[time=2239] Kenya and Uganda are 80 to 85% Christian now.
[time=2244] Ethiopia at 63%.
[time=2247] God is doing a work there in a mighty way.
[time=2250] And we're excited that we can just be part of it, right?
[time=2254] We just need to go.
[time=2256] So our last pie portion is our retired.
[time=2263] We have missionaries, eight of them that Blackhawk has sent out.
[time=2267] And due to age or health or both, they have come out of the field and they're retired.
[time=2273] And we don't kick them to the curb.
[time=2276] We still support them.
[time=2277] I think that's so honorable.
[time=2290] So there we are.
[time=2291] That's Blackhawk impacting the world, right?
[time=2295] In a mighty way, both locally, nationally and globally.
[time=2300] Let's read a few more verses here and then we'll be done.
[time=2305] Verse nine through 11.
[time=2308] And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, he was lifted up and the cloud took him out of their sight.
[time=2316] That's talking about Jesus.
[time=2318] He was lifting up and he ascended into heaven right in front of the disciples.
[time=2323] And while they were gazing, can you hear in verse 10, into heaven, as he went behold two men stood by them in white robes and said, men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven?
[time=2336] This Jesus who was taken up from you into heaven will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.
[time=2343] And Jesus had already told them, you guys don't need to know the hour nor will I tell you 'cause no one knows the hour but the father, right?
[time=2352] He wasn't gonna let them in on it.
[time=2355] But more importantly, as he ascended up and went away, the disciples are just standing there gawking.
[time=2361] What do we do now?
[time=2364] Is he coming?
[time=2365] But Jesus has already given them their orders.
[time=2369] Jesus has already given them the great commission.
[time=2374] He had called them to go.
[time=2376] Unfortunately, I think right now in America especially,
[time=2382] we have too many Christians, they're just looking up.
[time=2385] They're just waiting for the Lord.
[time=2392] And I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but that can't be your end all because he's asked us to go.
[time=2403] He's asked us to invest.
[time=2405] If you look back at verse eight or main verse, he says, "You will be my witnesses."
[time=2416] You see, the highest calling, it's not being a missionary.
[time=2422] It's not being a pastor, it's not being evangelist, it's not being a prophet, it's not being a teacher.
[time=2428] The highest calling is to be my witness.
[time=2433] Jesus says, "I want you to be my witness.
[time=2436] I want you to go share the good news about me." He doesn't say, "You have to do this."
[time=2447] He says, "You get to do this." How humbling is that?
[time=2456] I get to talk to the world about my creator.
[time=2463] And my Lord, he wants me to do that.
[time=2466] It might just be my neighbor across the street
[time=2472] or maybe some kid in Zimbabwe,
[time=2478] but he wants all of us to go in some capacity.
[time=2484] And I can't spell that out for you.
[time=2489] That's between you and him.
[time=2494] But after you and him get done figuring it out, then it's all about you and them.
[time=2499] From the vertical to the horizontal, we need to go.
[time=2505] We need to go.
[time=2508] So let's pray, Father, Lord, we are humbled, Lord, that you choose us to be vessels unto honor, Lord.
[time=2522] You didn't have to use this, Lord, but that's the way you want to do it.
[time=2525] So help us, Lord, have that insight, that courage, Lord,
[time=2531] as your Holy Spirit leads, Lord, that we will step out with greater boldness, with greater necessity in a world that is so, so hurting,
[time=2544] that we can be a light, that we can share the good news in a mighty way.
[time=2553] Father, I pray that you challenge those here today.
[time=2557] And Father, I want to ask right now, Lord, if there's anybody here who doesn't know you in a personal way, who is not have the Holy Spirit dwelling in them, Lord, and has not made that profession of faith, I want to give that opportunity to those in the room and those watching online.
[time=2574] If you have not asked Jesus into your heart, I want to give you that opportunity right now.
[time=2580] And you can do that by just slipping your hand up.
[time=2582] Say, I want to ask Jesus into my heart.
[time=2584] Just raise it up.
[time=2588] All right, I see you.
[time=2591] Anybody else?
[time=2592] Don't be afraid.
[time=2595] This is the big step for you to connect, for you to go.
[time=2600] Anybody else, if you're watching online, same thing.
[time=2603] All right, see you.
[time=2610] All right, let's pray.
[time=2612] One more time, Father, we just thank you for Lord for the opportunity of salvation.
[time=2617] You paid it all in full for us, Lord.
[time=2620] And now we get to pass that on.
[time=2621] We get to share about the redemption.
[time=2624] We get to share about the salvation.
[time=2625] We get to share about eternity, Lord.
[time=2629] And Lord, it's okay for us to look up, Lord, but we also need to be looking out and we need to be going and how important that is.
[time=2638] And so, Lord, we just ask that you go before each of us, Lord, speak to our hearts in a mighty way we pray.
[time=2644] In Jesus' name, amen.
