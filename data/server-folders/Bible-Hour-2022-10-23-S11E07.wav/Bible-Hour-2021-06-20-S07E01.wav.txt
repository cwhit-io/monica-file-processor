[time=0] If you're new with us, I've met so many guests.
[time=2] Even today, if you're watching us online today, our own screens, welcome.
[time=7] We have one rule around here.
[time=9] Many of you have heard me say it.
[time=10] It's that you come one time and you are family in the midst of all of our mess.
[time=14] And that's a good series for us to jump into.
[time=16] So let's do that.
[time=17] We're gonna be in the Gospel of John for three months.
[time=19] And so for these 12 weeks, we'll be in the Gospel of John.
[time=21] I won't be able to teach each verse in the Gospel of John, but we are in this series called Messy, going to read through the Gospel of John this summer.
[time=30] And over the next three months.
[time=31] And so here's what I wanna challenge you to do.
[time=33] Go to blackhawk.fi, and there you're gonna find kind of an outline for this series where we'll be looking at the relationships that Jesus had and that he built with messy people.
[time=43] That's the common denominator of all these relationships.
[time=45] He's not messy, but boy, aren't we.
[time=47] And he built relationships with all of these different kinds of people.
[time=51] You'll see an outline of this series, but more importantly, you'll see a reading plan where we together as a church family can read through starting now the Gospel of John in these next three months.
[time=61] So I invite you to do that with us.
[time=63] And I'm so glad that you're here today.
[time=65] As we start this series, I wanna talk to you about Jesus and the religious.
[time=68] Each week we're gonna look at Jesus and some group of people.
[time=71] Next week it'll be seekers, people like Nicodemus and John three.
[time=74] But this week, Jesus and the religious, John chapter two, verses 13 through 22 is where we are going to be.
[time=81] And so Jesus in his 33 years on earth, he made a lot of relationships.
[time=86] And the common denominator of those that we really get to zoom into when we look at the word of God, particularly in the last three years of the life of Jesus.
[time=94] That's the ministry of Jesus.
[time=96] We see all of these relationships.
[time=98] And the common denominator is that he built relationships with messy, sinful, broken.
[time=103] How many adjectives can we come up with?
[time=105] Messy, messy people.
[time=106] That was the best one we came up with.
[time=107] So that's where we are.
[time=109] And so I've got at least a couple of goals for us.
[time=111] Number one, I pray you can identify.
[time=113] Look at your neighbor and say identify.
[time=116] I want you guys to identify with these people.
[time=118] I want to identify with these people Jesus built relationships with so that I can see, so that I can see that God wants a relationship with me.
[time=127] Because if he wants a relationship with them, he wants one with me too.
[time=131] Second thing that I really hope for you is that you can initiate some of the intentionality that Jesus demonstrates in his relationships that he builds in the relationships that he has given you.
[time=142] Raise your hand if you've got a messy relationship or two in your life.
[time=144] That should be everybody, so I hope we can be intentional with initiating some things that we learn from Jesus.
[time=151] And to help us with that, I want you guys to help me preach today, here's our question of the week.
[time=154] I'm going to go back to one.
[time=155] It is, how has God shown you that he wants a relationship with you?
[time=160] And you can log on to our chat, even if you're in the room today.
[time=162] You can do that on our online platforms.
[time=165] And in the chat, if you're watching us right now, help me preach.
[time=167] I'll come back to this in just about 15 minutes.
[time=169] I'll give you a little time you can plug it in.
[time=171] Help me preach that.
[time=172] How has God shown you that he wants you to do?
[time=174] And he wants a relationship with you.
[time=176] All right, so let's go to John chapter two.
[time=178] And so in John chapter two, we see that the word is very clear in John chapter one, rather.
[time=184] John one five, the light has shown into the darkness.
[time=187] And the darkness has not overcome it.
[time=188] It's the part of our vision to light the one five.
[time=190] The wedding at Cana, where Jesus does his first miracle, is at the first part of John chapter two.
[time=195] And it shows the compassion of Jesus.
[time=197] It shows that he cares about everyday needs as he meets this need in a very compassionate manner at the beginning of John chapter two.
[time=205] But then John chapter two, verse 13, where we're gonna pick up today, we see the relationship of Jesus with religious people.
[time=211] And what we're gonna see is this a little bit of a different side of Jesus than we typically talk about.
[time=217] How many of you have you seen the sheep petting Jesus that you see everywhere?
[time=220] And it's good, it shows the tender loving, compassionate Jesus that he is, the wedding at Cana, Jesus that we know.
[time=227] But starting at verse 13, we see a little bit of a different side of Jesus.
[time=231] And so we're gonna start our series with the bang as we look at the messy relationships that he built.
[time=235] You ready for the word today, black car?
[time=237] Let's start in verse 13, John chapter two.
[time=240] The word says the Passover of the Jews was at hand.
[time=243] Jesus went up to Jerusalem in the temple.
[time=245] He found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons and the money changers sitting there, making a whip of cords.
[time=254] He drove them all out of the temple with the sheep and oxen.
[time=260] He didn't pet in those sheep.
[time=262] And he poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.
[time=266] And he told those who sold the pigeons, take these things away, do not make my father's house, a house of trade.
[time=272] His disciples remembered what was written, an Old Testament prophecy from the Psalms.
[time=276] We'll look at it, zeal for your house will consume me.
[time=280] So did you say to him, what sign do you show us for doing these things?
[time=283] Jesus answered him, destroy this temple.
[time=286] And in three days, I will raise it up.
[time=288] The Jews then said, it has taken 46 years to build this temple and you will raise it up in three days.
[time=296] But he was speaking about the temple of his body.
[time=299] When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this and they believed the scripture and the word Jesus had spoken.
[time=308] And I wanna read, it's not gonna be under screen, just these next couple of verses, 'cause they're gonna show you a very clear picture of the messiness of us, 'cause he says then, verse 23.
[time=318] Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many believed in his name when they saw the signs he was doing, but Jesus on his part did not entrust himself to them because he knew all people and needed no one to bear witness about man, for he himself knew what was in man.
[time=334] He knew how messy we are, he knew how messed up.
[time=337] We currently are, we're going to be and are even today, yet he loved us anyway.
[time=344] What a powerful start to our series, but boy, we got some work to do, don't we?
[time=348] To unpack a passage quite like this one.
[time=350] So here's the thing, this is the first of two cleanses of the temple, did you know that?
[time=354] That Jesus did that twice.
[time=355] He did it once in this passage in John chapter two, at the beginning of his ministry, right after his first miracle, water to wine at the wedding at Cana, but he does it again, and it's recorded in all three of the synoptic gospels, as they're known, which is Matthew, Mark, and Luke, at the end of his ministry.
[time=369] So he does it at the beginning of his three year ministry, then he does it in the final week of his life again.
[time=374] And so he's done this twice, and we learned from it, how to approach maybe some righteous anger.
[time=380] We're going to look at that here in just a second, and actually let's do that.
[time=384] Now, number one, two things.
[time=385] We're going to look at Jesus' anger and Jesus' authority.
[time=388] Jesus' anger in verses 13 through 17, he didn't seem real happy, did he?
[time=392] And sometimes we get a little uncomfortable with this Jesus, don't we?
[time=397] But I'm so thankful that he showed us, because we get angry too sometimes, and anger is a reality of life, and certainly of relationships.
[time=404] And so when we look at this side of Jesus, I'll tell you this, every time you see Jesus get angry, or be frustrated, it's usually going to involve religious people, and all the religious people are completely silent.
[time=419] Me too, me too.
[time=422] So Jesus' anger, before we look at some things that make Jesus angry, let me give you a couple of verses about anger that the Bible gives us some stern warnings about anger.
[time=430] James, the brother of Jesus, chapter one, verses 19 and 20 says this.
[time=434] Know this, my beloved brothers, and we've done a series on this, do it with me if you know it.
[time=438] Let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak.
[time=441] But then he also says slow to anger, for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.
[time=449] My anger doesn't often produce the righteousness of God either, and that's why we are warned throughout scripture to be very cautious and careful with how we deal with our anger, the anger of man.
[time=459] The apostle Paul Ephesians 4, verses 26 and 27, says be angry, and do not sin.
[time=465] Do not let the sun go down on your anger and give no opportunity to the devil.
[time=471] And Jesus modeled for us a righteous anger, 'cause he did not sin.
[time=475] He is a sinless, spotless sacrifice for us as he died on the cross, but yet he was angry.
[time=480] And I want to let you sit in that for a minute.
[time=483] Some things really should churn us.
[time=489] Some things really should produce a righteous anger, but we've got to be careful with how we apply that anger.
[time=494] So let's answer this question.
[time=495] What makes Jesus angry?
[time=497] You ever wonder that?
[time=498] What makes Jesus angry?
[time=500] Certainly we see a good example in this passage, but before we unpack it, let me give you some other examples.
[time=505] And instead of trying to keep up with me, I'm gonna read through these pretty fast.
[time=508] We've put all of these scripture passages in your notes.
[time=511] So whether you're watching us online or in the room, you can go to our church app, go to the gather section, our online bulletin, the sermon notes are there, or on your platforms, you can have the app or the notes page available for you there.
[time=522] And all these scriptures are listed here.
[time=524] The second temple cleanse is one.
[time=526] At the end of his ministry, as I've mentioned, it's Matthew 21, Mark 11, Luke 19.
[time=531] Jesus says, "You won't make my father's house a den of robbers." Pretty similar to this one, but some differences.
[time=536] This one was the only one with the whip.
[time=539] He didn't have a whip, and last time, but he had some pretty sharp words there.
[time=543] He was definitely not happy.
[time=545] Mark chapter three, verse five.
[time=546] Mark three is where Jesus on the Sabbath is being chastised by the religious leaders again for healing a man with a withered hand on the Sabbath there.
[time=556] And in verse five, it says that Jesus looked around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart.
[time=562] Mark chapter 10, the disciples, this is when the little kids were coming to Jesus and they're gathering around him, and the disciples thought they were doing something good, and they said, "No, get away, shoot, get away, kids." But Jesus says, here's what verses 13 through 15 tells us, is that he was indignant and said, "No, let the kids come to me." It's another good example for us.
[time=582] Matthew 16, Jesus has told the disciples that he must go to Jerusalem to suffer, that he would die.
[time=589] Peter, how many of you identify with Peter?
[time=592] He's a good, messy case study, isn't he?
[time=594] Peter rebuked the Bible, says Jesus.
[time=597] Be careful if you're rebuking the Son of God.
[time=600] That'd be your first 10th there, but he rebuked Jesus, and said, "No, it's not gonna happen to you, Lord." But here is what Jesus said to Peter.
[time=606] He said, "Get behind me, Satan." And then he said, "You are hindrance to me, "for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, "but on the things of men." A couple more.
[time=619] Matthew 23 is where Jesus calls the Pharisees and scribes.
[time=623] Sad you sees these hypocrites, and I'll tell you the word he uses in a moment.
[time=626] But in verse 27, he calls them whitewashed tombs.
[time=629] He gives this example of a cup.
[time=631] You clean the outside of the cup in the dish, but the inside is filthy.
[time=634] You're like a tomb that looks good and whitewashed and clean and pretty on the outside, but the end is full of dead man's bones.
[time=641] So he wasn't real happy in this passage as the words of Jesus came forth.
[time=644] Verse 33 of Matthew 23, he calls them serpents and a brood of vipers.
[time=649] And then, and I'll tell you, the Greek word for hypocrite.
[time=652] You wanna know what it means in the original language?
[time=654] It literally means actor or stage player.
[time=658] It means you look one way, but behind the scenes, when the curtain closes, it looks a lot different.
[time=665] And that got Jesus pretty angry.
[time=667] And I'll characterize this by Matthew 23 and verse 13.
[time=670] It's a great verse that kind of ties all this together.
[time=673] He says this, but woe do you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces.
[time=682] For you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in.
[time=689] In all of these passages, including the one we're gonna unpack now, what's the common denominator of the anger of Jesus?
[time=694] Here it is, you wanna know?
[time=695] It's people making it difficult for people to come to God.
[time=700] Look at all of these examples and you'll find that people were doing things that made it difficult for other people to come to God, to enter a relationship with him.
[time=714] That makes Jesus angry.
[time=718] And now that we know that, let's unpack this passage because it's perhaps one of the greatest examples of that common denominator that we'll see.
[time=725] In verse 13 that we just read there, what we see is that Jesus brought his disciples to Jerusalem for the Passover.
[time=731] This is one of three feasts that all Jewish men, they made provisions for people who lived further out from Jerusalem to do this from a distance, but even still many, many people would travel to Jerusalem.
[time=742] It's estimated some 80 to 150,000 people during this timeframe of Jesus would have been in Jerusalem, but over, well over half a million more people would come into Jerusalem for the feasts of the Passover.
[time=754] This is one of those three.
[time=755] There's the tabernacles, there's the Pentecost.
[time=757] These are these meals that to keep the law you would come to Jerusalem and be a part of them.
[time=763] And here's what's interesting about this time and the cleansing of the temple, ironically, is Jewish families would clean their houses.
[time=771] They would cleanse their houses during this time.
[time=774] And there's a phrase that maybe you've heard before.
[time=775] You've heard of spring cleaning?
[time=777] If you research the origins of spring cleaning, most of those origins go back to this Jewish history.
[time=783] Pretty interesting, right?
[time=784] Spring cleaning came from this idea of cleansing, but Jesus comes in and he finds that God's house, even though Jewish families are cleaning their houses, that God's house is filthy.
[time=794] And most people look at it and it's like, yeah, 'cause there was animals in there and there was money in there and we misuse this passage, but really what we're gonna find as we unpack this passage is that it's the heart behind what was in the temple, the presence of God where it would dwell, that Jesus really got angry about and he flipped tables and he dumped out the coins and he made a whip and he drove it all out.
[time=818] So as we look at this, verse 14, what no doubt, listen, you gotta get this, it was a good thing that animals were sold around the temple at this time because people would travel from so far and so they would sell animals for sacrifices.
[time=831] So literally this was something done so that people could follow the law of God.
[time=835] So that in and of itself is not bad.
[time=837] And all nor is the money changers.
[time=839] Money changers were around the temple because people would come with whatever currency that they had for in currencies and there in the temple there was a tax that was done with shekels.
[time=848] And so to get that you have to change over your money, just like if you travel internationally.
[time=852] And so these money changers would take the foreign currencies and change it over to the currency that was needed in the temple.
[time=859] But guess what they started doing?
[time=861] You're not gonna believe that some people, messy people would do this.
[time=864] They started upcharging the process.
[time=867] And what started as a good convenience to help people worship God turned into commerce, turned into personal gain for people.
[time=876] And Jesus didn't like that very much.
[time=879] And a lot of people will use this passage to say, see this is why the church should never sell anything.
[time=883] And while there's probably good wisdom to be gained from us making sure we keep the main thing, the main thing, that's really not the point of the passage.
[time=889] Jesus wasn't mad about the animals being there, the money changers being there.
[time=892] It's where they were that I'll get into in a moment but it's more about how they were doing it and with what heart they were doing it.
[time=898] Even these booths, these booths that were set up, they were set up in the court of the Gentiles.
[time=903] This is so key.
[time=904] Where it was set up is in the outer court of the temple.
[time=907] This is where any non-Jew and anybody who's a non-Jew, you're a Gentile.
[time=911] And so the Gentiles, those even that were seeking to come, they could come and hear, they could come and learn, they could come and worship, they could come and be welcomed to worship God.
[time=922] And that's where all this stuff got set up.
[time=924] You could probably see where this is going.
[time=925] And even these booths became known throughout history.
[time=928] You ready for this as the bazaars of Anas.
[time=933] Anas was the high priest.
[time=934] And so that means if ever there's a day and I'm no high priest, but as your pastor, if ever there are stations set up outside that become known as the bazaars of Kevin, we got a problem.
[time=945] And so by God's grace that won't happen.
[time=948] That's what's going on here.
[time=949] Now you kind of get a picture of what's happening in the story and what does Jesus do about it?
[time=954] Verses 15 and 16, well, you knew I had to do it.
[time=959] Eric, you especially knew.
[time=961] Jesus fashioned a whip of cords.
[time=968] Why are you all so quiet?
[time=971] I need a volunteer.
[time=973] No, just kidding, I'm just kidding.
[time=974] No, no, don't volunteer, just kidding, I'm just kidding.
[time=978] Jesus, and you know, here's the thing, the scripture doesn't really say how he went about this, it doesn't say if it took five minutes, doesn't say if he'd been doing it for hours, braiding, I don't know, we don't know exactly what it looked like.
[time=988] But can you imagine the disciples, if it took any length of time, they're probably going, "Do you do something wrong?" "Do you make it mad?" But he makes this whip of cords.
[time=999] Verses 15 and 16, we see that he uses it to dry.
[time=1002] And I'm kind of an, anybody in an upgrade kind of person.
[time=1005] So this is kind of cords, right?
[time=1006] It's pretty good.
[time=1008] I brought a bull whip.
[time=1012] Oh yeah, you ready for this?
[time=1014] I'm not as good as some of you guys would be, but I don't know what it looked like, but I like upgrades.
[time=1019] And I love that this side of Jesus is something we can learn something from today.
[time=1024] And so he runs these people out with this whip.
[time=1027] And again, it's not because they were selling the animals or changing the money, it's the heart they were doing it with.
[time=1033] And here's what I wanna tell you about that.
[time=1034] I wanna tell you today that, listen, the way you do the work of God can destroy the work of God in you.
[time=1042] As a pastor, I can so relate to this.
[time=1045] And in this story, these religious people don't miss the fact, they were doing the right stuff.
[time=1050] They were taking care of the temple.
[time=1052] They were going about the work of God, but the way we do the work of God can destroy God's work in us.
[time=1058] And Jesus is all about the heart.
[time=1061] Jesus is all about these Gentiles and anyone from the outside looking in, being able to look through an avenue and see and find God.
[time=1069] And anytime we as people make it difficult for people to come to God, anytime we even doing the work of God, do it with a wrong heart that is not bent towards the heart of God, which is making room for all people to be a part of his family.
[time=1085] He makes a whip and he gets angry.
[time=1090] But it's a righteous anger because the same Jesus knew what was in the heart of man.
[time=1095] Remember verses 23 through 25?
[time=1097] And he still loved us.
[time=1099] Aren't you glad of that?
[time=1100] They were inside this temple complex disrupting this place of worship.
[time=1104] Now it's a place of personal gain and people were making it difficult for people to come to God because that court of the Gentiles, listen, what happened is for the sake, and this is so easy for us to do church.
[time=1117] Don't miss this, for the sake of the convenience and the comfort of the insiders of the church.
[time=1126] They made it difficult for outsiders to have an avenue to come and learn about and feel welcomed in and participate in being a part of the family of God.
[time=1137] People were making it difficult for people to come to God.
[time=1141] And so as they set up and did all of these things with the wrong heart, they did it in the wrong place and it made a blockage where people wouldn't be able to see a proclamation of the gospel.
[time=1150] Did you know a proclamation of the gospel happens better through demonstration than it does through explanation?
[time=1156] I've known lots of people who, and I'm all about teaching.
[time=1159] I'm up here doing it right now.
[time=1160] I'll be a hypocrite if I didn't.
[time=1161] I'm all about doctrine, I'm all about truth.
[time=1163] But listen, I've known a lot of people who can give the best explanations of propitiation and eschatology and all these things, but they're so mean to their spouse and their kids or to other people in the church that I would never want to hear anything they have to say because I have no respect for them.
[time=1178] Proclamation of the gospel happens best through demonstration, not explanation.
[time=1183] And that's why Jesus, as he is going through cleansing the temple, is ready to set some new normals.
[time=1189] What did he do?
[time=1190] He came to get this, Jesus came to replace religion with a relationship, with relationship, with messy people.
[time=1198] Jesus doesn't care about how good our religion looks on the outside of the cup or the whitewashed tombs.
[time=1202] He wants to know what's on the inside.
[time=1206] And when it doesn't match up, it makes him angry.
[time=1208] And he fashions a whip of cords.
[time=1211] I don't want him to have to drive that kind of stuff out of my life.
[time=1214] And listen, the goal of biblical community, as I read it and understand it through all of Scripture, is not knowing more stuff.
[time=1221] It's knowing God vertically.
[time=1224] So much that we have to know others horizontally and be known by others horizontally.
[time=1232] That's why God came into our mess, into our sense so that we could have a personal relationship with God to replace religion with a relationship.
[time=1241] And that it wouldn't stop there, that we would know and be known, that we would have a relational disciple-making process.
[time=1250] And I'm so thankful for our church.
[time=1252] And we've been on this journey for many years, and we just had a group of us that went out to Colorado to a disciple shift one conference.
[time=1259] Some of my great friends from Idaho, if any of you see this, I love you guys so much.
[time=1262] Had a great time with them.
[time=1264] Just looking at how we can not just talk about what Jesus said, but actually do what Jesus did.
[time=1269] And what Jesus did is he made disciples through knowing them and being known by them, by sharing life together.
[time=1275] And that's why, listen, we're going to be online.
[time=1277] We hope these are great avenues into community.
[time=1280] But listen, you cannot be in biblical community by just watching on a screen.
[time=1287] And I'm not saying that because we devalue you watching on a screen because more people will watch on a screen today than will be in the room.
[time=1293] Did you guys know that?
[time=1295] Thousands of people.
[time=1296] And that's wonderful.
[time=1296] And listen, if that's you, I'm so glad you're here.
[time=1299] But I want to challenge you to go beyond where you are in your walk with God, in your discipleship journey, to know some other people and to be known by other people.
[time=1308] Because Jesus came for relationship.
[time=1311] And man, I got to tell you a story real quick.
[time=1312] Last night, what a Father's Day story.
[time=1317] I took my little girl, my middle child.
[time=1319] Callie is eight years old.
[time=1320] And I took her to a daddy daughter date night.
[time=1323] So cool.
[time=1323] We got to be at a Christian concert together and eat a picnic lunch.
[time=1328] I was reminded of how old I'm getting, sitting on the ground that long.
[time=1331] And so we sat there.
[time=1332] And there was a moment, though, just such a sweet time.
[time=1334] But there was a great moment where we were worshiping.
[time=1338] The afters, if you've heard of them, great band.
[time=1340] They did an awesome job leading us in a time of worship.
[time=1342] And I just kind of got lost from it.
[time=1344] I was thinking about Father's Day.
[time=1345] I was thinking about this message and how I get to share with all of you today.
[time=1349] And I was just lost for just a second in how good, good, good, my Father is.
[time=1354] We have a good, good Father.
[time=1356] And I was worshiping and my eyes were closed.
[time=1357] I had my hand lifted high.
[time=1361] And after a moment or two had passed, I looked down, kind of to my left.
[time=1365] And there's my sweet little girl.
[time=1366] Do you know what she was doing?
[time=1368] Exactly what her daddy was doing.
[time=1371] She had her little eyes closed and her little hand lifted high and she was singing as loud as she could.
[time=1376] When we moved here to Indiana, she was in preschool at BCS.
[time=1381] She's eight now.
[time=1382] She's since given her life to Christ.
[time=1385] Her mom and I got to baptize her right up there at that cross.
[time=1389] And I was reminded at that moment that somebody's always watching you.
[time=1394] And I was convicted in that moment that Jesus is all about relationship.
[time=1401] And that so many times I let the religious practices of being a pastor or just the rituals of life get in the way of the relationships that God has given me.
[time=1412] May we not miss those little moments where we realize, and I don't know if you're a dad or if you're a parent, but listen, somebody's watching you.
[time=1420] May they see a picture of your father.
[time=1424] I want to be that kind of a leader.
[time=1426] One that values relationship, the way that God values relationship.
[time=1432] And it all starts with you getting this one fact.
[time=1435] God wants a relationship with you.
[time=1438] He loves you so much.
[time=1440] And I came to share that with you today.
[time=1443] Maybe you don't believe it, but I believe you can.
[time=1445] And it's when people get in the way of other people seeing that, that Jesus gets angry.
[time=1449] That's how passionate he is about having a relationship with you.
[time=1453] And I was reminded at this conference of the first crisis.
[time=1455] Let me ask you a question.
[time=1455] Do you know the first crisis in history that Jesus, that God solved?
[time=1465] If you're like me for years, I would have immediately gone to, it's kind of a trick question, so I won't hear your answers, because I don't want to do that to you, because I would have been tricked in the past.
[time=1472] I would have, in the past, said, well, sin.
[time=1475] You know, the fall of man, Adam and Eve, they sin.
[time=1478] And God solved it by showing his mercy and his grace, eventually sending Jesus to be that perfect sacrifice, to die, to pay a price on the cross for my sin.
[time=1486] And he rose from the dead and defeated death hell in the grave.
[time=1488] And he solved that crisis so that I could have a relationship.
[time=1490] And that is very true.
[time=1492] It's one of the first ones.
[time=1493] But before the fall, Genesis chapter 2, before the sin had entered the world through Adam and Eve, verse 18, Genesis 2, 18, says, then the Lord, God said, and this is after he had created and he said, it is good.
[time=1503] It is good.
[time=1507] The Lord said, it is, say it with me?
[time=1510] It is not good that the man should be alone.
[time=1515] I'll make him a helper, fit for him.
[time=1517] What does that mean?
[time=1518] That means that even in a perfect creation, even where there's no barrier in the vertical relationship between God and man.
[time=1526] God and Adam have a perfect relationship.
[time=1528] There's no sin yet.
[time=1529] Even then God wanted relationship.
[time=1532] He valued relationship so much that he went beyond the vertical and said there needs to be horizontal relationships too.
[time=1541] God believes in relationship.
[time=1544] And I'm so thankful that he came not just to tell us about it, but to show us how to live in it.
[time=1550] In verse 17, the disciples remembered a prophecy.
[time=1553] By the way, when Jesus fulfills an Old Testament prophecy, it's a good reminder for us to never forget that God always keeps his promises.
[time=1562] We serve a good, good father on this Father's Day.
[time=1565] I don't know what your earthly father was like or what kind of relationship or lack thereof you may have experienced, but God keeps his promises.
[time=1572] You may have been let down over and over.
[time=1573] You never may have had the chance to be let down in your childhood.
[time=1576] I don't know your story, but my God loves you so much.
[time=1579] And he's the ultimate father and he keeps his promises.
[time=1581] And the disciples, verse 17, they remembered this.
[time=1583] Imagine their wide eyes at this point going, yes, sir, whatever you say, he's got a whip and all that has just happened and they're trying to figure this out.
[time=1590] And they remember this messianic Psalm, which means it's just a Psalm that talks about the coming Messiah, hundreds of years before Jesus would come.
[time=1597] So it's a prophetic Psalm and it says, for zeal Psalm 69, Psalm 69, Psalm 69, for zeal for your house is consuming.
[time=1605] And there are approaches of those who approach you have fallen.
[time=1608] And so they remembered the history.
[time=1612] They remembered the promises.
[time=1613] They remembered the prophecy and they see it being fulfilled by Jesus in front of their eyes.
[time=1617] So let me ask you back to our question now.
[time=1620] How is it that God has shown you he wants a relationship with you?
[time=1622] Let's look at some of your answers because I do believe God has shown you that in some way.
[time=1628] If not, I believe he's showing you even right now.
[time=1630] Oh, wow, we've got a lot of answers.
[time=1631] Thank you guys for hopping in on this.
[time=1634] Alyssa says, God keeps showing me, showing up, rather right where I am, no matter what season of life I'm in, he's always there.
[time=1642] I agree.
[time=1643] That's a good vertical picture of how God shows us that he values us.
[time=1647] Erika says, by chasing after me when I was running away from him, by forgiving my sins and accepting me as his child.
[time=1655] Katie says, by pursuing and protecting me when I was far from him.
[time=1659] Willie says, he's called me to him in the darkest time of my life.
[time=1662] He showed me my value to him and gave me the gift of grace which drew me closer to him.
[time=1668] Jessica says, by sending me repetitive messages, whether it's by a devotional or a sermon or a person.
[time=1674] You see it horizontal.
[time=1675] Just about always, when I ask a question like this, you'll see both.
[time=1678] The vertical, God does something.
[time=1680] But then he does a lot through people and you see it here.
[time=1682] She says, he reminds me over and over by sending people that speak into my life.
[time=1687] And while the list goes on, just some great stuff there.
[time=1689] God wants a relationship with you.
[time=1691] And I got to speak to those of you who would say that people have made it difficult for you to come to God.
[time=1699] Some of you are watching right now online because you've been hurt in church.
[time=1704] My highest highs have been in the church world, but my lowest lows have also been in the church world.
[time=1710] And I can empathize so much with those moments where people make it difficult for other people to come to God.
[time=1716] And if that is you, I want to speak to you for a minute.
[time=1718] Sometimes we make light of it and jokes.
[time=1719] I'm not here to make a joke today.
[time=1720] I want to tell you something.
[time=1721] I want to tell you that I am truly deeply sorry if someone in God's church has hurt you, has made it hard for you to come and experience a personal relationship with God through his church.
[time=1735] My heart truly breaks over those moments.
[time=1737] And I'm praying, I've prayed all week that God will bring healing into a lot of lives this week.
[time=1743] And maybe you're who I've been praying for.
[time=1744] I want to give you a few challenges with that.
[time=1747] Number one, I'm very sorry.
[time=1749] Hear that even on behalf of those who may never apologize that God's people don't always look like the God who created them.
[time=1756] I'm really sorry for that.
[time=1757] But number two, I want to challenge you to do something that I've had to learn to do.
[time=1760] I want to challenge you to shape and fashion your view, your perspective of God's church based on him, not them.
[time=1769] Why?
[time=1771] It's not their church.
[time=1772] It's God's church.
[time=1774] Jesus said, I will build my church and even the gates of hell won't prevail against it.
[time=1781] And that sounds good and it rhymes and all that kind of stuff.
[time=1784] But how do you do that?
[time=1785] I want to give you a step.
[time=1786] It's a really hard step and it's going to be a real one for some of you.
[time=1789] I want to challenge you.
[time=1790] If you've been hurt, I want to challenge you to open yourself up in two ways.
[time=1794] Number one, to God vertically.
[time=1795] To walk with him in a way that you haven't walked with him.
[time=1800] He has not given up on you.
[time=1803] And I know some of you think he has and you're too far gone, but he loves you so much.
[time=1808] Don't believe the lies of the enemy that the vertical relationship with God is over for you.
[time=1812] And then secondly, open yourself up to God's people again.
[time=1816] And I hate having to ask you for that because I know people are going to hurt you again.
[time=1819] But when you base your view of God's church on him and not them, even the them that hurt you, you won't look to them anymore.
[time=1827] You'll have your eyes fixed on Jesus, but know that you need to know God and you need to know each other and you need to be known by each other.
[time=1835] We need each other.
[time=1838] So maybe you need to just find a life group, but Roe can't know what you're going through.
[time=1842] Roe's are good and we gather, but there's a reason we don't stop with gather.
[time=1846] We say it with me, say it with me.
[time=1847] If you know him, we gather, connect and go.
[time=1850] Before you go and after you gather.
[time=1852] And even before you gather here, if you don't want to come into these doors, find a life group first.
[time=1857] You won't hear many pastors saying that, but I'm telling you, you need a relationship with people.
[time=1862] So open yourself back up and see what God can do.
[time=1866] And that leads to just where I'll land our plane today.
[time=1867] It's Jesus' authority, it's Jesus' authority.
[time=1870] And verses 18 through 22, they say, show us a sign.
[time=1873] And Jesus says, I'll show you the ultimate sign.
[time=1875] Tear down the temple, I'll rebuild it in three days.
[time=1877] They're like, well, it took 46 years to build this temple.
[time=1879] You can't do that in three days.
[time=1880] And Jesus is talking about a way bigger sign that points to his authority.
[time=1883] He's talking about the temple of his body.
[time=1885] He's talking about how he's gonna die and he would become that temple.
[time=1888] And listen, Jesus then at these moments, as he became that temple and it was torn down as he died on the cross, it did get rebuilt in three days.
[time=1896] He rose from the dead and because he lives, the ultimate sign had then happened.
[time=1901] And because that happened, listen, the presence of God went from a place, the temple, to a people, the body of Christ, the family of God.
[time=1908] We are the church now.
[time=1911] And that's the sign that Jesus is pointing to as he walks through this.
[time=1914] And in verse 22, what we see is that the disciples' faith, look there again, their faith was strengthened.
[time=1920] They remembered that he had said this and then they believed the scripture and the word Jesus had spoken.
[time=1926] The more, listen, please don't miss this.
[time=1928] Don't do any of the challenges I've given you for me.
[time=1930] Do it for this reason.
[time=1931] The more you submit to God's authority, the more you will see God's plan.
[time=1937] Submit so you can see.
[time=1939] You won't see clearly unless you're submitted to the ultimate authority that is God.
[time=1943] You won't receive, you won't be poised to receive the new mercies of God.
[time=1948] The new kingdom that God has established if you're stuck in an old mindset.
[time=1952] And I believe God's called you to move forward.
[time=1957] And when it comes to the temple, the Apostle Paul wrote this in 1 Corinthians chapter number six verses 19 and 20, he said, or do you not know that your body, remember the presence of God from a place to a people, that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God.
[time=1973] You are not your own for you are bought with a price.
[time=1976] So glorify God with your body.
[time=1979] So here's the question I wanna close with today is, what's one thing that Jesus desires to drive out of your life?
[time=1987] It's a good question.
[time=1989] Or you can take it a different way and say, what does Jesus wanted to drive you to in your life?
[time=1994] I believe he's wanting to do one and the other, both at the same time, it's a both end.
[time=1997] What does he want to drive out of your life?
[time=1999] What is he driving you to in your life?
[time=2001] And as we think about that, to think that God wants to use you and me as the body of Christ, the family of God, as his hands and feet in this world to welcome people into his family.
[time=2016] It's truly staggering to me.
[time=2019] We're so messy.
[time=2020] Look at your neighbor, say, you're so messy.
[time=2022] We're so messy.
[time=2026] It's staggering to me that God wants that.
[time=2028] 'Cause listen, let me remind us, God did have other options.
[time=2032] I want to say that again, 'cause some of you are ready for lunch.
[time=2034] God had other options.
[time=2036] He could have just wiped us off the face of the earth.
[time=2038] He could have made us robots, but God wants a relationship with us.
[time=2042] Messy, old, you, and me.
[time=2046] So he sent Jesus and believers in the room, I want to ask you to call just to bow your heads and close your eyes and ponder this.
[time=2050] Believers in the room, believers watching the line, what is God wanting to drive out of your life?
[time=2055] What made him fashion a whip to drive something out of your life?
[time=2059] What was he driving you to in your life?
[time=2060] And some of you would say today that you just don't know that you've got that personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ.
[time=2066] That's you today.
[time=2068] God's got something special for you.
[time=2069] It's the most special, amazing, eternal thing ever.
[time=2072] It's a grand offer of eternal life, the gift of salvation that you could not earn on your own.
[time=2078] We are saved by grace through faith, not of works, or then we would boast about it.
[time=2083] We can't boast about it, but God has already done it.
[time=2086] We get to receive it from a place of victory today.
[time=2088] If you've never accepted Christ as your savior, today the gospel, you've heard it all day, but I'm going to put it to you very simply that we are all sinners who fall short of the glory of God.
[time=2097] We can't have a personal relationship with God apart from a perfect sacrifice.
[time=2101] That's why Jesus came.
[time=2102] He lived a sinless life we could never live and he died.
[time=2106] His body was broken, his blood was spilled out.
[time=2108] So while we do communion like we did earlier today, the Lord's Supper, he was that perfect sacrifice so that this moment could happen.
[time=2115] He rose from the dead so that Romans 10 tells us that anyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
[time=2121] Just confess with your mouth.
[time=2123] You say, well, I can't remember all that.
[time=2124] I can't say it like you to good.
[time=2125] God doesn't want words, he wants your heart.
[time=2128] He wants you to surrender to him and say, God, I know I can't be saved apart from you.
[time=2132] In your words, cry out to him, ask him to forgive you, ask him to save you in this moment and he'll meet you right where you are in all the messiness that is.
[time=2141] Paul's right now and let's do that.
[time=2142] Don't wait another second.
