[time=0] If you will meet me there at the Gospel of John, we're gonna be in the third chapter today.
[time=4] I am so pumped to be able to share the word of God with you.
[time=7] Anybody else just excited to be in the house of God today?
[time=10] Yeah, and that applies to all of you watching us online.
[time=13] Hello to our online family.
[time=15] This is actually our largest time where we have engagement from our online audience, television ministry.
[time=20] So wherever you're watching from, however you're engaged, we are so glad to be a part of the family of God together as messy as we may be.
[time=28] And so let's dig into this series.
[time=30] We're in our second week of the series.
[time=32] And as always, you can catch up on the previous message by going to blackhawk.fyi anytime during the week.
[time=38] And so what we're looking at, my friends, is the fact that Jesus had a lot of relationships.
[time=44] He built relationships with a lot of people.
[time=46] And his 33 years on earth, especially in his three years of ministry, we get to zoom in because of Gospels, just like the Gospel of John.
[time=53] But the common denominator of all those relationships is that Jesus was never messy, but every person he engaged with was very messy.
[time=60] They were sinful, broken people that just had a mess in their life.
[time=64] And we are all able to do a couple of things with that.
[time=67] Number one, here's two goals I wanna give you for this series as we go through it.
[time=71] Number one is to identify with those people.
[time=73] Just identify with the people Jesus built relationships with.
[time=76] Here's why I want you to do that.
[time=78] Because when we identify with the people in the Bible, we start to realize that these are not characters in a fairy tale.
[time=86] We realize these are people in history.
[time=88] And I am like those people.
[time=91] And then we realize if God wanted a relationship with those people, He wants a relationship with me too.
[time=96] And so identify with them knowing that God wants you to have a relationship with Him.
[time=100] Secondly, initiate, do something with that.
[time=103] Don't just identify with these people that Jesus built relationships with.
[time=106] Initiate some of the intentionality that you see Jesus implementing in the relationships that He builds.
[time=112] Take that into your relationships and look like Jesus in your relationships.
[time=116] Make sense?
[time=117] That's bad be a good life if we could look a little more like Jesus in those ways.
[time=120] And that's really our hope for this series.
[time=123] Today I wanna talk to you about Jesus and seekers.
[time=126] Jesus and seekers.
[time=127] Last week it was Jesus and the religious.
[time=129] Jesus cleared the temple.
[time=131] I had a whip on stage last Sunday, by the way.
[time=133] If you missed that, now you'll go to blackcock.fi.i and catch up on what you missed.
[time=137] If you missed that, for sure Jesus did the same thing.
[time=140] And so today I wanna take you to the next chapter.
[time=142] We were in chapter two last week, chapter three this week is Jesus and seekers.
[time=146] And that seeker this week is Nicodemus.
[time=149] So part of the religious people, the religious group that we talked about last week, Nicodemus is a part of that crown.
[time=155] And so one of the things we're doing in this series and I wanna invite you into it, is we're reading through the Gospel of John.
[time=161] There's power in getting up and starting your day in the Word of God.
[time=164] I always challenge you.
[time=165] Go biblical before you go digital.
[time=167] And we wanna give you a way to do that this week.
[time=168] So pick up your Bible first, even if it is a digital Bible.
[time=171] Let it be the Word of God that speaks into your life first.
[time=174] And so we've given you a reading plan that will align with the series through the Gospel of John that you can read through it with us as a church this summer for these three months.
[time=183] You can still catch up if you haven't started with us yet.
[time=186] And so you can find that at blackcock.fi.i as well.
[time=188] Here's the question of the week.
[time=189] You guys get to help me preach.
[time=191] And the question I wanna ask you this week is how has God met you in your search for hope?
[time=196] I don't know if that's through another person that he sent, maybe in a dark time.
[time=199] God used a circumstance maybe to get your attention or to meet you in a way that you didn't see it coming.
[time=204] Or maybe it's the Word of God or through prayer.
[time=207] I don't know what that is, but later in the message, I wanna hear from you and I'll go to my phone real time and we'll answer some of those questions.
[time=213] You can do that by in the chat.
[time=215] Even if you're in the room, you can join us with that for a question of the week.
[time=218] All right, so let's dig into John chapter three.
[time=221] But before we do, I wanna kind of give you a preface with these words that we're looking at because Jesus has just finished cleansing the temple.
[time=227] And then now what we see is that, get this, Jesus is now going to personally, intentionally, relationally prioritize one of those very religious leaders that he just got very upset at.
[time=240] A seeker, someone who saw the signs of Jesus knew there was more to this Jesus thing than maybe meets the eye and then sought some deeper understanding.
[time=251] But I chose this word seeker for a reason because I think it gets misdefined a lot of times.
[time=257] Have you ever heard the phrases like churches that are becoming seeker-friendly or seeker-sensitive and attractional models?
[time=263] There's all these words.
[time=264] If you notice that the world is full of words these days.
[time=268] I can't even keep up with all the terminologies and all the definitions.
[time=271] And so what I wanna do is look at this sometimes flawed view of what does it mean to be seeker-friendly, to look at seekers like Jesus did, to have relationships like that the way that Jesus did, but define it from the word of God today.
[time=284] And so when you see the word seeker, you see Jesus even saying things like seek first, the kingdom of God.
[time=289] You see that word throughout scripture, but in Romans chapter three, verse 11, it actually tells us that no one seeks after God.
[time=298] Did you know that?
[time=300] No one seeks after God.
[time=302] Well, that seems confusing, doesn't it?
[time=304] Thought we're supposed to seek after God.
[time=305] Jesus said seek first.
[time=307] Well, the context of that passage, and this is the beginning point, is knowing that naturally and in and of ourselves, we don't seek after God.
[time=314] We all seek.
[time=315] Look at your neighbor and tell him, you're a seeker.
[time=317] Tell him, you are a seeker.
[time=319] You are seeking something in your life.
[time=322] You may be seeking to abandon the pain that you're going through.
[time=325] You may be seeking to get out of a circumstance that you're in.
[time=328] You may be seeking purpose.
[time=331] You may be seeking something this bigger than what this world has to offer.
[time=334] We all seek, we all have that tendency, that innate need to find something more.
[time=341] But what we don't do, because we are born into a sin-filled world, is we don't naturally, with all of our hearts, seek after God first.
[time=349] That's why Jesus would say seek first the kingdom of God, because that's not natural for us.
[time=353] And that's what Paul is writing about in the book of Romans.
[time=357] And so we don't naturally do that.
[time=358] And here's the best part of it all.
[time=360] Since nobody naturally seeks God in and of ourselves.
[time=364] You know what God did?
[time=365] God seeks us.
[time=369] Genesis chapter three, just after the fall in verse nine, Adam and Eve have sinned and they're hiding, naked in the garden.
[time=376] And what does God do?
[time=377] He says, well, I'm just gonna leave them there.
[time=379] Forget them.
[time=381] Nope.
[time=381] He seeks after them.
[time=383] He goes to where they are.
[time=384] And since then, God has been seeking the lost sinful people of the world.
[time=390] Jesus himself makes that very clear that that is his priority, that that is his mission statement.
[time=396] He gave us this as his mission statement.
[time=397] Luke chapter 19 and verse 10.
[time=400] Luke 19, 10, Jesus said for the son of man, this is Jesus, came to seek and to save the lost.
[time=407] So Jesus came to seek the lost, but notice what he also does as we go through this passage.
[time=412] Jesus also prioritizes the lost who were seeking, period.
[time=417] Even if they're not seeking him, if they're seeking Jesus prioritizes those people.
[time=421] The son of man came to seek and to save that which is lost.
[time=424] And so here's the thing, seeker friendly, seeker sensitive, all of these words is black talk this, is black talk that.
[time=430] I wanna speak to exactly what kind of church are we?
[time=433] If by seeker sensitive, if by seeker friendly, you mean and you define it as watering down the gospel and saying, hey, just believe in Jesus and your life's gonna get better.
[time=442] And that's all she wrote.
[time=443] Then absolutely not, that is not who black talk is.
[time=446] That is not the gospel.
[time=448] But if seeker friendly, if seeker focused, if seeker sensitive means prioritizing the lost the way that Jesus did, that my friends is the very essence of the gospel and black talk will always unapologetically be that kind of a church.
[time=466] There is a seat for everyone at black talk.
[time=469] Why?
[time=470] Because there is a seat for everyone at the table of the family of God and Jesus made it very clear that this was and is and always will be his mission and aren't you glad of that?
[time=481] I sure am because I'm one of those.
[time=483] And I'm sure glad that Jesus was lost sensitive, seeker sensitive, seeker friendly.
[time=489] Because if it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be a part of the family of God.
[time=492] And if we're to be the hands and feet of Jesus, the body of Christ as his church, then we've gotta look like Jesus.
[time=498] And Jesus even said it this way, his words after he talked about the lost, the lost sheep, the lost coin, the lost son, the prodigal son story, Luke 15, 15 seven, Luke 15 seven, Jesus said, just so.
[time=509] I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one center who repents than over the 99 righteous persons who need no repentance.
[time=518] So here's a question, a sobering question.
[time=520] Now that we're defining biblically, what does it mean to be a seeker?
[time=524] I wanna ask us a question as a church before we even get into Nicodemus.
[time=527] Because so many times we have these definition blocks and barriers that keep us from reading the word of God in the context that God wants to read it in.
[time=535] And so here's the question I wanna ask us today.
[time=537] If our priorities as a church do not match the priorities of our founder, then who are we following?
[time=546] And what are we doing?
[time=550] If our priorities as a church don't look like the priorities of the founder of the church, Jesus said, I'll build, say it with me, I'll build my church, not your church and Kevin's church and the elders church and the, no, my church, if our priorities as a church as the body of Christ don't look like the priorities of our founder, who are we following?
[time=568] It's not Jesus, if we're not focused on the things he's focused on.
[time=571] So I wanna keep us focused.
[time=572] And I'm so glad relationally that Jesus focused on us.
[time=575] And we had a great illustration of this.
[time=577] Before I get into Nicodemus story, I wanna show you this picture.
[time=580] This is our New York team.
[time=581] They just got back several in the room.
[time=583] Raise your hand if you were in New York.
[time=584] I say at least two, three of you in the room.
[time=587] Yeah, they were in New York.
[time=588] This is the team.
[time=589] We had 10 people from Black Hawk and two from another church.
[time=592] We partnered together with other students, college students, churches in New York.
[time=597] And so they went to New York specifically to do evangelism training and to then go implement that training in the streets of New York.
[time=605] And I am so proud of them.
[time=606] My wife was one of them.
[time=608] And they just got back last night.
[time=609] And about middle of the week, one of my kids looked at me and said, Dad, we say a lot of pizza this week.
[time=615] And I know, guys, I'm sorry, I'm doing my best.
[time=619] And they were fine with pizza, but they sure were glad for mom to get back.
[time=622] And so to our New York team, I'm so glad that you are home.
[time=625] But guys, get this.
[time=626] They went out.
[time=627] You talk about going beyond the Black Hawk bubble.
[time=630] They busted some bubbles.
[time=632] They went beyond their comfort zone.
[time=634] And here's some stats.
[time=635] This blew my mind.
[time=636] I saw this last night.
[time=637] I'm so proud of our team that went there.
[time=639] They prayed for over 200 people.
[time=643] This 12, 12 is a pretty good number, don't you think?
[time=646] They prayed for over 200 people.
[time=649] They shared the good news, the gospel of Jesus, with over 100 people.
[time=654] And they saw nine people give their lives to King Jesus.
[time=659] Let's give it up for the praise God.
[time=664] And you know, the best part is they didn't just do that and then walk away.
[time=666] They were able to through international project in the seeds week.
[time=669] This is Mike Roland's son, Gary, and his wife.
[time=672] They lived there, part of our partnerships that we're building.
[time=675] We're so excited about that.
[time=676] They were able to connect them to churches and to Christian resources and people who will walk with them on a journey of discipleship, just like we try to do here at Black Hall.
[time=684] So guys, we are so proud of you.
[time=686] And I'm thankful for your step of faith because you're embodying the priorities of the founder of God's church.
[time=692] The priorities of Jesus were seen in them this last week and I'm so proud of them.
[time=697] Let's see Jesus, because he's the ultimate example, as much as we try to be an example, as much as these guys are a good example, let's look at the example of Jesus.
[time=704] John chapter three, verses one through 21.
[time=707] We'll just read straight through the story and all its verses.
[time=710] You ready for the word today?
[time=711] Let's dig in.
[time=713] Verse one, John chapter three.
[time=714] Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
[time=718] This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him.
[time=728] Jesus answered him, truly I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." Nicodemus said to him, "How can a man be born his old?" Fair question.
[time=739] Can he enter a second time and do his mother's womb and be born?
[time=743] Jesus answered, "Truly, truly I say to you, unless one is born of water and the spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God." That which is born of flesh is flesh and that which is born of spirit is spirit.
[time=754] Do not marvel that I said to you, you must be born again.
[time=758] The wind blows wherever it wishes and you hear it sound but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes.
[time=765] So it is with everyone who is born of the spirit.
[time=768] Nicodemus said to him, "How can these things be?" Maybe you're here saying the same thing.
[time=773] How can these things be?
[time=775] Verse 10, Jesus answered him, "Are you the teacher of Israel?
[time=778] The teacher of Israel." We'll get there in just a moment.
[time=780] Yet you do not understand these things.
[time=782] Truly, truly I say to you.
[time=784] We speak of what we know and bear witness to what we have seen but you do not receive our testimony.
[time=792] If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
[time=798] No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the son of man, this Jesus.
[time=803] And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the son of man be lifted up that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.
[time=811] And then the most popular verse in the Bible, perhaps is John 3, 16.
[time=815] For God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.
[time=823] For God did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but in order that the world might be saved through him.
[time=829] Whoever believes in him is not condemned but whoever does not believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only son of God.
[time=839] And this is the judgment.
[time=840] The light has come into the world and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil.
[time=847] For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come into the light lest his works should be exposed.
[time=854] But whoever does what is true comes to the light so that it may be clearly seen and that his works have been carried out by God.
[time=862] And Lord we pray that your words, the red letters of our Bible, the words of Jesus would penetrate our hearts.
[time=867] Lord as we're seeking, we're all seeking something today and as Nicodemus was God we pray that as we unpack the words that you gave to him that it would be words straight to our heart from you.
[time=877] We love you and ask it all in Jesus name, amen.
[time=881] So hey, this scene here with a religious leader, Nicodemus, it's interesting as we look at this.
[time=887] By the way, I don't know if you've watched the new Jesus show that's on television, The Chosen.
[time=893] My wife and I've been watching that and I've gotta tell you, I whip like a baby watching the depiction of Jesus and Nicodemus.
[time=900] It's about a 10 minute clip and you could even just Google The Chosen, Jesus and Nicodemus.
[time=906] I challenge you to do that this week and just watch the context, the way the conversational approach that you see Jesus depicted as taking straight from these words that we just read this week.
[time=916] Just an extra little devotional resource for you this week.
[time=919] Check that out.
[time=920] And so here's what I wanna do.
[time=920] As we look at this, what I really see here is Jesus gave Nicodemus four illustrations of salvation.
[time=927] Four salvation illustrations that Jesus used with Nicodemus.
[time=931] And I wanna give you all of them and from the first one is birth.
[time=935] It's the new birth and it's from verses three through seven.
[time=938] But the first couple of verses, you see a couple of shifts in Nicodemus.
[time=941] The first shift is you see Nicodemus going from signs to seeking.
[time=945] He says, hey, I've seen all these signs and nobody can do the kind of signs that you're doing unless God is in him.
[time=951] There's something special about you.
[time=953] And so now he's seeking a deeper understanding.
[time=955] He may not even know exactly what he's seeking.
[time=957] In fact, we know he doesn't because he doesn't even receive it.
[time=960] And maybe that's where you are.
[time=961] Maybe you've seen God doing some things in your life, but today God has led you just to seek.
[time=966] You don't know what you're seeking but you're looking for more.
[time=968] You're looking for answers and Jesus is just that.
[time=972] And that's what we see in this passage.
[time=973] Nicodemus also shifts from teacher to student.
[time=977] He shifts from teacher to student.
[time=979] He's verse 10, he's the teacher of Israel.
[time=981] He is a member of the Sanhedrin.
[time=983] He is the top of the list when it comes with these religious leaders that Jesus has just dealt with in chapter two.
[time=989] He's got it made.
[time=990] He's got a lot of authority.
[time=991] He's got a big voice.
[time=992] He's got a big impact.
[time=994] But he goes from teacher to student.
[time=997] Jesus has a way of doing that.
[time=1000] The more you seek Jesus, the more humble you will become.
[time=1004] Because the more you seek Jesus, the more you realize, I do not have it all figured out.
[time=1009] And I need some answers beyond what I can get for myself.
[time=1012] And he came by night.
[time=1014] We'll look at that more in depth in a moment because he didn't want to be embarrassed because he had appointments in the day.
[time=1019] Who knows?
[time=1020] It doesn't say for sure, but we think probably as you look at this, he doesn't want to be seen being with this Jesus because Jesus is not well liked at the moment.
[time=1027] Can you imagine after he made the whip and flipped the tables and that, he's probably not very popular with the religious crowd that Nicodemus is a part of.
[time=1034] But yet he has to learn more.
[time=1036] And so these four illustrations, number one is birth.
[time=1039] It's the new birth.
[time=1040] It's from verses three through seven.
[time=1042] It's literally translated, born from above.
[time=1045] It's born again.
[time=1046] It's born from above.
[time=1047] It's a different kind of birth.
[time=1049] And this theme of life is big in the words of Jesus.
[time=1054] And especially as John depicts the words of Jesus, do you know John and John's gospel?
[time=1059] He uses the word life 36 times as he's talking about the ministry of Jesus.
[time=1064] And so this illustration of a birth is a very powerful salvation illustration.
[time=1069] Then when God saves us, we get born again spiritually.
[time=1072] It's water and the spirit as he told Nicodemus.
[time=1075] Water meaning physical birth.
[time=1077] Spirit meaning a spiritual birth from above.
[time=1080] Literally translated as exactly what this word means as we look at it.
[time=1083] When we are born again, God opens our eyes to the truth.
[time=1087] He gives us faith.
[time=1089] He gives us forgiveness.
[time=1091] He gives us fellowship as a part of the family of God.
[time=1095] We become new creations.
[time=1096] Second Corinthians chapter five and verse 17.
[time=1098] He makes us new.
[time=1100] And in that newness of life, he changes our desires.
[time=1103] He changes our nature.
[time=1104] Psalm 73 shows us this.
[time=1106] He gives us a cleansed heart.
[time=1108] Hebrews chapter 10.
[time=1109] This sounds great.
[time=1110] I need all these things.
[time=1111] Can I get it amen?
[time=1112] And then after that, he gives us a new mind.
[time=1114] As you know, as a follower of Jesus, as a child of God, you have the mind of Christ.
[time=1121] We get a new mind.
[time=1122] First Corinthians two.
[time=1123] And in the power of the Holy Spirit, you talk about defining seeking.
[time=1126] In the power of the Holy Spirit, now we have what it takes to truly begin to seek God.
[time=1132] To seek first the kingdom of God.
[time=1134] But it starts with God seeking us.
[time=1136] And I'm glad that he did that.
[time=1139] Verses 3, 3, 4.
[time=1140] How can one be born again?
[time=1141] It's new birth.
[time=1142] Can I enter my mother's womb again?
[time=1145] I'm an old man.
[time=1146] You can imagine Nicodemus sitting there and it's like, you see these gray hairs are the lack thereof?
[time=1150] I'm an old guy.
[time=1151] How can I be born again?
[time=1153] Doesn't make any sense.
[time=1154] How can this be?
[time=1155] Here's the thing.
[time=1156] Some context Jesus was seen as someone who would come and establish something new, being that he would be a military leader who would overthrow Rome.
[time=1165] Rome was this oppressive power.
[time=1167] And the Jews looked to the Messiah to come and overthrow Rome.
[time=1171] They were waiting for him to establish a kingdom.
[time=1173] And boy, Jesus had a kingdom in mind, but it was not the kingdom that even his disciples and certainly religious leaders thought that it would look like.
[time=1180] That's the only new thing they thought he would do.
[time=1182] Basically, people looked at Jesus as being a Messiah if he's that, as a continuation of something old, something that had been around.
[time=1190] The law, the scripture that they had at the time.
[time=1193] But in fact, Jesus came not as the continuation of something old, but the inauguration of something new.
[time=1199] He came to start a new kingdom, a new covenant through his blood.
[time=1204] And that's how we have the newness of life, because he did something new that none of us could do on our own.
[time=1210] That is the gospel.
[time=1211] It is his blood that brought this new kingdom, this new life, this new opportunity to us.
[time=1216] And listen, here's what happened.
[time=1217] You know, he cleansed the temple.
[time=1219] A big part of that is because he was inaugurating a new way for us to see, to feel, to experience
[time=1225] the manifestation of the presence of God in our lives.
[time=1229] Because at this time, the temple was the place of God's presence.
[time=1233] God's presence was confined to a place.
[time=1236] You would go to the temple to meet with God, to worship God.
[time=1239] Jesus is coming, and they don't know this yet.
[time=1241] We get the benefit of looking back and seeing the stuff that they couldn't have known at the time, because we have the Word of God, and this is played out through history.
[time=1248] Jesus moved the presence of God from a place, the temple, to a people who is the church.
[time=1255] Now because of the Holy Spirit coming and indwelling us, as we become a part of the family of God, his presence is not something that we go seek to find at a place.
[time=1264] His presence is a part of us.
[time=1266] His presence indwells us.
[time=1268] Jesus did something new in that he took an old place that characterized the presence
[time=1274] of God and moved it to a people who are his kids, his sons, his daughters, the church, the body of Christ, the family of God.
[time=1283] I'm glad I get to be a part of that family.
[time=1285] I'm glad that Jesus did that.
[time=1286] That's the new birth.
[time=1287] This is what Jesus is establishing in verses 5 through 7.
[time=1290] The water and the spirit, again, water, you're born with water.
[time=1294] Water is a part of birth, it represents a physical birth, but the spirit is a spiritual birth.
[time=1300] Something that happens on the inside.
[time=1301] It's born from above.
[time=1303] We're born here below, aren't we?
[time=1305] That's why we're here.
[time=1306] Not if you were born.
[time=1307] Just making sure you're, okay, yeah, good.
[time=1309] Just making sure nobody's nodding off.
[time=1310] We're called to be born from above.
[time=1314] God wants us to be a part of this family.
[time=1316] So number one is birth.
[time=1317] Number two is this picture here of when Jesus gives starting in verse 8.
[time=1324] And before I tell you that, I got to go back and say something about the birth.
[time=1327] This is so important.
[time=1328] We're talking about relationships.
[time=1329] Sorry, I got ahead of myself.
[time=1330] I'm so excited today.
[time=1331] Are you excited?
[time=1332] Let me back up.
[time=1333] Can I have grace to go back?
[time=1336] Back to the sacred place versus the sacred people, because God has made that shift.
[time=1343] That is why your relationships matter.
[time=1347] Because God shifted his presence from a place to a people, because he so values people, that's
[time=1354] why the person that sits with you right now, that's why you're spouse, that's why you're co-worker, that's why you're grandkids, that's why those people you influence, that's why those lost people who are your neighbors, whoever it may be in your life, that is why your relationship with them matters so much.
[time=1370] If it matters that much to God, it's got to matter to us.
[time=1375] Birth is number one.
[time=1376] Number two is the wind.
[time=1378] And the word in the Hebrew and Greek for wind, it's interesting.
[time=1382] It can be translated equally so, spirit.
[time=1384] In fact, it is the same word, it's spirit, wind, spirit, and so you would see why Jesus would use this comparison or this illustration in verse 8.
[time=1392] He says just as wind, it's not seen, but you hear it, you feel it, you know it's effects,
[time=1398] so it is with one who is born of the spirit.
[time=1400] We don't see the presence of God, we don't see the spirit, we don't see this new birth, but just like we don't see the wind, we know it's there.
[time=1408] We see the effects.
[time=1409] Indiana has some pretty strong wind, I learned coming from Georgia, and there are some nights where I woke up saying, man, is it a tornado out there, we feel the wind is strong.
[time=1417] We don't see it, but boy, we see what happens because of it, and that's what happens with the new birth, and that's what Jesus is teaching, Nicodemus, even though you may not feel God, even though you may not see his presence in a powerful, manifested, present, physically
[time=1432] way in your life today, you know it's effects because it changes you from the inside out,
[time=1438] so it is with those who are born of the spirit, those who were born again.
[time=1443] And I love verse 9, Nicodemus says, how can these things be, let's say that together,
[time=1449] how can these things be, one more time, how can these things be?
[time=1455] It's a mystery, isn't it?
[time=1456] That word is used for the gospel throughout Scripture because it just seems so far above our head, doesn't it?
[time=1462] It was for Nicodemus, and as we look at his responses, we know he had trouble receiving it.
[time=1467] In fact, verses 10 through 13, Jesus says, you hear these things, paraphrase, Kevin, version here, you hear these things, but you don't receive the testimony that we're given to, you don't follow it, and I'm so glad, did you know Nicodemus would eventually follow
[time=1481] it, at least from what we can tell, because at the end of Jesus' life, Jesus was buried in a tomb, it was the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and you know who was there?
[time=1489] Helping that process, helping Jesus get to the tomb, which by the way, would have been a very dangerous mission, because there was all kind of things going on there that shouldn't have been going on there, and Jesus was a pretty polarizing figure in case you haven't noticed as we look at his ministry, boy, the impacts of Jesus turned into messy stuff when it impacted the messy people that watched the process, but you know who was there at the tomb with Joseph of Arimathea, Nicodemus, tells you something about what happened maybe
[time=1514] after John chapter 3, doesn't it, and I'm so glad, and some of you, you've had seeds planted in your life all many years, and today I believe they're going to come to fruition,
[time=1523] maybe just like Nicodemus today, and so as we look at his question, how can these things be?
[time=1528] I'm reminded of several places in Scripture, I won't go through a lot of them, but I think of Mary, the mother of Jesus, when Gabriel came to her and said, "You're going to give birth to the Son of the living God." You know what Mary said, Luke chapter 1 and verse 34, she said, "How can this be?"
[time=1543] Same question that Nicodemus asked, pretty interesting, isn't it?
[time=1547] John chapter 14 and verse 6, "Perhaps you've heard that verse is where Jesus says, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no one comes with the Father except through me.'" You know what verse 5 is?
[time=1556] It's doubting Thomas, disciple of Jesus, and you know what he asks?
[time=1559] He says, "Well, how can we know the way?
[time=1562] How can this be?" Same kind of question.
[time=1565] How can we know the way?
[time=1566] John 14, 5, and in the same way Nicodemus asked the same question, and you know what I've learned, as it was for Nicodemus it is for us, it's difficult to give up all that we have.
[time=1575] Nicodemus would have had a lot to lose, he had a lot to lose, he lost a lot from what
[time=1581] we can see of him, knowing that he was at the tomb with Jesus at the end of Jesus' life.
[time=1585] He lost, but it's difficult for us to surrender all we have to follow the truth.
[time=1592] But I believe that there's no greater journey, and I want to invite you on to that same journey today.
[time=1596] So let's talk about this question of the week because I believe we all search for hope.
[time=1600] So here's the question of the week, how has God met you in your search for hope?
[time=1606] Real time here, let's see what you guys got.
[time=1608] Mike said, "Watching my family and friends except Christ." Oh my goodness, that is powerful, and praying that more will come to know the Lord.
[time=1617] How have you seen God meet you?
[time=1619] How has God met you in your search for hope?
[time=1620] Well, watching other people come to Christ, Mike, that is so powerful, so true.
[time=1624] Deborah says, "God has met me in my search for hope by providing godly parents." Ooh, parents, you better be listening today.
[time=1630] Our role really matters.
[time=1632] By providing godly parents, a village of godly people, that would be the church, that's community.
[time=1636] We've talked about community a lot lately.
[time=1638] Receding in prayer, teaching me, and of course reading God's word for myself and hiding his word in my heart.
[time=1644] Powerful.
[time=1645] Lynette says, "God has provided hope for me by surrounding me with educated people to direct me to correct cancer doctor, praise God."
[time=1656] Yes, and also surrounded me with Christian friends and family asking to pray with me.
[time=1662] God has given me hope.
[time=1664] Some of you are battling cancer, it's like Lynette's journey.
[time=1667] Some of you are in dark places.
[time=1669] Some of you are in the night of your life.
[time=1670] When did Nicodemus come?
[time=1672] When did he come?
[time=1673] By night.
[time=1674] Some of you are in the night of your life, and I thank God for how he provides hope.
[time=1677] So many more there, you can look on our chats and see so many great answers, and I thank God for all of those answers today.
[time=1684] Let me give you number three, birth, wind, now Old Testament.
[time=1689] Love this.
[time=1691] In the Old Testament, Jesus moves to John chapter 3 verses 14 through 18, and he talks about this passage in numbers, as what he's looking at.
[time=1698] Numbers 21 verses 4 through 9, if you want to look it up.
[time=1701] Numbers 21, 4 through 9, and this is the story of the Israelites, and they're in the wilderness, and as their serpents are biting them, and they're dying, sounds fun, right?
[time=1712] And as they're dying, God provided a way of salvation for them from the death by the serpents, right?
[time=1718] And so what he does is he tells Moses to put, "Make a bronze serpent on a pole and to lift it up in front of the people." The people of Israel would look at that serpent on the pole, and as they got bitten, they wouldn't
[time=1730] die.
[time=1731] If they would look to that serpent that was lifted up on the pole, and Jesus uses, I love this, Jesus uses an Old Testament passage, hundreds and hundreds of years before all of these events.
[time=1739] And Nicodemus would know this story.
[time=1741] He's a scholar of, he's the scholar of scholars, he's the teacher of Israel, verse 10.
[time=1746] He knows this story, and he says, "In the same way, the Son of Man must be lifted up." And you know what the verb, the original language here, the verb for lifted up, it has kind of this weird dual meaning.
[time=1758] It means both crucified and glorified.
[time=1761] Lift it up.
[time=1762] Now how is that?
[time=1763] That would be confusing.
[time=1764] Can you imagine being Nicodemus right now?
[time=1766] Born again, the wind, this Old Testament passage, now you're saying the Son of Man's got to be lifted, just like the serpent was lifted up.
[time=1773] So if you're going to be crucified and be humiliated, I thought you were going to be this big military leader, you were going to overthrow Rome, you were going to do all these things, if you're the Messiah, I don't even know if you're the Messiah.
[time=1781] Now you're saying you're going to be crucified, but it means you're glorified.
[time=1785] How can this be?
[time=1786] Can you blame him for asking the question?
[time=1789] Gets kind of confusing, doesn't it?
[time=1790] But I'm so thankful for this definition and these illustrations because Jesus in the context of this prophecy that he turns it into, he shows I'm the fulfillment of what was talked about.
[time=1801] Just as that serpent was lifted up, the Son of Man must be lifted up, crucified and glorified so that we can be right with God and have this relationship with God.
[time=1810] Then in the so cool, then we have the most popular verse probably in all of the Bible.
[time=1816] This is the context for it, is the Old Testament, the Word of God coming together and culminating in John 3, 16, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever
[time=1826] believes in him will not perish but have everlasting life.
[time=1831] In that a beautiful picture of how the whole Bible points to that one verse, Jesus is the fulfillment of all of that and that's what he's showing Nicodemus here.
[time=1840] I love John 3, 16 for so many reasons but here's three things that it shows us God's love is.
[time=1846] It's great, it's generous, it's global.
[time=1849] For God so loved, it's a great, great, great love.
[time=1852] For God so loved the world that he gave, it's a generous love.
[time=1858] We're never more like God, I don't think than when we give because this is how God showed his love.
[time=1862] He gave his Son.
[time=1863] And it's global, for God so loved the world that he gave his Son that who does that include?
[time=1871] You know what the Greek word?
[time=1872] It's not a trick question.
[time=1873] The Greek word.
[time=1874] You know what it means?
[time=1875] It's really deep.
[time=1876] Everybody.
[time=1877] Global.
[time=1878] It applies to anybody and everybody, no matter where you've been, no matter what you've done and I'm so thankful that when we look at verse 17, we're not here to condemn the world.
[time=1888] Because you know that, sometimes Christianity becomes this cockadoodle do of condemnation
[time=1894] in churches.
[time=1895] We become religious roosters, I call it.
[time=1898] You ever met a religious rooster?
[time=1900] All they do is condemn, condemn, condemn and point the finger and point the finger and point the finger.
[time=1904] This is why we're not here to be religious roosters, to be the cockadoodle do of condemnation.
[time=1909] If Jesus didn't come to condemn the world, then neither are we here to do so.
[time=1913] Jesus, verse 17, I didn't come to condemn the world.
[time=1916] And if we don't believe in the name of the only Son of God, we're condemned already.
[time=1920] We're walking dead people.
[time=1922] We were dead.
[time=1923] We are dead in our trespasses and scents, but God sent Jesus.
[time=1929] I'm so glad that the whole Bible, all of history points to these very facts.
[time=1934] And listen, my friends, this is why, this is the why.
[time=1937] This is the why behind our eight-year vision.
[time=1938] If you haven't heard us talk about that in our vision Sunday, you can go back to our vision Sunday.
[time=1942] We have a vision for these next eight years leading up to our 60th anniversary, which is in 2029, September of 2029, our 60th anniversary of the church.
[time=1950] To develop and send 1,500 ambassadors beyond our Black Hawk bubble.
[time=1955] We want to go beyond our comfort zone, just like our New York team did this week.
[time=1959] That was out of your comfort zone, right?
[time=1960] Jenny, Stan, Arlen, I see some of you in the room.
[time=1963] That was pretty out of the comfort zone.
[time=1965] I was so proud of my wife and the whole team just stepping out of their comfort zone.
[time=1969] We want to go beyond our Black Hawk bubble because we tend to build bubbles, don't we?
[time=1972] And Christianity is like, "Well, don't pop my bubble.
[time=1974] Make my seat comfortable.
[time=1975] Don't take my seat.
[time=1976] Make sure the coffee is exactly right." All these things.
[time=1979] And hey, we love those things.
[time=1980] It helps us create a good environment for us to come and learn about Jesus.
[time=1983] Why though?
[time=1984] So that we go beyond our Black Hawk bubble so that we can even bring people into our bubble.
[time=1989] And boy, I'm telling you, when you start doing that, things get kind of uncomfortable.
[time=1993] But we have this vision to develop and send 1,500 ambassadors, 2 Corinthians chapter 5, verse 15 and verse 20 is the picture of those ambassadors that go beyond their bubble.
[time=2003] Why to reach people who are far from God, but close to us.
[time=2007] And what would our church look like if we embodied that kind of a mindset?
[time=2011] Because that is the mindset of Jesus and He's even using the Old Testament to help us see that.
[time=2016] So here's the question I want to ask you today.
[time=2019] Who's far from God, but close to me?
[time=2021] Not you.
[time=2022] I didn't say you on purpose because then you're like, "Well, that's a question for them." This is your question.
[time=2027] Ask yourself in your heart right now, who in my life?
[time=2030] Right now, who is far from God but close to me?
[time=2035] I just want to let it sit for a minute.
[time=2040] There have been many times in my life because I've created a Christian bubble, if I'm honest.
[time=2045] That list is kind of short.
[time=2048] That when I look at the circle of relationships that God has given me, I don't open myself
[time=2054] up to people who don't think like me.
[time=2057] I don't often open myself up to people who stretch me beyond my comfort zone, people who don't believe like I believe.
[time=2062] It becomes so easy, church, listen, don't miss this.
[time=2065] Look at me.
[time=2066] It becomes so easy just like last week in the temple, the court of the Gentiles where Jesus turned over all the tables.
[time=2071] Why was He so mad?
[time=2072] Because people were making it difficult for people to come to God.
[time=2075] Why was that so important?
[time=2076] Because listen, they were making the convenience and the comfort of insiders in the temple more important than the avenue and the portal for people outside the church to come and know about God.
[time=2088] And so I want to challenge you this week to consider this question.
[time=2092] Maybe you need to develop some relationships outside of your bubble.
[time=2097] Number four, and this is what will happen, is light and darkness.
[time=2100] It's birth.
[time=2101] I love these illustrations of Jesus' birth.
[time=2103] It's wind.
[time=2104] It's the Old Testament from Numbers 21.
[time=2105] And now in verses 19 through 21, it's light and darkness.
[time=2109] I love this picture.
[time=2110] John really loves this contrast.
[time=2112] You see him talk about light and darkness a lot.
[time=2115] In fact, we love that contrast.
[time=2116] If you know our vision state, but stay it with me at Blackhawk, our missions to make disciples that make disciples where our vision is to light the one-five.
[time=2124] And we want to light the one-five because of John's writing, John 1-5 says the light has entered the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it.
[time=2131] So we want to be ambassadors of light in our community, across our street, among our city
[time=2137] and around the world.
[time=2138] In our 1-5 zip code, where God has planted us all the way to 15 global regions around the world and everywhere in between.
[time=2143] That's where our vision comes from and we want to do that by being ambassadors.
[time=2147] But notice that Nicodemus, verse 2, he came to Jesus by night.
[time=2151] By night.
[time=2152] Do you remember that?
[time=2153] I've talked about why a little bit.
[time=2155] But I love this picture because Nicodemus was in kind of a dark season in his life.
[time=2161] He was searching.
[time=2162] He was seeking.
[time=2163] I don't know what he felt, but I would imagine it probably felt a little hopeless.
[time=2165] I would imagine it probably felt a little bit like, man, all this stuff I thought I knew.
[time=2171] Maybe I don't know it.
[time=2172] Maybe you're in that kind of place.
[time=2173] Maybe you're in a night season in your life.
[time=2176] But here's what I've learned about my God.
[time=2178] He's such a redeeming kind of God.
[time=2180] Did you know that?
[time=2181] God is a redeeming God.
[time=2182] He redeems the night with light.
[time=2186] And I've learned that God often does his greatest work in the darkest seasons.
[time=2190] And so for those of you who are in the night of your life, not that it's about to end, I didn't prophesy that over you today, but it's a dark season in your life.
[time=2200] Look for God in that season.
[time=2201] Look for his light, because light stands in a stark contrast against a dark backdrop.
[time=2207] We see it in Nicodemus life and in ours.
[time=2209] In verses 19 through 21, we see a real clear call that we don't like to go into the light when we're living in darkness.
[time=2215] Did you know that?
[time=2216] Because then you know what light does in darkness, it exposes everything that's in the darkness.
[time=2219] If we're living in darkness, we don't want light to expose those things, right?
[time=2223] And some of you are doing that, and that's why you're hiding from the light.
[time=2226] And it's time to step into the light, to get help if you need it, to come into community and work through whatever it is that maybe is causing you to hide from the light.
[time=2234] Step into the light of God and be the light of God as ambassadors that God has called us to be.
[time=2240] And so here's the question I want to ask us now is how can I best exemplify these illustrations of salvation here with my life?
[time=2247] If it doesn't go home with us, then why are we even doing it?
[time=2250] I want to give you an answer to that question.
[time=2253] I believe the best way we can do that is to own our story for God's glory.
[time=2258] And to own my story for God's glory, share my story for God's glory.
[time=2262] I still believe with all of my heart that the greatest tool God has given you to share the gospel, the good news of Jesus, is your story.
[time=2271] Is your story.
[time=2273] You say my story, your story.
[time=2275] God is writing it that he's not done and he wants to use it to help other people.
[time=2279] And at Black Hawk, we've got this vision, a part of that ambassador vision for this next year, the short-term horizon of that vision, we're calling it 22 for 22.
[time=2288] We want to have 22 second Corinthians 5, 15 and 20 ambassador stories of people going beyond their comfort zone, of people reaching people far from God but close to them.
[time=2297] 22 of those ambassador stories through the course of 2022.
[time=2302] And I believe your story is one of those stories.
[time=2304] And if that's you, we've got staff pastors that would love to just respond to you personally.
[time=2309] You're not committing to do it yet.
[time=2311] But if you feel prompted by God to share your story, we're going to have a lot of ways for you to do that this upcoming year.
[time=2316] You can just send us a simple email, mystory@blackhawkministries.org, mystory@blackhawkministries.org.
[time=2324] You'll get a personal response from somebody on our team who will just say, "Hey, let's grab a call and let's talk about your story a little bit and see the best way we can help you share it." And we're going to share the gospel and be ambassadors of light with people all over the world.
[time=2337] I want to give you two application questions as we wrap up our time together today.
[time=2343] Number one is how will you seek God this week?
[time=2346] No one seeks God on our own, do we?
[time=2348] Aren't you glad God seeks us first and then teaches us to seek Him?
[time=2351] So now, if you're a part of the family of God, how will you seek God this week?
[time=2355] Maybe go biblical before you go digital.
[time=2357] Maybe it's to engage in prayer, maybe you've been numb in that for a while.
[time=2360] Maybe it's time to re-engage.
[time=2362] Number two, how will you prioritize the lost like Jesus did?
[time=2367] This has been something that's on my heart and watching the team in New York just stoked that fire in me.
[time=2371] It's been a big part of the vision that God has laid on my heart since I've been here.
[time=2375] You know that about me, I always want to present the gospel.
[time=2378] I always want to make a way for people to hear and to respond to the gospel, the good news of Jesus.
[time=2382] So how can you, this week, prioritize the lost the way that Jesus did?
[time=2386] I ask you again, who is far from God, but they're close to you and you have a voice in their life?
[time=2393] Believers, ponder those questions.
[time=2394] I want to ask you to bow your heads and close your eyes and some of you though would say, "You know what, I'm that name." And you know, as we did the ambassador vision, we sent in names and we had over 300 names
[time=2405] submitted of people who were far from God but close to us and I pray God is using you.
[time=2411] I'll give you a checkup question, how is God using you?
[time=2415] Have you engaged with that person?
[time=2416] Have you sent him a text?
[time=2417] You sent him an email?
[time=2418] Have you given him a call?
[time=2419] Have you invited him to coffee?
[time=2421] Have you had him over to your house?
[time=2422] Have you tried to build a relationship intentionally with them?
[time=2425] Let's identify with Nicodemus, but now let's initiate the intentionality that Jesus demonstrated with Nicodemus.
[time=2431] Let's do that in our own relationships church.
[time=2434] Let's prioritize the lost.
[time=2436] Jesus came to seek and to save that which is lost.
[time=2438] May we do the same.
[time=2440] Some of you fit that category of lost and today you would say, "If I were to die today, I just don't know that it's been eternity with God in heaven because of my relationship with Jesus.
[time=2450] I just don't know that I've surrendered my life to him, that I'm trusting in Jesus and Jesus alone for salvation.
[time=2455] I just don't know that I've transferred from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of light.
[time=2460] I don't know that I'm a part of the family of God.
[time=2462] Here's the good news.
[time=2463] God wants you to be a part of his family today.
[time=2467] Right now, he's seeking you and you feel him right now perhaps wherever you're at, you're watching on a screen, you're in the room right now.
[time=2474] If you feel the spirit of God prompting in your heart, don't squeeze the seat.
[time=2480] Don't hold on to your life anymore.
[time=2483] Open up your heart.
[time=2484] Open up your hands and let it go.
[time=2487] Late at the feet of Jesus, salvation is simply believing that Jesus is who he says he is, that he died to pay a price for your sin and mine as our perfect sacrifice, that we could never be for ourselves.
[time=2498] And he rose from the dead to defeat death hell in the grave so that moments just like this could happen so that you could become a part of the family of God as a son and a daughter
[time=2509] of the king of kings and the Lord of lords.
[time=2512] It's not about a perfect prayer that saves you.
[time=2514] I'm not going to lead you in one.
[time=2515] Your heart's screaming it.
[time=2516] So will you cry out to him right now in this moment?
[time=2518] Don't wait another second.
[time=2520] Do that right now.
