[time=0] We're in a series called Messy. We're in the Gospel of John, and so meet me there in John's Gospel.
[time=5] There are a lot of John's in your Bible. This is the one towards the middle, the big John as we call him.
[time=10] So John chapter 4 is where we will be today, and we are reading through the Gospel of John as a church body this summer.
[time=16] We're doing a 12-week series. This is our third week, but even if you're just catching up with us, still plenty of time to do the reading plan with us.
[time=22] You can go to blackhawk.fyi, and you can find an outline of this series as well as the reading plan, and you can catch up with us.
[time=29] Or even just go longer than us. It'd be great for you to read through the Gospel of John, and we want to do that as a church this summer.
[time=34] So we invite you into that, but in this series we kind of have two goals, Messy, the Gospel of John.
[time=39] We're looking at the relationships that Jesus built throughout John's Gospel, and so we'll go through the Gospel of John looking at the different relationships Jesus built.
[time=47] So far we've looked at Jesus and the religious. Last week we looked at Jesus and seekers.
[time=51] This week we're going to continue that study, and as we do, two goals that we are digging into.
[time=56] Number one, identify with these people that Jesus is building relationships with.
[time=60] And as you identify with them, the woman at the well is our story today in John 4.
[time=64] As you identify with these people, you're going to realize that God loves you, and he wants a relationship with you.
[time=70] So identify with them. Number two, initiate is the word.
[time=73] Initiate some of the intentionality that Jesus demonstrates in his relationships, in your own relationships.
[time=80] How many of you have a messy relationship in your life? Please raise your hand.
[time=84] Alright, this series is just for you, and I'm glad Jesus showed us the way, as we just sang about in the song.
[time=91] So today I want to talk to you about Jesus and outcasts.
[time=94] Jesus and outcasts. John chapter 4 is the first 42 verses, so we're going to cover some ground on a pumpy full of the Word of God today,
[time=101] and a lot of things we can learn about Jesus and also about ourselves.
[time=105] Every week we're trying to have a question of the week too, so you can help me preach.
[time=108] So in the chat, even if you're in the room you can join us with this, in the chat where you're watching, answer this question.
[time=113] What does messy mean to you? What is messy? That's our series, and I think this passage kind of captures so much of maybe what we're going to hear,
[time=121] but I'd love to hear from you. What does messy mean to you?
[time=124] So share that with me, and then just a little bit, let's be honest. It might be a lot of it.
[time=128] I don't know how long I'll preach points one and two, but when we'll get there, you can help me preach.
[time=132] So let's dig into the Word. You ready for the Word today, Black Hawk?
[time=135] Alright, John chapter 4, I'm going to give you five things today that we can learn about Jesus from this story,
[time=141] and then I'm going to give you two steps that really are things that you and I can learn about ourselves, hopefully and take away for ourselves from this story.
[time=148] So let me give you point one about Jesus. It's simply this, that Jesus, listen, Jesus prioritizes those that others ostracize.
[time=156] We're talking about Jesus and outcast today. The woman at the well fits that category as we're going to look at, but Jesus always prioritizes those that others ostracize, alienate, cast out, don't care to engage with.
[time=168] The people that we would just assume stay away from, that's the people you often find Jesus going directly toward.
[time=174] Let me show you what I'm talking about. John chapter 4, let's read the first six verses, and then we'll talk a little bit about those verses.
[time=181] Now when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John,
[time=187] that would be John the Baptist, although Jesus himself did not baptize, but only his disciples.
[time=193] He left Judea and departed again for Galilee, and he had to pass through Samaria.
[time=200] You should underline that. And he had to pass through Samaria.
[time=204] So he came to a town of Samaria called Saikar near the field that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.
[time=211] Jacob's well was there, so Jesus, we read as he was from his journey, was sitting beside the well.
[time=216] It was about the sixth hour, and that would be about high noon, it would be the hottest part of the day, and that does matter in the story.
[time=224] So let's go break apart these verses as we see how Jesus really does prioritize those others ostracized, the outcasts of society.
[time=232] But we got to start with some context in verses 1 and 2.
[time=235] As you go back to the end of chapter 3, we were in chapter 3 about Nicodemus last week.
[time=239] And at the end of chapter number 3, we see that Jesus had journeyed south to Judea.
[time=245] And that's where he's at, and then we see that he's going to depart from there, and that's an important context of the story.
[time=250] But I want you to see for a moment why he departed.
[time=253] Verses 1 and 2 talk about some religious rumor mills.
[time=257] How many of you have ever heard a religious rumor before?
[time=261] Anybody? That would never happen. That happens in all those other churches, not at Blackhawk for sure.
[time=266] Less religious people don't ever create bubbles, and within those bubbles start rumor mills or anything.
[time=271] Interestingly enough though, as Jesus, remember he fashioned a whip, he turned tables over in the temple.
[time=276] He's made a little bit of a stir, has this Jesus.
[time=279] And there's a lot of rumors that are getting spread about Jesus.
[time=282] There's a lot of things. He's the talk of the town, okay?
[time=285] And so the rumor mill right now, and this part of his story in John's Gospel, is that he's making and baptizing more disciples than John the Baptist.
[time=293] And it's like, well, if I'm going to be known for something, making disciples and baptizing, that's a pretty good way to go.
[time=299] So they're threatened by Jesus, as you see as you go throughout the Gospel of John and throughout his ministry.
[time=305] And this is a big deal. And notice when Jesus left.
[time=308] Remember he goes south to Judea, and I'll show you a map in just a moment.
[time=311] He goes south to Judea at the end of chapter 3, and he's ministering there, and the Bible says end of chapter 3.
[time=316] That's where he's baptizing. And notice that his disciples are actually the one baptizing.
[time=320] Not a lot of what they're even saying is not even true. Imagine that.
[time=323] You know, we would never get caught up in untrue things.
[time=325] And this is a big implication, hear me, of our vision for the next eight years, for our 60th anniversary.
[time=330] We want to develop and send 1500 ambassadors for Jesus to reach people far from God, but close to us.
[time=337] And we know it's going to take us going beyond the Blackhawk bubble to do it.
[time=341] This is a big deal to us. You're here to talk about it for the next eight years frequently.
[time=345] It's because we do tend to kind of create our bubble, don't we?
[time=348] And it becomes this little bubble for religiosity, becomes this little bubble for things just like this.
[time=353] But notice what Jesus did. Verse 3, when did he leave?
[time=357] It says really clearly, when he learned that the Pharisees were saying these things.
[time=362] When he learned that the Pharisees had learned that he was baptizing and all these things that were going on, he left.
[time=369] And I've noticed this about Jesus, that he always moves away from religious drama and towards ostracized, broken, sinful people who are outcasts.
[time=379] He made sure in his ministry he kept moving beyond the comfort zone of the disciples and beyond what would have been natural for him to do,
[time=388] so that he kept bursting bubbles to move away from the religious stuff and move towards the heart of people like you and me.
[time=395] I love that about my Jesus. And you see that even in the context, the beginnings of this story, how he prioritized these people and you'll see how it turns in to that.
[time=403] And I love verse 4, told you to underline it.
[time=406] ESV is what I read from it. It says he had to pass through Samaria.
[time=410] Interesting language there because last I checked he's the Son of God.
[time=414] Last I checked the route from Judea to Galilee was not something where you had to go through Samaria.
[time=420] In fact, no one would go through Samaria if you were a Jew, but he had to go through Samaria.
[time=425] Why? Because he prioritized his people, those who others ostracized and he had a divine appointment with an outcast.
[time=432] That's why. I learned it growing up in the King James version.
[time=435] The King James version says he must needs go through Samaria.
[time=440] He must needs.
[time=442] A lot of times I think I must needs something too, right?
[time=445] I want to ask you today, what are your must needs pointing you towards?
[time=449] Is it towards the will of the Father? Because that's why he must needs go through Samaria.
[time=453] He had a divine appointment because he prioritized the Father's priorities.
[time=457] I pray that I can do the same thing.
[time=459] But he had to go through Samaria. Let me show you a map.
[time=461] So this is the journey of Jesus. I know it's a little small, but you can see the colors here.
[time=465] So he would have come down in the end of chapter 3, this normal way.
[time=469] This is the normal route that a Jew or Jewish people would take if they're going to go from Galilee.
[time=474] This is up here. This is Samaria.
[time=475] Saikar is right here in the central middle and southern part of Samaria.
[time=480] And this is Judea. This is where Jerusalem is out here.
[time=483] So Jesus would have taken this journey with a red line.
[time=485] You see the green line? The green line is actually going outside and crossing the Jordan River, going totally outside of the country to make sure there's no bordering on Samaria and you go around.
[time=496] How many of you think that looks a little out of the way? Raise your hand.
[time=499] You'd be right. No trick question. It is. The straightest, you know, direction or way to get from point A to point B is a straight line, which looks a little more like this, doesn't it?
[time=508] With the roads and you've got a lot for it, but they would just literally, it would take days added to the journey.
[time=513] Days extra to go this route. Most likely he went down this way.
[time=517] Here's where he's out in chapter 4, and when he heard these things happening, he left from Judea to go back to Galilee.
[time=524] But he must needs go through Samaria. He had to go through Samaria to which the disciples would say, "No, you don't. We don't go through Samaria. It's not safe.
[time=535] There's those outcasts there. Now you say, ask me, ask me, say, "Why wouldn't they go through Samaria, pastor?"
[time=541] I'm so glad you asked. That's an important question for today's sermon.
[time=544] And since you asked, I'll share with you. There are so many reasons.
[time=547] There are so many barriers. There are political barriers. There are racial barriers.
[time=552] There are religious barriers. There are cultural barriers. They all came into play.
[time=557] We're going to break that apart in a minute. But what you need to know for now is that Jews and Samaritans hated each other.
[time=563] The Samaritans intermarried with people outside religiously, ethnically, racially, culturally.
[time=572] Every way imaginable, they just broke all kinds of cultural norms for the Jews.
[time=577] And we could go into that and we'll go into it even more.
[time=579] But for now, no, that there was a deep hatred. Let me give you an example.
[time=582] If a Jewish person during this time were to marry a Samaritan, or to ask for their handed marriage and to marry them,
[time=589] the Jewish person's family would hold a funeral for that family member.
[time=594] And they would henceforth and forever more be dead to them.
[time=598] So they didn't go, "No, we don't must needs go through Samaria, Jesus." None of us do that, but he had to go through Samaria.
[time=605] There's Saikar, it's a little small town, and we're going to break it apart now.
[time=609] It's a true hatred there. And notice when she came to the well.
[time=612] I want to go on and preface this just a little bit.
[time=614] We learned that she came to the well, number two things, one of two.
[time=618] By herself, women during this time would go in the early morning time because it's not hot, and they would typically go in groups for safety, and it would be a social time for them.
[time=627] So she went by herself.
[time=629] To make sure she could go by herself, number two, she went at noon.
[time=632] She went at noon because this is when Jesus comes there, as we're seeing.
[time=635] She went at noon. It's the hottest part of the day.
[time=637] She'd be dripping so it makes no sense to go at that time, unless you just want to be by yourself, which by the way isn't very safe anyway.
[time=643] And so she's a part of this outcast group of people.
[time=646] And within that group of people, she is an outcast.
[time=649] So she is an outcast of the outcast.
[time=652] Maybe you feel that way sometimes.
[time=655] And Jesus had a divine appointment to meet with her.
[time=659] And he has a divine appointment to meet with you today as well.
[time=661] This is why he must needs go through Samaria.
[time=664] And boy, I'm so thankful to be a part of a church that makes sure that we embrace and love the outcast like Jesus.
[time=669] We do it so imperfectly, and I think of so many stories.
[time=671] Some of you are here because you felt outcast from church, and I've walked that journey with you, and I'm so thankful you sit in the room.
[time=677] I see faces all over who I know that to be the case for.
[time=680] And I'm so thankful that Jesus showed us how to do that.
[time=683] And it's what we are called to do.
[time=685] I think of stories like the New York team.
[time=686] I see Grace over here, my wife, and several others.
[time=689] They went to the outcast.
[time=691] They went to foreign-born people in New York.
[time=693] And they trained in the morning and shared the gospel in the afternoons.
[time=696] And there was a particular guy named Abdul.
[time=698] He was from India, and he was an outcast.
[time=700] He had nobody to go to.
[time=701] He had lost all kinds of ways of contacting people.
[time=704] And I've heard so many stories like this from you guys.
[time=706] And they went, and not only did they sit with him, and not only did they pray with him, but they made sure to find him resources.
[time=711] They got him connected to churches.
[time=713] And guess what?
[time=714] He eventually, because he saw that kind of love and picture of the light of Jesus, he decided to give his life to Christ while they were there in New York.
[time=720] Can we just celebrate that?
[time=721] That's the kind of stuff that gets Jesus excited.
[time=724] That's the kind of stuff that Jesus did, and that's the kind of stuff that Jesus wants from us because he prioritizes those that others ostracize.
[time=732] And I am the outcast with the outcast.
[time=735] I am the center that Jesus came for.
[time=737] So are you.
[time=739] But he loves us so much.
[time=740] And I love verse 6 before I go to point 2.
[time=743] Some of you are weary.
[time=744] This is for the weary people in the room.
[time=746] Verse 6 says that Jesus sat down at the well.
[time=749] He was weird from his journey.
[time=751] Imagine him dripping sweat.
[time=754] And he must needs go to some area.
[time=756] And it makes no sense to anybody.
[time=758] But he's there, and he's worn out from a journey.
[time=761] And he came there because he had a divine appointment to meet with someone in their humanity.
[time=766] Their frailty.
[time=767] Their sin.
[time=769] But I love the humanity of Jesus, this on this, by the Son of God, the Word made flesh to dwell among us.
[time=777] And in verse 6 we see a picture of his own humanity.
[time=780] He's fully God, but he's also fully man.
[time=782] And he's tired.
[time=785] And in his humanity, in his weary some journey, he stopped to meet with someone else in their
[time=792] weary some journey.
[time=794] Some of you are very weary.
[time=797] Some of you right now need to sit at well.
[time=801] Some of you are sitting in a seat or you're watching online and you just don't even know what you're doing right now.
[time=806] And you are just tired.
[time=808] You can relate.
[time=809] And you know the beauty is Jesus can too.
[time=812] But I'm not often like Jesus when I'm weary.
[time=814] I tend to kind of want to isolate and sit down somewhere away from people.
[time=818] But Jesus, in his own humanity, stopped and sat at a well in a divine appointment to meet with someone else in theirs.
[time=825] And I want to challenge you, if you want to be that kind of person, you have got to first sit down at the feet of Jesus.
[time=833] So God sent me today for somebody.
[time=836] I don't know if it's you.
[time=837] I don't know if it's one other person.
[time=838] I don't know if it's somebody in the first service.
[time=840] I don't know, but I got to say this to you.
[time=842] God wants you to slow down and rest in Jesus this week.
[time=848] Because if you won't do that, if you won't sit at the feet of Jesus, you're never in your weary humanity going to be able to model the love of Jesus sitting down in your humanity to meet other people in their humanity.
[time=861] Let Jesus fill you up.
[time=863] That's the point of this story.
[time=864] Shall we continue?
[time=865] But rest in Jesus as we go through it.
[time=867] Because he prioritizes those that others ostracize.
[time=870] Number two, Jesus breaks barriers.
[time=872] Did you know that?
[time=873] Jesus breaks barriers to move his mission forward.
[time=876] Write that down.
[time=877] Number two, Jesus breaks through barriers to move his mission forward.
[time=881] Oh my goodness, the barriers that are here is cultural, political, racial, religious.
[time=887] The list goes on on every barrier that we could think of.
[time=890] It is true here.
[time=891] And we see that in verses 7 through 14.
[time=893] Let's pick up where the woman comes on to the scene now.
[time=896] Verse 7, "A woman from Samaria came to draw water.
[time=899] Jesus said to her, 'Give me a drink for his disciples had gone away to the city to buy food.'
[time=905] So the Samaritan woman said to him, 'How is it that you, here's these barriers, how is it that you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a woman of Samaria?'"
[time=915] Very big barriers here.
[time=916] In the parentheses just to drive the point home, John says, "For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans."
[time=922] Verse 10, "Jesus answered her, 'If you knew the gift of God and who it is that is saying to you, give me a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.'" The woman said to him, "Sir, you have nothing to draw water with, and the well is deep." A lot of symbolism there.
[time=937] Where do you get that living water?
[time=939] I love that question.
[time=940] Some of you are asking the same question, and you're here to find the answer, and his name is Jesus.
[time=945] Verse 12, "Are you greater than our Father Jacob?
[time=947] He gave us this well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock, and Jesus said to her, 'Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again.
[time=955] But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again.
[time=960] The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water is selling up to eternal life." Circle the end of verse 14.
[time=968] I'm telling you, you're going to want to come back to it when we get to the end of today's message.
[time=971] A spring of water welling up to eternal life.
[time=975] And so in this we see Jesus breaking through all kinds of barriers to move forward his mission.
[time=979] What is his mission?
[time=980] Well, we looked at it last week.
[time=981] The Son of Man came to seek and to save that which is lost.
[time=984] And then he wants to have them follow him, and this following has grown, and as they follow him, many don't make the journey because it's a tough journey.
[time=991] And he's not saying, "Come follow me," and then everything's just going to be just peachy.
[time=995] He says, "Come follow me, and I'm going to make you fishers of men." He has to make us into something, he has to grow us into something, but it starts with seeking the outcast.
[time=1003] And Jesus is modeling that whole process for us here.
[time=1006] And let's talk about this outcast for the past for a moment.
[time=1009] I need to give you a few more details about this Samaritan woman, at least what we know about her.
[time=1013] Notice we don't know her name.
[time=1014] So I think sometimes that happens for us so that we can identify maybe fill our own name in to that.
[time=1019] I don't know exactly why it's written that way, but I'm glad that I can fill my name into that blank.
[time=1024] But this woman, so many barriers, she's a Samaritan, she is a woman.
[time=1028] That's a problem.
[time=1029] Here in this time, women were not valued, and I know you say, "Well, what a horrible thing." It's true.
[time=1033] It's a horrible thing.
[time=1034] We don't look at things that way today in so many ways, but this was a reality in our culture.
[time=1037] Women were not valued.
[time=1038] We'll look at that more in a minute.
[time=1039] But she had a past.
[time=1040] She's not just an outcast.
[time=1041] She's a woman who's an outcast among the outcasts of the Samaritans, who also has a past.
[time=1047] She has five husbands.
[time=1049] Now, even in our culture, that seems a little extreme and excessive to most.
[time=1054] But in her culture, it would have been ten times worse.
[time=1057] Not only did she have this past, but it's also a public past.
[time=1061] How many of you grew up in a small town?
[time=1063] You may even consider Fort Wayne that where your business is their business.
[time=1066] Uh-huh.
[time=1067] You know, where word travels fast, Jessica and I surely did.
[time=1069] In our small town, anything that happened, everybody's going to know about it.
[time=1073] And probably before the next two hours go by.
[time=1075] And that was even before Facebook.
[time=1077] Now it's just 500 times worse.
[time=1079] Everybody knows everything.
[time=1080] In Saikar, it's a very small town.
[time=1082] So not only is she a woman who is a Samaritan among the outcasts of the Samaritans, who's an outcast among the outcasts, she's an outcast with a past and she's living with a husband, with a guy who's not even her husband.
[time=1094] And now we see all of these things combining and she is just an outcast with a past.
[time=1099] She stands no chance at all.
[time=1101] She is the outcast of all outcasts.
[time=1104] And here she says, "And now her past is known by everybody." And that's why she's going to the well at noon when nobody else goes so she can go all by herself.
[time=1112] She's an outcast.
[time=1114] There's barriers between God and people.
[time=1116] This is the Son of God meeting with a person, a very sinful person.
[time=1119] There's barriers between Jews and Samaritans.
[time=1122] As we have already looked, political, racial, cultural, religious, it keeps going.
[time=1126] There's godly and ungodly.
[time=1127] Did you know Jews and Samaritans, if a Jew drank from any vessel that a Samaritan had used, then they would be not considered any longer clean, but then be considered unclean.
[time=1136] And ceremonially they would have to go through all these different things.
[time=1139] And so we have that barrier going on here, the unclean, the unclean, a man and a woman.
[time=1143] Again, Jesus, listen, Jesus did more for women and in valuing women than anybody in all of history.
[time=1149] He did more for people in that regard.
[time=1151] But this is such a barrier in this time.
[time=1153] We can't really imagine it as well as it truly is and its historical realities.
[time=1158] But Jesus broke through so many barriers to make this conversation happen.
[time=1163] But here, did you know this?
[time=1164] This conversation, we're going through 42 verses.
[time=1167] This is the longest recorded conversation in all of the Bible that Jesus had with any other person.
[time=1174] Did you know that?
[time=1176] And it's with a no name Samaritan woman who's an outcast among the outcasts.
[time=1183] Don't tell me, don't tell me that my God doesn't care about you.
[time=1188] The longest recorded conversation that Jesus had with anybody in all of scripture is with this outcast.
[time=1195] I love that picture of who Jesus is.
[time=1197] May we not forget it as we try to be His light in the world around us.
[time=1201] And as we go through this, Jesus asks for a drink and even to do that, write this down.
[time=1205] Jesus is more interested in reaching people than being proper.
[time=1209] He broke a lot of, I don't mean he sinned, I'm not saying he sinned, he never sinned.
[time=1214] But boy, did he ever break through a lot of barriers.
[time=1217] And boy, did he not go through a lot of proper etiquette and politically correct walls to make sure his mission moved forward.
[time=1225] He broke you name a barrier, he broke through it.
[time=1227] And I'm so thankful that he did because I am the woman at the well.
[time=1230] You are the woman at the well.
[time=1231] We're pictured in this story.
[time=1232] And he asked her for a drink.
[time=1233] And I was thinking about when God asked us for something, guys.
[time=1235] When God asked us for something, and I want to remind us of this, when God asked you for something, did you know he doesn't need something from you?
[time=1244] He's the creator of the universe.
[time=1246] Pretty sure he doesn't need a little of me.
[time=1249] But when God asks something from me, I've learned that he doesn't want something from me, he wants something for me.
[time=1256] And that is exactly what this living water that he wanted to bring into this amazing lady's life that he valued and loved so much.
[time=1264] And that's why just like I told you last week, did you know God will not bless a church that is more about keeping people like this woman out than they are about bringing them in through the gospel?
[time=1272] And so we're committed to being that kind of church at Black Hawk, no matter the cost.
[time=1277] Why? Because it's Jesus' church, and it's what he showed us to do.
[time=1281] And I am going to forever be committed to that.
[time=1283] I'm an imperfect, flawed human, but as best as I can, I'm going to lead us, shepherd us, point us to the model of Jesus so we don't just talk about what he said, but we do what Jesus did.
[time=1292] Praise God.
[time=1293] I want to be that kind of person.
[time=1295] Verses 11 through 14, she responds to him, and I love how she starts, actually I don't, because it's a what not to do model.
[time=1301] If you're talking to the Son of God, if you're praying, so this is a prayer what not to do, lesson for all of you who are learning to pray.
[time=1308] She starts her conversation, her response, with the Son of God with these three words.
[time=1314] You have nothing.
[time=1316] Pretty bad way to start your conversation with God, and surely she's talking about you don't have anything to draw water with, and the well is deep, so how are you even going to do this, right?
[time=1324] And so it makes logical sense.
[time=1326] But boy, in that how we kind of come to God, sometimes like you got nothing for me, you don't care.
[time=1331] And a lot of times we think God doesn't hear our prayers where the whole time he's just wanted to give us something bigger than what we think we need.
[time=1337] And we're going to see that as we keep going through this story.
[time=1339] So he predicts what's coming for this outcast.
[time=1342] Love verse 14, he says, "Here's what's going to happen. Anybody who drinks with this living water is going to become a spring of water that's going to well up to eternal life."
[time=1349] I told you to circle it, we'll get there in just a minute.
[time=1351] "But she came to a well, but she ended up meeting the well." And that is, I believe, what God wants to do in your life today.
[time=1359] You may have come to a well, a church, a time to hear a sermon, a time to hear some music and worship, but the well wants to meet with you today.
[time=1367] He has a divine appointment.
[time=1369] That leads me to number three.
[time=1370] Jesus knows our heart, write that down.
[time=1372] Jesus knows our heart.
[time=1374] Seems simple, but look at verses 15 through 18 because boy he really knows her heart and he makes sure she knows that he knows her heart.
[time=1382] Verse number 15.
[time=1383] So the woman said to him, this is after the living water welling up to eternal life thing that she's going, "What is he talking about?"
[time=1389] The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water." Fair enough.
[time=1395] Jesus said to her, "Go call your husband and come here." Say what?
[time=1401] Verse 17, the woman answered to him, "I have no husband." Jesus said to her, "You're right in saying I have no husband, for you have had five husbands." Ooh, it got deep fast.
[time=1410] That deep well just got deeper.
[time=1412] And the one you now have is not your husband.
[time=1415] What you have said is true.
[time=1418] Wow.
[time=1419] Jesus knows your heart.
[time=1420] He knew her heart.
[time=1421] And so what's happening here is she's kind of missing the point, you know, and understandably so.
[time=1425] It's a pretty deep conversation, Jews, Samaritan.
[time=1427] She's missing the point, so what does Jesus do?
[time=1429] Jesus gets kind of pointed.
[time=1431] Don't miss what happened here because she was focused on a vessel.
[time=1434] She was focusing on what's going on around her, but Jesus wanted to do something in her.
[time=1438] Jesus always goes for the heart of people.
[time=1441] Let me say that again.
[time=1442] Jesus always goes for the heart of people.
[time=1445] He doesn't get consumed with all this stuff going on around us.
[time=1448] He wants to go to the heart so that he can do something in us and transform us.
[time=1452] And what Jesus did in verses 17 and 18, don't miss this.
[time=1456] Jesus went to the one place that she wanted to hide and that she wanted to hide from.
[time=1465] And that's what Jesus wants to do with you today.
[time=1467] So I ask you a personal question.
[time=1470] What in your life, in your heart right now, do you most want to hide?
[time=1476] What in your heart right now do you most want to hide from?
[time=1480] Jesus is ready to go right there.
[time=1483] He's already aware.
[time=1484] Look at me for a minute.
[time=1485] He already knows.
[time=1487] He knows better than you do how messed up and messy you are and sinful you are.
[time=1491] Yet he loves you.
[time=1494] And that's what he does here in these verses.
[time=1496] He goes to the one place you wanted to hide and hide from.
[time=1499] And it reminds me that God will often bypass what I think I need or what I want to give me what I really need.
[time=1506] This is why some of you, you're having trouble in your prayer life right now.
[time=1509] Sometimes I have trouble in my prayer life.
[time=1511] Sometimes I'm praying and God just doesn't want to respond and he's not listening and he must not care.
[time=1515] He feels a million miles away.
[time=1517] And I'm praying and it's like I can give you 9,812 reasons why what I'm praying for is what I need.
[time=1523] And it's also what I want too.
[time=1525] Which may have taken away one of my reasons.
[time=1528] 9,012.
[time=1529] But anyway, you get the point.
[time=1530] We got all these reasons why we need what we need and what I'm praying for matters so much.
[time=1534] But the whole time God wants to say to you, listen, I know you think it's that.
[time=1538] I've got something way bigger in mind.
[time=1540] I'm going around what you think you need to give you what you really need.
[time=1544] This woman thought it was all about a well and this physical water.
[time=1547] But Jesus wanted to give her living water.
[time=1549] He bypassed all of those things to go to the heart.
[time=1552] To go to this heart that he knows is so messy and sinful and flawed to give us what we really need.
[time=1558] He does it the same thing today.
[time=1561] And I'm glad he does.
[time=1562] Jesus knows our heart.
[time=1564] And I've got to tell you my favorite wedding illustration.
[time=1567] At least one couple here today I know that I'm doing a wedding for.
[time=1570] And so some of you may be planning weddings so don't do this.
[time=1573] There was a couple that wanted on their wedding cake.
[time=1576] Their favorite verse.
[time=1577] And it's 1 John 4 18.
[time=1579] And it tells us that perfect love casts out fear.
[time=1581] And so that was their verse.
[time=1582] And they wanted it on the wedding cake.
[time=1583] And so they caught it in.
[time=1584] The wedding cake designer.
[time=1585] Here's the thing.
[time=1587] They left out one little number.
[time=1589] The one before John.
[time=1591] So there's little John's too.
[time=1593] They went into your Bible.
[time=1594] Did you know that?
[time=1595] 1 John, 2 John, 3 John.
[time=1596] And so they wanted 1 John 4 18.
[time=1598] But they said John 4 18.
[time=1600] And so the wedding cake designer looked at it and all of you are looking it up right now.
[time=1603] And you'll see why.
[time=1604] This is funny.
[time=1605] And read it and said, "You sure you want this on your wedding cake?
[time=1609] John 4 18." And they said, "Yes, we want John 4 18 on our wedding cake." And so they put it on there.
[time=1615] "You have had five husbands.
[time=1617] The one you're with now is not your husband." Yeah.
[time=1620] So don't do that.
[time=1621] It has nothing to do with my point.
[time=1623] But I just couldn't help but share it because I thought it was hilarious.
[time=1626] With that messy illustration, let me go to our question of the week.
[time=1630] What is it that you see and think of when you hear messy?
[time=1633] So let's real time look at a few of your answers.
[time=1636] What does messy mean to you?
[time=1638] Rick says understanding that life is seldom pretty and lived perfectly, perfectly reality
[time=1644] of my sin.
[time=1645] A blessed mess.
[time=1646] Hashtag blessed mess.
[time=1647] That's a good hashtag for today's sermon.
[time=1649] Hashtag that now.
[time=1650] Philip says messy means chaos in the circumstance.
[time=1653] So true.
[time=1654] Whitley, the filth that hinders me from growth.
[time=1657] Blake says clutter.
[time=1659] When I think of mess, I think of clutter having little room for space to grow or excel.
[time=1664] But through God his son, the Holy Spirit, I have that opportunity to give my mess up to him and become free from the clutter.
[time=1671] Oh my goodness, that will preach.
[time=1674] Wow.
[time=1675] So many more responses.
[time=1676] Join us in that.
[time=1677] Help me preach.
[time=1678] There's so much there.
[time=1679] And as I read through those and even in the ones that I just read and even the other service today, you see a combination of God, a vertical relationship and then a horizontal relationship.
[time=1689] Many responses earlier today especially pointed to other people coming into it as we talk about what do we do with our mess and I'm so thankful that God modeled that for both of us.
[time=1698] He knows our heart and this leads to number four, yet he is patient with us.
[time=1701] Number four, Jesus is patient with people because she kind of changes the subject here.
[time=1706] Let's go to verses 19 through 24.
[time=1709] Jesus is patient with her.
[time=1711] She took a step in the right direction, but then she kind of twists and changes the subject once again.
[time=1716] Verse 19, "The woman said to him, 'Sir, I perceive you are a prophet, you think.'" Right?
[time=1721] Yeah, for sure.
[time=1722] I would too.
[time=1723] Verse 20.
[time=1724] And then she changes to kind of one of these barriers, these religious barriers.
[time=1727] Our fathers were on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to go to worship.
[time=1732] Jesus said to her, "Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.
[time=1739] You worship what you do not know.
[time=1741] We worship what we know for salvation is from the Jews." Talking about these barriers, Jews and Samaritan, but here's the new kingdom that Jesus came to establish.
[time=1748] 23.
[time=1749] But the hour is coming.
[time=1750] And now is here when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth.
[time=1755] For the Father is seeking such people to worship him.
[time=1759] That is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.
[time=1765] Jesus is patient with people because in this passage we see that she's kind of not getting it.
[time=1771] She took a step in the right direction, "Okay, you must be a prophet.
[time=1773] Now let's talk about worship then." You know, let's don't talk about those five husbands and that wedding cake, right?
[time=1778] Let's talk about this Jews, Samaritan, religious barrier.
[time=1782] And so he just allows her to go there.
[time=1783] Aren't you glad Jesus does that?
[time=1785] And he's like, "This is not really what I wanted to take you right now, but I'll walk with you." He's patient.
[time=1792] And that's how we should be as well.
[time=1794] She focuses on the nature of her outcast people.
[time=1796] And Jesus then, in verses 21 through 24, describes the new kingdom that he's there to build.
[time=1801] What's the deal with this living water?
[time=1803] Listen, this is what he did.
[time=1805] He patiently walked her back to a conversation about the gospel.
[time=1809] Write this down.
[time=1810] Jesus, Jesus modeled patient persistence with people.
[time=1815] Jesus modeled persistent patience, patient persistence.
[time=1820] Which way should we say it?
[time=1821] Yes, both ways.
[time=1822] He did it both ways all the time with people.
[time=1825] And so I ask you, how can you display patient persistence with that really big knucklehead
[time=1831] in your life?
[time=1833] With that hard-headed person that you have a relationship with, how can you do like Jesus and patiently yet persistently walk the conversation back to eternal things, to the gospel, to
[time=1843] the kingdom of God, to the only thing that's going to matter when all is said and done.
[time=1847] I'm glad that Jesus didn't just tell us to do that.
[time=1850] He showed us how to do that.
[time=1852] Number five, and this is for all of us.
[time=1855] What we learn about Jesus is that Jesus can fill our emptiness.
[time=1858] Jesus alone can fill our emptiness.
[time=1861] In verses 25 and 26, look at what happens next.
[time=1864] It says, "The woman said to him, 'I know the Messiah is coming,' I love this part.
[time=1868] He is called the Christ.
[time=1869] And when he comes, he'll tell us all things." It's like she's saying, "Nice talking to you.
[time=1874] This has been a really weird conversation, but hey, the Messiah is going to come and he'll figure all this mess out.
[time=1880] See a piece leaving on the way out the door of Jesus says to her, verse 26, "I who speak
[time=1886] to you am He." He's wanting her to know that what riches can't do, I can.
[time=1894] He's wanting her to know that what relationships can't do, I can.
[time=1898] He's wanting her to know that all these pursuits of yours, what they can't do, I can.
[time=1904] What temples and mountains can't do, I can.
[time=1908] I am the Messiah.
[time=1910] I am offering you this living water today.
[time=1913] And I want you to know today, look at me for a minute, my friends.
[time=1916] Jesus sent me to tell you today, some of you have these empty pursuits and you're trying everything but Jesus.
[time=1921] And what He wants you to know today is that everything you are looking for is found in Jesus.
[time=1928] Only Jesus can fill that empty space that you're trying to fill right now.
[time=1933] And He loves you as much as He loves this woman.
[time=1936] So let me give you two steps from this story.
[time=1938] Now what can we learn about me?
[time=1939] How can I take this home with me?
[time=1940] Two steps from the story.
[time=1941] The first one is to leave behind your empty pursuits.
[time=1945] Look at verses 27 through 30, we can learn from this woman and what she does, leave behind empty pursuits.
[time=1950] So then as disciples came back, they finally got back with the Big Macs.
[time=1953] They were in town getting food.
[time=1955] Just then the disciples came back, they marveled that He was talking with a woman.
[time=1959] But no one said, "What do you seek or why are you talking with her?" So the woman left her water jar and went away into the town and said to the people, "Come,
[time=1969] see a man who told me all I ever did.
[time=1972] Can this be the Christ?" They went out of the town and were coming to Him.
[time=1976] I love this because she didn't just drop a water jar.
[time=1979] As she left behind in that moment, she would have to come back and get water again.
[time=1983] But that water jar represented all of these empty pursuits, all of these relationships, all of these ways that she was trying to fill the void of her emptiness.
[time=1991] And as she left that water jar in verse 28, she left behind all of these empty pursuits in her life that would never fulfill her, that made her feel like the outcast, that people had made her, people had made it difficult for her to come to God.
[time=2005] And that makes Jesus mad as we looked out earlier in this series.
[time=2008] That's why He must needs go to Samaria because Jesus is a messiah to the outcast.
[time=2014] And because she ran into Jesus, she went to A well, but she met the well.
[time=2019] And now she is going to become the spring of water that's going to well up into eternal life.
[time=2025] But to do that, she had to drop all of these empty pursuits.
[time=2028] And when she dropped that water jar, everything changed because she met Jesus.
[time=2034] And so today, please stop pursuing those empty things.
[time=2039] Pursue Jesus just like He has pursued you.
[time=2043] Leave behind all these empty pursuits.
[time=2047] Then number two, oh, I love what happens with this.
[time=2048] Number two, I want to tell you, we've got to trust God to do what we can't.
[time=2054] Leave behind your empty pursuits.
[time=2055] Number two, trust God to do what you can't.
[time=2059] Look what happens in verse 39, 342.
[time=2061] Many Samaritans from the town believed in Him.
[time=2063] Why?
[time=2064] Because of the woman's testimony.
[time=2066] A woman's testimony wouldn't not only not hold up in court in this day.
[time=2069] It doesn't matter.
[time=2070] It wasn't valid period in this day.
[time=2072] I know that seems crazy, but it's true.
[time=2074] But John chapter four, because of the woman's testimony, these people believed in Jesus.
[time=2080] He told me, she said, verse 39, everything I ever did.
[time=2082] So when the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him to stay with Him and He stayed there two days.
[time=2087] And many more believe because of His word.
[time=2090] They said to the woman, don't miss this.
[time=2093] It is no longer because of what you said that we believe.
[time=2097] For we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world.
[time=2105] It was a woman's testimony that caused people to come to Jesus, and boy, when they met Jesus,
[time=2111] everything changed.
[time=2113] And now they're saying, this woman, she was an outcast.
[time=2115] She couldn't even go to the well with people.
[time=2117] She couldn't be around people at all.
[time=2119] And now she's the loudmouth of the town telling people, come see this guy who told me everything I ever did.
[time=2124] Could He be the Christ?
[time=2125] You should go see.
[time=2126] And now because of her testimony, doing what she could not do, God is doing it through her.
[time=2132] She is sending people to Jesus, and they're coming back to her saying, I don't just believe in Him because of what you said anymore.
[time=2138] You're right.
[time=2139] I ran into Jesus because of you, I went to Jesus, and He is those things.
[time=2143] And many more kept believing in this story just keeps going.
[time=2146] You know what it takes?
[time=2148] Takes people, even if you felt like an outcast, leaving behind empty pursuits and trusting God to do what only He can do.
[time=2156] This woman went to a well, she met the well.
[time=2159] And because of that verse 14, remember I told you to circle it, here it is, she became spring of water, willing up to eternal life.
[time=2168] Not just in her own heart, but in the hearts of many, many others.
[time=2173] When I asked you to bow your heads, close your eyes, and ponder how you can leave behind empty pursuits.
[time=2178] What empty pursuit do you need to leave behind in your messy world that you live in right now?
[time=2184] How can you trust God?
[time=2185] What specific situation do you need to trust God to do what you can't today?
[time=2190] If you're a believer, I want to challenge you to ask God to answer those questions in your heart.
[time=2195] And some of you are here today, and you would say right now, you know, I feel like the woman at the well, and I just need to sit down at the well with Jesus for a few minutes.
[time=2204] I believe Jesus had a divine appointment with me today.
[time=2206] I don't know that I have a personal relationship with Jesus today, but I sure do identify with
[time=2212] this woman at the well.
[time=2214] I know I need that relationship, and I know that Jesus wants to offer it to me.
[time=2218] I've got good news for you.
[time=2219] You've heard the gospel today.
[time=2220] You've seen it in action today through this story, but the gospel is simple.
[time=2223] We are all sinners who fall short of God's glory.
[time=2225] We cannot bridge the gap between us and God.
[time=2228] We can't be good enough, no matter how good we are.
[time=2230] That's why Jesus came.
[time=2232] And Jesus came and lived a sinless life we could never live.
[time=2235] He broke through all those barriers for you and for me, for moments just like this.
[time=2241] He died on that cross to pay a price for your sin, to be a perfect sacrifice that we could never be for ourselves.
[time=2248] And then he rose from the dead, whoo, he rose from the dead.
[time=2251] And he conquered death, and he conquered hell, and he conquered the grave, and he conquered sin once and forever.
[time=2259] And I thank God that that is a good news reality for us.
[time=2262] It's news because it already happened.
[time=2264] Jesus won that victory.
[time=2266] So today, what's your role?
[time=2268] How do we step into that?
[time=2269] It's a gift, but you've got to, as the Holy Spirit is prompting you right now, let go.
[time=2274] And say, "Jesus, I give you me all of me.
[time=2277] I've been holding back, but right now I give you all of me." And you say, "I can't say it that way good.
[time=2281] God doesn't want my words.
[time=2283] God doesn't want perfect prayers.
[time=2284] God wants your heart.
[time=2286] He knows your heart, and he's patient with you, but he's led you to this moment.
[time=2289] So right now, wherever you're at, pause and ask Jesus to be the Lord and save your of your life.
[time=2295] Ask Him to forgive you, and He will do just that in this moment of pause, cry out to
