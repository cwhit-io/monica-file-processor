[time=0] Steve Webster I right now this for a moment and your care and adult ministries pastor I also get
[time=6] to do different things during the school year I've been teaching at the school for a whole bunch of years 18 years I was driving to breakfast this past week and realized that we're in the middle
[time=18] of summer which means that summer is half over and I just despaired for a minute I have to be honest I just did but let's make the most of it this morning I'm really glad that you're here if you're watching online however you found us today if you're in the room if you're visiting I hope you've been made to feel welcome today so glad to see all of you today before we begin we'll be in
[time=38] John chapter 5 I invite you to go to John 5 in your Bibles and as you're going I just want to think about something that we just sang I love that song I surrender I love it for a whole bunch
[time=49] of reasons but here's two reasons why today to get us started number one whenever you open the Bible
[time=57] the number one reason why you have what we call the Bible the scriptures God's Word is so that you will know him better that's why we've been given God's Word so we will know what he is like if you
[time=69] search through the scriptures and your starting point is how will this make my life better or what does it have to say to me about improving myself there are parts of the Bible that you'll have a very hard time landing the plane on that one but if every place you go in the Bible is first and
[time=85] foremost about how can I know God better everything explodes with meaning and so we sing in the song
[time=92] I want to know you more I invite you to come to God's Word that way God I want to know you more would
[time=98] you please show me please show me how I can know you more the laser focus way that God made himself
[time=105] known to us is in the person of his son Jesus his very nature the the visible nature of the invisible
[time=112] God made manifest in the person of Jesus how marvelous is that so I invite you to come to God's Word
[time=119] this morning with that posture God I want to know you more just like to be saying and secondly I would say this also from the song Lord have your way in me that's a hard thing to say God do whatever
[time=132] you want to do I was told some years ago that the scriptures will afflict the comfortable and comfort
[time=139] the afflicted however you came in this morning I invite you to consider that Lord have your way
[time=145] in me I found myself wanting to get my palms out this morning in the posture of surrender I found myself wanting to cut my hands how great is our God ever done that worship I wanted to shout it how great is our God anybody else feel that way let's pray as we start those two things
[time=161] on our minds Lord have your way in me and how I want to know you more let's let's be the way we
[time=167] approach God's Word today and every day would you pray with me God this morning we come to you
[time=173] from all over the world from this room and we ask you to have your way in us to show us yourself
[time=180] in your word because you gave us your word God that we would know you more that we would see you as you are and so God today I pray that you would have your way in us that you would do what you can only do pray that you would give us encouragement and wisdom and insight that as we follow after
[time=198] Jesus God or realize that we don't know who Jesus is wherever we are this morning I pray that you would meet us where we are and change us I pray all those things in Jesus name with great
[time=209] thanksgiving amen John chapter five we're going to be there I want to read this passage with you
[time=215] and John chapter five verses one through 18 we are in a series called messy it's a series of
[time=222] relationships that Jesus finds himself in in the gospel of John and it's complicated because people
[time=228] are complicated the man you're going to meet this morning in John five has a complicated story it's a messy story it's not up and to the right as we often feel like our lives should be there's these
[time=239] are people that are very deeply broken so today's about Jesus and the hurting that's today's title Jesus and the hurting and maybe you came in this morning maybe you're watching this morning and you would say I'm hurting Steve I'm really deeply hurting there is something here for you if you aren't hurting you notice somebody who is hurting so I was to invite you this morning to
[time=260] consider what God's word says to each person who finds himself there John five begins this way
[time=267] after this there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem now there is in Jerusalem
[time=273] by the sheep gate a pool in Aramaic called Bethesda which has five roofed colonnides in these lay
[time=282] a multitude of invalids blind lame and paralyzed one man was there who had been an invalid for 38
[time=290] years when Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time he said to
[time=296] him do you want to be healed the sick man answered him sir I have no one to put me in the pool and
[time=302] the water is stirred up and while I am going another steps down before me Jesus said to him
[time=308] get up take up your bed and walk and at once the man was healed and he took up his bed
[time=315] and walked now that day was the Sabbath so the Jews said to the man who had been healed
[time=322] it's the Sabbath it's not lawful for you to take up your bed but he answered them man who healed me
[time=328] that man said to me take your bed and walk they asked him who is the man who said to you take your bed and walk now the man who had been healed excuse me did not know who it was for a Jesus had withdrawn as there was a crowd in the place afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said
[time=345] to him see you are well sin no more that nothing worse may happen to you the man went away and told
[time=354] the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him and this was why the Jews were persecuting Jesus because he was doing these things on the Sabbath but Jesus answered them my father is working until
[time=365] now and I am working this was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him because not only
[time=372] was he breaking the Sabbath but he was even calling God his own father making himself equal
[time=381] with God this is God's word let's jump in this morning friends the first point in our outline
[time=387] for today is that Jesus changes everything Jesus changes everything I love contrast
[time=398] especially in the gospels and in this passage there is a contrast between 38 years and at once
[time=406] that's a great contrast 38 years is a long time more on that in just a minute it was September
[time=414] of 1992 and I was in a chapel service at Takoa Falls College in Takoa, Georgia
[time=421] beautiful place you should visit sometime and the preacher said in chapel he said if you died
[time=427] today do you know that you'd go to heaven and I had a good conscience at active conscience I Christian parents at a Christian education and no answer to that question no answer
[time=437] because knowing about God friends isn't the same thing as knowing him very very different
[time=443] and that day was the change was the transition for me and that was a long time ago and praise be the God everything changed not like a bolt of lightning requires of angels but my but things are different he changes everything how many of you in this in the room this morning would say that Jesus changed everything for you raise your hand praise God praise God the world needs to know
[time=463] the world needs to know and this passage enshrines him friends as the only one who can change
[time=470] everything I repeat myself this passage enshrines Jesus Christ as the only one who can change everything
[time=477] he can do it he's done it for you he can do it for somebody who's in your life who is hurting as well
[time=483] whatever kind of hurting they find themselves in today first one says that there was a feast after this we were last week with a story the Samaritan woman um and after this he goes up to
[time=495] Samaria to Galilee then he comes back down and finds himself in Jerusalem for some unnamed feast on which one it is he's going up to Jerusalem refers to the elevation of the city I I was born in
[time=508] Michigan right there as Michiganders would say and we used to go up north in Michigan you ever heard the expression before go up north any Michigan people in the room up north uh there you go
[time=519] there you go up north so up feels like north because we literally said up north up here going up to Jerusalem this means it was a high elevation so that's whenever you see the phrase going up to Jerusalem doesn't necessarily mean north because he came south to Jerusalem he's going up just FYI verse two the sheep gate there's a lot of detail in verse two and I wondered why that was this week take a look the sheep gate was in the northeast side of Jerusalem like we are on the northeast side of Fort Wayne the sheep gate and there are there's a pool there which is called Bethesda which means
[time=552] house of mercy and it's no surprise the kind of people that are at this house of mercy there are
[time=559] five roofed colonnads there these are columned porches with a covering to shade from the heat
[time=566] of the day and get a while these details and for a long long long time for many centuries it was
[time=572] widely believed that John is just making this place up there's no such place he's well there's this and there's that and there's the other until we actually you know found the pool of Bethesda
[time=583] in Jerusalem by friend Kevin Newbury is taking a team of people to to Israel next year march
[time=589] of next year so find on our school website that's information to be found about that so I've got pictures to show you of the pool of there it is you can go see this very place next march
[time=600] with Kevin and friends this is what looks like today picture from a hundred years ago I'll show you now that we've dug through archaea they built things on things on things on things in ancient cities we don't live in an ancient city we live in an ancient country but this is an ancient place
[time=616] here's what it may have looked like back in the day in the first century so you see some you're going to see some columns they see a pool running down into another pool which could have been the pool of Bethesda roofed colonnads on each side there it is and so there would be one pool that flows down into another one there it is we found this place and I have to say that for Jessica
[time=638] Rivers if she's listening the 165 people have had told me to watch the show that chosen that's not an exaggeration 160 that's a lot of people but it may not be an exaggeration a lot of people told me to watch it the scene that you are going to hear about today in john five as portrayed
[time=654] in that show is so incredibly beautiful and I think very accurate to the heart of the passage so I
[time=660] commend you Jessica had the receipts I mentioned it said in the morning so I'm watching the show so sorry I'm late to the party anyway this scene pool Bethesda that shows you can google it and check it out it's beautiful my friends and captures the heart of this passage I must say look at verse
[time=676] three in these pools lay a multitude of invalids sounds like a great band name multitude of invalids
[time=683] I thought about that multitude of invalids blind lame and paralyzed that word for invalid is
[time=693] to be without strength to be powerless I was a spiritual invalid that morning in September
[time=704] I recognize my power I can't save myself I can't save I wanted I wanted to obey God I really did my
[time=714] my mom who's listening this morning mom I love you my mom said I need to do a bay god and I want to do a bay god but had no spiritual power to do it I didn't have the the booster rockets strong
[time=726] enough to escape the gravity of my sin I was powerless I said geez you can do it only you can
[time=732] save me I want to do what you say but I can't do it myself please please do so and he did he gave me
[time=738] the faith even to believe as Ephesians 2 says he changed everything in my life these are invalid
[time=744] people they are blind they are lame they are paralyzed I just thought I just read this this
[time=750] morning for the for many many times I've read this week and it's you see how it starts how does verse five start one man uh bill bodecker asked me between services how come he didn't heal all of
[time=762] them see just the one guy and I don't know but there is this one man that has his focus and that
[time=768] has his attention this is a pathetic group of people pathetic meaning they deserve they they
[time=775] evoke those feelings deep feelings of compassion and oh man can you imagine this scene those imagine those pools I showed you a picture of it what it would have looked like and there's just covered by all these people that can't walk and they're blind they're lame they're paralyzed all of those things I thought about Revelation chapter 3 the apostle john also wrote the book that
[time=794] we call revelation and here are his words to the church at Laodicea revelation begins with several letters to churches and by my count five of the seven are in really bad shape and in light of this
[time=806] passage from John 5 this came to mind for you and me today Revelation 3 15 says I know your works
[time=815] you are neither cold nor hot would that you were either cold or hot so because you are luke warm
[time=823] and neither hot or cold I will spit you out of my mouth for you say I am rich I have prospered
[time=831] and I need nothing not realizing that you are wretched pitiable poor blind and naked I counsel
[time=842] you to buy from me gold refined by fire so that you may be rich and white garments so that you may
[time=848] clothe yourself and the shame of your nakedness may not be seen and salve to anoint your eyes
[time=855] so you may see those who my love I reprove and discipline so be zealous and repent
[time=861] so here's what I would say the start because you ask in this question the passage do you want to be
[time=870] healed the starting point is I am wretched I am poor I am pitiable I am blind I am naked I need you
[time=880] God that's the starting point we don't love that in our culture we don't love to seem needy it's
[time=887] unseemly to be that way I need help and here is multitude of invalids waiting for the waters to
[time=893] be stirred up more on that in a second I thought about John in Revelation the church at Laodicea
[time=899] who thought they needed nothing and John goes really is that really where you are this that's a great danger I think for us friends in the west to see ourselves I have everything I
[time=911] need but in reality we don't we need to be saved and friends this morning I invite you to consider
[time=918] Jesus as the one who can do what only he can do see yourself like me as you are let's see ourselves
[time=925] as we are in the waters of Bethesda needful of his grace maybe waiting by the waters of Bethesda
[time=932] needing his grace and needing his mercy look at look at the page if you have it in front of you
[time=938] maybe on your app whatever do you want to say thing about the verses three and five where is verse four perhaps you're wondering where is verse four I'm glad you asked here let's talk
[time=950] with that for a minute some manuscripts insert this thing that says well when the water moves
[time=956] angel of the Lord there's a probably a footnote in your bibles look at the bottom of the page you can see a footnote for this explains this angel of the Lord would at certain times in the pool stir
[time=966] up the waters and whoever goes in first gets healed a scribe read John what we now called John chapter
[time=973] five and said and there was no verse four and said we have to insert this to explain why this
[time=979] guy is even there so we know that the earliest maybe your Bible says that to you the earliest
[time=985] and best manuscripts don't have verse four everywhere in the Bible that this is going on we know where
[time=992] it is you know why because you have thousands and thousands and thousands of copies thousands of copies the New Testament is the best attested work from the ancient world by miles and miles and
[time=1004] miles the only question is what the words mean not what the words say so I encourage you with that
[time=1010] that's be living in age friends people have lost confidence in God's word they have lost confidence in what God's word says and what and and I can't trust it because it's like the telephone game this guy to this guy this guy to this guy that's not how the Bible came to you today on your
[time=1027] phone or on your lap the Bible was given to groups of people transferred by groups of people in an
[time=1034] open and honest and public way and by the end of the first century all these books were written they were circulated widely and we have the receipts there's a huge copy of the manuscripts at the University of Michigan as it turns out they're all there we have we know what these words say so you can be confident that these words before you in English this morning we have the originals we can translate them accurately be encouraged by that friends there is a myth circulating that the Bible
[time=1060] is this or that or someone's best guess that's not how the Bible has come to you this morning and
[time=1067] I encourage you with that that's where verse four is scribe was like we should probably write something in there and it's not it's not it's not unhelpful but not the Bible verse five one man was there multitude one man has his focus was there who had been an invalid for 38 years
[time=1089] most people in the first century wouldn't live to be 38 and he was waiting by this pool for the
[time=1096] water to get stirred up for 38 years that's a long time how long would you wait if i'm in the drive-through for five minutes and my sandwich hasn't come i get antsy i get
[time=1111] i get i get agitated would you wait 38 years on the phone on hold still on hold still waiting
[time=1119] 38 i've been waiting since 1985 on hold nobody would do that i wouldn't do that and you wouldn't
[time=1126] either he's been waiting by the pool for 38 years because he believes something he believes something friends number one in your notes was that Jesus changes everything i said
[time=1141] this to you before and i think novelty is overrated so i'll say it again the object of your faith
[time=1147] is more important than the amount of your faith the object of your faith is more important than the amount of your faith we are surrounded by
[time=1157] people in our culture that believe things very sincerely very sincerely but how much you believe
[time=1164] isn't god standard in whom you believe that's where god standard is this person's faith has been
[time=1170] tragically misplaced in this pool that may or may not get stirred up and it hasn't happened for him
[time=1176] for a really really long time but he's still there maybe today maybe you've been sick maybe you're maybe you're experiencing long-term illness this morning
[time=1188] and there are times in my life when i've been sick and i can't remember what it was like to feel
[time=1194] better does it ever happen to you it's a that's a bad feeling some of you have chronic illness
[time=1202] and my heart goes out to you today because you're hurting in that way there is a word of comfort here for you hope deferred makes the heart sick part of 13 12 says that he's been waiting for 38
[time=1215] years and and again i'll go back to the chosen for a second happy to do it again he says this guy
[time=1221] at the pool he's like you don't need this pool you need me it's exactly right it's exactly right
[time=1227] he really sincerely believes this pool can help him he's been there a long time and nothing has
[time=1234] changed and then enter enter jesus and everything changes friends i encourage you to see things
[time=1240] with those eyes verse six when jesus saw him
[time=1250] a multitude of invalids one man jesus saw him keep going saw him lying there and knew
[time=1258] and knew if you are here today in the sound of my voice wherever you find yourself i want you to know
[time=1269] something jesus knows and he sees you i might miss you probably will i might not know
[time=1279] i may not do what i should do to deploy resources to help you i try my best this church is not a
[time=1286] perfect place we are endeavoring to serve god in that way i assure you this morning that jesus
[time=1292] sees you and he knows what you're going through in ways that maybe others don't and i can
[time=1298] encourage and comfort you with that from john chapter five that you are no different from this man you are seen by him and you are known by him he knew that he'd already been there
[time=1308] a long time he said to him do you want to be healed it seemed like a mean question
[time=1314] i don't think it's a mean question i think he's asking this he's asking him basically
[time=1320] how is this going for you is this the way you want to live do you want to stay here 38 more years
[time=1334] and the guy responds it doesn't really answer his question can you imagine waiting for help watching other people all those years getting the water before
[time=1343] you all those years he can't get up he can't move and one after another they just keep getting
[time=1351] the water the sick man answered him sir i have no one to put me in the pool when the water is stirred up that's why the scribe had to explain it earlier and while i'm going another steps down
[time=1362] before me he's just passed over and passed over not seen not known for all these years and in walks jesus and everything changes
[time=1374] everything he has seen and known for the first time maybe in his whole life he invites this man to leave behind his superstition and to place his hope and faith and trust in him
[time=1391] and this morning i invite you to do the same whatever you are giving power to in your life this will help me this will help me this will help me this will help me and it begins and ends with jesus friends if that's not your answer that it won't help you not long term verse eight said to him get up take up your bed and walk if you can't pull it off that's a really mean thing
[time=1416] to say is somebody you can't walk it's like holding up it's like it's like holding up
[time=1422] numbers somebody you can't see what number am i holding up but he's in the in the middle of seeing it he's restored again beautifully done in the chosen i
[time=1433] must say verse nine at once you circle that in your bibles if you if you mark in your bibles
[time=1443] you can highlight it in your app whatever at once 38 years nothing nothing nothing
[time=1450] not seen not heard not known no different day after day other people go on before him
[time=1457] at once he stands up i like to imagine he jumps to his feet
[time=1465] lots of stories about like this in the gospels if you've noticed here's another one
[time=1471] the text says that he does everything that jesus commands him to do things that he can't do in his own strength he does because of his connection because he believes jesus in that moment okay i'll do it and there are things that he's asking you to do and there are things that there are conversations that you need to have there are things that you have the seem beyond you and they probably are and i'm telling you that whatever he commands you to do he will meet you with the power to do whatever he commands you to do i'll say that again it's worth repeating there are things that god is clearly calling you to do that are in obedience to him
[time=1502] they seem like they're beyond you and they probably are beyond you and everything that you are asked to do by god he will empower you by his spirit to do it for him and for his glory and when you do it
[time=1513] in his power and by his spirit god gets the glory and thanks be to god for those things
[time=1520] at once in distinction from 38 years i think that's beautiful he hasn't walked for 38 years
[time=1528] you imagine like your legs are under your seat like you sit in your legs like your leg goes to
[time=1534] sleep and you can't stand up right away he had walked for 38 years and he gets up and walks just like that fully restored in an instant no there no physical therapy just up walking around
[time=1547] how amazing this passage is intended to encourage us to prompt us to treasure Christ
[time=1555] more and more and more and anything besides that friend is a distraction the last six words of verse nine are and and now that day was the Sabbath more to come on that
[time=1568] this man still has no name the man the man the man he has no name this there he is but we're reading
[time=1576] about him two thousand years later they bring to his attention in verse 10 something it's not lawful
[time=1583] isn't the same thing as being sinful there is no Old Testament record of what he does in his
[time=1589] passage being a violation of the law not one they have been layering on top of the law in the Old Testament extra regulations and rules to get people under their thumb these leaders were doing this and Jesus has zero patience for it zero patience for it why why is he doing what
[time=1607] isn't lawful they never mentioned in the story once that he's been healed they won't even acknowledge
[time=1613] it they won't even they don't see him at all they don't know him at all all they can do all they
[time=1620] can worry about is he isn't doing what I want number two in your notes friends the second
[time=1628] point on the outline as we enter the section is that Jesus keeps his focus Jesus keeps his focus
[time=1634] on the one man the one man I see you I know you that's his focus some of you don't feel seen
[time=1644] you don't feel heard you don't feel known at all and the most beautiful thing in the world
[time=1650] friends is to be known by God completely and to be loved by him completely and that's what you have
[time=1656] in front of you I want to know you more have your way in me he'll do it there is nothing I repeat
[time=1666] myself there's nothing in the law that said that he couldn't do what he did not one thing he isn't violating the Sabbath he isn't sinning or causing other people to sin in his interactions with the
[time=1679] Jewish leaders this they've all kinds of back and forth back and forth who is this guy what do you say they never even acknowledge that he's different it's all the things that Jesus said all they're concerned about is the violation of their rules and it's just so sad it's so sad
[time=1695] verse 13 I'm sorry verse 12 they asked him who is the man who said to you take up your bed
[time=1702] and walk your answer to that question is something of eternal significance
[time=1708] who is Jesus now who he is to you because that can be very different who he is to you who he is to you
[time=1715] who he is to you is a good teacher he's a good prophet he's a charismatic leader and all of it
[time=1722] falls short of what this passage says but who he is that he's equal with God he's making God his own
[time=1728] father that's what John wants us to know how they want how he wants us to follow after Jesus
[time=1734] if Jesus sense Jesus is God he has the right he has the right to define all the terms to set all the
[time=1741] rules Hebrews says that he is the exact imprint of God's nature Colossians says that he is the
[time=1749] visible image of the invisible God this is who he is and we at this church at black art ministries
[time=1755] have enshrined some theological essentials and that's one of them the divinity of Christ the deity of Christ and this is why it makes all the difference it's the Bible's clear testimony about who he is it's how John opens his gospel take a look at John 1 this week in the beginning
[time=1771] was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God this is the testimony that we have
[time=1778] received that John the chosen again not sorry John's there writing it all down he's watching
[time=1784] everything happen he's writing it all down I think it's John I don't know it's beautifully done
[time=1790] he's interested in the individual versus the crowd verse 13 the man who had been healed didn't
[time=1797] know who it was for he withdrawn as there was a crowd in the place he just doesn't want to happen he's not interested in the fight in the in the drama verse 14 after where Jesus finds him in the
[time=1809] temple and says to him see I can see the joy can you hear him saying it was joy see
[time=1817] you're well he's excited the leaders aren't excited yeah but yeah but that's all they got yeah but
[time=1824] yeah but see you're well he has nothing to hide I think the leaders are using this man
[time=1835] to find Jesus he was looking for him do you see that
[time=1844] he goes and tells the Jews the next verse what's going on look at verse 14 with me he says sin no more that nothing worse may happen to you and I got to stop here for a minute
[time=1855] there is a river of testimony in the Bible that would discourage you from connecting your physical
[time=1865] suffering to some sin some hidden sin and if someone is telling you that in your life do not
[time=1871] believe them Job is a righteous man his friends can't believe it well you're obviously some sins
[time=1877] happen to you Job you sin some way because I know it in John chapter 9 there's another interaction
[time=1884] with Jesus and he goes and they say who sinned this manner is parents that he this has happened to him he goes neither so the power of God can be revealed Galatians 4 Paul is suffering not because of some sin physically that's not why this is happening at all so friends I just
[time=1900] want to encourage you with that today I don't know why you're suffering physically but I will tell you unless Jesus Christ has told you personally that that's happening do not believe
[time=1910] someone telling you that that's cruel it's abusive and I reject it utterly on the authority of God's word I tell you this morning today that God sees you and he hears you and if you are suffering
[time=1920] physically for for long periods of time chronically I'm so sorry I'm so sorry do not believe
[time=1930] the lies that you have been told about that being somehow some sin in your life do not believe it
[time=1936] the word for persecuting here in these verses is also is using a trial setting
[time=1943] this is the beginning of the end for Jesus the Jewish leaders don't even reckon with this beautiful restoration that he's bringing about he's bringing about new creation all over the world that I didn't even see it here's the here's an application point from the second point of your
[time=1958] notes friends never let your preferences get in the way of what God is doing never let your preferences get in the way of what God is doing the Jewish leaders heads all they had was preference look at mark chapter seven sometime this week and see that you make your traditions out to be to
[time=1975] violate God's word and Jesus says no you can't even see it they had lost sight of the individual for their own preferences and rules and it's tragic
[time=1987] and it's heartbreaking and they hated Jesus for it they wanted to kill him and they did
[time=1993] they are content to use this man to get back at Jesus they sent him out looking for Jesus
[time=2000] you can't see that in the story they sent him out looking go find him go tell us who it is and so he dies they never even there's no trace at all that they've rejoiced
[time=2010] in his restoration and Jesus goes see you're well it's so different so beautiful verse 17
[time=2020] Jesus answered the leaders he said my father is working until now and I am working and then
[time=2026] you exactly what he meant even God works in the Sabbath day upholding the universe by the work
[time=2033] of his power so that's what I'm bringing good things into the world the Sabbath was made for man as a blessing not man for the Sabbath to be a slave it's a blessing that he's given to us and so what he is doing is bringing this into the world people get people are born in the Sabbath people die in the Sabbath God is so on his throne and Jesus goes so am I it's profound
[time=2055] verse 18 is the conclusion here and the third point of your notes friends is that Jesus is equal
[time=2061] with God this is why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him we're only five
[time=2069] chapters in the John's gospel there's more than this in this in John they're already out to kill him all the more to kill him because not only was he breaking the Sabbath in their mind he wasn't
[time=2080] really but he was even calling God his own father making himself equal with God this is what John
[time=2090] wants us to see from this passage this is who Jesus is I want to read you a quote from C.S. Lewis
[time=2096] and we'll be done this is from his book called the four loves our imitation of God in this life
[time=2105] which he means our willed imitation not that we're like him because we're making his image but our decisions to be like him must be an imitation of God incarnate our model is the Jesus not only of
[time=2117] Calvary but of the workshop the roads the crowds the clamorous demands and surly oppositions
[time=2124] the lack of all peace and privacy the interruptions the multitude of envelopes the messy stuff
[time=2131] for this so strangely unlike anything we can attribute to the divine life in itself is apparently
[time=2139] not only like but is the divine life operating under human conditions friends I must leave you
[time=2147] with this question who do you say Jesus says and some of you will have the right answer
[time=2155] you'll speak the right answer because you know about God but you don't know him and what C.S.
[time=2161] Lewis is saying is that what good is it do if I have all the right answers but it's not matched with my life and the world is watching us and they're like and they're just feeling the same way you have all these right answers you guys but where is it on the ground in the cul-de-sac
[time=2176] at the office let's friends let's live this if you believe that Jesus is equal of God he has saved
[time=2182] you from your sins because only he can do it let's strive to live into that this week he calls the
[time=2189] shots in my life I want to know you more God I want to I want to have your way in me that's the call
[time=2198] Jesus changes everything he keeps his focus don't get distracted with this don't sweat the small stuff
[time=2205] that's all they could do is with the small stuff and lastly he's equal with God and who you say that Jesus is changes everything in your life I would invite you as we close this morning friends
[time=2216] to pray with me fire heads and close your eyes I very much believe that the answer to that question
[time=2224] is of eternal significance who you say Jesus is and so wherever you find yourself this morning I
[time=2231] invite you to ponder that question and consider the scriptures answer that question the Jesus is the
[time=2238] visible image of an invisible God that he is what the answer to all of the questions he is the
[time=2247] sacrifice for sins the debt that I could not pay on my own he has paid it for me by virtue of his
[time=2253] perfect obedience as God's own son in flesh and if you believe that that's who he is this morning
[time=2260] that he can save you from your sins and you cry out and say God I can't do this
[time=2267] if you're being asked this morning do you want to be healed healed in the soul way I invite you to consider Jesus this morning if you're here you don't feel seen and you don't feel
[time=2279] known and you don't feel like any of it I pray that you would rejoice today that Jesus sees you
[time=2287] and he knows you and he loves you and he demonstrated that when he gave his life for you on that cross
[time=2293] you never have to doubt his love for you so God wherever we are today wherever wherever people are
[time=2299] is in the sound of my voice people that don't know you God that need to know you in this very
[time=2305] moment they can cry out to you and those that do God that need to live into the truth that they
[time=2311] believe God give them the strength by your spirit to do so I thank you for this passage God I thank you for this story this true story in a real place about a real person who was in trouble
[time=2323] and entered Jesus and everything changes thank you that he has has a heart God for the hurting for the messy maybe follow his example this week I pray all those things in Jesus name amen
