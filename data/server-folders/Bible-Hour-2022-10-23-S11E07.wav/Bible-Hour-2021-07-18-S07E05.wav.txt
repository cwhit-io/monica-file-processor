[time=0] - Good morning, good morning, good morning.
[time=3] Welcome to Black Hawk and whether you're watching from online or in the room with us, we thank you for the privilege of your time today.
[time=14] We live in a busy world and we know that it takes effort to do that.
[time=21] My name is Rick Raber.
[time=23] Some of you may not have ever seen me in this place before.
[time=26] I've been here for a long time.
[time=29] I am a husband to my wife, Diane of 31 years, father to Caleb and Kate, Josh in 80 and Zach and Mara.
[time=38] I'm a grandfather to two and a half year old Jackson and knew this Wednesday, Cooper Flynn to Caleb and Kate.
[time=48] I'm an executive in the business world.
[time=54] I actually have a customer in the room today.
[time=56] That's a dangerous thing when you're preaching.
[time=59] But I would tell you, above all those things, I am a messy sinner in need of forgiveness from a perfect savior.
[time=72] That's me.
[time=73] Many of you have been around here long enough that to the response to the church smile, "How are you? How are you?" and everybody goes, "Fine, fine, fine." My standard response has been over the last several years.
[time=91] I am a blessed mess.
[time=95] I think Kevin tried to pick the perfect message for me to preach.
[time=99] I'm thankful for being able to serve him this way.
[time=103] If you've not been with us over the last four weeks, we've been dealing with Jesus' encounter with the people, the real people in the gospel of John.
[time=115] We started with the religious that were really had things screwed up in the temple and Jesus got out of whip.
[time=123] We went to the seeker who was a religious person that came to Jesus at night in Nicodemus.
[time=129] We went to the outcast, a woman and a Samaritan at the well.
[time=134] Last week, Steve Webster led us through the hurting guy
[time=141] at the pool of Bethesda 38 years.
[time=146] He waited.
[time=147] Back in week one of the series, Kevin set out two goals for us each week.
[time=154] And those were, the first one was to identify with the type of people that Jesus related to.
[time=162] We need to think about that.
[time=164] The second is to initiate with an intentionality and engage those messy relationships in your life.
[time=173] See, 'cause the truth is, it's no different today than it was in Jesus' day.
[time=181] People get involved and it gets messy.
[time=185] It just does.
[time=188] That's the way it works.
[time=189] If we're honest, I hope you can be in this place today.
[time=198] We should all be able to identify this week with the title, messy sinners.
[time=205] I love how Paul, the man who wrote the majority of our New Testament says in 1 Timothy 1, 15, it is a trustworthy saying, worthy of complete acceptance.
[time=219] Jesus Christ came to save sinners, of which I am the greatest.
[time=225] If Paul can say that, then we can say that sitting here this morning.
[time=230] And I would challenge you to see yourself from that point of sin in your life and understanding what it looks like.
[time=237] Today we're gonna step into the biblical account of the woman caught in adultery.
[time=241] It falls in scripture from John chapter seven, verse 53, through chapter eight, verse 10.
[time=250] And I do wanna take a couple minutes because if you have your Bibles, please open them to there because I think you'll find something that I don't want to ignore.
[time=259] It's the brackets or the highlight that's in that section.
[time=265] And in mine, in the ESV actually says, some manuscripts do not include chapter seven verses 53, through eight, 11.
[time=275] Others actually put it in chapter seven and others put it in 21.
[time=280] And some even put it in Luke 21.
[time=284] The truth is, is we could literally spend the whole day.
[time=289] We really could.
[time=290] The scholars have spent a lot of time trying to do what is called textual criticism and what belongs and what doesn't and all those kinds of things.
[time=299] We're not gonna do that today.
[time=301] We're going to spend some time.
[time=303] I'm gonna give you four things that I believe really make this fall into place the way that it does about this passage.
[time=311] While it's not in the earliest and most ancient manuscripts, it is in literally several hundred.
[time=318] It's present in a lot of manuscripts of the text.
[time=323] It is consistent and I want you to catch this.
[time=327] When you look at our Jesus, when we look at Jesus, what you see in this passage is absolutely consistent with the Jesus that's through the New Testament.
[time=340] It really is.
[time=341] It doesn't introduce anything that's in question.
[time=344] The next thing is, is even though it's not in the manuscripts, the early church, the early church passed this down.
[time=354] They said this encounter was significant enough that it has propagated consistently through centuries, over 17th centuries that this has been maintained.
[time=366] So the footnotes, the footnotes are indicative
[time=373] of the scrutiny of scholars to make sure that this, which we believe here at Black Hawk, is absolutely an errant without error.
[time=383] And the word of God that you hold in your hand today, that we're using today, it can be trusted.
[time=391] It should be trusted and it should be obeyed.
[time=395] We need to make sure that we acknowledge that.
[time=397] So it's on that basis that we step in today.
[time=402] So I wanna grab some context from chapter seven because it's pretty important.
[time=406] Chapter seven started, chapter seven starts with a feast of booths or tabernacles is what it says.
[time=415] And that was a celebration of the booths that they used to set in and sleep in, I should say, when they were out at harvest.
[time=424] And in verse one, it says, that's what was going on.
[time=427] And so it was also a reminder of the celebration and a reminder of that they slept in tents while they were mobile during the Exodus.
[time=435] It was a big deal.
[time=436] Verse one notes already in chapter seven
[time=443] that the Jews were ready to kill Jesus.
[time=446] They're already ready to kill him.
[time=449] Right up front.
[time=450] Because his time, he says in this passage, because his time had not yet come, Jesus decides to stay away from the celebration out of town for till the middle of the week.
[time=462] Catch verse seven, he tells his brothers that we're gonna go to the festival.
[time=468] He tells them before they leave, why the world hates him.
[time=471] And I would submit to you today that this is pretty consistent with today, with what the truth of the gospel is.
[time=480] John seven, seven says, the world can't hate you, but it hates me because I testify about its works that its works are evil.
[time=491] The world doesn't like to hear that it's a evil world that we live in.
[time=497] Not only does he testify about the works of the world being evil, in verse 10, he is seen by the Jewish people sitting around being taught as being learned by having haven't studied.
[time=514] And that culture of sitting under the rabbis and that stuff, for him to know, not having studied, was a very strange thing.
[time=522] He also confronts their legalistic double standards
[time=528] that were in play.
[time=529] This is exactly what happened in response to what Steve Webster preached last week.
[time=534] This guy that gets healed at the pool of Bethesda and what that means, but he confronts a standard.
[time=542] Listen to what he says, if on the Sabbath in verse 24, a man received circumcision so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because on the Sabbath, I made a man's whole body well?
[time=556] Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.
[time=563] He just went right straight to the heart like it's on when he does that.
[time=570] He goes right straight to the heart of it.
[time=573] He taught multiple days in the temple before the feast and the scribes and Pharisees were so fixed on a test for him and tripping him up that they were only able to see that he was a threat, that he had been recognized as somebody who was learned but hadn't studied.
[time=593] I'll give you this, I believe their agenda,
[time=599] their agenda kept them from seeing and getting to know the true Jesus.
[time=605] They couldn't see because they had so fixed on what they were planning to do.
[time=612] He really did meet the messianic prophecies, but they couldn't get past the fact at the end of the chapter.
[time=619] They said, "Come on, even challenge Nicodemus." Nothing comes from Galilee, a prophet certainly doesn't.
[time=627] So as we read the passage from the Word of God today, we're gonna encounter four people or groups.
[time=636] The first is Jesus himself.
[time=638] We're gonna see the component of Jesus in a couple of ways.
[time=642] We're gonna see the crowd around him.
[time=644] The crowd around him that we're watching these Jewish leaders really challenging him and they were also trying to learn from Jesus.
[time=654] Some of them were there.
[time=656] We have the scribes and Pharisees, the people that were supposed to keep track of the law and truth.
[time=662] And finally, we have the woman.
[time=664] We have the woman.
[time=665] My goal is before we're done today that the Holy Spirit will allow you to see, really,
[time=675] to allow you to see that each one of those four people, those four groups, possibly the different season in your life or today that you can identify with.
[time=688] Join me in John chapter eight and let's read the passage.
[time=693] John chapter 7, 53 ends with, then each went to his own house, but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
[time=702] Early in the morning, he came again to the temple.
[time=706] All the people came to him and he sat down and taught them.
[time=709] The scribes and Pharisees brought a woman, this who had been caught in adultery and placing her in the midst, they said to him, teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery.
[time=721] Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women.
[time=727] So what do you say?
[time=728] This, they said, to test him that they might have some charge to bring against him.
[time=735] Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground.
[time=738] And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, "Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her." And once more, he bent down and wrote on the ground.
[time=754] But when they heard it, they went away one by one, beginning with the older ones.
[time=760] And Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him.
[time=764] Jesus stood up and said to her, "Woman, where are they?
[time=770] 'Cause no one condemned you." She said, "No one, Lord." And Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you.
[time=780] Go, and from now on, sin no more." Pray with me, please.
[time=789] Heavenly Father, we thank you for the privilege of having the written word captured and in front of us.
[time=796] I pray, Father, that today that you would sanctify my words.
[time=801] Holy Spirit, lead us today through my weaknesses and gaps, to places where the words of Rick can't take anybody.
[time=812] Please, God, today, speak through your word and through your spirit that life can be challenged and changed.
[time=822] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=823] So let's jump right into the passage.
[time=827] In verses one and two, Jesus was fixed on his mission.
[time=831] Jesus was fixed on his mission.
[time=834] It says they each went to their own house that night after their confrontation and they telling him who he was.
[time=841] But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
[time=844] Early in the morning, he came again to the temple.
[time=846] All the people came to him and he sat down and taught them.
[time=849] Just a reminder, less than 24 hours before,
[time=855] Jesus had been called a demon because he told them they were plotting to kill him.
[time=860] He was told that he couldn't be the prophet or the Messiah.
[time=864] He could perceive clearly that the crowd was torn and split between people that really wanted to hear his teaching and those that were trying to test him.
[time=876] He saw Nicodemus, the one who did come to him in John chapter three at night, say, "Hey, challenge him a little bit." And they basically chastised him.
[time=888] They chastised him.
[time=889] But Jesus responds to the death threats and disbelief, which to get away to the Mount of Olives.
[time=897] Luke in later in his gospel towards the end
[time=903] of Jesus' life, we're told in Luke 21, 37 and 38 in Luke chapter 22, 39 that it was his custom.
[time=912] It was his practice to go to the Mount of Olives to get a break.
[time=917] Even if he retreated for rest and recovery,
[time=923] the cool part is that he returned.
[time=927] Sometimes it's really easy for us to, when we get to difficult situations, with messy people, is to just step away.
[time=936] Jesus stepped in, Jesus stepped in, and he stepped back early.
[time=943] Catch what verse two says.
[time=944] Early in the morning, he came back.
[time=947] He didn't wait till noon, he didn't sleep in.
[time=949] He waited, he got up early in the morning, and he came back, it wasn't to one or two people.
[time=954] It says all the people.
[time=957] They were there.
[time=958] Jesus modeled, this is what he did.
[time=962] He modeled endurance with objectors, and he removed obstacles for those who wanted to pursue and understand the truth.
[time=973] That's what Jesus did.
[time=974] This is people, the heart of Jesus, for the lost.
[time=979] That's what he does.
[time=981] I love how the Apostle Paul, when he was dealing with the Corinthians in the second book, Second Corinthians chapter six.
[time=990] This is Paul writing from his heart, and I believe his heart was exactly like the heart of Jesus.
[time=999] Second Corinthians chapter six, if you wanna join me there, it is an extended passage, but I wanna read it.
[time=1005] I want you to listen to the heart of Paul.
[time=1009] Behold, now is the day of salvation.
[time=1013] We put no obstacle in anyone's way, so that no fault may be found within our ministry.
[time=1021] But as servants of God, we commend ourselves in every way, by great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, calamities, beatings, imprisonment, riots, labors, sleepless nights,
[time=1036] hunger, purity, by purity, knowledge, patience,
[time=1044] kindness, the Holy Spirit, genuine love, by truthful speech, and the power of God, with weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left, through honor and dishonor, through slander and praise.
[time=1062] We are treated as imposters, yet true, as unknown yet well-known, as dying and behold,
[time=1072] we live as punished and yet not killed, as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many rich, as having nothing yet possessing everything.
[time=1084] Paul challenges them, the Corinthians,
[time=1090] in verses 11, 12, and 13 in a beautiful way, 'cause I would tell you to live out that whole list,
[time=1101] to live out that list, or to even pursue any of it, takes a heart that is committed to the salvation of another one's soul.
[time=1110] It becomes more about somebody else than you.
[time=1115] Paul says in 2 Corinthians 1, he says, that I've went through these difficulties, and he says that it's for your comfort and salvation.
[time=1127] You don't go through anything that isn't for God's glory.
[time=1132] Doesn't matter what it is.
[time=1133] And ultimately, your heart needs to be open, that God would use your story to change the life of somebody else.
[time=1141] Verse 11, Paul says, our hearts were wide open to you.
[time=1148] Verse 12, he says something really interesting, because the Corinthian people had actually closed off, restricted, or restrained their affection for Paul.
[time=1161] He had deep wide open heart for them, but they were, nope, nobody's CNR's, they closed it off.
[time=1168] And in verse 13, Paul goes on to challenge them, to open up and widen your hearts.
[time=1175] So my question is today, who or what?
[time=1182] Are you willing to endure hardship?
[time=1185] Go away quietly, go hungry, or get up early for?
[time=1190] Had somebody after first service, said they were up really late and really early to get a brisket on the smoker.
[time=1199] You know, it might be to go fishing.
[time=1204] It might be to go hunting.
[time=1205] It might be to play basketball.
[time=1206] It might, but, you look at that list of what Paul and Jesus was an example for us.
[time=1215] What are we willing to do?
[time=1218] And then secondly, can you be open hearted
[time=1225] to somebody who shut their heart off to you?
[time=1228] That's hard, that's hard.
[time=1236] Having a heart of compassion for somebody that says, nah, I'm not interested.
[time=1242] As we move on to verse three, I would tell you that we're getting ready to see the stark contrast between an open, wide heart of Jesus and some close-minded, hard-hearted people.
[time=1256] Let's look at verses three through six.
[time=1259] The accusing mob shows up.
[time=1262] Described in the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery and placed in her in the midst, they said to him, a teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery.
[time=1273] It literally could say in the very act of adultery.
[time=1277] Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women.
[time=1281] So what do you say?
[time=1283] They said this to test him that they might have some charge to bring against him.
[time=1288] It included, this mob included describes and the Pharisees and the woman.
[time=1299] She was caught in the act and she was guilty.
[time=1302] Jewish law was really clear.
[time=1304] On the testimony of two or three witnesses, death.
[time=1308] Deuteronomy 22 and Leviticus 10.
[time=1312] Everybody around in the room would have known that the death penalty was what was due here.
[time=1318] However, they were also under Roman law, just in the same way that Jesus was put before Pilate.
[time=1326] And John 1831, as Jesus was sent before Pilate, it says, take him yourself and judge him by his own law, Pilate said.
[time=1337] The Jew said to him, it is not lawful, lawful, excuse me, for us to put anyone to death.
[time=1344] So just in a few chapters, we go from a spot where they've got a lady that they're bringing and saying, hey, we gotta put this lady to death to Pilate and saying, nah, we can't execute anybody.
[time=1357] The scribes and Pharisees, the one who were supposed to know the ins and outs of the whole law and were selectively using it for their own agenda.
[time=1367] It's what they were doing.
[time=1369] Stoning would not have normally happened according to Deuteronomy 17.
[time=1372] The stoning would have normally been done on the outside of town.
[time=1376] They weren't honoring the temple.
[time=1378] They brought this defiled woman into the area of temple where teaching was happening.
[time=1384] If she was caught in the act, back then, is today, it takes two to commit adultery.
[time=1391] Where was the man?
[time=1392] - You think she actually did it or there it is like?
[time=1396] - Oh, it's very clear.
[time=1398] She was in the, she, the text says she was caught in the very act it literally says.
[time=1404] So they brought, but the man's missing.
[time=1406] The man's missing.
[time=1408] What's that look like?
[time=1412] Another one that's missing in Jewish law, the one that was offended the most, would be the one to cast the first stone.
[time=1420] The husband wasn't there.
[time=1422] This was never about the woman.
[time=1428] It was about their agenda of catching and testing Jesus.
[time=1433] Humiliated by her sin being taken to the temple, drug to the forefront and thrown in the middle of Jesus' teaching time.
[time=1441] I would tell you today that we are in a culture where we regularly see agendas get in the way of kind-heartedness, of wisdom, and of even the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
[time=1460] Please be aware of your social media feeds.
[time=1466] Your social media feeds are sent to and you receive from people who like what you like so that they can like it and make you feel all good
[time=1482] and warm and fuzzy that somebody agrees with you.
[time=1484] Your feeds are done that way.
[time=1487] Just to be clear, because somebody likes your post,
[time=1495] doesn't mean you're right.
[time=1502] Here's the truth.
[time=1504] I deal with this every day and we use it.
[time=1507] You see it on your phones.
[time=1508] You see that all of a sudden stuff pops up.
[time=1511] They're like, wow, are they listening?
[time=1513] Well, the pattern of many groups is to monitor, is to monitor the broadcast, the blogs, the post, just waiting for somebody to say something or do something that will make their point.
[time=1530] And even lead to their being totally disqualified.
[time=1534] This is the accusing, cancel culture that we live in today.
[time=1540] It is.
[time=1542] It is absolutely that.
[time=1547] What happened to our being called to our calling to be the light, being in the world, but not of the world, please be cautious of searching, creating, looking for or picking up
[time=1567] accusation stones to make your point.
[time=1569] I'll confess to you this morning that there's a command for us to pray for our leaders, to pray for our president.
[time=1582] And in my own life, I will tell you there are times where it's easier for me to be looking at a post that is about our president's most recent, verbal blunder,
[time=1595] way more frequently than I pray for him.
[time=1599] We should be convicted by what we're piling up
[time=1605] against somebody.
[time=1608] Hearts of stone, cold hard hearts of stone are fixed on being right or getting their way even at the expense of others.
[time=1618] It's at this point in the passage
[time=1624] that we really see Jesus the advocate show up, verses seven through 11.
[time=1629] Jesus bent down, he bent down and he wrote in the ground.
[time=1639] So I will tell you all of those people that I listed it at the beginning of the passage, they could probably tell you that sometimes I can be impatient and not want to wait.
[time=1654] I'm not sure I would respond to Jesus and kneel down and said nothing and start writing.
[time=1662] Remember, he had been up early, he had been up early
[time=1668] and went to the temple to teach.
[time=1671] They were disrespecting the woman, the temple, the people wanting to learn, they were disrespecting his time and from his foreknowledge, he knew they were trying
[time=1685] to catch him, trying to test him.
[time=1688] So what does Jesus do?
[time=1690] He bends down and writes.
[time=1694] He doesn't step into it and get in the guy's grill, he bends down and writes.
[time=1702] We don't know what he wrote.
[time=1705] But verse seven says, as they continued to ask him,
[time=1711] I will tell you this week we got to spend a little extended time with my two and a half year old son, grandson Jackson while the other baby was being born.
[time=1721] And a two and a half year old will regularly remind you the question, why, why, why grandpa, what are you doing?
[time=1731] And I believe this was the kind of nagging
[time=1737] they were probably doing.
[time=1738] They continued to ask him, they continued to ask him.
[time=1743] And he stood up, verse seven says, and said to them,
[time=1749] let him, who is without sin among you, be the first to throw a stone at her.
[time=1755] Like I said, this clearly, clearly is the example
[time=1762] of the heart of Jesus that we see.
[time=1765] It's exactly what he does.
[time=1768] Caringly, pointedly, confront.
[time=1776] This is where Jesus models a grace filled heart when he stands in the gap for sinners and for those who can't stand on their own.
[time=1785] This is justice.
[time=1789] This is the heart of Jesus.
[time=1791] And I would submit to you that whether it's in your workplace or with a friendship or somewhere, that there will be somebody less fortunate, there will be in a situation where the pressure's on and they don't even know how to speak, whether it's kids that might be in a bullying situation at school, it might be a coworker where you need to step up and stand in the gap for somebody that can't stand for themselves.
[time=1818] Never are you more like the heart of Jesus.
[time=1820] Be clear though, Jesus doesn't dismiss the sin.
[time=1827] He doesn't say it.
[time=1828] He doesn't say, oh, this is no big deal.
[time=1831] At the end, he wraps it up and says, go and sin no more.
[time=1833] He didn't say, oh, it's no big deal.
[time=1835] He said, stop.
[time=1836] He makes sure that these people here today recognize that her messy sin was hers.
[time=1846] Your messy sin is yours, but he also made sure that they understand, that they each had their own, that they had to deal with.
[time=1858] Judgment is real.
[time=1862] Scripture is clear, everybody will face it.
[time=1865] It has been appointed unto man once to die and then face judgment.
[time=1871] It will happen.
[time=1873] And I promise you, judgment will not be a time for finger pointing at somebody else.
[time=1880] It will not be.
[time=1882] You won't be pointing to anybody else, but he, but he, but he.
[time=1889] Your only answer before the judgment seat of your sin is that I trust in the covering of my mess with the blood of Jesus Christ and won't be pointed and won't be, won't be pointing, it won't be accusing.
[time=1905] From the beginning of Genesis on, God is concerned with the heart.
[time=1911] The word of God coupled with the spirit of God is able to do exactly what Hebrews 4, 12 says.
[time=1919] The word is powerful and living sharper than any two-edged sword, able to divide joints and moral.
[time=1926] And I love the last phrase.
[time=1928] Able to judge the thoughts and intentions of one's heart.
[time=1933] Heart matters.
[time=1937] Micah 6, 8, he is told you, oh man, what is good and what does the Lord require of you to do justice?
[time=1947] To do justice, love mercy and walk humbly with your God.
[time=1952] James 2, 13 says, for judgment without mercy to one who has not shown mercy, mercy triumphs over judgment.
[time=1962] Clearly these guys were playing the accuser, pointing fingers.
[time=1968] And once more, Jesus bent down and started writing in the ground.
[time=1977] We don't have any idea, again, what he wrote.
[time=1980] The interesting thing is this time, while he was writing,
[time=1986] verse nine says, while he was writing, they heard.
[time=1993] While he was writing, they heard.
[time=1999] Not really sure what it meant.
[time=2004] Not really sure what he said, but they left and she stayed.
[time=2009] Whether or not any of the accusers left, changed and believing is unknown, but they clearly heard and were convicted.
[time=2019] I want to remind you of this.
[time=2021] Conviction does not, yeah.
[time=2025] Conviction doesn't mean that you embrace the tugs of your heart.
[time=2033] It means that your heartstrings were tugged.
[time=2035] Conviction does not mandate change.
[time=2041] Some would say they're leaving, indicates their rejection of Jesus in realizing that their trap failed.
[time=2048] Jesus stood up and said, "Woman, where are they?" Has no one condemned you?
[time=2057] Notice she says, "Lord, no one, Lord."
[time=2064] And Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you "and from now on, send no more." David, a man that's described after God's own heart, in Psalm 51, committed this very act.
[time=2076] Adultery with Beth Sheba.
[time=2081] In 51, 16 of Psalms says, "For you do not delight
[time=2087] "in sacrifice, or I would give it.
[time=2090] "You will not be pleased with a burnt offering.
[time=2094] "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, "a broken and contrite heart.
[time=2104] "You will not despise.
[time=2107] "Broken, contrite, humble hearts,
[time=2114] "acknowledged their own mess.
[time=2115] "Fully aware that you got a mess.
[time=2122] "They believe in Christ and His ability to cover it, "and they are blessed.
[time=2126] "Blessed messes.
[time=2129] "Justice in the everyday arena can never require "a sinless person.
[time=2135] "If so, who could serve?
[time=2139] "I love how Rick Warren says it.
[time=2142] "If God only used perfect people, nothing would get done.
[time=2146] "God will use anybody that's available.
[time=2149] "There's not a perfect one.
[time=2153] "The only one that ever walked this earth, "they put him on a cross and killed him.
[time=2156] "Ultimately, there was a much bigger heart issue "in play that Jesus actually addresses "back in chapter three with Nicodemus.
[time=2166] "Remember, Jesus came to seek and to save the lost.
[time=2172] "He gives Nicodemus' response in John 3, 17,
[time=2178] right after the famous "For God so loved the world" verse.
[time=2181] For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world.
[time=2189] It's not why He came.
[time=2190] But in order that the world might be saved through Him, whoever believes in Him is not condemned.
[time=2198] Pretty clear, isn't it?
[time=2199] But whoever does not believe is condemned already.
[time=2205] It had nothing to do with the stoning.
[time=2207] It has everything to do with your belief in Jesus.
[time=2210] And this is judgment.
[time=2214] The light has come into the world and people love the darkness rather than the light.
[time=2219] So I ask you who you might be identifying with today.
[time=2225] With Jesus, can you have a wide open heart?
[time=2231] Going to great lengths to those sinners
[time=2237] who were willing to listen.
[time=2238] Do you have a big heart?
[time=2241] Are you a person in the crowd that doesn't really know?
[time=2248] You're just trying to get close.
[time=2250] You're just trying to get close and here's what he's got to say.
[time=2253] And learn everything you can about Jesus.
[time=2257] Maybe you're just looking for that.
[time=2259] Maybe you're being an obstacle.
[time=2266] Maybe you're putting things in the way of people that doesn't allow them to embrace the truth of Jesus.
[time=2272] Jesus really blasts them in Matthew, chapter 23.
[time=2278] And just woe to you scribes and Pharisees and just blast them for being obstacles in people's way.
[time=2288] Participating and accusing and calling out someone who's guilty without consideration of your own mess.
[time=2296] Had somebody after first service say, "Boy, we and evangelicals are really good at that." At pointing fingers and calling people out that have screwed up rather than dealing with our own ugliness.
[time=2307] Maybe you identify closest with the woman.
[time=2313] Caught in the act, guilty, ashamed,
[time=2319] feeling like everybody's watching.
[time=2323] And you just want somebody to care.
[time=2325] Jesus will respond the same way to you.
[time=2330] We just dealt with one of the most difficult things that the world encounters.
[time=2337] Is Jesus a loving God?
[time=2339] Is he a loving God that always forgives everything?
[time=2344] Or is he a just God?
[time=2345] Yes, he is.
[time=2348] He's both.
[time=2351] They're always in perfect balance.
[time=2354] Today, I would ask you to bow your heads as I ask a couple of these questions.
[time=2360] If you've not trusted Christ as your saviour,
[time=2366] if you don't know him as Lord in your life, I would ask you this.
[time=2373] Humbly ask Jesus to deal with your messy sin.
[time=2383] Just stop and ask him.
[time=2384] I love how Kevin says your heart's screaming it.
[time=2387] It doesn't take just acknowledge that you want Jesus to cover your sin.
[time=2391] There's nobody present here today that doesn't have sin in your life that requires the Holy Spirit to be your advocate for growth and change.
[time=2401] Everybody, if you want to grow and change and perform to the image of Jesus, it takes the Holy Spirit.
[time=2408] Believers in the room ask the Holy Spirit to help you have a heart that is wide open to those lost around you.
[time=2417] So you might be able to be more of a big-hearted advocate
[time=2424] than a stone grabbing accuser.
[time=2427] I would ask you, is there anybody in the room this morning
[time=2436] that would say, Rick, today, today, I want to ask Jesus to deal with my messy sin?
[time=2443] If there is, would you please raise your hand that I might be able to pray for you?
[time=2448] Thank you.
[time=2451] Anybody else?
[time=2452] Thank you.
[time=2454] Thank you, Jesus.
[time=2456] Believers, is there conviction for you
[time=2465] to have your heart be wide or open?
[time=2471] For those that are lost.
[time=2472] Raise your hand if that's you.
[time=2475] Thank you.
[time=2477] Thank you, Jesus.
[time=2478] God, we celebrate.
[time=2483] God, we celebrate those that would say they want you
[time=2492] to deal with their messy sin.
[time=2494] Thank you for the privilege, Jesus, with the Greek and the truth, that would bring conviction by your Holy Spirit.
[time=2503] God, the angels are celebrating right now.
[time=2508] May we do the same in Jesus' name.
