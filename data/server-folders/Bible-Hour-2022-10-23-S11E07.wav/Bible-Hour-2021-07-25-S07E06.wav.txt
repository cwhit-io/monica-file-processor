[time=0] Well, hello friends, it is so good to see you.
[time=7] Good to be back with you.
[time=8] I want to give a special shout out to my friends, Steve Webster and Rick Rayburn.
[time=12] Didn't they do an awesome job bringing the Word of God to us these last two weeks?
[time=16] Yeah, let's give it up for them and how guys use them.
[time=19] And the series, Messy, has just been so impactful to me and to so many and we're in the Gospel of John.
[time=25] So we'll be getting there in just a minute.
[time=26] But hey, as we dive in today and continue this series, it is great to be with you.
[time=31] I've met so many new people today, so many guests, people I've met for the first time.
[time=35] And so we just want you to know, we are so glad that you're here, I want you to feel like you were among family.
[time=40] That's our rule.
[time=41] Once you come once, your family with us, thanks to those of you who have allowed us into your homes, onto your screens, we're just glad to be a part of the family of God as we've been singing about together.
[time=49] Can I get an amen?
[time=50] It's a good family here at Blackhawk and we're glad you're a part of it.
[time=54] Speaking of that, just a few things coming up, I want to invite you, if you missed our 10 before, that's where we do our announcements.
[time=59] We give you all things Blackhawk in the 10 minutes before the service, whether you're in the room or you're watching us online.
[time=66] We just talked about all these things, but go to blackhawk.fyi.
[time=69] All things Blackhawk are there.
[time=71] We've got child dedication.
[time=72] Next week, the last day to sign up for that, I think it's tomorrow, we've got fall kickoffs, a huge day.
[time=78] You talk about reaching out to people, inviting people who are far from God, but close to you and give them a chance to engage with Jesus.
[time=84] The 15th of August, we've got a whole day planned for you for a fall kickoff.
[time=89] One service the next week, October, excuse me, August the 22nd at 10am is a baptism service.
[time=96] Some of you have been waiting to get baptized and it's time to stop waiting and I believe this is your day.
[time=101] A lot of you have been waiting on the outdoor baptismists.
[time=103] We're planning one big service, 10am and get all those details at Blackhawk.fyi as well.
[time=109] Last but not least, you guys showed out.
[time=111] Look at your neighbor say, you did good.
[time=112] Tell them.
[time=113] They don't need to know why yet.
[time=114] Just tell them.
[time=115] It's good.
[time=116] You guys did so good collecting for our 46815 zip code schools.
[time=120] My goodness, the stuff out there, we don't have anywhere to put it all.
[time=123] It's awesome.
[time=124] Let's give it up for Jesus and for each other for how you showed up collecting these school supplies to light the one five in our area.
[time=130] I'm so glad to be with you and I don't know where you're at today, but I know that God's got a word for you.
[time=136] Do believe it.
[time=137] I want to continue our series messy today and in this series, we're looking in the Gospel of John.
[time=142] So if you have your Bibles, devices turned to the Gospel of John and your New Testament and we're reading through the Gospel of John as a church this summer and into the fall.
[time=150] And so we invite you into that even if you're new with us, you can find all those reading plans, Blackhawk.fyi, but what we're doing is looking at the relationships Jesus built and we're trying to number one, identify with the people with whom Jesus is building relationships so that we know that God wants a relationship with us and then secondly, we want to initiate some of those relational principles, the intentionality of Jesus in our own relationships.
[time=173] Raise your hand if you've got a messy relationship in your life.
[time=176] Anybody who didn't raise their hand, we know that you meant to because we all have those.
[time=180] And today, I want to talk to you about Jesus and the disappointed Jesus and the disappointed.
[time=184] This is the story of Jesus and Lazarus from John chapter 11.
[time=188] We'll be reading.
[time=189] Yes, you read it right.
[time=190] 1 through 44, I tried to look at, you know, can we do it in two weeks?
[time=194] I just got to give you the whole story today.
[time=196] So cancel your lunch plans.
[time=198] I'm just kidding.
[time=200] But we've got a lot of verses to cover.
[time=201] I can't wait to dig in with you today.
[time=202] Jesus and the disappointed.
[time=204] I don't know if you brought some disappointment with you today, but it's been said when it comes to trials and adversity and disappointment, you're either leaving a time of that, you're in a time of that, or you're going into a time of that.
[time=215] And sometimes it seems like you're doing all three simultaneously.
[time=217] Can I get a name in?
[time=219] No matter where you're at in that process, I believe today's story is full of disappointment.
[time=223] Because listen, this story starts with a funeral, but it ends with a party.
[time=227] I'm not promising to you that the funeral of sorts that you brought with you, your disappointment is going to end with a party today at all.
[time=234] In fact, Jesus says the opposite is going to happen quite often.
[time=237] But what we are going to learn is that the Lord of that party, the Lord of all eternity, the Lord who meets us in our disappointment is ready to do that in your own life.
[time=246] So with that, I want to give you seven things or people really that Jesus relates with in this story.
[time=252] And so we're going to go through it verse by verse.
[time=253] The first one is simply this, you ready for the word today?
[time=256] Let's do it.
[time=257] Jesus in suffering, the first four verses of John chapter 11, we see how Jesus starts off this story acknowledging and relating with suffering.
[time=266] Jesus said, John 1633, these things I'm telling you that in me you can have peace in the world, you will have tribulation, but take heart because I've overcome the world.
[time=274] And we see him living this out in this passage.
[time=276] So let's dig into John chapter 11 today, we'll read the first four verses where we see Jesus starting us off about suffering.
[time=282] Let's dig in together.
[time=285] Verse number one of John 11, now a certain man was ill, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
[time=292] It was Mary who anointed, it was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill.
[time=300] So the sisters sent to him saying, Lord, he whom you love, this is going to be a theme, this love of Jesus in this passage, he whom you love is ill.
[time=309] But Jesus when he heard it said, this illness does not lead to death, it is for the glory of God so that the son of man may be glorified through it.
[time=320] And if you've ever struggled with this question of suffering and why would a good God allow bad things to happen to good people, first of all we realize we're not very good, we're pretty messy and sinful, but even such, if you've ever struggled and I have and your neighbor has, whether they want to admit it or not, if you've ever struggled with the whole problem of pain, I want to point you to a great resource, CS Lewis wrote a book called The Problem of Pain.
[time=340] And in that book, here's what he says about what God does with suffering, he says, God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pains.
[time=350] It is his megaphone to rouse a death world.
[time=354] And we see Jesus using that megaphone right here at the beginning of this passage, and in the first verse we see a reality, and I just want to remind us of it, not that we need that reminder, that suffering and death is going to come for all of us.
[time=366] It follows us no matter what.
[time=368] It was not a part of God's original plan.
[time=370] Did you know that death?
[time=371] Did you know that that's when Jesus defeated death at the cross?
[time=373] It was once and for all, and it was to eventually get us to a spot where all of that stuff that he never wanted or intended is going to be no more.
[time=380] He has defeated death, but we live in this temporary flesh suit, we live in this temporary world anticipating an eternal kingdom, it's the already not yet tension we live in today.
[time=390] Until we get there, we have to deal with this horrible thing called death, and it's real, and suffering, and it's real, and some of you have lost people, some of you are fighting some diagnoses right now, some of you are fighting suffering and death and things of the light right now.
[time=405] In this passage I believe will encourage your heart.
[time=407] Lazarus was ill, maybe you are, many of you I know have had diagnosis even just this summer.
[time=412] You're walking with somebody who is, let's learn from Jesus.
[time=415] And before I go to verse two, in verse one you notice that it talks with Bethany, I can't just skip over that because a lot of times we do, we just read it, it's like yeah, that's where it was, but I want to point it out because I am so passionate and confident in the word
[time=429] of God.
[time=430] I'm so passionate about helping people have confidence in your Bibles.
[time=434] Because I'll tell you, I didn't always have that, even as a PK my parents are over here, I just searched things out for myself and learned to own my own faith, and as I went on that journey, the more I sought after God, the more I realized things like this, that the Bible is full of these factual, historical, scientifically proven and true items that
[time=453] all converge under the spiritual eternal kingdom that God is building.
[time=457] I want you to have confidence in your Bible my friends, because it is so full of true, real events in real places, and real people just like Martha and Mary and Lazarus and Bethany.
[time=468] And so we start the story there in verse one, seeing that that is exactly who's involved, and that it is Mary who in the next chapter actually who would anoint Jesus and wipe his feet with her hair, this whose brother is ill, Lazarus, Mary, Martha and Lazarus.
[time=483] And we read a lot about them in scripture, and I'll tell you some of that together as we go.
[time=488] But verse three, they're in a crisis, they sent to Jesus, Jesus the one whom you love is ill.
[time=492] And I can't just skip over that either, it's a theme you'll find throughout this passage that it's the one you love, Jesus loved, Jesus loved him so much.
[time=499] Over and over you see this, especially for us guys in the room, this is true for all of us, but because as we often said in the south, because I are one, I'll pick on the guys for a minute.
[time=510] A lot of times we don't do what Jesus did, he's this super in shape, the stuff that they had to do to travel, we forget how in shape he must have been, he's a carpenter, he's a man's man, but in this passage he weeps, and he has these emotionally strength, it has an emotionally healthy relational approach as a single man.
[time=528] He loves Lazarus and he loves Mary and he loves Martha and so, I don't know why this
[time=534] hit me so hard as I read this this week and you'll see it over and over, dads listen, tell your kids and your family that you love them.
[time=542] So thankful to have a dad who did that and that's not true of every family even in pockets of our own family, but today I just want you to know there's power in being strong and secure enough to be emotionally healthy and mature and say I love you.
[time=556] No strings attached.
[time=557] That's for, I don't know, but implement it in your life because that's exactly what we see Jesus doing and then in verse four he just gives us this picture of suffering, he says it's to glorify God, he said this suffering is going to glorify God, it's going to show who I am and so this is the picture we see in really amidst crisis and suffering,
[time=573] we'll see the destruction of it sometimes without seeing the potential deliverance, without seeing the end game, without seeing the purpose that God wants to bring about.
[time=581] I think of being in a plane, I've told the story before where I look down, saw this big ball of cloud and thunder and thought of the people and it was just like a basketball size because I was so far up and I saw the big cloud there and up above that I saw rainbow,
[time=595] no kidding, just right into the clouds, the rays of sun were just shooting, it was the most beautiful picture ever, but I thought about the people in the storm and they couldn't see any of that, but because of my elevated perspective I could see what they couldn't see and that is how God views suffering.
[time=608] He sees a way bigger picture than what you and I see and on that foundation we keep moving
[time=614] in our story, Jesus is saying to you today just like in the story, trust me and see what I'll do, see how I'll bring glory to God through this trial, through this suffering that I'm in the midst of.
[time=625] Number two is Jesus in timing, not just suffering but now timing, look at the next few verses here because God's timing, how many of you have ever noticed God's timing is not your timing, have you ever noticed that, okay, well the people in this story can probably one up you, all right, so let's check it out, maybe not, let's see where it's at, verse five, now Jesus loved Martha, there it is again, and her sister and Lazarus, so don't miss
[time=647] this because he loved them is the flow that we go from verse five to verse six, he loved them so much, so what did he do because of his love for them, verse six, so when he heard that Lazarus was ill, he stayed two days longer in the place where he was, then after this
[time=664] he said to the disciples, let us go to Judea again, Jesus in timing, you see the trend of his love and because of that love he stayed, he said, well that doesn't make much sense if he really loved him he would go, right, but there again God's plan and purpose and suffering is often a way bigger picture than what we can see in those moments because Jesus knew exactly what he was going to do and he knew the timing it would take to get there, so he heard of the emergency and he stayed where he was, so now I ask you, does God ever seem late to you, does God ever seem like he doesn't care to you, can you relate with
[time=697] that, God why wouldn't you show up, God why won't you hear my cry, God why won't you
[time=703] answer my prayer, God why won't you come through, God do you even listen to me, maybe
[time=710] you can relate with some of those questions, no doubt that's how many felt in this story, Jesus in the disappointed is what we're looking at, but Jesus then verse seven tells the disciples hey now's the time, let's go to Judea, but before we unpack that I want to remind you if you're waiting on God's timing and you're struggling with how he's not showing up and things are not going the way that you thought they would go, I want to remind you of this truth that I found in my life as I follow Jesus as a son and a daughter, as we are, as kids of his, as a son of God, I have learned that pain is just a pause in God's promises, pain is just a pause in God's promises, it didn't stop him, they're still moving,
[time=746] but sometimes he takes a pause and lets us walk through things so that his promises can make sense so that his purposes can come true and God's economy, listen pain is never wasted, I know it sure feels like it sometimes in my life, how about you, but boy when I read these scriptures I'm learning over and over that I can trust God that he's always faithful and good even when his timing doesn't make sense, his ways are not my ways, his timing's not my timings and here's what I've learned is that God's pause is not God's punishment, he ever felt like when God gave you a pause it's like well God's just punishing me, he just hates me, God's out to get me, he doesn't love me and a lot of times it's because he loves
[time=785] you, he lets you go through the pause of pain so that in that pause you can stop and sometimes
[time=791] the only place you're so low, the only place you can look is up and God wants you in this pause to realize he's not looking to punish you, he's looking to point you to his promises, he's wanting you to know who he is and see his purposes and so you see Jesus in suffering, you see the timing element, number three now he teaches the disciples about it, Jesus and the disciples is number three versus eight through nineteen is where the story goes next and he spends a lot of time, this is before he shows up on the scene, he's teaching the disciples about what he's about to do and he's preparing them so let's pick up where we left off verse eight, the disciples said to him Rabbi the Jews were just now seeking to stone you, are you going there again? Jesus answered, are there not 12 hours
[time=831] in a day if anyone walks in the day he does not stumble because he sees the light of this world but if anyone walks in the night he stumbles because the light is not in him, after saying these things he said to them our friend, there it is again, our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep but I go to awaken him, the disciples said to him Lord if he's fallen asleep he'll recover, now Jesus had spoken
[time=852] of his death but they thought he meant taking rest in sleep, verse 14 then Jesus told them plainly
[time=858] Lazarus has died and for your sake, this is so powerful, underline this, for your sake I am glad
[time=868] I was not there so that you may believe but let us go to him, verse 16 so Thomas called the twin
[time=876] said to his fellow disciples let us also go that we may die with him, now when Jesus came he found
[time=883] that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days and here's another factual truth that just shows you the historical accuracy of the story, verse 18, Bethany was near Jerusalem about two miles off and many Jews had come to Martha and married to console them concerning their brother
[time=900] so Jesus is teaching his disciples and in verse 8 he says hey let's go back to Judea and they say to him okay, if Lazarus is dying what we really don't need Jesus is a dead Lazarus and a dead Jesus
[time=912] because the last time you were there have you forgotten, I mean we know you hadn't forgotten because you're you know the son of God and all but it feels like you've forgotten you know I'm paraphrasing a little, you wonder what goes through their minds, I wonder what goes through my mind but you know if you go back there they're going to kill you and now you say let's go back there
[time=928] and if he's sick you know I mean I kind of hate that but you probably shouldn't go there is what they're saying but this is what I love, I love the gospel in verse 8 because this is who Jesus is, he lays down his own life for our spiritual death, Jesus lays down his and sacrifices
[time=947] his life for the sake of his friends, he didn't care what would wait for him there because he prioritized the people that he came to minister to, Jesus lays down his life for his friends,
[time=959] greater love has no man than this than he who would lay down his lives for his friend, Jesus didn't just say that, Jesus lived that, the gospel is so evident in verse 8, Jesus said you know what
[time=970] I don't care in verses 9 and 10, how many of you are a little confused verses 9 and 10, the whole light, day, night, dark thing like what is, Jesus is so weird like where does that come from and what Jesus is talking about in that part of the passage is listen I'm on a mission and I'm in the daytime of my ministry and the nighttime of my ministry is coming up where I will lay down my life
[time=991] for you and for the sake of the world and for the sin of humanity, that time will come but it's not here now and so while it's daytime, while it's still time to go, I will not be deterred and I don't
[time=1003] care what stands in my way, I will not stop and that's a good word for some of you here today,
[time=1009] some of you are getting deterred and it just feels like you're so distracted and so defeated and so disappointed and so discouraged but God wants you to see even in the life of Jesus until he calls you
[time=1020] home, pursue Jesus until he calls you home, run after the heart of God, he doesn't care what
[time=1026] obstacle stands in your way, he's bigger than any storm, he's bigger than any disappointment and Jesus is showing us that in verses even just 8 through 10 at the beginning of this story and I
[time=1037] love verse 11, he caps it off and says our friend Lazarus, relational Jesus, that's the first thing what you see in verse 11 is that Jesus wants to look at me for a minute, Jesus wants to be your friend, Jesus wants to call you a son and a daughter or a part of the family of God,
[time=1053] that's why he came. Second thing is you notice the language that the Bible uses pertaining to
[time=1060] death, it's different for those who are in Christ and those who are not in Christ, for those who are in Christ people who surrendered their life to Jesus, their sons and daughters of God because of the sacrifice of Jesus and because he has made us righteous and holy and not because we were good enough to do that on ourselves, that's part of the family of God is who Jesus is what Jesus came to do, those who are in Christ it'll have to say things like he's fallen asleep, you notice that, but death is talked about very differently and that's for those who are not and today I want you to notice like what are you trying to scare me, I'll tell you I'm scared to death of death without Jesus, the worst thing in life is not to die, the worst thing in life is to die without Jesus because heaven is real, hell is real, separation from God is real, but God has
[time=1100] made a way so that we can be a part of the family of God, that is the gospel, that's what we see in this passage is what Jesus came to implement and I want you to know it beyond a shadow of a doubt,
[time=1111] I can't change your heart, God does that work but I want to point you to the truth of Jesus today, no matter where you're at, no matter how confused you've been, God's Holy Spirit is working in you to show you the truth of who Jesus is and I'm so thankful that he made this truth approachable
[time=1128] and available because you and I are not adequate to approach it on our own, I'm so dead and my
[time=1134] trespasses and sins, but God sent Jesus and I'm so thankful that that's true, there's so many
[time=1141] scriptures that exemplify the outflow, the overflow of that, 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 8 is
[time=1147] one of them, it says yes we are of good courage and we would rather be away from the body and at
[time=1153] home with the Lord to be absent from the body, to be present with the Lord, that's what we can hope for, that's why the worst thing that could happen to you is not death, it's death without Jesus, it's life without Jesus, it's eternity without Jesus and that's why I preach Jesus every Sunday
[time=1167] and that will never stop as long as I'm here and listen if you don't know Jesus today, where you're at right now in this earth is as close to heaven as you'll ever be, if you are a believer today,
[time=1177] right now on this earth is as close to hell as you'll ever be and I'm so glad that my Jesus
[time=1184] has given me a home with him, that he loves me that much and we see the gospel even in these verses and then they're come to the disciples and they're kind of confused, you ever get there, you ever get confused, they're saying well I mean if he's just sleeping he'll get better, he's good and Jesus has to plainly tell him verse 14, no Lazarus has died and some of you I just want you to know you've lost loved ones and I've got a few things I want to say to you today but I want to start with this, do you notice Jesus is not present physically where Lazarus is dead, how do you know, well because he's the Son of God and we look back and we know that but Jesus was not physically present but yet he knew in this passage, today I know that God has sent forth
[time=1222] his Holy Spirit to indwell us but Jesus no longer walks among us, the word became flesh and dwelt among us but then he ascended to heaven and he sent his spirit to be with us and that's how we connect with God, that's how we have his presence in our life but here's what that means, it means for you and me when we go through times with disappointment, discouragement, depression and even loss and suffering, it means that we don't feel the presence of God sometimes because we can't look
[time=1243] across the room and see him there, just like just like the Jesus who wasn't physically present where Lazarus was dead in this story, he may not be physically present where you can lay your eyes on him today but just like he knew then he knows now, what does he know pastor, he knows every depth
[time=1260] of your soul, he knows all of the pain that you've experienced, he knows all of the grief
[time=1266] that you're walking through and this passage, if no other passage in the Bible shows us and boy they all do but if no other passage shows us how much he cares, this passage of scripture reminds us how much God doesn't just know but he loves you and he cares, I can't make all your pain go away
[time=1282] and the God who can one day will but until then you can trust him and he wants you to know that today and that's what he shows us in this story and as we're looking at that very fact Jesus reminded them verse 15 is so powerful, he says I'm glad, I wasn't there, he's like excuse me,
[time=1299] right you're glad your friend is dying and you could have done something, you're like what's the, we don't get that do it, it doesn't seem very logical, why so that you could believe and then Thomas says hey well if Jesus is going to die, let's hope God go die with him, it's a Philippians 121 kind of mindset, Paul said it this way, for me to live is Christ and to die is gain, that's what Thomas says, hey if he's going to die because they're going to stone him, we already know, so this is just, this is what he wanted, this is the time, so let's just go die and like hey maybe Jesus had done something in that guy's heart right because he exemplified
[time=1329] that and they were in this situation where there was nothing else they could do, Lazarus is in the tomb for four days and it's over, maybe you feel the same way, it's just over, there's nothing else
[time=1339] I can do, well that's when God likes to show up and do his greatest work and first Corinthians 15,
[time=1345] Paul reminds us of this that because of the sting of sin, because of sin, death is going to come after us all, suffering is going to come after us all, but thanks be to God because he took away
[time=1356] the sting of death, the sting of sin is no more, he conquered it, he's conquered the grave, he's conquered hell, he's conquered our separation from God because of his work, his finished work
[time=1366] on the cross and when Jesus shows up, listen it may be too late for you and me but it's never too late when Jesus is on the scene and I'm glad of it, verse, and that's what happens in verse 17, Jesus came, I love that, circle those two words, Jesus came, when Jesus shows up everything changes,
[time=1382] everything shifts, there may be no hope but when Jesus shows up there is always hope my friends,
[time=1388] so I don't know what you carry today but God wants you to know there is hope, verse 19, notice that they were surrounded, Mary and Martha and the family, they were surrounded by their physical
[time=1399] family but they were also surrounded by the Jews it says, which is their church family and we often forget that when it says that but that's what it is, it would be their church family this time just like this is our church family, we're gathered here together today and so I want to remind you today you were born into a physical family in this earth but if you're a follower of
[time=1417] Jesus you were born again into a spiritual family, your church and I want to remind you that we need
[time=1424] both, I want to remind you today and that's what's happening here, they're surrounded, Mary and Martha are surrounded by their family yes but their church family is there too, the Jews are there and that's what we're moving next as Jesus moves from teaching the disciples, he's now on the scene and he moves to Martha and then he moves to Mary and disappointed people and he loves them super well but as this is happening don't miss the fact that they are surrounded by their church community and I don't know what your physical family looks like but I can tell you this church family here at Blackhawk is a beautiful amazing family of people who want to embrace and love you and you need that, in fact
[time=1457] look at your neighbor, I do this all the time and it's time to do it again, tell them, I've been gone a couple of weeks, tell them say you need me, tell them you need me, you need me, you do, now
[time=1467] tell them again because they didn't believe you say you really do need me, tell them, you really do need me, we need each other, we need to be known and we need to know and as we go through crisis and
[time=1477] it was to go through disappointments, I did a wedding here yesterday, we've got a baby coming in our staff right now and we want to go through the highs like that but we want to go through the lows of disappointment and discouragement and depression and loss and grief and the funerals
[time=1493] you're not meant to do it alone, that's why we say a row can't know but circles sure do, when we sit in circles and we do community, we gather here, we connect and we go, those are our three methodologies for accomplishing our mission and our vision, it's gathered, we're doing that now, it's connect and it's go, connect means I've got to get in a circle, I've got to go beyond the row, we see that happening even this story. Number four is Jesus and Martha, this is where it gets really personal, verses 20 through 27 we see this picture of Jesus and Martha and she comes
[time=1522] on to the scene and I just love how Jesus meets her right where she's at, let's go to verse 20
[time=1528] which says so when Martha heard that Jesus was coming she went and met him but Mary remained seated at the house, I love that, I don't know why it's seated because that's where Mary would be in the next chapter, it's kind of interesting how they all grieve differently right, they all go through life differently, Mary's the doer, she's the server as you study and see them in scripture but Mary's at the house, verse 21, Martha said to Jesus, "Lord if you had been here my brother was
[time=1550] not have died but even now I know whatever you ask from God God will give you," Jesus said to her,
[time=1557] "your brother will rise again," Martha said to him, "I know he'll rise again in the resurrection on the last day," and I need to pause this there and tell you Martha is quoting something that the Jewish people would have known all too well a concept known as the resurrection from the dead places like Daniel 12-2 you can see the why behind that you see that in the last day everyone would be raised
[time=1576] to life there'd be a resurrection of the dead and they knew that and so some would be raised again to everlasting life, some would be raised again to everlasting death and she knew that and so she said yeah I know listen here's what she's saying and maybe it's what you're saying, she's saying yeah yeah I know it in the last day he'll rise again but Jesus I miss my brother now maybe that's where you are you know that there's things to come and there's eternal hope but you
[time=1602] hurt right now and that is where Martha is as we read this story and then this is what Jesus had to say verse 25 Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life whoever believes in me though we die yet shall he live and everyone who lives and believes in me
[time=1620] shall never die." Do you believe this? She said to him, "Yes Lord I believe that you are the Christ
[time=1629] the Son of God who is coming into the world." And I'm so thankful for this passage because it's
[time=1638] the gospel again and he's making it known through his care and his compassion for Martha she gives him all the if-then's you ever give God the if-then's if you God then this if you would have shown up
[time=1650] if you would have kept what I thought was your promise if you would have done this then this wouldn't have happened or that would have happened and that's what Martha gives him but she says nonetheless I still believe you are who you say you are I'm struggling to and I'm really
[time=1664] disappointed and I'm falling apart but I'm giving it my best maybe that's where you're at that's where Martha is out and Jesus meets her there and he says she's gonna rise he's gonna rise again and
[time=1675] then says to her I am the resurrection and life this is a change this is the new kingdom that he's established and he says to her listen I am not talking about the last days I'm talking about something that I came to do right now I want you to know that I today am the resurrection and the life and that anyone who lives and believes in me even though they're gonna die they will live and I am the way I am that truth I am the life that I've come to bring to you even in the midst of
[time=1701] disappointment even in the midst of death and that is what God wants us to hear today and he says to her this powerful question do you believe this it's the most important question you and I have to answer in all of our time here on earth what do you believe about Jesus and he asks her and she
[time=1717] don't miss what she responds with though let me tell you what she didn't respond with Martha didn't respond with perfect faith Martha didn't respond with a full understanding of what was
[time=1729] going on she still didn't know what Jesus was about to do she still didn't know why Jesus was saying all these things she still didn't know why Jesus didn't show up when she thought he should have shown up she didn't listen she didn't even respond with perfect obedience she was far from
[time=1743] perfect but you know what she responded with all the faith she had and you know what it was enough
[time=1749] because even when we're not enough Jesus is you know what she said these two powerful words yes
[time=1755] Lord yes Lord those are powerful words that we can take from this passage and
[time=1763] I'm so thankful that right now some of you are probably asking you like even as I read the story hey I know Jesus is about to raise Lazarus from the dead but he didn't raise my mom
[time=1773] he didn't heal my brother he didn't answer my prayer why not
[time=1779] and I want you to know today what I can't do and what I can do what I don't know and what I do know
[time=1787] as your pastor I wish I could give you all those answers I don't know I don't know why God doesn't
[time=1793] do things the way he does and doesn't do them because I'm not God I don't know what all his
[time=1799] purposes are that he's trying to bring about in your life I don't know why in this passage he did this this way but in other passages and in other people's lives including you use in mind he doesn't do them the same way I don't know let me tell you what I do know I do know that God has a purpose
[time=1815] for you in the midst of your pain I do know that the same God of this passage you said I'm the resurrection and the life loves you dearly I know that he knows the depths of your heart and I know
[time=1826] that he cares I know that he loves you with all that he's got and that's everything and it's something that's far beyond what we can find them I know that he's faithful I know that he's trustworthy I know that he's the true king of kings and the lord of lords who came and became flesh to dwell on us so then in the midst of your pain and your doubts and your questions and
[time=1848] your lack of full understanding and your imperfect obedience and faith to him that if you just bring
[time=1854] your yes lord if you just bring what little faith you've got in the midst of your disappointment
[time=1860] that he will meet you in your mess and then he will love you through it that he will weep with
[time=1866] you even though he knows the end result because he loves you that much so that's what I don't know but that's what I do know and God just like he did with Martha wants to show up in your messiness he wants to show up in your disappointment and your discouragement and in the death and in the grief and in the pain that you're experiencing today oh I know God wants to change your heart in this place I pray we'll open ourselves up and let him in will you do that so glad that Martha did and
[time=1892] then we move to Jesus and Mary and I love the differences in their ways of grieving Jesus and
[time=1898] Mary verses 28 through 33 let's read that together starting in verse 28 when Jesus when she had said this she went and called her sister Mary saying in private the teacher is here and is calling for you love that verse and when she heard it she rose quickly and went to him now Jesus had not yet
[time=1914] come into the village but was still in the place where Martha had met him when the Jews were with
[time=1920] her in the house consoling her saw Mary rise quickly and go out they followed her supposing
[time=1926] that she was going to the tomb to weep there now when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him
[time=1933] she fell at his feet foreshadowing for where she would remain in the next chapter and I love that part of her story saying to him Lord if you had been here my brother would not have died when Jesus
[time=1944] saw her weeping and the Jews who had come with her also weeping he was deeply moved in his spirit and greatly troubled I love this picture of the love of God so he called for Mary and it reminds
[time=1955] us that Jesus doesn't forget people and I want to tell you today Jesus has not forgotten you other people may have forgotten you may have betrayed you may have left you on your own
[time=1966] but Jesus has not forgotten you just like he didn't forget Mary he called for her and I love what she
[time=1972] does she gets up and she quickly comes to Jesus by the way that's the best thing you could do in adversity get up and quickly go to Jesus as fast as possible but I love what happens you notice the people watch her as she went to Jesus others followed that's my prayer for me when I go through
[time=1987] a trial when I go through adversity when I go through loss when I go through pain when I go through disappointment my prayer is that I get up and I quickly go to Jesus and that people see me going to Jesus and they come with me because I believe this about suffering I believe listen that your greatest opportunities to point people to Jesus will come in times of suffering people watch really hard because true character comes out when you're suffering doesn't it
[time=2012] and we know that and people look a little harder and some of your greatest opportunities to point people to Jesus just like Mary did in this story will come when you are suffering and I love what she does when she gets there she falls at his feet verse 32 maybe that's where you need to be to today is just at the feet of Jesus and Jesus saw her weep he saw those weeping around her and so he was deeply moved he bore their burdens Galatians 6 2 tells us this that what we are called to do
[time=2037] is bear one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ well so what's the law of Christ one
[time=2043] of the best pictures I can give it to you in just a couple of verses is John 13 34 and 35 where Jesus said it this way John 13 34 35 he says a new command I give to you that you love one another
[time=2055] well that doesn't feel very new that's an old command what's new about it well here's what he says that you love one another just as I have loved you you are also to love one another by this all
[time=2065] people will know you're my disciples if you have love for one another what was new about the command
[time=2071] what's the law of Christ is to love the way that Jesus loved and not only did Jesus tell us that he's showing us that in passages just like this as he's not even raised Lazarus from the dead yet
[time=2081] some of your life would you just get to the good part but boy we that's where we are in our lives sometimes and we just need to pause in the pain and see what God's up to how he's building something and that leads me to Jesus in the disappointed then he looks around and we see this in verses 34 through 42 but here's the question I want us to read that through the lens of and that is simply this what do you do when the things of your life don't turn out the way you thought they would or should you ever ask that question I'll give you a quick story it's nothing compared to
[time=2110] the real disappointments of life and my life since then but I remember in our double white trailer Jessica and I got married and we remodeled a double white trailer and we were joking last
[time=2119] night about all the colors we chose and just thinking about at least how far we've come with a design eye in a lot of areas of life but we were growing in so many ways weighed a lot of grilled cheese that was our go-to meal we were learning how to cook we were learning how to make brownies and I won't say who made these brownies this first time but we made a pan of brownies and it was a circular shape and we got it out and it was as hard as a rock and I got it out because I'm
[time=2142] just a knucklehead and tend to not make things better and make it worse but God redeems the story I got it out and I said hey it's a frisbee a homemade frisbee and I said hey go long and we
[time=2152] ended up just laughing about this frisbee brownie and so we just last night were laughing about our remember our frisbee brownie and we and I went out and I just said hey watch this and I got on our back porch we had some woods behind us and I threw it as far as I could I don't know the words I'm sure I killed a dog or something it's probably a terrible terrible idea but ever since then this disappointing thing that didn't turn out the way we thought it would has been a bright
[time=2177] spot of joy that we look back at and laugh and I know that doesn't even begin to compare to the real disappointment the real loss the real depression the real things that have happened in our lives since or in yours but boy it's a good reminder of what Jesus is doing in this story he wants to take the things that don't turn out the way you think they're going to and redeem them and use them for his glory let's read about how he does that towards the end of this passage here let's read verses 34 through 42 picking up verse 34 and he said to them where have you laid him and they
[time=2206] said to him Lord come and see the shortest verse in the Bible maybe the most potent verse 35 Jesus
[time=2213] wept so the Jew says see how he loved him but some of them said could not he who opened the eyes
[time=2221] with the blind man have also kept this man from dying verse 38 Jesus then moved deeply deeply
[time=2229] moved again came to the tomb and it was a cave and a stone lay against it foreshadowing even his own tomb and what would happen Jesus said take away the stone Martha the sister of the dead man said to him Lord by this time there will be an odor for he has been dead four days four days Jesus said
[time=2244] to her did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God so they took away the stone and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I thank you that you've heard me I knew that you always hear me but I said this on the count of the people standing around that they
[time=2260] may believe you sent me Jesus and the disappointed I don't know where you're at with disappointment
[time=2266] Philip Yancey is the one who said that the only thing that's worse than disappointment with God is disappointment without God maybe you're disappointed with God but the only thing that's going to make it worse is if you go through this disappointment without God and God shows up in disappointments and he uses it as a platform to build his purposes and that's
[time=2285] exactly what happens here he says where's he laid and then they say come see in the shortest verse in all the Bible why would Jesus weep when he knew what he was about to do why he wanted to walk
[time=2295] with them he loved them remember that theme we've looked at he wanted them to see how much he loved them he wanted to show this new command of how will my disciples love as I have loved them this is a
[time=2307] this is how I'm going to love you moment I'm going to walk with you even though I am the answer
[time=2313] and I know all the answers I'm going to weep with you I'm going to hurt with you I'm going to bear your burdens he cried knowing the ending here and here's what I've learned about Jesus in messy moments of pain what I will observe about Jesus is that he modeled relational investment as the
[time=2329] avenue to theological instruction let me apply that for you you ever had somebody in your weakest
[time=2336] moment say something like oh just Rome is 828 it's all going to work out for good or just believe
[time=2342] more just have more faith you know are they send you a verse first I'm saying these things are good truth is good but what I see Jesus and he is the truth he knew what he was about to do but he didn't start there he wept with him first and that became the avenue for him to be able to be the truth share the truth and love and so what I'm saying to you is when you walk with others in pain don't just drop the truth bomb right off the bat don't just try to correct them and instruct them but first say I will bear this burden with you I am so sorry I care so much I wish I could
[time=2373] make it go away but I am with you I am for you great relational principle if you've had a messy
[time=2380] relationship or two in your life try this one out Jesus models this relational investment that then gives way to theological instruction in his case he's living out being that instruction verse 36
[time=2392] they see how much he loved they said see how he loved him and then came the people with critical
[time=2398] spirits the naysayers you ever noticed that people with a built-in negative critical spirit they'll even use other people's pain to make their own points you ever had any people like that in their
[time=2409] life in your life and all I have Jesus did too because they say well this guy and there's a difference listen between Mary and Martha and these people they say well the guy who opened blind eyes definitely a hundred percent he could have stopped this what's his problem it was an accusation
[time=2423] Mary and Martha noticed that both of them said if you had been here lord this wouldn't have happened
[time=2430] but they expressed their belief imperfectly yes but they expressed their belief they ask a question they seek to understand in this case verse 37 it's an accusation they seek to condemn
[time=2440] they seek to tear down they seek to have a critical spirit and we're gonna have all of that in our life but you know what's intriguing to me what Jesus did about it there are times he called out that critical spirit actually more times than not he did but in this case he stayed focused on his mission which is those people he came to love and he just moved straight to what he's there to do I love that about Jesus he's so relational he's deeply moved again that's the next verse he's deeply moved again he cares about all the people grieving in all these different ways and then he says take away the stone and verse verse 39 in the King James you know what it says look it up I dare you it says he stinketh lord there would be an odor I like King James in this case he stinketh lord you can say that at
[time=2478] lunch to that person that needs to take their bath he stinketh and then Jesus reminds them again if you believe you're gonna see the glory of God did I not tell you that and then he prays out loud some of us will pray quietly and that's good and listen I'm not here to condemn you if you don't like praying in front of people that's that's totally fine it's part of your journey and growth but I love what Jesus demonstrates for us here he prays out loud he says God you already know we've already talked about this but I'm praying out loud so that those can around me can hear what a relationship with you looks like as I have a conversation with you and so maybe that's a good next step of growth for you maybe look to say a short prayer out loud at that next family gathering because what you're going to do is you're going to model what a conversation with God can look like what a powerful picture that Jesus shows us there and lastly in the best part we get there Jesus in the dead the last two verses we see what happens with Jesus and Lazarus Jesus in the dead in the verse 43 when he said these things he cried out with a loud voice Lazarus come out
[time=2533] the man who had died came out his hands and feet bound with linen strips and his face wrapped
[time=2539] with a cloth Jesus said to them notice who he talks to unbind him and let him go one preacher
[time=2547] from my childhood I can't remember who said this but talked about Lazarus and he says Lazarus come out that it's a good thing he didn't just say come out or all the graveyards would have emptied at once and I believe that because that's the power of my God but he's focused on Lazarus and he says Lazarus come out and he comes out and listen this is a new man given a new life but he's got grave
[time=2566] clothes on he still got the grave clothes on and that's how we walk around sometimes his sons and daughters of God he's given us a new life we're a new creation but we walk around with the grave
[time=2578] clothes of fear and the grave clothes of doubt and the grave clothes of condemnation and the grave
[time=2584] clothes of guilt and the grave clothes of shame and God sent me to tell you today it's time to drop
[time=2590] the grave clothes it's time to walk in the new life that God has given you it's time to loose those chains because in Jesus name he's defeated at all and as he said Lazarus come forth he says
[time=2601] to you it's time to come out it's time to come forth but notice how he says to do it he doesn't say
[time=2608] so Lazarus take take off all those grave clothes man what you doing he doesn't say Lazarus take off your grave clothes he looks around at all the people there remember the people that have surrounded Mary and Martha and he says guys go help him out help him take all that off he says
[time=2623] unbind him set him free remember I said we need each other Jesus shows us that in this passage
[time=2632] that we need each other if we're going to drop the grave clothes maybe you've been doing it alone it's time to do it not only with the Lord but with other people too and I love that part of this passage and I don't know where you're at today so we looked at these seven things I know God's shown you something new maybe as a believer a way you can implement this intentionality in your own life walking with others walking through life and challenges yourself but maybe some of you are ready to take that next step and God's challenger heart I want to ask you just to bow your heads and close your eyes and ask you this question it's the question that Jesus asked Martha do you believe
[time=2664] this do you believe this do you believe Jesus is who he says he is if you're a child of God today
[time=2673] what is he challenging you to do in walking with others and trusting him through your own pain and right now I just want to ask you right now if you would say man I've got a huge next step
[time=2684] in my life to trust God through some pain or walk with others would you raise your hand I'm going to pray for you in a moment I just want to give you that chance right now I see all of you praise God put your hands down some of you would say though today I don't know Jesus and I don't know if I were to die today I'd spend eternity with him the gospel is that we are all sinners and we all sinned and fall short of the glory of God but God we're dead in our trespasses and sins but God sent Jesus and Jesus was that ultimate sacrifice paying the price for our sin as our perfect sinless sacrifice and he rose again just like Lazarus came out of the grave Jesus did
[time=2715] he rose from the dead and defeated death hell in the grave he defeated your sin and your role is to receive that gift if it's a work God is doing in your heart or his Holy Spirit now surrender
[time=2726] trust him to save you not your grandma's faith not your obedience not your ability would you
[time=2732] cry out to God no matter what step God's leading you to take right now and ask him to save you believers praying for those who are doing so and praying for your next steps right now as we pray and pause hello black hawk family so glad you're with us today what an amazing day it has been to just
