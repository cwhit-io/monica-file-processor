[time=0] I'm glad that I've got a story to tell, even though we're in this series called Messy, and Messy is in the Gospel of John.
[time=7] So you can turn there with me.
[time=8] John chapter 13's where we'll be today.
[time=10] In this series, Messy, we're looking at relationships Jesus had with Messy people, and how Jesus engaged with them with intentionality, and we're hoping to identify with these people, and maybe learn some things from Jesus, and initiate some of those things in our lives.
[time=24] And I don't know about you, but when I look around, boy, isn't culture pretty Messy today.
[time=29] When I look around and I see the world around us, it's particularly difficult to try to live a Christian life where we're called to be light in dark places.
[time=38] That's our vision to light the one five, to be light in all of the dark places in our world.
[time=42] And I look around and I see a world where the centrality of truth is like, what is that?
[time=47] And I look at morality and it's become just relevant to individualized views and whatever works for you.
[time=55] And it feels such like an impossible task, doesn't it, to stand on truth, to be light, and to really to not cave into, and to not get sucked into, and to not get distracted by, and to not just get consumed by what culture, and what life, and what sin, and what mess is in our world, and even in us who come to church every Sunday, can I get a name in?
[time=78] But boy, I wanna tell you today, and I'm so thankful for passages just like today's passage.
[time=85] It's not just something that we are dealing with in our own era.
[time=90] This is something that the church over centuries of its history, going all the way back to when Jesus sat with the disciples, have dealt with over, and over, and over, and over again, where everything around them was crumbling, where everything around them was impossible to engage, where culture was messy, and it seemed so impossible to live out the call to be the church.
[time=113] And today, that's what I want us to look at.
[time=114] Jesus and the disciples, so look at John chapter 13 with me today.
[time=118] Jesus and the disciples, we're looking at Jesus and some group of people every single week.
[time=122] Jesus and disciples, John 13, one through 17s, where we're gonna be.
[time=126] The disciples were in the same kind of place that we often feel.
[time=129] They didn't even know what was coming.
[time=131] Listen, this is the night before Jesus was to deliver himself to be crucified, and he spends that evening with his disciples.
[time=137] They share a meal together.
[time=138] They know that things are about to change.
[time=140] Jesus has been telling them, but they don't really get it.
[time=142] They don't really understand the scope and the magnitude of all that was coming, but they knew everything around them was crumbling.
[time=148] They knew that all of these things that have felt so certain were about to shift, and it was a constant shifting, quick sand of life around them.
[time=157] Can you relate with the disciples?
[time=159] And boy, wouldn't it be nice to know what it is that we can hold onto and how it is that we can really stand on something firm when everything around us is shifting?
[time=167] Wouldn't you like to know a little of that?
[time=168] If you need a little of that, not for me today.
[time=170] All right, just to make sure we're all in the same page, and that's where the disciples were.
[time=174] That is where we are, and there's an old for him song.
[time=178] How many of you know for him taking you way back?
[time=181] Some of you all are going to think, man, how old is that dude, right?
[time=183] If you don't know for him, you don't know Christian music.
[time=185] Just telling him.
[time=187] There was an old song though that they were seeing, and it would go, [MUSIC]
[time=192] [MUSIC]
[time=194] How many of you remember that?
[time=195] Raise your hand if you remember that.
[time=196] If you don't, you need to look it up, it's awesome.
[time=198] That's what Jesus does though with his disciples, and that's what I believe today's passage is gonna do for all of us.
[time=204] It's gonna give us, listen, some building blocks.
[time=206] It's gonna give us some cornerstone essentials of Christianity, essentials of our faith that's gonna take us back to the basics.
[time=213] Listen, things that the world would distract us from.
[time=216] Things that we as believers who desire to be light, desire to stand on truth, desire to be the love and grace of God in a world that often makes it feel impossible to do it.
[time=225] We have to stay anchored in these cornerstone things.
[time=228] These shifts that Jesus gives his disciples in John chapter 13.
[time=233] So it is the last night before Jesus would deliver himself for all these messy sinners.
[time=237] He spends it with his disciples, and John is one of the best friends of Jesus.
[time=243] He knows them as good as anybody, and he gives his account, and that's what we're gonna read, but there are parallel accounts by people like Luke, and Luke's Gospel, and Luke 22, verses 24 through 30, we see that in this same time, in this same account, that the disciples, even in this pivotal, pivotal, high-magnitude moment, right?
[time=263] The night before Jesus would deliver himself to be crucified, they're acting like two-year-olds.
[time=269] You ever had those nights like, this is an important moment, and then the kids are just acting like two-year-olds, or kids, your parents are just acting like two-year-olds.
[time=277] Of the disciples that Luke 22 tells us, they're arguing over who's gonna be the greatest in this moment, in this same moment.
[time=284] And so Jesus, here's what he's found.
[time=285] He's come to this moment, and he finds proud hearts and messy feet, dirty feet, proud hearts.
[time=292] So what does Jesus do?
[time=294] He washes the dirty feet.
[time=297] That's the passage that we're looking at today, and it occurred to me this week, we're looking at Jesus and this group of people, right?
[time=303] Every single week, we're about halfway through this series, and we're spending three months in John's Gospel to do that.
[time=308] And it occurred to me that at this table in John chapter 13 is represented this entire series, just with the disciples.
[time=316] Think about it, here's some of the names that we've gone through already, and that we will go through.
[time=319] At this table was Jesus in disciples.
[time=322] Was Jesus in accusers?
[time=323] Was Jesus in religious people?
[time=325] Was Jesus in sinners?
[time=327] Was Jesus in the hurting?
[time=328] Was Jesus an outcast?
[time=329] Was Jesus and the disappointed?
[time=331] Was Jesus in traitors?
[time=333] Judas was at the table, as we'll see in a moment.
[time=335] Was Jesus in the broken?
[time=336] Was Jesus in the doubters?
[time=338] And Jesus washed the feet of all of these messy people.
[time=342] That's the passage that we're adding.
[time=345] Through this, we're gonna get back to some basics, some shifts.
[time=348] Jesus gives them kind of three shifts that are things we can anchor to when the world around us seems to be crumbling.
[time=354] I believe they're gonna help you.
[time=355] And here's those three shifts.
[time=356] Number one is there's a shift from selfishness to service.
[time=360] Write that down.
[time=361] Three shifts that Jesus gives.
[time=363] Number one is selfishness to service.
[time=365] And this comes from John chapter number 13.
[time=368] John chapter 13, the first five verses, we're gonna go through it, and I'm gonna give you these three shifts that are building blocks.
[time=373] And the first five verses will show you the shift from selfishness to service.
[time=378] We live in a selfish minded world where it's all about me.
[time=381] And it's part of why culture is such a mess these days.
[time=385] And this is something we can anchor to.
[time=386] So let's read about it together.
[time=387] You ready for the word today, Black Hawk?
[time=389] Let's read the first five verses of John 13.
[time=391] And we'll see this shift.
[time=393] Now, before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end, love them.
[time=406] During supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him, Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he had come from God and was going back to God, rose from supper.
[time=421] He laid aside his outer garments and taking a towel, tied it around his waist.
[time=426] He then poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
[time=435] And Jesus shows us the shift that is a huge part of the kingdom of God.
[time=438] I think we can anchor ourselves to a thing that we can often get distracted from in a world that's all about me, me, me, the shift from me to he.
[time=448] The shift from selfishness to service and putting other people first.
[time=453] And Jesus, the first three verses, he knew a few things.
[time=455] I love that you see that.
[time=456] In verse one, it says that Jesus knew.
[time=458] What did he know?
[time=459] Three things he knew led to what he would do in verses four and five.
[time=462] What he knew led to what he would do.
[time=463] And in verse one, he knew the hour had come.
[time=467] It was time for him to go back to the Father.
[time=468] He knew the time had come for him to deliver himself up for his mission to be fulfilled, that his life would end, that his ministry was coming to an end to this culmination of his purpose.
[time=477] And it's interesting in John's gospel, more than any of the other gospel writers.
[time=482] John gives this account of a heavenly timeline, I'll call it.
[time=486] If you wanna write a few down.
[time=487] Chapter two, verse four, chapter seven, verse 30, chapter eight, verse 20, chapter 12, 23, 13, one, that we just read, 17, one.
[time=495] These are a few places where you see a heavenly timeline.
[time=497] John's saying, Jesus knew the hour had come, or Jesus knew that God's timing, in essence, paraphrased here, it was at hand.
[time=505] And you see the heavenly timeline pictured by John over and over again, and Jesus knew that his time had come.
[time=511] I love the end of verse one, but he loved them to the end.
[time=515] Aren't you glad he did?
[time=517] Jesus loved them to the end.
[time=519] You should be glad I was not Jesus.
[time=521] I'm not sure I would have loved all you knuckleheads and me knuckleheads to the end, but Jesus loved them to the end.
[time=529] Even while they're arguing over who's gonna be the greatest, even while they're missing the point, even while they continue on doing all these things that they know they shouldn't do.
[time=538] Verse two, he also knew a second thing that Jesus knew he knew he was gonna get betrayed.
[time=541] At the table was Judas is scary at him.
[time=543] We see that he's Simon's son.
[time=545] Two times in this chapter you see that, and it's the only place in the Bible really, that you see Simon mentioned.
[time=550] We don't know much about him, but it reminds us that Judas, listen, he was a real person.
[time=554] A lot of times we dehumanize Judas.
[time=558] A lot of times we just think that he's just this pawn of Satan, this terrible guy, I would never be anything like that.
[time=563] But these passages remind us, we are Judas.
[time=566] Judas had a father.
[time=569] Judas walked and talked with Jesus.
[time=572] He went to the University of Jesus, but he didn't know God.
[time=577] And he became used by Satan.
[time=579] And we'll look at Judas some more.
[time=580] But Jesus knew that he would betray him.
[time=582] And in verse two there, put Satan and put it into the heart.
[time=586] The original language for the word put is literally to throw.
[time=590] And it makes me think of Ephesians chapter six and verse 16 where Satan throws fiery darts at us.
[time=596] That's a relevant passage for us.
[time=597] And it's the same kind of visualization that we get here.
[time=600] He had put, he had thrown into the heart these darts, these lies into Judas's heart.
[time=606] Jesus knew it was happening, but yet Judas was still at the table and Jesus still washed the feet of Judas.
[time=612] He knew all those things.
[time=613] Another thing in new verse three, he knew the father had given all things into his hands.
[time=617] You see that in verse three?
[time=618] He knew, listen, think about what he did.
[time=620] The hands that held the universe.
[time=622] The hands of the Alpha and the Omega.
[time=625] The hands of the beginning and the end.
[time=628] The hands of the king of kings and the lord of lords.
[time=631] The hands in which God has put everything.
[time=634] The creator and the holder and the sustainer and the one who holds all power and authority over all of the universe.
[time=641] Jesus knew who he was.
[time=644] So what did those hands do?
[time=645] They picked up a towel.
[time=648] It's the point of the passage and it's an astounding point to think that the creator of the universe, with the hands into which God has given all things, all authority, all power has been given to him that he would pick up a towel, but that he did.
[time=661] He picked up the towel and he went to serve.
[time=664] And as we watch Jesus serve, we see the shift that's going on.
[time=667] And because of those things that he knew, he knew the end of the story.
[time=670] He knew how this was gonna end.
[time=671] Yet those hands picked up a towel.
[time=673] What he knew ended up with now what he does in verses four and five because it became an action for him.
[time=679] Because of what he knew, he picked up a towel.
[time=682] He washed the disciples' feet.
[time=683] Now it's important to know that not only would a rabbi not wash people's feet, the students of a rabbi like Jesus would never wash the feet of people.
[time=691] It's a common practice, it's a hospitality thing.
[time=694] That people's feet would get washed when they come in.
[time=696] But listen, this would be the task of the lowest ranked servants in a home.
[time=702] It would never be the students of a rabbi.
[time=705] Absolutely would never be a rabbi.
[time=707] It would be unheard of, unthinkable, inappropriate.
[time=710] All the adjectives you can think of that say it shouldn't happen is exactly what would be the case for a rabbi.
[time=716] Much less a rabbi who is the son of God, the king of kings, the Lord of lords and who's not just a teacher but his lord.
[time=723] But he picks up a towel and everybody gasps.
[time=726] Everybody says, what is he doing?
[time=729] And Peter's gonna ask that 'cause leave it to Peter, right?
[time=731] We'll get there in just a minute.
[time=732] But before we do, that's what he does.
[time=733] He picks up the towel and he shows us what love is.
[time=737] You know, love is sometimes a feeling.
[time=739] Look at your spouse if you're married or you're with that significant other.
[time=742] Say, sometimes I feel love, let her know that.
[time=745] Tell him, say, sometimes I feel love.
[time=747] But you know, in our culture today, a lot of times we just think love is a feeling, don't we?
[time=751] Because love, listen, if it's a feeling, it comes and it goes and it goes up and it goes down.
[time=756] And we've learned if you've been married long enough or if you try to do the whole love thing, even if you're single and you've got relationships with people, loving people is difficult.
[time=763] And what you learn is that love is way more a choice and an action than it is a feeling.
[time=767] Feelings go up and feelings go down and they come and they go, so sometimes love is something you feel.
[time=773] All the time love is an action.
[time=774] All the time love is something you do.
[time=776] And that is exactly what Jesus shows as he picks up this towel.
[time=779] He shows that love is an action.
[time=782] He served them because he loved them all the way to the end.
[time=786] And I'm glad Jesus let his love turn into service.
[time=790] And today I'm gonna tell you, it's a hard time to be a leader.
[time=793] And you're a leader, did you know that?
[time=795] You're leading your home, you're leading your business, you influence other people, some of your CEOs, some of your mid-level management, some of you are not in any kind of management, but you manage your life and people watch how you manage your life, therefore you have influence, therefore you are a leader.
[time=807] And it has been a very difficult season to be a leader, period.
[time=811] Can I get a name in from all of you who know what I'm talking about?
[time=814] In the church, it's been a very difficult season to be a leader.
[time=817] And pastors in our city, we've often talked about just what church is becoming, the new normals and all these discussions that are going on.
[time=826] And one of the things that we've talked about is that there kinda can be this church carousel, we've called it sometimes, or a church buffet, where people just kinda hop around.
[time=833] And one of the most common phrases that I've heard over the course of the last few years is, hey, pastor, we just haven't been able to find a church that meets our needs.
[time=844] Every time I hear it, I cringe a little.
[time=849] David Jeremiah was here for the 50th anniversary and he said about that phrase, I'll never forget it.
[time=853] He said, I have a holy hatred for that phrase.
[time=856] Still remember him saying, I do too.
[time=858] And listen, if you said that to me, look, I still love you.
[time=860] I'm not mad at you.
[time=861] I already forgave you and moved on, but you did make me cringe.
[time=863] And here's why, because listen, church, if we are really going to be the church of Jesus Christ, we are not called to be spiritual consumers.
[time=872] We are called to be spiritual contributors.
[time=875] We are not called to come to church or be the church to have our needs met.
[time=880] We are called to come to church.
[time=883] We are called to be light, to be the hands and feet, the body of Jesus, to meet the needs of others.
[time=889] And in so doing, point people to the only hope in this dying and decaying culture and world that we live in, and his name is Jesus Christ.
[time=897] (congregation applauding) So let us be that kind of church.
[time=901] Let us be the kind of church that picks up the towel.
[time=904] And what I've found is, listen, and when you, here's what happens, some of you are doing this.
[time=908] You're still living it, you're not convinced.
[time=909] So I got another visual.
[time=910] Some of you, this is the bowl of your life.
[time=912] You ready?
[time=913] Here's the bowl of your life.
[time=914] And you're trying to fill it up just, and it's like trying to fill it up with this imaginary container of water.
[time=919] And you're just trying to fill it up, trying to get your needs met, trying to make it about you, trying to have a church that checks these boxes, and trying to walk with Jesus, and trying to find that devotion, and study the Word of God, and listen to that sermon.
[time=931] And boy, it's just not speaking to me, and I'm trying to fill it up.
[time=934] And you're trying to fill your own self, and you're trying to look to maybe all these things, good things even sometimes, but certainly bad things.
[time=942] And what you end up doing is you try to have your needs met, and that is your focus.
[time=946] You are trying to fill up a bowl with a hole.
[time=951] With an imaginary jug that has nothing in it.
[time=954] So don't be the guy or gal.
[time=958] I'm looking at you.
[time=960] Don't be the guy or the gal, trying to fill the bowl with a hole.
[time=966] Here's what you'll find.
[time=969] The more you grab a basin of water, the more you pick up the towel, and you strive to serve others, and meet the needs of others, the more you'll find that God fills you up to.
[time=984] Go on a mission trip.
[time=987] I'll talk a little bit about what we're doing tonight.
[time=988] I'll give you an opportunity to come with us tonight.
[time=990] I'm gonna give you, I don't just wanna talk about grabbing a towel and give you a chance to grab a towel, even today, for some of you.
[time=995] Go on a mission trip, serve somewhere, serve in a ministry, and here's what you'll find.
[time=999] You go to be a blessing, right?
[time=1000] And that you should, and that you are.
[time=1002] But when I go on a mission trip, or I serve somewhere, or I grab a towel, what I find is I go to be a blessing, and I end up getting overflowed with blessings of God.
[time=1014] He does more in me than I think even does through me, but he still does something through a knucklehead like me.
[time=1019] I say, let's grab a towel.
[time=1021] If Jesus could do it, then I think we can too, and I'm thankful that he's called us to that.
[time=1025] 'Cause listen, as a part of the church, serving is not just something we do.
[time=1030] Serving is who we are.
[time=1031] Throughout all of history, and all of the pages of history of the early church to now, this is what has set apart the church of Jesus Christ.
[time=1040] Let me prove it to you.
[time=1040] A few examples of this.
[time=1042] Francis Schaeffer said that the love of the church is the church's most effective apologetic.
[time=1048] It means it proves who we are more than anything we do is our love, and it's shown the most through times of service.
[time=1054] Historian, Eberhardt Arnold, who wrote a lot about what the church was known for, studied what the church was known for, and how it was set apart in society and in culture, wrote this.
[time=1064] Most astounding to the outside observer about the church was the extent to which poverty was overcome in the vicinity of the communities.
[time=1072] Christians spent more money in the streets than the followers of other religions spent in their temples.
[time=1080] Whoa, that fires me up.
[time=1081] I wanna be known as that kind of church, where people look at Black Hawk and they say, "You know what?
[time=1086] "I may not agree with everything those knuckleheads think, "or I may not buy into all of the Jesus stuff, "or all of the scripture truths that they hold to, "but I sure can't deny that they like the one five.
[time=1097] "I sure can't deny that our communities better "because that church body, that community of believers "are there.
[time=1103] "I sure can't deny that they sure do love loud." And then people who are far from God get close to us and they see something different in us, and we become known by our love for our community, even when it doesn't make sense, and listen, even when you don't feel like it.
[time=1120] How many of you didn't, let's just speak.
[time=1121] Y'all ready to be real?
[time=1122] Can we be real?
[time=1124] I'm gonna be real, okay, no one else wants to be real, but I'll be real.
[time=1126] How many of you didn't want to go to church today, but you drug yourself here anyway?
[time=1130] All right, there we go.
[time=1131] Now we got some honest people in the room.
[time=1133] Here's what I've learned.
[time=1134] When you feel like it the least and you do it anyway, those are the times that God just overflows you with the blessings of the Lord, the most.
[time=1143] The same thing is true of serving, not just coming to church, but being the church, being the hands and the feet of Jesus, and what I have learned is that when you serve, God changes lives, period.
[time=1154] But I've learned even more than that, that when you serve, yes, God changes lives, but usually the first life that He changes the most is my own, and I want to be changed by Jesus in that way.
[time=1164] So I want to give you an application question for service, this shift, this cornerstone that we can hold to in this changing, quick, sand-filled world that we live in today, a decaying, declining culture, selfishness to service.
[time=1177] Here's an application question.
[time=1179] This week, I've tried this this week, and it rocked my world, I'm going to be honest with you, so I want to challenge you to do the same thing.
[time=1185] I want to challenge you to look for needs that you can meet.
[time=1187] No doubt, you can't meet every need.
[time=1189] There's going to be needs everywhere, and you see needs, and it's like, well, I could do that one, I could do that one, I could do that one.
[time=1194] But I want you every time you see a need and say, you know, I really could meet that need, I just want you to do one simple thing.
[time=1200] Every need, it's important, every need.
[time=1202] I want to challenge you to pause and say, God, is this a need you want me to meet today?
[time=1210] I tried this this week, and I'm a little embarrassed to tell you about my results, but I kind of can't challenge you to do it and be the hypocrite who won't tell you my real results, so here's my real results.
[time=1218] Here's what I found.
[time=1219] Every time I paused and I saw a need that I could meet, and said, God, is this one you want me to meet today?
[time=1225] Almost always.
[time=1226] The needs that the spirit of God really prompted me towards were the needs that, I don't even want to say it out loud, that felt beneath me, the needs that that day felt like such an inconvenience, the needs that that day felt like I do not have time to do that, not that, Lord.
[time=1247] Almost every time, and the ones that are just like, well, I thought God would call me to that.
[time=1251] It was like, nope, I want you to do that one.
[time=1253] And I'm like, really, is that one?
[time=1254] Are you sure it's going to take so much time?
[time=1256] I whined a little bit this week, I don't like whining.
[time=1260] We don't even allow whining in our homes, we don't like it, but I whine, that was a hypocrite and whine, because God showed me, and what he did is he put me in these positions to remember that I had to be served by a safe shirt who picked up a towel.
[time=1275] And I'm never too good to do any one thing.
[time=1277] And God opened doors of conversation, invitations to our stuff that's coming up for our fall kickoffs and just did a work in me this week.
[time=1284] So I challenge you to do the same thing.
[time=1286] Pause every time and ask God, is this one you'd have me to meet?
[time=1289] I don't know if you'll find the same thing that I found.
[time=1290] Maybe that was just my, because I'm way behind you spiritually.
[time=1293] Your spiritual giant, so your lesson will be way more advanced than mine probably, but you'll have a spiritual lesson in this, and here's what I want to challenge you to say.
[time=1300] I want to challenge you to say, I got this one.
[time=1303] When God says that one, I want you to say, all right, I got this one.
[time=1307] Look at your neighbor and tell him that, say, I got this one.
[time=1310] I got this one.
[time=1311] That's what I want to challenge you to do.
[time=1312] This week in parents, listen, oh, one more thing, this is so important.
[time=1316] You got to do it with the right motives.
[time=1317] The right motives lead to the right motions.
[time=1320] The wrong motives, even if you're doing the right motions, will lead you down bad pass.
[time=1325] So what that means is, when you're doing these things, when you say, God, I got this one, don't do this.
[time=1330] Hashtag, I got this one, blessed or whatever.
[time=1339] No, no, no, don't, you missed the point.
[time=1342] Don't show anybody.
[time=1344] You're not doing it for Instagram.
[time=1346] You're not doing it for Facebook.
[time=1348] We're doing it for the Lord because the Spirit prompted it.
[time=1351] So put the phone away and say, God, this is for you, I don't know what you want to show me.
[time=1356] But I want to do it because you said so, I just want to be obedient.
[time=1361] Let that be our heart this week in parents.
[time=1363] Oh, man, go ahead, celebrate it.
[time=1364] You want to celebrate, let's do it, let's do it right.
[time=1366] Let's do it, that means you're in.
[time=1368] Don't clap if you don't mean it because God's going to change your life.
[time=1371] He's going to rock your world this week in parents.
[time=1372] Listen, I want my kids, if you're a parent in the room, just a side note for you.
[time=1376] I want my kids to want to serve Jesus.
[time=1379] I want my kids to be passionate about serving Jesus so bad.
[time=1384] And man, I'm telling you, there have been so many times where I forget the truth that my very first ministry is at home.
[time=1391] And so let this be a reminder for all of you that your families, that the people that God has given you influence over in your life, and they might not be blood-kinned to you, but you have family, God has given you family, and you've got to start at home.
[time=1402] And listen, there's two things that I've noticed as I've watched our kids.
[time=1406] If you want your kids to be passionate about serving Jesus, number one, they need to see mom and dad, they need to see grandma and grandpa, they need to see whoever you are influencer in their lives, they need to see you modeling it even when you don't feel like it, and they know you don't feel like it, and they know the week that you've had, but they see you show up and do it anyway.
[time=1423] That's number one.
[time=1425] Number two, I believe they need to see us have times to be able to do it as a family.
[time=1430] Your kids don't want to just watch you serve, let them get their hands dirty, and listen, they'll make it take longer.
[time=1436] Yes, you could just do it yourself, and 10 times faster, but you'll miss that teaching moment.
[time=1442] I've got a good opportunity for you tonight.
[time=1444] We're going canvassing tonight.
[time=1446] In case you haven't heard, that's six o'clock, we're meeting here at the church, and we're going out and we're inviting people to kind of do two things.
[time=1451] August the 15th, that's next Sunday, by the way.
[time=1452] Yes, it's mid-August next week.
[time=1454] We are having our big block party.
[time=1456] It's our big fall kickoff.
[time=1457] We're having a seeds group from Idaho.
[time=1458] They're gonna be in both of our services nine and 11.
[time=1461] You don't want to miss that kind of a family service.
[time=1463] Kids in the room is gonna be an awesome Sunday morning set of services nine and 11.
[time=1467] And then from four to six, we're having a block party.
[time=1469] The first 400 kids, I made a big boo boo.
[time=1471] I said, "Everybody eat free?" And that's not true, sorry.
[time=1474] There's food trucks, and it's the first 400 kids that eat free.
[time=1477] So yeah, I made a boo boo and said that to you guys before.
[time=1480] It's gonna be, everything else is free.
[time=1482] We got a dunk tank.
[time=1483] I'm gonna be in a dunk tank.
[time=1484] I don't know how I always get recruited for those things, but yeah, come dunk me.
[time=1487] Come dunk coach Davis and our state champion coach.
[time=1490] I think it's gonna be in the dunk tank.
[time=1491] We're gonna have a blast.
[time=1492] We're gonna have games.
[time=1493] We're gonna have all kinds of stuff.
[time=1494] Four to six outside.
[time=1496] And then we're gonna come in for a family concert at six p.m.
[time=1499] That is August the 15th.
[time=1500] And then on August the 22nd, we're having one service at 10 a.m.
[time=1503] We're gonna all get together one church, one service.
[time=1506] That Sunday only, 10 a.m.
[time=1507] We're gonna have an outdoor baptism.
[time=1509] We're gonna start in here, have a shortened abbreviated service, and then we're gonna have time for people getting baptized to get ready.
[time=1514] We're gonna go out.
[time=1515] We're gonna end our day with outdoor baptism.
[time=1517] Some of you need to get baptized.
[time=1518] Some of you though may need to join us tonight.
[time=1520] We're canvassing the one five here and inviting people, we've got materials, and we're just gonna go out and invite people to these opportunities.
[time=1526] This is a great opportunity.
[time=1527] My family's gonna be here.
[time=1528] Maybe you should come join us tonight at six o'clock.
[time=1531] That's just one example of how you could pick up a towel.
[time=1533] A simple thing could turn into people hearing the gospel and be in change forever and ever and ever because we're willing to move and shift from selfishness to service.
[time=1543] And then it occurred to me, as we think of all these things, as we start at home, I look at Jesus and Jesus got on the floor to serve Judas, the traitor, the betrayer.
[time=1554] But Jesus got on the cross to serve you and me.
[time=1558] I'm glad that we don't have a savior who tells us what to do, but one that shows us what he means.
[time=1564] Here's another shift, another cornerstone we can hold on to in a shifting, changing world.
[time=1568] The second one is simply this.
[time=1570] My capability to God's cleansing.
[time=1572] This is an identity thing.
[time=1574] The outward part of this started with the service.
[time=1576] Now let's go to the inside that motivates the outward changes and the impacts that we have with our hands.
[time=1581] Let's go to the heart thing.
[time=1582] My capability to God's cleansing.
[time=1585] This is chapter 13, picking up where we left off, verses six through 11.
[time=1588] This is when Peter's turn to get his feet washed, come on.
[time=1591] And imagine that Peter would be the one to say, well, maybe all of us are thinking, but he's all about his way, his capabilities, but Jesus has to teach him something and maybe he wants to teach you the same thing.
[time=1601] Let's read about it, verses six through 11.
[time=1603] He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, "Lord, do you wash my feet?" Jesus answered him, "What I am doing, you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand." Trust me, says.
[time=1614] Verse eight, Peter said to him, "You shall never wash my feet." Listen, the original language is even stronger than what our English can capture here.
[time=1620] It's more like if we were to say, there's no way in the world, Jesus, that you will ever wash my feet, not ever, no, never.
[time=1628] That's kind of Peter language.
[time=1630] Some of you are Peter knucklehead kind of people too.
[time=1632] Well, that's kind of what he's saying.
[time=1633] So Jesus answered him, "If I do not wash you, you have no share with me." Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head." You see his progression.
[time=1645] Jesus said to him, "The one who has bathed," underlined that word.
[time=1648] "The one who has bathed," different word than wash.
[time=1652] "Does not need to wash except for his feet, but is completely clean," underlined that.
[time=1657] It's completely clean.
[time=1659] And you are clean, but not every one of you, why, but for he knew that one was to betray him.
[time=1665] And that's why he said, "Not all of you are clean." When it comes to Judas, by the way, we try to look at Judas a little more later in this series specifically, but you know that we believe firmly, John 10, nothing can snatch us from the Father.
[time=1679] So you can't lose your salvation, but you sure can't fake it.
[time=1682] There are Judas' everywhere.
[time=1685] Judas heard from Jesus himself.
[time=1687] He was in all these miracles.
[time=1690] He knew all the right things to say.
[time=1691] There's people even like that today where we just sit in church, we look at the part, but what Jesus is teaching Peter about is that there's not this fake it, look the part Christianity.
[time=1702] You have no share with me tells Peter unless I wash you.
[time=1706] That means salvation is a work of God.
[time=1709] And if we try to do it ourselves, we get nowhere.
[time=1714] We can fake it, we can try to look the part and people come to church every single week who try their best to look the part, but you cannot be good enough.
[time=1723] And that's what Jesus is teaching Peter.
[time=1725] That's what Jesus is teaching us.
[time=1727] Peter saying, "No Lord, you're not doing that.
[time=1728] We're gonna do it in my ways, my capability." As some of you are doing Christianity based on your capability and I came to tell you, it will lead you nowhere but straight to hell.
[time=1737] Jesus is the way, the truth and the life.
[time=1742] Our capability will never get us to the spot where we are truly cleansed and bathed.
[time=1748] And as Jesus said, completely clean.
[time=1751] I wanna break this apart for a few minutes with you because it's such an important identity thing.
[time=1755] Peter wants to know why.
[time=1756] He says, "Why are you washing me, Lord?" How many of you are that person?
[time=1760] You got that kid, the why kid.
[time=1761] Why, why, why, why, why, why?
[time=1763] Well, I was, again, you already don't up to some things.
[time=1766] Come on.
[time=1767] I was that kid.
[time=1769] Why?
[time=1769] Why, dad?
[time=1770] Why mom?
[time=1771] Why we gotta go there?
[time=1772] What time are we doing?
[time=1773] I was that kid all the time my parents were hearing.
[time=1775] They all test.
[time=1776] I'm the why, why, why, why?
[time=1777] Peter was that guy and he's asking why.
[time=1779] Jesus says, "You're not gonna get it now.
[time=1780] I'm gonna show you, trust me.
[time=1782] Go on this journey with me.
[time=1783] I'm gonna teach you why." And then he kind of gets it wrong again.
[time=1786] But then, and he says, "Don't, you'll never." That's a bad thing to say to the Lord, by the way.
[time=1790] You'll never do this, Lord.
[time=1792] I told the Lord I'd never be a pastor.
[time=1794] And he's got a good sense of humor.
[time=1798] That's the Lord.
[time=1799] Just remember that.
[time=1800] And Peter does this, but what he wanted to teach Peter is that salvation and this total cleansing, completely clean, is the work of Jesus and Jesus alone.
[time=1809] And if you wanna share with him, if you wanna be a part of his family, that means that this is God's work.
[time=1814] Salvation is God's work.
[time=1816] It's not your capability.
[time=1817] It's God's cleansing.
[time=1818] There's a shift in thinking for this.
[time=1820] And oftentimes we forget that we are dead.
[time=1823] You know what dead people can do about?
[time=1824] Their state, nothing.
[time=1827] We are dead in our sins and our transgressions.
[time=1830] But God sent forth his son.
[time=1834] And he washed our feet.
[time=1835] And he gave us this opportunity to be totally bathed and cleansed.
[time=1839] That word bathed is to bathe all over.
[time=1841] It's in perfect tense, which means it's complete.
[time=1843] It's whole, it's forever, it's finished.
[time=1846] That's the bathed all over.
[time=1847] That's the completely clean that Jesus was teaching about.
[time=1850] And when he used that different word, listen, it's a different word from wash, like washing their feet.
[time=1853] They would've gone, oh wait, he's not talking about my filthy little toes, my piggies anymore.
[time=1860] What's Jesus talking about here?
[time=1861] He's not talking about my nasty feet.
[time=1863] He's talking about something a lot bigger.
[time=1864] And he sure was.
[time=1865] And that's what he wants us to see together here today.
[time=1869] And here's the thing, we all often will know that Jesus forgives.
[time=1872] When we think of salvation, we know Jesus forgives.
[time=1874] And aren't you glad that past, present, and future, that all of the junk that's in my closet, all of the problems, all of the sin, all of the messiness that Jesus Christ forgives us of all of our sins.
[time=1889] Is anybody glad of that in this place today?
[time=1891] [AMEN] We should be.
[time=1893] But oh, I came to share with you what Jesus was sharing.
[time=1896] Listen, please don't miss this.
[time=1898] Sometimes we remember that Jesus forgives our sin, but we forget the other part of salvation that is very clear in scripture and I wanna show it to you.
[time=1906] And it's what Jesus is showing Peter, that Jesus doesn't just forgive us of our sin, but Jesus cleanses us from all unrighteousness.
[time=1915] You got any unrighteousness?
[time=1917] Well, if you're a child of God, you don't have, it's not who you are anymore.
[time=1921] And that's what Jesus is teaching Peter.
[time=1923] And we cannot miss this total cleansing that happens here.
[time=1926] Because listen, love friends, don't miss this part.
[time=1929] Maybe you've misunderstood salvation.
[time=1931] And maybe God's gonna show it to you clearly in a way you've never seen it before today.
[time=1934] So don't miss the voice of God in the prompting of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1937] Listen, if Jesus only forgives us, then we would still walk around, carrying all of the dirt, all of the shame, all of the guilt, all of the condemnation, all of the defilement, all of the hidden sin.
[time=1954] It would still be who we are, yet Jesus would have just forgiven us of it.
[time=1958] And that's great.
[time=1959] And I'm glad God would forgive us of that, but it would still be who I am, and it would still be my ball and chain that I carry around every single day.
[time=1967] And some of you like Lazarus was given this new life, but you walk around with grave clothes on, because you don't realize that with salvation doesn't just come forgiveness.
[time=1975] It comes a cleansing where you're totally washed clean of all of those things that you're still trying to drag around today.
[time=1982] God wants you to know that salvation is so much more filling, but it starts with knowing, listen, you're filthy.
[time=1989] Our righteousness is as filthy rags.
[time=1993] We have all sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[time=1998] We need to be cleansed, but our capabilities cannot cleanse us.
[time=2003] This is what Jesus is teaching, Peter, is what he's teaching you.
[time=2007] And for all of you, it's what you've done.
[time=2009] You're dirty because of what you've done.
[time=2012] But listen, some of you, you feel filthy, and you feel shame, and you feel condemnation, because of what's been done to you.
[time=2019] Some of you have been violated.
[time=2021] Some of you have had others do filthy, nasty, horrific things to you, either sexually, or mentally, or emotionally, or physically, or verbally.
[time=2031] And some of you, my heart breaks for you because you're carrying around everything that you have done.
[time=2036] And you're carrying around everything that's been done to you.
[time=2039] But I came to tell you today that with coming apart of the family of God, being totally cleansed is not just that God forgives all the stuff in your past and all of your sin, but he totally watches you clean from head to toe, and you don't have to carry it around any more.
[time=2057] It's not who you are in Jesus' name.
[time=2060] It may be what you did.
[time=2062] It may be what was done to you, but it's not who you are in Jesus' name anymore.
[time=2067] Today he cleansed you, he's forgiven you, and he loves you, and he's done it by picking up a towel to meet you where you are.
[time=2075] That's salvation.
[time=2076] You thought salvation was good.
[time=2078] Maybe you've been missing how good it truly is.
[time=2080] And if you don't believe me today, here's the thing.
[time=2083] Because Jesus forgives and cleanses, you've got a new identity that watches you clean all that stuff.
[time=2088] Let me show you in Scripture.
[time=2089] 1 John 1, 9.
[time=2091] If we confess our sins, he's faithful and just to two things.
[time=2093] Forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[time=2098] What does that mean?
[time=2100] What does that mean, pastor?
[time=2101] I'm glad you asked.
[time=2102] Two more.
[time=2102] Psalm 103, verse 12.
[time=2104] As far as the East is from the West, so far does he remove our transgressions from us.
[time=2111] Hebrews 10, verse 17.
[time=2113] I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.
[time=2118] Now do you believe me?
[time=2120] Now do you see it?
[time=2122] This is how God looks at you.
[time=2123] He looks at you, and yes, you're still a sinner.
[time=2125] Do you still sinned?
[time=2126] How many of you sinned this morning?
[time=2128] Okay, you're gonna do it later today too, because you're still in this flesh suit.
[time=2132] But when God looks at you, he doesn't see all that was done by you or to you, he sees the spotless lamb of God.
[time=2140] He sees the cleansing blood of Jesus over your life.
[time=2145] And I want you to believe that today.
[time=2147] So today, as you think of this, and this is what overflows, how do I be holy, pastor?
[time=2151] You realize that God sees you as holy, and you realize that your identity can now overflow into what you do, who you are, becomes what you do.
[time=2158] You can't help it, but you've been doing it backwards and trying to do it first so that God will love you, and it'll never work.
[time=2164] Maybe it's time to realize how God goes about this.
[time=2166] Your forgiven past, present, and future, and you are cleansed.
[time=2171] Listen, if you're a child of God, if you're saved by Jesus, you are not forgiven and dirty.
[time=2176] You are forgiven and clean.
[time=2181] That's who you are as a child of God.
[time=2185] Who you were is not who you are in Christ.
[time=2190] Can I get an amen?
[time=2192] Let me give you a third shift.
[time=2193] This is an identity shift that leads you to hopefully some of the selfishness shifting to service.
[time=2198] But the last one, Jesus talks about knowing to going.
[time=2201] What you know leading you to do something with it, not just being a hearer of the word, but being a doer of the word.
[time=2205] Versus 12 through 17, Jesus ties us together here.
[time=2209] Verse 12, he says, when he had washed their feet and he had put on his outer garments and resumed his place, he said to them, do you understand what I've done to you?
[time=2216] You call me teacher and Lord, and you're right for so I am.
[time=2220] If I then, your Lord and teacher have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.
[time=2227] For I have given you an example that you also should do just as I have done to you.
[time=2232] Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.
[time=2239] Don't miss this, if you know these things, knowing, then blessed are you if you do them, this is the going.
[time=2247] If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.
[time=2250] Jesus taught them something by example.
[time=2252] Verse 12, he says, do you understand what I've done to you?
[time=2255] Do you see it?
[time=2255] I taught you something, and not only did he just teach it with his words, he showed them.
[time=2259] Love that we have that kind of a savior, but a lot of times in Christianity, we think it's just about what we know, but Jesus is saying it doesn't do you any good to know something if you don't go and do something with what you know.
[time=2268] And that's what he's teaching his disciples to do.
[time=2270] Versus 13 through 15, he reminds them, I'm greater than you, I'm the Lord and the teacher.
[time=2276] And I did this, I picked up the towel.
[time=2279] I'm pretty sure someone will use the towel.
[time=2282] He said, I picked up the towel.
[time=2283] Now you pick up the towel.
[time=2285] Now you do what I have done.
[time=2287] He says to them, I've given you an example so that you also should do as I have done to you.
[time=2292] This is why we always say at Black Hawk, we don't just want to talk about what Jesus said, we want to do what Jesus did.
[time=2297] Jesus didn't just give us instruction, he gave us examples and models.
[time=2301] We don't have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with us in our weaknesses because he's walked where we have walked, yet he did it without sin.
[time=2307] He knows what we're going through and he's shown us how to walk through it.
[time=2311] We can't separate the message of Jesus from the methods of Jesus.
[time=2315] And Jesus picked up the towel.
[time=2318] And he's teaching his disciples that.
[time=2319] And verse 17, if you know these things, you're blessed if you do them.
[time=2324] There's a great capture of this concept from the seeds team.
[time=2327] Mike Rowland's right over here, our care pastor, his son Gary leads a team and the seeds team, our New York team went out to New York and they shared their faith.
[time=2335] And I got to look at a lot of the curriculum that they looked at and one of the best parts of the curriculum to me that just really hit me so hard was this distinction about discipleship, about making disciples.
[time=2346] And here's what the statement was, that there's a difference between knowledge-based discipleship and obedience-based discipleship.
[time=2355] And I've noticed a trend in society and especially in the church culture today that we just think, just fill up another notebook.
[time=2361] And if we just know enough and if we know the word and so we should, Jesus was the word, he kind of exuded it.
[time=2366] How could he not?
[time=2367] He is the word of God and we should know the word of God and we're always gonna preach it.
[time=2371] And every life group's gonna have biblical truth, relational authenticity and mission or living, but it starts with biblical truth because we're called to know.
[time=2378] So that's such an important thing.
[time=2379] But listen, there's this trend going on to think that if I just know a little more and I can one up the next person in my knowledge and I can't be a hypocrite 'cause I went to school for all this, I think it's important.
[time=2390] But there's this trend that says, if I just know a little bit more, that's true depth, that's true spiritual maturity.
[time=2396] Not according to Jesus and not according to what I see from his life.
[time=2400] He says, it's not about a knowledge-based discipleship.
[time=2403] It's an obedience-based discipleship.
[time=2405] If you know those things, you're blessed.
[time=2407] If you do those things, listen, my friends, spiritual maturity is not intellectual, it is transformational.
[time=2414] Spiritual maturity is not knowing more things.
[time=2418] God would much listen.
[time=2419] If you don't think you're smart enough, hear this.
[time=2421] God would much rather have ignorance on fire than intelligence on ice.
[time=2427] And God has called you today to know that true spiritual maturity is transformational, not intellectual, it's transformational in that the great commission.
[time=2437] Did you know the literal translation of go and make disciples?
[time=2439] It's literally as you are going, make disciples.
[time=2442] It's transformational is spiritual maturity because it infiltrates everything that we do in our daily lives.
[time=2448] This is what Jesus is teaching his disciples because knowledge puffs up but love builds up.
[time=2452] So I want to give you this question.
[time=2454] Here's the question that I want to tie us together with today.
[time=2457] So how does what you know cause you to grow and change how you go?
[time=2462] Let's tweak it a little bit.
[time=2465] How should what you know cause you to grow and change how you go?
[time=2471] How can you pick up a towel this week?
[time=2473] Maybe it's branching a life group.
[time=2475] Maybe our life group is we got a good problem.
[time=2477] It's a good and bad problem.
[time=2478] We got so many people wanting to be in life groups.
[time=2480] We don't have enough spaces.
[time=2482] And so we need some of you to start groups.
[time=2484] We need some of you to get uncomfortable and branch your group.
[time=2486] Yeah, I said it and turn it into a place where you can spread out and you can make capacity and you can make room for other people to find the same community that you found in your group because they're out there in India.
[time=2496] There's a need for people to step up and find people who are far from God but they're close to you and them to see Jesus in you.
[time=2503] They may not want to step foot in a church like Black Hawk on a Sunday morning but they see the church because they see you.
[time=2509] They're far from God but they're close to you.
[time=2511] Maybe it's time to serve in a ministry.
[time=2513] Maybe you need to show up tonight with your family and help us invite people to canvas our area and invite people to a block party and to an outdoor baptism.
[time=2520] And they may get baptized on August the 22nd because they showed up and heard the gospel on August 15th or because they went to your house and lo and behold, you had the opportunity to share the gospel and you led them to Jesus.
[time=2531] How are you looking for opportunities to grab your towel and say, Jesus, I'll do whatever you want me to do.
[time=2537] I want to grow and I want to go.
[time=2539] I don't just want to know, I want to live it.
[time=2542] With that in mind, I just want to ask you to buy your heads and ponder that question.
[time=2545] What does it mean for you to pick up your towel?
[time=2548] Maybe you need to get baptized on the 22nd.
[time=2551] That's quite a testimony.
[time=2553] I don't know what God's teaching you and calling you to do but believers in the room.
[time=2556] What does it mean to pick up your towel?
[time=2558] What does it mean to serve God in a way that you need to?
[time=2562] And listen, some of you, you're not physically able to serve in certain ways and but there's a way.
[time=2567] God's put you in unique positions to make a huge difference for the kingdom of God.
[time=2572] And those he calls, he equips.
[time=2574] So you trust him?
[time=2575] What towel do you need to pick up believers in the room?
[time=2578] How does, how should, what you know leads you to grow and to go this week?
[time=2583] Maybe you take that challenge to say, God, every need I see I can meet.
[time=2587] I'm going to ask you, is this what I should do?
[time=2589] And then say, I got this one.
[time=2591] Some of you would say, today I don't know that I have that personal relationship with Jesus.
[time=2595] I've understood the gospel, I've understood salvation that it's so much more than God forgiving me.
[time=2600] He cleanses me and he gives me a new identity.
[time=2603] And I've seen the gospel.
[time=2604] Jesus lived the gospel in this moment.
[time=2607] So while believers are praying and seeking God for what towels we are to pick up, some of you need to just pause right now and cry out to Jesus.
[time=2614] There's no perfect prayer that saves you as your heart but you would need to nail down your salvation today because you've heard the gospel and the Holy Spirit is prompting and pulling you right now because you've realized you can't save you.
[time=2625] Your capability is not enough.
[time=2626] You need God's cleansing and you can ask Him to forgive you and save you knowing that Jesus paid it all for you.
[time=2633] He rose from the dead to defeat your sin, to defeat hell, to defeat the grave so that this moment could happen for you.
[time=2639] You're watching on a screen, you're in the room, whatever that it looks like for you, pause.
[time=2643] Ask God to save you, ask God to show you what's next and He'll meet you where you are.
[time=2646] We do that right now.
