[time=0] Let's talk today from Acts chapter 16.
[time=2] If you got your Bibles, meet me there.
[time=4] Acts chapter 16 will be in verses 22 through 34.
[time=8] We're taking a break that we have these last two weeks from our messy series in the gospel of John.
[time=13] We will come back to that next week and we will spend a couple more weeks to finish that series for those of you who've been reading through the gospel of John.
[time=20] We've been doing that for almost three months now and we're excited about that.
[time=23] Today, I wanna talk to you about why not now?
[time=27] Why not now?
[time=28] Everybody say that out loud.
[time=29] Ready, one, two, three.
[time=30] Why not now?
[time=32] That's the title of today's message.
[time=33] That's a theme of what we're gonna read about.
[time=35] This is the gospel of Acts, or this is the Luke's writing about the Acts, the early Acts, the early parts of the church, the early church, and I want us to learn some things about what we can hopefully deploy and learn from as the church today.
[time=51] Acts chapter number 16.
[time=53] I'm gonna give you a little context.
[time=54] Paul has a ton of momentum at this time.
[time=56] The Apostle Paul is on his second missionary journey.
[time=58] He is beginning that second missionary journey.
[time=61] Listen, the gospel is now spreading to Europe.
[time=63] It is taking over all over the world.
[time=65] There is a great momentum for the gospel.
[time=68] Paul is commissioned by God and by God's church to take the gospel, the good news of Jesus to the Gentiles, to the people who are not Jews, to the people that they shouldn't have been able to be included in all of this, many people thought.
[time=82] But Paul is commissioned to spread the gospel all over the world, to all people.
[time=86] And he comes to the region of Macedonia here in Acts chapter number 16.
[time=92] And he comes to a town called Philippi.
[time=95] And that may sound familiar because in your Bible, one of the 66 books in your Bible is the book of Philippians.
[time=100] And that is one of the letters that the Apostle Paul wrote and he wrote it to the church at Philippi.
[time=105] And so it's interesting that the letter, the epistle of Paul to the church at Philippi, the book of Philippians, as you know it in your Bible, it was written about 10 years after the events of this chapter in Acts chapter 16.
[time=118] So Paul hasn't even written it yet because he is now going to be a part of the beginnings of the church at Philippi to whom he would write about a decade later, makes sense?
[time=126] So that's where we're at in the history of the Bible and of the early church.
[time=130] And as he went to this region of Macedonia, as he went to Philippi, he ran into a lady named Lydia.
[time=137] She was a seller of purple cloths.
[time=139] She was kind of like, obviously a CEO wealthy, purple cloth meant a lot of those things, kind of a fashionista perhaps, but we learn a lot about her and he runs into her and she believed in God, but she didn't know yet about this Jesus.
[time=153] And Paul was more than obliged to tell her about Jesus and it's interesting because you read her story.
[time=158] The church of Philippi began really in her home.
[time=162] Pretty neat story.
[time=163] And then he runs into a slave girl who is possessed by a demon who was constantly after him and confronting him and contradicting him.
[time=171] And it's a reminder that as we, just like Paul, follow the call of God, the purpose of God on our lives, we will have constant contradictions come our way, constant confrontations, constant challenges, constant confusion.
[time=185] And maybe you like Paul are seeing some of that as well.
[time=187] He has great momentum for the gospel.
[time=189] The church at Philippi is beginning and he doesn't even know that perhaps at this point, but he sees its formation through Lydia and now through a slave girl in whom he casts out a demon, but that made some people mad because there were some people who owned her who made a good livelihood, a good wealth from her abilities that she had from this demon and that went away and when their livelihood went away, they got mad and they turned Paul and Silas in to the magistrates and to the city and that's where we find ourselves here right now in Acts chapter 16.
[time=219] So let's read those first three verses.
[time=221] Acts 16 verses 22 through 24 and we'll see what Paul runs into.
[time=227] This is a baptism passage, believe it or not, but before we get to the baptism, we gotta go through some suffering.
[time=232] Maybe some of your suffering.
[time=233] So let's read Acts 16 starting in verse 22.
[time=236] You ready for the word today, Black Hawk?
[time=239] Let's dig in, verse 22.
[time=240] The crowd joined in attacking them.
[time=244] Doesn't that happen when you follow God's plan?
[time=246] That's what happened to them.
[time=247] And the magistrates tore the garments off them and gave orders to beat them with rods.
[time=252] And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison and ordered the jailer to keep them safely.
[time=260] Having received this order, he put them in the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.
[time=266] Now enters the third person that will be a part of the beginnings of the church at Philippi.
[time=271] There is Lydia.
[time=272] There is the slave girl who's possessed by an evil spirit.
[time=276] And then there is the Philippian jailer.
[time=278] And he is the one who is charged to keep them after they beat them.
[time=281] And who knows, he could have been a part of that.
[time=283] Likely was certainly present for that, but most likely would have even had some part in that of making sure they had the submissive attitude as he put them in stocks.
[time=290] And you gotta understand stocks.
[time=292] When they say that, it's not like where you just got a couple here and a couple there and you can sprawl out and cross your legs and lay across a little bed.
[time=298] Typically stocks would mean that they've contorted your body, twisted your body in all kinds of painful positions where you wouldn't be able to sleep, you wouldn't even be able to think straight.
[time=308] You are in constant torment and pain when stocks in prisons like this Philippian jailer would have been in charge of.
[time=314] That's where Paul finds himself.
[time=316] So we go from momentum for the gospel, now to misery for the gospel.
[time=320] Really quickly.
[time=321] But it's the beginnings of the church at Philippi.
[time=325] That's what we see in these first few verses.
[time=327] And you know, I wanna remind you today that Paul and Silas were attacked.
[time=331] Why?
[time=332] 'Cause they did something terribly wrong.
[time=333] No, because they set captives free.
[time=336] Because they told people who didn't know about Jesus about the saving news or the gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ.
[time=341] Because they began the church at Philippi in these very moments.
[time=345] We see its beginnings and its origins.
[time=347] And I wanna remind you today that the proof of God's presence, a lot of times we think, well, God is present when there's an absence of pain.
[time=354] The proof of God's presence though, my friends, is not when there's an absence of pain.
[time=358] It's when we as believers are able to trust God's promises through the pain.
[time=363] And that is exactly where Paul and Silas are.
[time=365] And maybe that's where you're at a crossroads of right now in your own lives.
[time=370] And listen, the greater you're calling, the greater the conflict, the greater the confrontations perhaps sometimes.
[time=375] And we see that in Paul's life.
[time=377] But because God is for you, it means, you know, a lot of times we think, but because God is for me, nothing bad's gonna come against me.
[time=384] No, because God is for you, everything bad's gonna come against you.
[time=387] But greater is he who is in me than he who is in the world.
[time=392] And we see that in this passage.
[time=394] And they're given to the jailer, the Philippian jailer, they're put in those stocks and they're not just put in prison, they're put in the inner part of the prison where there's zero chance of escape, there's zero chance of hope.
[time=404] There is no way out, momentum has turned into misery.
[time=407] And I think we can learn two key things by how Paul and Silas respond.
[time=411] Number one, write these down.
[time=412] Two things that we can learn.
[time=413] Number one, I believe we can see how they were steadfast in suffering.
[time=417] They were steadfast in suffering.
[time=418] This is from verses 25 through 28, right where we left off.
[time=422] They were steadfast, everybody say steadfast.
[time=425] They were steadfast in their suffering.
[time=428] So let's read verses 25 through 28 and then we'll break it apart.
[time=431] We see how steadfast that they are.
[time=434] Verse 25, about midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God.
[time=440] And the prisoners were listening to them.
[time=442] I bet they were.
[time=443] Verse 26, and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately, immediately, everybody say immediately.
[time=452] Circle that word, if you will, in your Bibles, underline that word or make a note of that in your notes.
[time=457] We're gonna come back to it, I promise, toward the end of the message.
[time=459] And immediately, all the doors were open and everyone's bonds were unfastened.
[time=465] When the jailer woke and saw the prison doors were open, he drew a sword and was about to kill himself.
[time=469] Because listen, if you were a jailer like him and you lost a prisoner that you were given orders to keep and you lost them, you would be killed.
[time=477] You would be executed.
[time=477] So he's just gonna beat him to the punch.
[time=479] He didn't wanna go through all that.
[time=480] So he was gonna take his own life.
[time=482] And so he was about to kill himself.
[time=483] Supposing the prisoners had escaped.
[time=486] I would have too, but verse 28, "But Paul cried with a loud voice, "Do not harm yourself, for we are all here." What a picture of steadfastness in suffering.
[time=499] Let's break that apart with a few things.
[time=501] Maybe you're in a season of suffering.
[time=503] Just pause for a minute and identify what season of suffering have you found yourself in today?
[time=508] You're like, I thought it was a baptism Sunday.
[time=509] It is, just hold on.
[time=511] But to get to those beautiful, made new moments of God, we gotta go through some things sometimes.
[time=515] And your story has brought you through a lot of suffering to bring you to today's moment.
[time=520] Some of you are being baptized today.
[time=521] There'll be some who will decide to be baptized today.
[time=523] We're gonna counsel and talk with each of you.
[time=525] We've got a team and a group that's ready to do that, even today.
[time=528] But to get to these moments, listen, it takes a lot of suffering.
[time=531] When you're following the calling of God, the enemy always rears his ugly head.
[time=535] Every single time.
[time=538] And we see that in Paul's life and in yours as well.
[time=541] But let's learn to be steadfast.
[time=543] I wanna give you three things that we see about that steadfastness.
[time=545] They were steadfast in suffering.
[time=547] First thing I'll tell you is being steadfast means praising and not pouting.
[time=551] Praising and not pouting.
[time=552] Verse 25, what was happening there in verse 25?
[time=555] About midnight, Paul and Silas were doing what?
[time=558] They were crying 'cause they were in agony and pain.
[time=560] No, they were praying and singing hymns to God.
[time=565] And the prisoners were listening.
[time=567] Like in that much pain, I've been beaten with rods.
[time=570] I've been stripped.
[time=570] I'm twisted and contorted and no telling.
[time=573] What kind of a shape?
[time=574] There's no telling what kind of pain.
[time=575] And they're singing hymns in the inner part of the prison and the darkest part of the darkness.
[time=582] And I wanna tell you this about being steadfast that it is about praising and not pouting.
[time=586] They had every reason to pout.
[time=587] How many of you ever pouted before when you should have been praising?
[time=590] I'm raising my hand not as just an example for you, but because I've been a powder before when I should have been a praiseer.
[time=595] But they were praising God and listen, here's what I want you to know about praising God.
[time=599] It's what you externalize, right?
[time=601] This now, what you externalize in the dark means what you show.
[time=604] It's what other people see.
[time=605] What you externalize in the dark will flow from what you internalize in the light.
[time=613] How did they remember the hymns?
[time=615] You think they had a hymn book in the prison?
[time=618] No.
[time=619] So where was this coming from?
[time=620] It was coming from what they had internalized in the light in the times where they were following God when they had all of this momentum.
[time=626] They were memorizing.
[time=627] They were internalizing the word of God, the truth of God so that when dark times came, that's what overflowed.
[time=634] And that's what they externalize.
[time=635] What you externalize in the dark is always going to flow from whatever it is you're internalizing in the light.
[time=641] So I ask you today, what are you internalizing?
[time=644] Why you're maybe not in such a dark place.
[time=646] Or maybe you are in a dark place.
[time=647] What are you seeing flowing from the inside?
[time=649] Because what goes in is going to come out.
[time=651] You've heard that in youth group, perhaps, all of your life and it is true.
[time=657] What you externalize in the dark is gonna flow from what's inside of you.
[time=660] So how did they remember these things?
[time=662] Here's what I've learned about my own life is that when it's in my heart, I don't have to see it with my eyes.
[time=667] I won't say that again.
[time=669] Some of you need to know this 'cause you're in a time of darkness.
[time=672] When it's in your heart, you don't have to see it with your eyes.
[time=675] They're in the inner part of the prison.
[time=677] They're suffering, they're contorted, they're twisted.
[time=679] They're in pain for doing what?
[time=681] For doing what God has called them to do.
[time=683] Every reason for them to lose hope and to lose heart is in place.
[time=687] But instead, they're overflowing with the goodness of God.
[time=691] They're overflowing with what they have memorized, with what they have internalized because they knew in their heart what they couldn't see with their eyes.
[time=699] And that's a good word for those of you who are suffering today.
[time=701] God wants you to have in your heart these things that will overflow even when you can't see those things with your eyes.
[time=708] I think God, he loves us that much.
[time=710] And if you don't practice in the daytime, my friends, you won't remember it in the nighttime.
[time=715] If you found that to be true in your own life and the dark times of your life, here's a few verses, Psalm 103 and verse two.
[time=721] Psalm 103 verse two, "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits." Remember that, remember his benefits, remember his blessings, internalize them so that when the dark times come and you can't see them with your eyes, you've got them so entrenched in your heart that you're able to sing and praise and pray even when things are dark.
[time=739] Just like Paul did, Jeremiah in Lamentations 3 even said, "This I recall to my mind, therefore I have hope." What you recall, what you internalize matters, what are you feeding yourself?
[time=749] What intake are you allowing in your life right now that will be the output when times get difficult?
[time=756] One more verse, and it's from Paul.
[time=758] I told you that the book of Philippians was written about 10 years after this.
[time=760] Philippians 1, 3, Paul said to them, and remember, this is the beginnings of the church at Philippi.
[time=766] He's written this now 10 years or so later.
[time=770] What does he remember?
[time=771] Oh man, it was horrible.
[time=772] Man, I remember the prison.
[time=774] I remember the pain.
[time=775] Well, no, verse 3, Philippians 1.
[time=778] "I thank my God in all my remembrance of you." Now this would be Lydia.
[time=785] This would be the slave girl.
[time=787] This would be the Philippian jailer as we're about to find out.
[time=790] And he thanks God, what does he do?
[time=792] He focuses on the outcomes and not the oppositions.
[time=796] He focuses on God's purposes and not the prison.
[time=803] When he looks back 10 years later, that's what he remembers.
[time=806] Being steadfast is praising and not pouting.
[time=809] In the end of verse 25, the prisoners were listening.
[time=812] Do you know that when you're suffering, people are watching.
[time=815] People are watching, you have a big megaphone to scream some good news while you're suffering.
[time=820] So if you're suffering, take heart in that.
[time=821] Steadfast and suffering first is praising, not pouting.
[time=824] Second one is being steadfast means believing God when hope seems lost.
[time=828] Write that down.
[time=829] When hope seems lost, this is when being steadfast kicks in the most.
[time=833] Verse 26, God sent an earthquake and where did it shake?
[time=838] Even the inner foundations of the prison, where was Paul?
[time=840] Let me ask you this, when there's a hurricane, a tornado, an earthquake, a natural disaster, where do you try to go?
[time=846] The innermost parts of the building, right?
[time=849] Well, that is where Paul is at.
[time=851] That is where Silas is at in the prison.
[time=854] The innermost part of the prison where even the earthquakes, even the natural disasters can't reach, but God sends an earthquake from heaven and it shakes even the innermost parts of the prison.
[time=867] And verse 26, what happens?
[time=868] That word again, say it again, starts with an eye?
[time=871] Immediately, God sends his power, God sends his earthquake and even to the places, listen, that's what God's power will do.
[time=879] It will reach into the places that you think are untouchable in your life.
[time=884] That's what God's power did.
[time=885] It reached to the untouchable, unreachable parts of the prison and immediately, all of the chains were loose and all of the doors were opened.
[time=893] That's the power of God on display.
[time=896] And as we underline that word immediately, we realize that listen, when God's power shows up, stuff changes.
[time=903] How many of you ready for some of God's power in your life?
[time=907] When Jesus shows up on the scene, everything changes.
[time=912] Now, does that mean he's gonna show up today and just wash away all your problems?
[time=916] No, we're gonna get there in just a minute.
[time=917] You notice they stayed in the prison.
[time=918] I'm getting ahead of myself.
[time=919] So it may not look like what you think, but God's power is ready to be manifested in your situation, but we've got to believe him, even for the impossible earthquakes to reach the impossible, untouchable places, not just of our prisons, but of our hearts.
[time=934] And that's a good reminder for us today.
[time=936] In the jailer, verse 27, he saw they were free and so he drew a sword.
[time=939] He was gonna take his own life because he knew his life was going to be lost anyway.
[time=943] And so we see that they had hope.
[time=944] Paul and Silas had hope in God, even when all hope seemed lost.
[time=948] They praise instead of pouting.
[time=949] The third thing, right this down, is being steadfast means seeking to endure not to escape.
[time=955] That's verse 28, 'cause what did they do?
[time=957] They ran out.
[time=958] What would you have done?
[time=959] God sent you the earthquake and your doors are open, your chains are loose, right?
[time=966] I mean, let's be honest, I'm guessing that's probably by reaction.
[time=969] I'd like to think I did what Paul and Silas did, but no, they say, "Hey, don't hurt 'em yourself." We are all still here.
[time=977] They didn't seek and escape.
[time=979] They seek to endure in God's purpose.
[time=981] Verse 28, we see that.
[time=982] And today I've just got to speak for just a second to some of the things happening in our world.
[time=988] If you've watched the news, and I try not to watch the news very much these days, but I do try to keep up with world events.
[time=992] And my heart is broken over natural disasters, places like Haiti, there's so many things going on, but specifically my family has every night been praying for Afghanistan and for all of the horrible things going on.
[time=1005] And Afghanistan, and listen, before you start going political with your minds, there's way bigger things God's up to right now than politics there.
[time=1012] Yeah, so be reminded.
[time=1015] So today, today I know there's political things going on with, I can get all that, but there's people.
[time=1021] There's prayer that we are called to as the people of God, the body of Christ.
[time=1025] And so my family, we've just been praying for them.
[time=1026] We've been reading about some of the things that these families are experiencing that are living there, specifically those who are being persecuted, are brothers and sisters in Christ, the church pastors.
[time=1036] I've had the opportunity to read some of what these pastors, that many of whom are being chased down, many are being killed, they're all being persecuted, they're all afraid, and they've written letters to different denominations, you know, asking for prayers, what they're asking for.
[time=1049] And you know, if there's one situation I can think of in the world right now where it makes total sense that if I were there, it would be an escape plan, it would be that.
[time=1057] Can I get an amen?
[time=1058] Wouldn't you feel that way if you were there?
[time=1059] And my family's there, you better know that's what I'm looking for.
[time=1061] I'm trying to get out of that prison, right?
[time=1063] But as I've read those letters and those requests for prayer from these pastors, you know what some of the phrases I've read look like.
[time=1070] One of my favorites that's just rung in my heart has been one of the pastors said, "Hey, pray for us, pray for all these things "and you gave a list." But he said, "But no, our hope is not in politics, "our hope is in Jesus." I praise God, give God some praise for that.
[time=1085] If you believe that, my hope is not in politics, but they're saying that in a prison that we cannot even fathom and imagine right now.
[time=1093] And they're trusting God.
[time=1095] And they're praying, one of their prayer requests that was a constant theme from the churches that I got to read things from.
[time=1101] And we've looked at them as a family and we've just prayed for these things.
[time=1103] And I pray you'll join me as a church body and praying for our persecuted brothers and sisters is that the light of the gospel would shine in all the darkness.
[time=1112] May we have that kind of a mindset.
[time=1118] May we learn from those kinds of people being steadfast.
[time=1122] I think they're a perfect example of Paul and Silas.
[time=1125] They're not just looking to escape, even though they should, maybe would if they could, but they're looking to endure in God's purposes and to see what God wants to do through the most tragic of circumstances.
[time=1136] So let's join together, continuing to pray for them as a church, but let's learn from them as we learn from Paul and Silas.
[time=1141] 'Cause here's what I've learned about perspectives in the middle of pain.
[time=1144] Your perspective in the middle of pain will be the greatest catalyst perhaps that will make the purposes of God visible to those around you.
[time=1152] Your perspective in the middle of pain is gonna be one of the greatest catalysts that'll make the purposes and the plans of God visible to those who are watching.
[time=1161] The prisoners were watching as they were singing.
[time=1162] You remember that?
[time=1163] They were watching.
[time=1165] But it's interesting because God has now made the prisoner of the preacher.
[time=1168] He was in stocks, but now he has the power because the power of God has loosed his chains and immediately they fell off and the doors were open, but he endured and he stayed there.
[time=1176] God's power's not granted so we can run away from our problems and escape.
[time=1180] God's power is granted.
[time=1181] God's power is sent so that we can endure in his promises, so that we can endure in his purposes, so that we can live out his plans.
[time=1189] So look at me for a minute, everybody look at me.
[time=1190] Even on the screen, look at me for a minute.
[time=1193] Are you about to quit?
[time=1194] Are you about to throw in the towel?
[time=1198] What are you about to give up on?
[time=1202] God sent me today to tell you, don't quit.
[time=1206] God sent me to, I know this world feels so much a lost cause
[time=1213] and your circumstances are no different, but God sent me today to be his voice and his messenger to say endure in his purposes.
[time=1220] Stop looking for the escapist's mentality.
[time=1222] That's what we do a lot of times when we look for Jesus to come back.
[time=1225] We say, preacher, we're gonna talk about the last days and I do and I wanna talk about the last days and here's what I wanna tell you about the last days.
[time=1231] We're in them and what that means is we don't look for an escapist's mentality to get out of here.
[time=1236] We look to endure in the purposes of God and we need to have a hope-filled, anticipation-driven hope in Jesus coming back that leads us to an urgency for the gospel like never, ever, ever before.
[time=1249] That's what you need to know about the last days.
[time=1252] May we live in that, may we know we're in that, but may we live not with a fearful, anxiety-driven, escapist's mentality, but may we live with a hope-filled, anticipating the coming of Jesus' urgency to make sure we spread the gospel in every way possible as long as God has us here.
[time=1271] Clap if you believe that today.
[time=1272] I'm so thankful that God has given us and trusted us with this mission and may we live it out with the confidence.
[time=1278] So listen, persevering in prison might just be where you best find God's purposes for your life.
[time=1285] Maybe you've been just looking to get out.
[time=1287] You've been just looking to run away, but God says persevere in the prison that you're in right now and you'll find my plan.
[time=1294] You'll find my promises.
[time=1297] So I ask you today, why not now?
[time=1299] Why not this prison?
[time=1301] Why not in the darkest times?
[time=1303] Why not at midnight?
[time=1305] Why not now?
[time=1307] They were steadfast in suffering.
[time=1308] Number two, they were immediate in obedience.
[time=1310] Write that down, immediate in obedience.
[time=1312] Everybody say, immediate.
[time=1314] Immediately the chains fell off.
[time=1315] Immediately the doors were opened.
[time=1317] They were immediate though in their obedience.
[time=1318] Let's read that together verses 29 through 34.
[time=1322] And the jailer called for lights and rushed in and trembling with fear.
[time=1325] He fell down before Paul and Silas.
[time=1328] Then he brought them out and said, sirs, what must I do to be saved?
[time=1333] And they said, believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, you and your household.
[time=1338] And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house, verse 33.
[time=1343] And he took them that same hour of the night.
[time=1346] Sounds pretty immediate, doesn't it?
[time=1347] And washed their wounds.
[time=1349] And he was baptized.
[time=1350] There it is.
[time=1351] Told you it was a baptism Sunday.
[time=1352] And he was baptized when?
[time=1354] At once.
[time=1356] He was baptized at once.
[time=1357] Circle that, underline that word too.
[time=1359] I told you we're gonna come back to it.
[time=1360] He and all his family.
[time=1362] Then he brought them up into his house and set food before them.
[time=1365] And he rejoiced along with his entire household that he had believed in God.
[time=1370] Verses 29 and 30, the jailer fell in all humility and all brokenness at the feet of Paul and Silas who he had bound in stocks.
[time=1379] That's what the power of God could do.
[time=1380] It reversed the roles completely.
[time=1382] And he asked, what must I do to be saved?
[time=1385] The guy who had locked them up who had made them hostage is now humbled.
[time=1390] That's what the power of God can do.
[time=1392] And then, so what do they do?
[time=1393] Verses 31 and 32, Paul and Silas, they don't delay.
[time=1397] Immediate action, immediate obedience.
[time=1399] Let me be honest.
[time=1400] If he came to me and said that, it's like, weren't you the guy that was beating me earlier?
[time=1404] Weren't you the guy that twisted me and hurt my body?
[time=1408] You take me home, you feed me some food, you clean me up, and then I might just tell you.
[time=1414] Quit laughing at me like you don't think the same thing.
[time=1418] (laughs) You're like, man, I thought our pastor was nice.
[time=1422] You know, I'm human, but what do they do?
[time=1424] They don't do any of that.
[time=1425] Like, you fix us up and then I'll tell you a little bit about how you can be saved.
[time=1428] If you're nice, punk, it's not what Paul and Silas do.
[time=1432] What do they do?
[time=1433] Immediate obedience.
[time=1435] They share the gospel immediately.
[time=1438] They're in pain, they stayed in a prison.
[time=1441] At least, if I wouldn't, that mean I would've at least, listen, I would've at least said, hey, why don't we talk somewhere else before somebody else comes and locks me back up?
[time=1448] Won't you hide me, won't you give me a no, but in the prison where they are, as best as we can see, right then they share the gospel and they tell them and his whole household about Jesus.
[time=1459] Isn't that a beautiful picture of that obedience?
[time=1462] And as we look at that today, immediately they share the gospel.
[time=1466] It's a reminder that we're never promised tomorrow, friends.
[time=1468] Make good decisions today because you are never promised tomorrow.
[time=1472] Let's be immediate in our obedience as we're steadfast in our sufferings.
[time=1477] And do you know when it comes to decisions like this one that Paul and Silas made?
[time=1481] Did you know that the average adult makes approximately 35,000 decisions in any given day?
[time=1488] It's a lot of decisions.
[time=1489] Let me give you a couple of pointers some that we see from Paul and Silas.
[time=1492] First of all, don't make permanent decisions based on temporary emotions.
[time=1496] We've talked about this before.
[time=1497] I mean, you could see this in the Philippian jailer.
[time=1499] He's about to make a permanent decision on his temporary situation.
[time=1502] He didn't think it was temporary.
[time=1503] It felt very permanent to him, but it was a temporary thing because God was up to something new.
[time=1508] And for us, don't make any permanent decisions when you've got temporary emotions flowing.
[time=1512] That's just a good practical piece of advice that we can learn from in decision-making, but especially from Paul and Silas and what they did write this one down.
[time=1519] Make sure that your short-term decisions reflect your long-term values.
[time=1525] Make sure your short-term decisions, today's decisions, one of those 35,000 plus decisions, make sure they reflect your long-term values.
[time=1531] That's exactly what Paul and Silas did.
[time=1534] Instead of saying, well, I'm hungry and I'm hurting and I wanna get out of the prison and then I'll tell you how to be saved.
[time=1539] What do they do?
[time=1541] They said, you know what?
[time=1542] Eternities at stake for this friend of ours.
[time=1546] I don't care about the short-term implications.
[time=1548] I'm thinking about the long-term eternal values of his soul.
[time=1552] And so I'm gonna make an irrational decision right now because I'm thinking in terms of eternity.
[time=1558] May we not get caught up in the earthly.
[time=1560] May we live with eternity in mind.
[time=1562] May we begin and live with the end in mind.
[time=1565] That's what Paul and Silas do.
[time=1567] Verse 33, listen, God used the one holding them hostage then to bring healing to them.
[time=1571] 'Cause that hour than I, He took them to His house and He bandaged and He brought healing to their wounds.
[time=1576] The one who was holding them hostage brought healing to their body.
[time=1579] Right then and immediately, that is what happened.
[time=1582] And then verse 33, he and his entire household was baptized immediately at once, at once, that happens.
[time=1590] So here's what's happened, Paul and Silas, them being immediate in their obedience to share the gospel, has now trickled over, has now rippled into immediate obedience from the Philippian jailer and his household because he immediately, him and his whole household, at once went to be baptized.
[time=1607] Listen, if you catch anything, I say today, don't miss this.
[time=1611] I told you to circle, underline the word immediately.
[time=1613] In verse 26, look at it there in your Bibles.
[time=1615] Look at it on your phones, on your screens.
[time=1617] And then in verse 33, at once, looks like different words.
[time=1621] As you know that in the original language, that is the exact same Greek word.
[time=1625] Just as immediately, as the chains were loose and the doors were open, is how immediate, how at once, how right in the moment, he and his family went and got baptized, it's the same word.
[time=1636] The Greek word there is paracramma.
[time=1641] I wanna make sure I say it right, paracramma, everybody say that, you can say it at lunch and sound real smart, paracramma, paracramma, that's the Greek word.
[time=1648] It's the same thing, it means immediately, it means at once, it means without any delay.
[time=1652] Just so get this, don't miss it.
[time=1653] Just as immediately as the earthquake from heaven opened the doors and loosed the chains in the prison.
[time=1661] It's that immediate, it's that at once that the Philippian, once he had seen an experience and surrendered his life to the saving power of Jesus Christ that he and his whole household went to get baptized and take that step of obedience.
[time=1677] And so as we look at that today, I'm reminded of Acts 8, verses 36 through 38, Philip in the Ethiopian, he says to him, as they studied the word together, writing down the road, he says, what would prevent me from being baptized?
[time=1689] And what do they do?
[time=1690] Immediately they saw water and he went and he was baptized.
[time=1694] You know what, there wasn't a probation period to see if they got it enough or if they were good enough or if they lived it out enough, they just immediately went.
[time=1701] Just as immediate as the earthquake was in opening the doors of the prison.
[time=1706] Let me talk to you about baptism before we wrap things up today and baptism today, the word itself means to immerse, it means to put under, it means to go under and to come back out, it means to cover.
[time=1715] And that's what the blood of Jesus does.
[time=1716] We've looked at it in communion today.
[time=1718] And so let me give you four reasons.
[time=1719] To answer this question, why should I be baptized?
[time=1722] Why did the Philippian jailer get baptized?
[time=1724] Why did the Ethiopian get baptized?
[time=1725] Why should you get baptized?
[time=1727] Why not now?
[time=1728] Let me give you four reasons.
[time=1729] Number one, Jesus did.
[time=1731] Matthew chapter three, Jesus got baptized.
[time=1733] Did he need to do that?
[time=1734] He's the Son of God.
[time=1735] No, why did he?
[time=1736] Because he did it as our example to show us what he was gonna command us to do, which is number two, Jesus did it.
[time=1742] Number one, number two, Jesus commanded it.
[time=1743] The Great Commission.
[time=1744] Go therefore and make disciples doing what?
[time=1748] Baptizing them, that's the same word.
[time=1750] Baptizing them, the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=1753] That's exactly what Jesus did, it's what he commanded.
[time=1756] And then the book of Acts, things like the Ethiopian in Acts chapter eight, things like the Philippian jailer in Acts chapter 16, the early church showed us what conversion experiences should look like.
[time=1765] And it should be, let's go find water.
[time=1768] Let's go show the world, which is number four.
[time=1770] So it's because Jesus did, because Jesus commanded it, because the early church did it as the followup and the model and the establishment of what Jesus commanded.
[time=1777] We have all of these examples in the book of Acts.
[time=1779] Number four, it's because it is a witness to the world of the saving power of Jesus.
[time=1783] It does, listen, when you're baptized, I've baptized so many people.
[time=1786] I've been baptized, I've baptized two of my kids.
[time=1788] It's just the most amazing thing in the world.
[time=1790] It does something in you, but more than that, it even does something through you.
[time=1795] It shows the world because other people are gonna say, if she got baptized, if she got baptized, maybe I should.
[time=1801] Maybe I should think about that.
[time=1802] Maybe I need to think about my own salvation.
[time=1804] It gives a testimony to the world of the saving power of Jesus.
[time=1808] Baptism doesn't save you, only Jesus can do that.
[time=1812] But it's the first step of obedience we should take.
[time=1814] Immediately, everybody say that out loud.
[time=1816] Immediately following our conversion, immediately following salvation.
[time=1819] It's the first step of obedience because of those four reasons.
[time=1823] Baptism is just an outward expression of the inward miracle of salvation.
[time=1827] It happens because Jesus saves us.
[time=1828] We are dead and our trespasses and sins.
[time=1831] There's nothing we can do apart from Jesus Christ, our sin gives us the penalty of death.
[time=1837] And only a perfect sacrifice could pay that penalty.
[time=1839] Jesus became that perfect sacrifice.
[time=1841] Living the sinless life, we could never live.
[time=1844] And he died to pay a price.
[time=1845] And that's what we talked about in communion just a few minutes ago, his body was broken, his blood was shed out as our perfect, a toning sacrifice, taking our place on the cross and paying that price.
[time=1856] And oh, it got better from there.
[time=1857] He rose from the dead to defeat hell, to defeat death, to defeat sin, so that we could live in him, so that we could take part in that victory.
[time=1867] A victory we can't win on our own, but that God won through his son, Jesus Christ, on our behalf.
[time=1872] You get to receive it.
[time=1873] What do you do?
[time=1874] What do I must not do to be saved?
[time=1876] What do they tell him?
[time=1877] Believe.
[time=1878] It really is that simple.
[time=1880] And we make it so complicated.
[time=1881] So my friends today, maybe that's your why not now moment.
[time=1884] Maybe you're here today because God has led you to that moment of surrender.
[time=1888] The spirit of God is calling you to take that step.
[time=1890] And maybe you've made that step of surrender.
[time=1892] And today is the time for you to be baptized.
[time=1894] And that's what we're going to do, verse 34 in a minute.
[time=1897] We're going to do what they did in verse 34.
[time=1898] We're not going to eat.
[time=1899] We're going to let you guys do that afterwards, but we're going to celebrate.
[time=1902] We're going to have fun and we're going to party because of those decisions.
[time=1905] But I ask you today, why not now?
[time=1910] I want to be steadfast in my suffering.
[time=1914] I want to be immediate in my obedience.
[time=1918] Why not you?
[time=1920] Why not today?
[time=1922] Why not in this moment?
[time=1923] Why not?
[time=1925] Now, I want to ask you to bow your heads and close your eyes.
[time=1928] Nobody's looking around even at home for this moment.
[time=1931] I want to give you this time of invitation.
[time=1933] Some of you need to accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior today.
[time=1936] You've been trusting in everything but Jesus to save you.
[time=1939] And today is the day of your salvation if you trust in Jesus.
[time=1942] If you believe, sir, what must I do to be saved?
[time=1945] Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1946] That he is who he says he is.
[time=1947] Ask him to save you.
[time=1948] Ask him to forgive you.
[time=1949] Tell him you believe he died and that he rose again.
[time=1952] He is the Savior of the world and you're going to trust him and nothing and no one else for your salvation.
[time=1958] That is the surrender.
[time=1959] That's the belief.
[time=1960] That's the belief that God gives to us and maybe he's implanting that inside of you through his spirit in this moment right now.
[time=1966] Will you pause?
[time=1968] Believers are praying.
[time=1969] Maybe some of you who need to be baptized pray right now.
[time=1972] But most importantly today, why not now?
[time=1977] Will you trust Jesus as your Savior?
[time=1978] I'm not going to leave you in a prayer because God's screaming it inside of your heart.
[time=1982] He's just pouring it out right now in your own words.
[time=1983] Will you trust Jesus as your Savior?
[time=1985] Don't wait another minute.
[time=1986] Why not now?
[time=1987] (gentle music)
[time=2006] Your heads are bowed, some of you are still praying.
[time=2008] But if you're taking that step today, even online, before God, even though I can't see you, he does, would you just acknowledge that there's power in acknowledging what God's doing?
[time=2015] Would you right now say, today is the day of my salvation.
[time=2018] I've trusted Jesus as my Savior.
[time=2020] If you nailed that now, would you lift your hand so I can pray for you in a moment?
[time=2022] If I was going to come get you, I promise, I just want to pray for you.
[time=2024] Anybody say today is the day of my salvation.
[time=2027] I see you, sir.
[time=2028] Praise God.
[time=2029] In the heavens for joys, who else?
[time=2031] In the room and listen, God sees you if I don't see you.
[time=2033] I see you, sir.
[time=2034] God bless you.
[time=2035] Who else?
[time=2036] Raise your hand, say today is the day of my salvation.
[time=2040] I trust in Jesus and Jesus alone, anybody else.
[time=2043] Even if I can't see you, God does, you can put your hands down.
[time=2045] Believers, those who maybe have taken the step of salvation and trusting in Jesus, maybe time for you to be baptized is at hand.
[time=2052] Why not now?
[time=2055] And I'm going to help you with that in just a moment.
[time=2056] Just a second, I'm going to ask people to come and actually, what I want to do is ask our elders and leaders who are going to be prepared to talk with those who are getting baptized, just to come to the front.
[time=2064] I'm going to do things a little different today.
[time=2066] Just come to the front, all of you guys, they're counseling, we just come on up.
[time=2069] We've got pastors, leaders, ministry leaders, all over the place.
[time=2074] Would you guys just come to the front?
[time=2075] And now those of you who are already scheduled for baptism, will you just come join us right up here in the front?
[time=2080] Just come right up here in the front.
[time=2081] If you're already scheduled, many of them are kids and they're in our kids' ministry, and I'll give you instruction for that in just a minute.
[time=2087] But if you're already scheduled for baptism, would you come on up?
[time=2089] Come on up, don't be shy.
[time=2091] Come join us up front.
[time=2093] Praise God.
[time=2095] There are many who baptize a lot of kids today, folks.
[time=2097] It's beautiful, a lot of youth.
[time=2100] And now here's what I want to do.
[time=2103] I want you to be bold for a minute.
[time=2104] If you're ready to be baptized today, and you've given your life to Jesus, maybe you just did, maybe you did it a while ago, but why not?
[time=2111] Now listen, here's what we've done.
[time=2112] We've got extra shirts, we've got extra towels, we got extra shorts, we got all the stuff that you need.
[time=2117] We've removed every obstacle for you to answer this question, why not?
[time=2121] Now, so right now, if that is you, would you come?
[time=2123] Just come right now.
[time=2124] I know it's a big deal, would you come?
[time=2126] We're just gonna cheer for you.
[time=2127] Praise God.
[time=2128] Would you come?
[time=2129] Would you come, anybody else?
[time=2131] Come from the balcony, we'll wait on you.
[time=2134] Would you come down front?
[time=2136] We're gonna talk with you in just a minute, we're gonna have our kids.
[time=2138] And listen, if you've got kids in the ministry, would you head and get them right now?
[time=2141] We'll let you out, we won't even do anything to cheer for you or anything, we won't embarrass you.
[time=2145] Go on and get your kids, and meet them down at the media center.
[time=2147] Cammy's gonna lead us down there in just a minute.
[time=2149] Anybody else, you can still come, and I'm gonna dismiss us in just a second.
[time=2153] I praise God for immediate steps of obedience that are happening here today, maybe there are more.
[time=2157] So we're gonna go down together, I'm gonna join them in a minute.
[time=2159] You guys can head that way.
[time=2160] Cammy, if you'll lead the way, they're gonna go out those doors, and you can still catch up with them.
[time=2163] If you didn't want to come stand at the front, go catch up with them.
[time=2166] Our elders, they're all here.
[time=2167] They're ready to talk with you.
[time=2168] Even if your next step's not baptism, go with them.
[time=2171] And they'll walk with you.
[time=2171] I praise God for you guys.
[time=2173] I thank God for what he's doing.
[time=2174] Can we cheer for them and just celebrate what God's doing?
[time=2176] The heavens are rejoicing, my friends.
[time=2178] Whoo!
[time=2182] Listen, we've had illness today.
[time=2184] We had people that were scheduled to be baptized, that had to stay home, but God's still sending next steps.
[time=2189] And we're still gonna baptize.
[time=2190] There's no illness.
[time=2192] There's no pandemic that's gonna slow down the work of Jesus Christ.
[time=2195] Do you believe that in this place?
[time=2197] Whoo, God is good.
[time=2198] God is good.
[time=2200] We've got a great time ahead of us, my friends.
[time=2202] And listen, if you said yes to Jesus today, you didn't come forward, grab one of the cards, they're in the seats around you.
[time=2207] I'm gonna dismiss us in a minute.
[time=2208] I'm gonna give us all of our instructions, but the card looks like this.
[time=2211] Fill it out, let us know.
[time=2212] They're gonna do the same thing, actually, in just a moment so you can join them and you can drop those in the black boxes.
[time=2217] Listen, if you're watching online, you can do the same thing by going to blackhawkministries.org/nextsteps.
[time=2223] I know you can't come forward, but you sure can.
[time=2225] You can fill out that form and we'll call you this week and we're all about next steps, not just on special Sundays, but on Mondays and Tuesdays and Wednesdays and Thursdays and Fridays and Saturdays, every day of the week.
[time=2235] So we wanna walk on that journey with you.
