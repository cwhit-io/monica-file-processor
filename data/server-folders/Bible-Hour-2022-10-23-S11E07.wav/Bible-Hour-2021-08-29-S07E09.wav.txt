[time=0] as we are in this series called messy messy we're in the gospel of John I invite you to turn there with me John chapter 13 where we'll be today but we're looking at the relationships Jesus had
[time=10] with messy people and number one we're hoping that we can identify with those people to learn and be reminded of the fact that God wants a relationship with us and number two we want to initiate we want to identify and number two we want to initiate some of the intentionality that we learn from Jesus in dealing with messy people we've looked at Jesus and somebody a different group of people and let me just remind you today because here's today's topic Jesus and traders Jesus
[time=36] and traders we're going to look at Judas Judas was a disciple of Jesus who betrayed him and as we look at this today you say well what a downer for such an up kind of a day right you know I felt that way at first looking at this and how the timing worked out but I think it's perfect timing and here's why when you stand for the things of God when you live out the light that we are called
[time=58] to live out when you are taking ground from the enemy for the kingdom of God there will always be
[time=66] opposition this is true in our church this is true in our world and this is true in your life in
[time=73] your personal walk with God the more you walk with Jesus the more the enemy will rear his head because
[time=80] listen he'll leave Christians alone who just kind of sit back in their seat and let the world pass
[time=86] them by but if you're taking ground for the kingdom of God you always face opposition and so this is great timing as a church as we're coming off of such great weeks where we have so much to celebrate let us be reminded that the enemy will always use other people and the enemy will always come after us as we follow Jesus so let's go to John chapter 13 and look today at this story so here's
[time=106] where we're at in the life of Jesus in John chapter 13 this is right on the heels of where Jesus washed the disciples feet I didn't even mean to do that you see what I did there right on the heels you'll catch up later all right there you go you're welcome just make sure you're awake so right after Jesus washes the feet of his disciples here at the end of chapter 13 Jesus has already told them that his betrayer is at hand and so Jesus is in the last week of his life within a week
[time=131] Jesus is going to die he's going to give himself for the sin of the world and partially he's going to do so because of someone that he has loved so dearly one of the disciples feet that he washed
[time=144] someone that he has served someone that he has invited onto this journey with him someone he has invited into his inner circle is going to be his betrayer and is going to deliver
[time=155] him to those who are seeking to kill him that's where we're at in the life of Jesus and he finds
[time=161] that he's a fake friend a friend that has been plotting against him for years that's where we're
[time=167] at in the story of Jesus quite a discouraging point but how he deals with this is phenomenal
[time=173] and it gives us a great template and outline for our own lives this is arguably the most tragic story in all of the Bible perhaps in all of history and some of you like me you know the sting
[time=184] of betrayal of someone that you thought like a Judas just like Jesus walked through somebody that
[time=191] had been with you through thick and thin someone that you thought was the real deal stabbing you in the back some of you are walking through that now and let me just remind you if you're not walking through that now your time will probably come it will come because why we are what kind of people what's the name of the series we are messy people we are so full of sin and we
[time=209] are so much like Judas just what you came to church to hear today right so let's talk about
[time=215] Judas here today first of all let's just read the story following right after Jesus has washed the disciples feet and he has told them that his betrayer is there let's let's see how that story unfolds let's read verses 21 through 30 of John chapter 13 you ready for the word today church verse 21 after saying these things Jesus was troubled in his spirit and testified truly truly
[time=237] I say to you one of you will betray me the disciples looked at one another uncertain of whom he spoke one of his disciples whom Jesus loved this is John who is the writer here of John's gospel was reclining at the table close to Jesus so Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was
[time=253] speaking so that disciple leaning back against Jesus said to him Lord who is it Jesus answered
[time=259] it is he whom I will give this morsel of bread when I have dipped it so when he had dipped the morsel he gave it to Judas the son of Simon scary verse 27 then after he had taken the morsel Satan
[time=271] entered into him Jesus said to him what are what you are going to do do quickly now no one at the
[time=280] table knew I said this to him some thought that because Judas had the money bag he was the treasurer Jesus was telling him by what we need for the feast or that he should give something to the poor so after receiving the morsel of bread he immediately went out and it was night and it was night not
[time=298] just in the time of day but spiritually and in the season of the life and the ministry of Jesus
[time=305] and in the overtone of what Satan was up to in that season it certainly was night but as we look at
[time=311] this we got to talk about Judas for just a minute then I'm going to give you some lessons from his life that we can learn Judas don't forget how to privilege seat to watch the son of God at work in the world the word became flesh and dwelt among us and he walked with him he watched the son of
[time=326] God walking and working in the world Judas appears about 20 times in the New Testament usually he's in
[time=332] the list of disciples and usually he's even listed last probably that's how you would see him as well
[time=338] we typically look at him that way but I'm reminded as you look at the story of verse 26 for the second
[time=344] time in this chapter it's the only time Simon the father of Judas is mentioned in scripture but two times in this chapter you're reminded that he had a father we're reminded that Judas was a real person in history Judas was someone who had a soul it has a soul and a heart and walked with Jesus
[time=361] and really felt all of the same kind of things that we felt sometimes we dehumanize Judas in the
[time=367] Christian world but he was a real human being and Simon was his father he had a father he was a son he was an influencer he was a person that Jesus came and died for so maybe we'd be reminded of
[time=378] that today and Jesus he was a friend of Judas he loved Judas he washed the feet of Judas so I'd
[time=385] say there's two ways that we can view Judas we can view Judas number one religiously and that's what we church people if you're a church person like me we tend to jump to this one pretty quick and we dehumanize and we view him religiously and we say what a terrible guy that guy was and we say aren't you glad you know somebody you say aren't you glad that we're not him that's that's truly
[time=406] kind of our default if we're honest is we view Judas religiously but I would say and I want to submit to you today that maybe for the first time in your whole spiritual journey you viewed Judas a second way and that is repentantly we viewed Judas through the lens of being a repentant
[time=421] center who is so dead and our trespasses and sins apart from Jesus Christ and instead of saying I'm so glad I'm not Judas we say I am Judas God save me for myself and save me for my sin
[time=436] and may I learn from what Jesus had to say and what Jesus did with a traitor
[time=442] that's how I would prefer us look at Judas I think that's how God would prefer us look at Judas today and here's the bottom line Judas is a reminder listen that apart from Jesus we are all
[time=453] in horrible shape and now that we know that let's learn some lessons from the life of Judas I want
[time=460] to give you four and then I'll give you some lessons from Jesus and how we dealt with Judas to make it really practical for you in your life so let's talk about lessons we can learn from Judas you ready for that number one this will go straight through some of what we just read here number one lessons we can learn from Jesus Judas knowing the word of God must lead us to surrender to the God
[time=479] of the word let that sink in for a minute because sometimes we're all about knowing the word of God and listen yes we should we've got the discipleship journey we always tell you go biblical before you go digital all of those things we're called to know the word of God but oftentimes we forget that Judas walked with the word of God he didn't just know the word of God he walked with the word of
[time=499] God he knew it intellectually but he also walked with the word that became flesh and dwelt among us
[time=506] so it's not enough to simply know the word knowing the word of God should lead us to know the God
[time=512] of the word personally how do we do that we do that through Jesus that's the progression we know him through his word the word of God is the revelation that God has given what does revelation mean what's the revelation of God it means God wants to reveal himself to us he wants to show us who he is why so that we can know the God of the word that's why the word of God is there and
[time=533] Judas is a reminder listen Judas went to the University of Jesus he listened to all of his Bible
[time=541] teaching he listened to all of the stories of Jesus he listened to the Old Testament law as Jesus taught it he went to the temple he had relationships with Christian people he looked the part
[time=552] but he didn't have that heart level relationship that Jesus came to establish and verse 22 reminds
[time=558] us that he was one of those disciples that is what a disciple is it's a student they sat at the feet of the teacher Jesus was the greatest teacher in all of humanity in all of history and Judas had him as a personal tutor so knowing the word of God's not enough by itself it starts there
[time=577] but it's got to get into our heart it's got to lead us to a place of surrender he didn't believe and he didn't trust and he didn't surrender and he didn't live it out he didn't do what the
[time=589] word says let's look at James chapter 1 verse 22 as a reminder of this do not merely listen to the word and so deceive yourselves do what it says that's the true test of growth that's the true test
[time=601] of what God is doing in us that doesn't mean we earn our salvation how many of you think you can earn yourself I just don't raise your hand because you can't it's so impossible you learned that as a child didn't you how many of you that are parents had to teach your kids to be little knuckleheads and little sinners around your house you didn't have to do that did you because we just do that naturally we can't do enough to earn our salvation but once we truly walk with Jesus and once we know
[time=624] the word enough to now surrender to the God of the word then it changes us and it transforms us
[time=630] from the inside out that's what the baptisms were all about that baptism didn't save anybody that baptism is kind of cold to be honest it wasn't even pleasant water but there were no little sins floating in there the sins of all of us who were in that tank were already washed away by the blood of Jesus it's an outward symbol that not only do we know the word of God but we know the God of the word who has saved us and transformed us for his glory that's what Jesus came to reveal and
[time=657] that is the opposite of what you see in the life of Judas Judas knew the bible but he didn't believe it applied it's got to go from head it's then got to go to our hearts and I've shared with you several times I'll do it many more especially as we go through the book of Colossians by the way we'll be in the book of Colossians if you want to order some commentaries or start reading ahead we're going to go verse by verse for 12 weeks through the book of Colossians in two weeks so we'll do messy this week and next week and then we'll be in the book of Colossians and it's going to be called maturity university we're going to be looking at spiritual maturity because Colossians give us a great outline of that and a premise of that is going to be what I'll tell you about Judas today is that spiritual maturity is not intellectual it's transformational God wants to
[time=697] transform you he wants to make you new he wants to give you a new life in Christ because first Corinthians eight one knowledge puffs up but love builds up my job and my calling and my passion
[time=710] every week as we say as I say you're ready for the word church is to get you into the word of God but what I can't do is transform you that's God's job that's God's part and you have a part to play in that is to make sure that you're letting the word of God I'm not I'm going to get you into the word of God but you've got to let God get the word of God into you during the week and make sure
[time=730] that you do that because just knowing it here and having all the Sunday school answers is not enough and Judas reminds us of that number two number two is that salvation cannot be lost
[time=741] aren't you glad of that salvation cannot be lost but it can be faked write that down salvation cannot be lost but it can be faked as we study Judas one of the first and you know obvious questions
[time=752] that we have to answer is well as a disciple of Jesus wasn't Judas saved and didn't he then lose his salvation and so the answer to that is no he didn't lose something that he didn't have and
[time=762] here's how we know that really simply put verse 27 you see that Satan entered him
[time=768] Satan entered him and what we know about being a follower of Jesus a son or a daughter of God a part of the family of God is that we are indwelled by the spirit of God we sung about it all morning we are indwelled by the spirit of the living God the same power that raised Jesus from
[time=783] the dead lives in us can I get an amen and because we believe that and because that is true listen
[time=789] Satan and God's spirit do not cohabitate so Satan cannot indwell Satan cannot possess a demon
[time=798] you talk about demon possession cannot possess that which is already held John chapter 10 in the hands of the Father and so what we know from this passage is that if Satan has entered into Judas that he faked something looked the part that he never really had to begin with and what I
[time=816] want to submit to you is a hard truth is when we look around our church body one of the greatest concerns burdens that I carry is that so many people I believe today look the part come to church
[time=829] just like Judas did know the answers walk the walk so to speak but deep on the inside there's no
[time=837] transformation that they're a fake friend of God that one day will hear the words depart for me
[time=845] I never knew you I don't say that to scare you other than to say you need to make sure of your
[time=851] salvation how do you make sure of your salvation what are you doing with Jesus because a lot of our minds immediately go to oh but I didn't apply the word enough oh this week I said no listen that's why Jesus came that's not how you know you're saved is if you're good enough if that's the case none of us would be saved we know that we are saved when we answer the question of surrender to Jesus Christ as our Lord as our Master and our Savior so I ask you today what have you done
[time=875] with Jesus that is how you can know that you know that you know that you are saved first John chapter
[time=882] five and verse 13 reminds us of this first John 5 13 John says I write these things to you who believe
[time=889] in the name of the Son of God that you may know somebody say no no not think not hope but know that
[time=896] you may know that you have eternal life oftentimes I'll say I want you to know that you know that you know that you know that you know that you know that you know no doubts I'm not here to plant down I'm here to give you certainty today that's what the word of God does is it transforms us from the inside out number three is that your heart follows your money another thing that we learn from Judas is that your heart follows your money Matthew chapter number six and verse 21 Jesus says this the best
[time=923] he says for where your treasure is there your heart will be also and we see that in life of Judas he was the treasurer he was entrusted with all of the resources to pay for all the things that Jesus and his disciples were doing and in verse 29 we see that Judas was that treasurer the disciples were wondering was he just going out to get bread what is he doing you know why is Jesus say that and what you're going to do do quickly we'll talk about that in just a minute and they thought well maybe it's because he's the treasurer and just for some pieces of silver Judas would go and do quickly
[time=952] what Satan had prompted him to do and his heart would follow his money and it's a good reminder
[time=959] for us and it's easy for us to look at Judas religiously and say shame on him I would never have done that but he stole from Jesus he stole from God but I want to ask you a hard question today is what are you robbing God from today what are you robbing from God do you know today that
[time=974] the average Christian gives to the Lord through their local church about 2.5 percent of their
[time=981] income I don't say all that to condemn anybody today but I hope I say that to remind us that the world is pulling us so quickly away from the heart of God with our money and maybe your money
[time=994] has become an idol and you didn't even realize it and God's going to use his word today to show you that that one way you could identify with Judas is that your heart may be following your money to all of these wrong places I don't say that because I want something from you for the church God's been taking care of this church for five plus decades and he's not done yet he doesn't need any of us yet he uses all of us I say that not because I want something from you or because God wants something from you but because God wants something for you and he wants your heart to follow your money so where your treasure is there your heart's going to go as well your heart's going to be there too so be a giving person so that you can then become a forgiving person so that you can then look a lot more like Jesus number four thing we can learn from Judas is and this oh I'm so
[time=1034] excited to share this with you if you feel condemned and discouraged already this morning I think this is going to lift your spirits number four is you cannot do someone else's part you can't do someone
[time=1044] else's part some of you came today just to hear that word from the Lord today you cannot do someone
[time=1052] else's part and verse 30 Judas immediately went out and it was night some of you have watched that
[time=1060] same story unfold someone that you love just like Jesus Jesus loved Judas so much you've watched them
[time=1066] go out immediately into self-destruction and you saw it coming and you pleaded with them not to take whatever those steps are but you've watched them go out destroy their life destroy your life
[time=1076] perhaps in the life of many others own their self-destruction pathway and it was night some of you were
[time=1084] in the night and some of you like me tend to carry burdens way more than God wants you to carry them
[time=1091] and I want to speak to your heart for just a minute please hear me there's three parts in every relationship we're looking at messy relationships there's God's part my part and their part sometimes
[time=1102] if you're like me you get so consumed with how God is or is not doing his part that you're so focused on God's part and their part that you should forget that God's only asking you to do your part listen you can't do God's part you can't and God doesn't want you to do his part he is
[time=1117] faithful he is capable he's the king of kings and the lord of lords he is the creator of the
[time=1123] universe you don't have to worry with God's part I know you think he's doing it wrong but he's better at it than you so don't be worried about God's part and the hardest part maybe don't miss this is you're so worried about their part and you've tried and you've pleaded and you've begged and maybe
[time=1138] you've beaten him over the head with a Bible don't do that by the way but maybe you already have and you've just beat this person down and they just won't see what you're trying to help them see and
[time=1147] you know you know the path that they're on but listen God today is not worried about you doing
[time=1154] their part for them they whoever they is they may or may not do their part they may or may not do
[time=1161] their part but God is faithful God will do his part God will work in their heart what God has
[time=1167] asked of you is to do your part you should ask yourself this question you should say God in this situation what is my part what is my part to offer forgiveness what is my part to offer an apology what is my part to offer reconciliation what is my part to give them the truth in love what is my
[time=1184] part to show them that I love them no matter what choices that they make and the list goes on God what is my part and once you ask that question you got to know they may or may not do their part
[time=1196] to respond to that truth but you can know God will do his part because he's faithful and he's good
[time=1202] and he's kind and he's compassionate so God just wants you to do your part be set free in that today
[time=1210] and that's something that we can learn from Judas because listen if Jesus the son of God who
[time=1217] walked with Judas was able to take that truth and apply it to a disciple relationship as he did
[time=1223] then so can we if Jesus who walked with Judas knew and there's a truth I'll share with you that
[time=1230] will show this in just a moment that not everybody was going to be a part of this kingdom he came to build then sometimes we have to do the same thing and I know it's painful but God wants to walk with you through that and I'm not saying give up on people because Jesus never gives up on us but sometimes we have to know that we did our part and put our head on our pillow and have peace with that be set free in that today and I want to give you now as we read the rest of this passage some things that we can learn from Jesus because wow that was kind of heavy stuff a lot that we learned from Judas but what do we do in the throes of walking through that so let's reverse this 31 through 33 to start and I'll share a few things about Jesus here you guys good let's dig in together
[time=1269] verse 31 when he had gone out meaning when Judas had left so think about this it feels like let me
[time=1275] pause us it feels like Jesus is about to change the subject it's like okay well we're just going to a whole new thing no he's not and I want to prove it to you today so let's read what Jesus has to say about it he says now is the son of man glorified and God is glorified in him if God
[time=1291] is glorified in him God will also glorify him in himself and glorify him at once a lot of glory
[time=1297] little children verse 33 yet a little while I am with you you will seek me just as I said to the
[time=1303] Jews so now I also say to you where I'm going you cannot come he's saying I'm going to go to heaven I'm going to die I'm going to be raised I'm going to ascend it's the story he's been telling them and he's telling them that the time is now you can't come yet but he's making a pathway for them to be able to join him but glory God's going to get glory is now what we're saying doesn't seem to make a
[time=1323] lot of sense does it that God would be glorified through what Judas just did but Jesus knew don't miss this Jesus knew that by his death salvation would come that by his death he would then have
[time=1334] that opportunity for God to raise him back to life and through that resurrection that salvation
[time=1340] and hope would be brought listen Jesus knew that even through all of the evil that Satan was bringing about through Judas that God would take that which the enemy meant for evil and use it for the ultimate
[time=1352] good of his kingdom and for his glory and the same is true of us and the same is true for you and
[time=1358] the same is true for what God's doing around you even through the evil that maybe is being done to you or even by you there is hope that is bigger than your sin there is a hope that is bigger than
[time=1370] betrayal there is a hope that is bigger than all of the evil that the enemy is throwing at you these
[time=1376] days and his name is Jesus Christ and that is why the response of Jesus to the betrayal of Jesus
[time=1383] after he had gone out is that God's now going to get glory you can say the same thing in your world today and then you may not have known verses 34 and 35 are in the context of Judas but they were and so let's read and then maybe familiar verses to you then Jesus said a new commandment I give to you that you love one another just as I have loved you you also are to love
[time=1403] one another by this all people will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another
[time=1411] he said that in the context of betrayal of God getting glory and bringing good through evil that
[time=1418] other people were bringing about in and around the life of Jesus wow maybe you've never caught that and
[time=1424] maybe that changes the way you see it I think it should because as we look at this today he says first of all a new command I give you in your life that's not they were like that's not a new command that's the oldest one in the book Jesus to love your neighbor right that's the oldest command that there is and he said no let me tell you what makes it new I want you to love as I have loved you and he's making this application in the midst of betrayal Jesus and
[time=1447] traitors we're looking at today even when people betray you the world's going to know that you're
[time=1453] my disciples if you love as I have loved you even when you're betrayed even when others don't do their part even when sin abounds even when you're so confounded by the craziness of the world even
[time=1466] when blank love as I have loved you this is the context of that command and I don't know if you're
[time=1473] like me but when I face times of betrayal I tend to kind of wall off and say well I'm not trusting
[time=1479] people again bunch of knuckleheads bunch of whatever else you might call them and whatever you might do however you do that you wall off though but Jesus is saying I've got a better way I want you to love the way that I loved and I showed you even through betrayal how to do that so
[time=1494] let's talk about that I want to give you five things to tile this together for us today lessons that we learned from Jesus on dealing with betrayal right these down number one is acknowledge your own sinfulness now I'm not saying Jesus did that because Jesus did not ever sin Jesus never sin
[time=1509] yet Jesus helped those around him in giving them a model for dealing with betrayal help them see that
[time=1515] like hey you've got to acknowledge that you are a Judas too even though Jesus wasn't even though he knew no sin this is where he started let me show you he didn't sin but he called Judas friend didn't he he called Judas friend but what did he call Peter he called him a lot of things because Peter was a lot of things but one of the things that Jesus called Peter was Satan when he got in
[time=1535] the way following the story he would get in the way to try to protect Jesus and Jesus said hey you get behind me Satan why because Peter was getting in the way of the mission of what Jesus came to
[time=1546] do and he said get behind me Satan and in this and the same thing happens with Peter if you keep reading in the next verses before we get to chapter 14 which we'll look at next week Jesus and doubters you don't want to miss that Thomas Jesus and the doubters he's the way the truth and the life this is what comes after it but right before that he tells Peter who says I'll never deny you Lord he tells him you're going to die me three times before the rooster crows that's exactly what Peter did the first step for you and for me in dealing with betrayal
[time=1571] with traders with hurt with evil with sin is acknowledging our own sinfulness and Jesus helped his disciples do that well and the more we recognize our own sin our own habits our own hurts our own
[time=1584] hang-ups the more that we recognize how much God has forgiven us the more we can look like Jesus
[time=1590] and love like Jesus loved even when people betray us so number one acknowledge your own
[time=1596] sinfulness number two know that the church is full of wheat and weeds I'm not going to be able to
[time=1603] preach this passage to you today but there's a lot to preach there but Jesus told a story about wheat and weeds and it's in Matthew chapter 13 you could read the whole thing and he even gives an explanation of that passage and of that parable to his disciples at the end of the passage Matthew 13 24 through 43 good devotional material for you to follow up with this week but here's what you should know is that the kingdom of God was being described as all of Jesus parables did and as the the word was sown as this kingdom was sown there was wheat but with the wheat so there's fruit there's harvest there's people who would accept that there's sons and daughters of the king who would come into the family of God but at the same time weeds were sown and weeds sprung up with the
[time=1640] wheat and I've learned even in the church setting it's tough because salvation cannot be lost but
[time=1646] it can be faked and and I'm not here to judge anybody's salvation there's only one who can do that I'm here to talk about the salvation and the one that can give salvation and God is the one and that's the point of this parable is that he's the judge of salvation and he says no let the weeds grow they're going to be there together and sometimes you're going to have trouble seeing and telling them apart I mean there's all kind of applications to that but the bottom line is this is that I want us to know and God wants us to know as we deal with betrayal to number one acknowledge our own sinfulness number two know that there's going to be weeds with the wheat expect that there's
[time=1677] going to be opposition expect if there's going to be junk and sometimes the junk and sometimes the weeds is going to come from people who you thought were friends people who you thought were a believer and maybe they are Satan even uses believers sometimes can I get an amen you know that because
[time=1692] he's used you before and he's used others before I've lost sight of what I'm supposed to stay focused
[time=1698] on so many times and I've been a tool not of God but of the enemy sometimes you do too in your
[time=1704] sinfulness that's a hard truth but I'm so glad that even in those moments I'm still held by my father he doesn't give up on me and he helps me refocus but we got to know that at the end Jesus will sort
[time=1715] all that out listen this is a hard truth but some of you need it stop trying to sort out the wheat
[time=1721] and the weeds that job belongs to Jesus stop trying to fix all of those people
[time=1729] focus on your part and stop letting their part how they are or they're not doing it keep you held
[time=1735] back from what God wants to do in your life and through your life I figured it'd be quiet
[time=1741] but it's true and Jesus wants to help us walk through that life trusting listen entrusting
[time=1748] ourselves Peter writes entrusting ourselves to the one who judges justly it's his job but know that we're going to be in the midst of wheat and of weeds in our lives as we walk through this life but Jesus loved and served listen the Judas just as much as he did the John let me say that again Jesus
[time=1766] loved and served the Judas just as much as he did the John we're called to do the same thing the
[time=1773] wheat the weeds he knew but he loved and he served number three and here's where it gets really practical for us don't let evil people affect your integrity don't let evil people or evil actions
[time=1785] affect your integrity the example of Jesus write this down it's not in your notes but write this down Judas did not change Jesus Judas did not change Jesus all of the things that happened to him
[time=1799] did not change the integrity did not change the course did not change the mission did not change the purpose did not change the call did not change the focus of Jesus Christ he stayed focus on
[time=1810] the mission so don't let evil people affect your integrity I want to remind you today that your identity if you're a child of God if you're a son of the king a daughter of the king today if you're a part of the family of God if you have surrendered your life to Jesus today your identity is not based on your sin or on the sin of other people your identity is based on what Jesus did on
[time=1832] the cross his death his burial his resurrection nothing and no one can take that from you and nothing in no one can rob you of the identity that you get from that sacrifice but sometimes we let
[time=1844] our identity get wrapped up in what other people do to us or maybe what we've done to other people and we just get so out of whack don't we and I want to remind you today just to not let
[time=1854] the retaliation mindset that we live in in our world today rob you of the joy of what it is to
[time=1860] follow Jesus even in the midst of evil things and evil times a couple of scriptures from the new living translation our e-t Romans 12 17 never pay back evil with more evil do things in such a way
[time=1871] that everyone can see you are honorable I pray I can do that well because that's exactly what Jesus
[time=1877] did Romans 12 17 1 Peter 3 9 don't repay evil for evil don't retaliate with insults when people
[time=1884] insult you instead pay them back with a blessing it's what Jesus did that is what God has called you to do and he will grant you his blessings don't let evil people or evil actions or betrayal
[time=1896] affect your integrity number four forgive as you've been forgiven forgiveness a lot of times we say
[time=1903] I'm not helping them by forgiving them you're changing you're allowing Jesus to transform your heart when you forgive even if they have nothing to do with it even if they're not even on this earth to forgive in person anymore you need to take that kind of step why because you're in chains
[time=1918] of bondage until you do often heard that not forgiving bitterness resentfulness and unforgiveness
[time=1925] is like drinking poison and thinking it's going to affect the person that you're mad at it doesn't
[time=1931] do anything to them but it just heaps bitterness and condemnation and distraction on your life
[time=1938] forgive as you've been forgiven that's why number one is acknowledge your own sinfulness when you realize how much you've been forgiven you become more of a forgiving person and Jesus models so
[time=1947] much what forgiveness looks like even when it's not deserved and I want to read a couple of verses to Colossians 3 13 bear with one another and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance
[time=1958] against someone forgive as the Lord forgave you Ephesians 4 32 be kind to one another tenderhearted
[time=1965] forgiving one another as God in Christ forgave you how did Jesus forgive you I think the best
[time=1971] verse I could read to you is Luke 23 and verse 34 which is Jesus hanging on the cross and not only has Judas betrayed him but everybody else is turning their back on him and
[time=1981] if ever there's a time and a full level of pain that none of us could ever even fathom going through
[time=1988] this is it for Jesus but what did he say father forgive them well they know not what they do
[time=1994] may we live that kind of forgiveness may you write a letter to that person whether they're
[time=2001] gonna read it or can read it and burn it rip it up throw it away whatever it is you need to do something tangible I've walked with many people I've done that in my own life because you need to release whatever it is that the enemy is using to hold you back from what God's got on the inside of you forgive as you've been forgiven and last but not least number five don't misinterpret your opposition don't misinterpret your opposition here's what I mean by that so many times we often associate God with blessings we associate God with times of comfort when things are going
[time=2030] well we associate God with the good things in life and then associate everything bad all the challenges all the problems all the oppositions we associate that with the devil and now there's a lot of truth to that because certainly God is the giver of all good things and every blessing and every piece of comfort he's given in your life you should give him all the credit for that but sometimes we give Satan too much credit and yeah he's probably in the middle of whatever evil whatever
[time=2052] bad whatever challenge you're in the middle of but listen God will often take the stuff that we just want to turn our back on and listen we'll run away from it even we'll run away from the pain we'll run away from working through a conflict in a relationship with other messy people and what we'll often do is at the same time we're praying for God to give opportunity we're praying for God's blessings we're praying for God's provision we often run away from that which we're praying for because what we do is we say well that's just of the devil but I want to remind you that whatever opposition whatever conflict whatever betrayal whatever pain you're facing right now
[time=2085] God is ready to redeem it for his glory and for your good because all things work together for the
[time=2092] good of those who love God and those who are the called according to his purposes God is ready to take the opposition and the pain and that you're trying to just run away from and escape from and help you face it and help you go through the valley of the shadow of death not to it but through it so that he can do something in you and through you even through your opposition so don't misinterpret your opposition Romans chapter 5 captures this so well read it to you Romans 5
[time=2119] 3 through 4 we can rejoice too when we run into problems and trials for we know that they help us develop endurance and endurance develop strength of character and character strengthens our confident
[time=2130] hope in salvation my friends oftentimes with the Lord the opportunity that you're praying for comes
[time=2137] through the opposition you're trying to run away from the dirt that others that Satan wants to use against you God wants to take it and make it a soil a rich fertile soil through which the seed
[time=2148] of his word and his character can spring up a new purpose and a new thing inside of you this is a
[time=2155] good look at Jesus and traitors and maybe it's a good look at you and blank whatever it is that you face to that pray that it has encouraged you and we can look a little more like Jesus love the
[time=2166] way that he's loved even when it's most difficult in our messy relationships I want to ask you to bow your heads ponder that for a few minutes I want to give you a chance to respond whether you're
[time=2176] watching us on a screen you're in the room believers that are in the room I want to ask you today what relationship do you need to apply these principles to just pick one today you may say well I got 12 well let's just start with one this week and see what God does what relationship does God wants you to apply these principles to this week some of you are here and you would say man
[time=2196] I've realized today when you said I am Judas I've realized I am Judas and I am a sinner and all of us are sinners and because of our sin we all fall short of the glory of God and we all need a Savior we all need salvation and God's tugging on your heart the Spirit of God is prompting you to make that step of surrender you've known in your head perhaps who Jesus is but today God's doing
[time=2217] something in your heart and it's time to lay down your life to trust in Jesus for salvation and nothing in no one else that's you today I'm going to lead you in a prayer is your heart screaming prayer does it save you it's your heart being transformed and turned over to Jesus that saves you and if that's you offer it to him let him know that you believe he is who he says he is ask him to forgive you and save you and he's going to do that today let him know that you know he died for you and then he's alive today surrender your life to him in your own words and he will save you right now take this moment of pause and don't miss what God's doing in your heart
