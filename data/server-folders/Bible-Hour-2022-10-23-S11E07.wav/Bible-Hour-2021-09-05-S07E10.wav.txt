[time=0] 1 Jesus and doubters, John 14, we will look at the first 11 verses today.
[time=6] And so let me ask you this question as we kick off today.
[time=10] Do you ever have doubts?
[time=12] Why do you all laugh?
[time=15] You're afraid to answer.
[time=17] It's not a trick question.
[time=18] You can all nod.
[time=19] Do you ever have doubts?
[time=21] I have doubts.
[time=22] I know some of you are like, I don't want to go to a church that has a pastor who has doubts.
[time=27] Well, good luck finding one.
[time=29] And I ain't it.
[time=30] I can tell you that.
[time=31] I have doubts sometimes.
[time=34] We doubt things in life.
[time=35] Our minds wonder and situations arise that make us question things and Jesus dealt with people who had doubts.
[time=42] And he met them in the middle of their doubts.
[time=44] And so let's talk about that today.
[time=46] We're looking at doubting Thomas and then a little bit Philip as well in this passage.
[time=50] And so as you look at these doubts, I want to talk to you a little bit about the doubts and the context.
[time=56] I've read this passage over and over throughout my Christian journey.
[time=60] Perhaps you have two.
[time=61] This is the verse, John 14, 6.
[time=62] It was a memory verse for me at a young age.
[time=64] Jesus said I'm the way, the truth and the life and no one comes with the Father except through him.
[time=67] But the context of this is actually doubts but even bigger than the context being surrounding doubts.
[time=74] The context is Jesus really teaching about God as his Father.
[time=78] And I've never really noticed it quite at the level I have over these past few weeks as we've looked at this message and getting it ready for it.
[time=85] In fact, Jesus talks about God as his Father very frequently.
[time=88] God is referred to as Father over 160 times in the Bible.
[time=93] Over 100 of those 160 times can be found in John's account of the life of Jesus.
[time=99] It's interesting, John was a best friend of Jesus.
[time=102] He would have been as close in his inner circle as anybody else in his life.
[time=106] And he recorded how much Jesus focused on God as a Father over 100 times.
[time=111] And you see that in his writing, 10 of those are in this chapter that we're looking at today.
[time=115] And in the chapters of John 13 through 17, you see the word Father 53 times.
[time=122] And so what a context that John has laid out for us about Jesus, about understanding and walking through doubts.
[time=130] But doing so kind of in this context of seeing God as our Father.
[time=134] So really the five things I want us to look at today are five doubts that Jesus spoke into that related to the Father.
[time=140] And so to set the course for that, let's read the Word of God.
[time=143] So John chapter 14 verses 1 through 11.
[time=146] And as I read these verses today, here's how I want you to hear them.
[time=150] These are red letters in my Bible.
[time=151] Look at your Bible.
[time=152] Red in yours too, perhaps.
[time=154] I don't know if you know what that means, but that means these were the actual words of Jesus.
[time=159] And so I want us to read them as such.
[time=162] These are words that Jesus himself has spoken to you, a doubter like you, just like a doubter like Thomas.
[time=169] These are words directly from the mouth of Jesus as he wants to speak into your own doubts pertaining to your Father and what this world can often bring about in our minds.
[time=178] So let's read it as such together.
[time=180] You ready for the Word today, black car?
[time=182] John chapter 14, let's read the first 11 verses.
[time=184] Jesus says, "Let not your hearts be troubled.
[time=187] Believe in God.
[time=188] Believe also in me.
[time=189] In my Father's house are many rooms.
[time=191] If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you.
[time=196] And if I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself that where I am, there you may be also."
[time=206] And you know the way to where I'm going.
[time=208] Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going.
[time=211] How can we know the way?" Jesus said to him, "I am the way and the truth and the life." No one comes to the Father except through me.
[time=221] If you had known me, you would have known my Father also.
[time=225] And from now on, you do know Him and have seen Him.
[time=229] Philip said to him, "Lord, show us the Father and it is enough for us." Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you so long and you still do not know me, Philip?
[time=237] Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.
[time=240] How can you say show us the Father?
[time=242] Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me?" The words that I say to you, I do not speak on my own authority, but the Father who dwells in me does His works.
[time=253] Believe me that I am in the Father and that the Father is in me, or else believe on account of the works themselves.
[time=260] And what Jesus is saying there is that, "Hey, I've taught you these things.
[time=264] I've told you these things, but even if you won't believe me," he's saying, "Believe me that we are one, but if you don't, just look around.
[time=270] Look at the works that have happened." He's saying, "Look at all that I have done in your life.
[time=274] Look at all the Father has done in sending me, and look what I have done in you and through you," when he says the works and the accounts that he's talking about here.
[time=283] He's saying, "Look around.
[time=284] Look at the fact that the Father has sent me.
[time=286] The Father wants you to know Him." So you see the context of all of these doubts really are focused on the Father.
[time=293] So I want to give you five doubts about the Father that Jesus spoke into, and maybe you can relate with some of these doubts.
[time=299] Number one comes from verse one, right this down.
[time=301] It's the Father's goodness.
[time=305] You ever doubt the goodness of God?
[time=309] You ever been in a season where you see all the bad things that happen in life and say, "Man, how could a good God allow such terrible things to happen?" You'd be in good company if you said yes, and in fact you see some of that here.
[time=321] It's kind of the beginning point in verse one.
[time=323] The first part of the verse says, "Let not your hearts be troubled." And we got to unpack that for a minute because it's interesting.
[time=329] What Jesus is not saying is that you're not going to have trouble and your heart won't be troubled.
[time=333] Yet he says, "Don't let your hearts be troubled." We're going to look at the context of that and unpack that further.
[time=337] Here's how I know.
[time=338] Going back one chapter, John 13, this is when Judas betrayed Jesus.
[time=342] Jesus knew Judas was about to betray him.
[time=344] He's in his inner circle.
[time=346] And in verse 21 of John chapter 13, look there as it's just on the next page over.
[time=351] You can just see it there.
[time=352] Verse 21, it says that Jesus was troubled in his spirit.
[time=358] This is the same Jesus who just a couple of chapters later, John chapter 16 in verse 33.
[time=363] He says, "Hey disciples, hey you and me.
[time=365] I'm telling you these things so that in me you can have peace.
[time=368] In the world you will have trouble or tribulation.
[time=373] But take heart because I have overcome the world." So let me tell you what Jesus is not saying at the beginning of verse one.
[time=380] He's not saying you're not going to have trouble.
[time=382] He's not saying that your spirit and your heart is not going to be troubled sometimes.
[time=387] He is saying that you will have trouble, but I don't want trouble to have you.
[time=394] Because I have overcome the world.
[time=397] Let not your hearts be troubled.
[time=398] What does he say next?
[time=399] Believe in God.
[time=400] Believe also in me.
[time=402] Here's what Jesus is not telling you.
[time=403] He's not saying that faith and belief is the absence of doubt.
[time=408] Jesus is saying that you overcome your doubt by having faith and belief in me.
[time=413] When the trouble comes.
[time=414] When the pain is present.
[time=416] When your doubts are there.
[time=418] When you're troubled in your spirit and anxiety starts to rise up.
[time=421] You may have that trouble, but that trouble doesn't have to have you.
[time=425] Because I have whatever is troubling you in the palm of my hand.
[time=429] I have overcome the world.
[time=430] So don't let your hearts be troubled.
[time=432] Believe in God.
[time=433] And believe also in me knowing that I have overcome the world.
[time=437] Belief and faith is not the absence of doubt.
[time=441] Look at me.
[time=442] Jesus isn't afraid of your doubts.
[time=444] Sometimes it's like we try to hide our doubts from Jesus thinking what I wanted to find out I'm thinking that.
[time=449] Spoiler alert.
[time=450] He already knows.
[time=454] You might ought to just own it.
[time=455] Jesus is not saying you shouldn't ever have doubts.
[time=457] Look how he deals with those who have doubts.
[time=459] Even about the goodness of God.
[time=460] That's why he's saying don't let your hearts be troubled.
[time=462] I know you feel troubled.
[time=463] I know there is trouble.
[time=465] But you can have a faith.
[time=467] You can have a belief that walks you through the doubts.
[time=471] That walks you through the troubles.
[time=473] Jesus just doesn't want you Psalm 23, the 23rd Psalm.
[time=476] Jesus doesn't want your troubles to become a valley that you get stuck in.
[time=481] Jesus doesn't want you to pitch a tent in the valley of the shadow of death.
[time=485] The verse says even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.
[time=490] Not though I walk to the valley of the shadow of death.
[time=494] I'm so thankful that Jesus starts this verse with this in mind about the goodness of God.
[time=499] And that's why we can have faith even when bad things occur.
[time=503] What becomes bad and what becomes consuming for us when we are troubled, we run into troubles in our life is when we make it this burden.
[time=511] This backpack of burden that we carry around.
[time=514] What Jesus is teaching us and has taught us through his ministry to do.
[time=517] Even as we look at the gospel of John is to take the backpack of your burdens.
[time=520] Lay him at the foot of the cross to transfer the burden to Jesus.
[time=524] Jesus said my yoke is easy.
[time=526] My burden is light.
[time=527] He's saying I will carry you.
[time=529] Ever seen the footprints in the sand story?
[time=531] I don't have time to preach it because we got four more points today.
[time=534] But you should look it up, Google the footprint story.
[time=536] And what you'll find is those times where you thought he wasn't there.
[time=539] There's only one set of footprints in the sand.
[time=541] It was because he was not just carrying your burdens.
[time=543] He was carrying you.
[time=545] That's the kind of God who is speaking about the goodness of God today.
[time=548] What Jesus wants us to learn to do is to do our part.
[time=551] If you were with us last week, to do your part, to do your part and to trust God.
[time=556] This is the believe in God, believe also in me.
[time=558] Second part of verse one, to trust God to do what you cannot do.
[time=562] And in case you're not in touch with the reality of your own doubts, because some of you are self-deceived today, and you're saying I'm good.
[time=570] And I don't feel the stress of that.
[time=572] And maybe you're right.
[time=573] I hope you are.
[time=574] But time will pass and doubts will come and troubling will come in your spirit.
[time=579] And just to help you get in touch with maybe some of the realities, I'm going to show you some images that may jog your memory of just reasons we have to be in doubt.
[time=585] This is Afghanistan.
[time=586] If you've been watching the news, I've shared, we've prayed as a church.
[time=589] This is one of the evacuations, one of the cargo planes that perhaps you've seen on the news.
[time=594] And this has become an every night topic at our house.
[time=596] And our kids, when we say prayers at night, we pray for these people specifically for the church, the brothers and sisters in Christ who are being persecuted for their fate, for standing for Jesus, even to the point of potentially losing their lives, for all of the trauma, all of the problems that are going on there.
[time=612] And it has become something that's hard to do, but not only does it help us see that like, "Wow, the trouble that I think I have here is not quite so big after all for my kids, for me." And it's hard to put your kids in touch with realities, isn't it?
[time=627] Parents, especially when they're young, but here's what I've learned.
[time=630] I've learned that there's so much power in helping your kids see some of the realities of the world, because it's through that that they can truly see the power of faith.
[time=638] And as my kids have prayed, I've watched their hearts break.
[time=643] And my friends, listen, our hearts should always break for what break the heart of God.
[time=650] And I pray yours does, and I pray that this jogs your memory not just of trouble in the world, but maybe what God's doing inside of you.
[time=657] Here's another one.
[time=658] There are wars.
[time=659] And how could a good God let a young lady like this walk through a place that's ravaged the way that this place has been, and people are so lonely and people are so hurting.
[time=669] The world's full of so much pain, so much hatred.
[time=672] And in fact, in the last couple of years we've seen pictures like this one over and over division in our world where there's just, and listen, right now some of your blood pressure's going up.
[time=680] I'm putting you in touch with your own reality, because some of you right now are politicizing all of this.
[time=684] And you're like, "Yeah, but if so and so would do so and so, and this person would do that." And you might be right, but listen, what I wanted to show you today is so many times we get consumed with all of the sides.
[time=695] And I did a message here in the middle of when all of this stuff was going on called "Choose Jesus, not sides." And that's what I want to challenge you to do again today, because some of your blood pressure is rising and you realize, "I'm so consumed by my troubles that I'm missing what Jesus wants to do in me in the midst of those trouble and even the divisions." And even the hurricanes, like this one, hurricane.
[time=715] We got that one.
[time=716] There it is, hurricane.
[time=717] Yeah, some of you, this is like what's going on inside of you right now.
[time=720] And this is a heartbreaking natural disaster here, and it leads to things like floods in our world.
[time=725] And it leads to, dare I say it, this global pandemic that has been afoot for some time.
[time=734] Things like this can often cause us to doubt the goodness of God.
[time=741] They cause us to doubt, does he really care?
[time=744] They cause us to doubt, is he really who he says he is?
[time=747] And Jesus says, "Believe in God, believe also in me." Listen, belief is not the absence of doubt.
[time=752] It's not the absence even of the fears that you fight with.
[time=755] Belief, this trust, this faith in God is the platform upon which you stand to get through all of the doubts, to get through all of the fears.
[time=763] It's the venue through which when this kind of stuff, how many of you just are like, "I'm just so tired of this.
[time=768] I'm ready to go.
[time=769] You just want the picture to go away." Right?
[time=771] And we feel so stuck and we feel so consumed in our hearts, feel troubled just like Jesus in John 13, but he says to you today, you don't have to let your hearts be troubled.
[time=779] You may have trouble, but trouble doesn't have to have you.
[time=781] You can believe in me and that doesn't mean that it's the absence of fear.
[time=784] It doesn't mean it's the absence of doubt.
[time=786] It means that I'm going to get you through it.
[time=788] Listen, here's what that belief is.
[time=790] It's even when you can't see it, even when you can't feel it.
[time=796] And even when you can't explain it, you have faith and you believe and you trust
[time=802] in an outcome that a God has promised you, even though this world says it will never ever come.
[time=808] Faith is the substance of the things that we hope for.
[time=811] Faith is what we hold on to when we can't see, when we can't feel, and when we can't explain what's going on.
[time=818] I have doubts, but faith carries me through them.
[time=821] And on the other side of my doubts lie the promises of God.
[time=824] I don't want to remind you of that today.
[time=826] I know you got doubts.
[time=827] I got doubts too.
[time=828] You got a pastor who has doubts.
[time=830] Who knew?
[time=832] You may want to find a different church where there's a pastor who doesn't have doubts, but you're not going to find that and you're not going to find a neighbor and you're not going to find a family member who doesn't have them, but God wants to work in you through that.
[time=841] So sometimes we doubt the Father's goodness.
[time=842] Jesus spoke into that in verse 1.
[time=844] And verse 2, right down to the Father's house.
[time=847] Number 2, the Father's house.
[time=849] Verse 2, look what Jesus says in verse 2.
[time=851] This is about heaven.
[time=852] In my Father's house are many rooms.
[time=854] He's saying there's plenty of room for you, and there's plenty to do, and there's plenty for you there.
[time=859] It's just an overwhelming nature that we cannot even, environment, culture, place that we can't even begin to fathom.
[time=868] There are many rooms.
[time=869] If it were not so, what I've told you that I go to prepare a place for you.
[time=872] In my Father's house are many rooms.
[time=874] Jesus is talking about heaven, and I want to do a little experiment, and I want you to be honest.
[time=877] Not just Sunday school answers because we know, you know, the Sunday school answer.
[time=880] Jesus.
[time=881] And you're right.
[time=882] That's always the right answer.
[time=883] Jesus is always the answer.
[time=884] But really in your heart of hearts, when I say the word heaven, what images come to mind?
[time=889] Say it out loud.
[time=890] We're going to talk today in church because you all let sleep you on a holiday weekend.
[time=893] Shout it out.
[time=894] The pearly gates.
[time=895] What else?
[time=896] The golden streets.
[time=898] Streets of gold.
[time=899] Keep on going.
[time=900] Okay.
[time=901] Rivers.
[time=902] Keep going.
[time=903] Peace.
[time=904] Jesus.
[time=905] There it is.
[time=906] You saved it to the fifth one.
[time=908] That's good.
[time=909] What's that?
[time=911] No darkness.
[time=912] I love it.
[time=914] Sounds good, doesn't it?
[time=915] Yeah.
[time=916] Here's the thing.
[time=917] I don't know about you.
[time=918] You guys do good.
[time=919] This is a spiritually mature group.
[time=920] You guys that are watching online, right in the chat, too, want to hear your answers as well.
[time=924] A lot of times, though, in society, you'll hear things like harps, and clouds, and angels, because in that the picture that gets painted of heaven.
[time=933] And because of that picture, I'm going to share something with you that you might be surprised to hear.
[time=938] I really struggled with a longing for heaven as a believer.
[time=942] I was saved at a young age, even in my high school.
[time=944] And even in seminary some, you guys were like, what kind of pastor?
[time=947] He has doubts, and he didn't want to go to heaven.
[time=949] What kind of guy is this?
[time=951] I'm a real one.
[time=952] I'm sorry.
[time=953] I'm just being real with you.
[time=954] I struggled with really longing for all these images of like, you know, singing and choirs and formal, you know, sitting there like, and listen, I'm not down playing that I want to, I can't even imagine what I'm going to do when I see my Jesus.
[time=967] I'll be on my face.
[time=968] I can promise you that.
[time=969] But the stuff that, at least in my mind, that culture had filled me with that and followed.
[time=974] I'm like, I don't think I really want any of that to do all that forever.
[time=977] Is that okay to say in church?
[time=979] I was like, I'm not real sure.
[time=981] And the Bible says, you know, we're going to be known as we're known.
[time=983] But what about all these blended families?
[time=985] And like, how can it be a perfect environment where every tear is wiped away and you're there with all these people and they're going to know you and are they really going to know you?
[time=991] And I had all these questions and I ducked them.
[time=993] And listen, some of you are like, oh, I thought it was just me.
[time=996] I thank God for a pastor.
[time=997] Some of you are judging me right now.
[time=999] Don't be doing that.
[time=1000] God will take care of you.
[time=1001] But some of you are going, man, I am so glad that this pastor finally said something.
[time=1006] By the way, that's what Thomas is.
[time=1008] I call him honest, Thomas.
[time=1009] He just says what everybody's thinking.
[time=1011] He really isn't that much of a doubting Thomas anymore than doubting whoever, doubting Peter, doubting whoever.
[time=1017] He just says what a lot of people are thinking.
[time=1018] Some of you are like, I'm so glad he said that because I have doubts about heaven too, the Father's house.
[time=1023] And so I want to give you a resource and I don't have time to preach all of it and share all of it.
[time=1027] I'd like to maybe one day do a series just on heaven one day.
[time=1030] So that we can really long for it, have a homesickness for what's going to lie here.
[time=1036] But here's a great resource.
[time=1037] Randy Alcorn wrote a book appropriately named called heaven.
[time=1039] You should Google it.
[time=1041] There's so many great resources out there.
[time=1042] This answers a lot of those questions and it fostered inside of me a longing for heaven that I had never had until I had read this book.
[time=1050] I'm going to tell you that even as a pastor because it filled in some blanks biblically for me that I had maybe even subconsciously been allowing culture to live for me regarding the Father's house.
[time=1061] So maybe you can relate.
[time=1062] Maybe you're just still judging me.
[time=1064] Maybe that helps you today.
[time=1065] Here's a quote from his book.
[time=1067] He says, "Nothing is more misdiagnosed than our homesickness for heaven." We think that we want sex, drugs, alcohol, a new job, a raise, a doctorate, a spouse,
[time=1079] a large screen television, a new car, a cabin in the woods, a condo in Hawaii.
[time=1083] What we really want is the person we were made for, Jesus.
[time=1089] And the place we were made for, heaven, nothing less can satisfy us.
[time=1096] I believe that to be true.
[time=1097] Do you believe that to be true?
[time=1099] And I pray that that resource can help you dig further into that truth.
[time=1101] And it's going to help you see things like what Scripture tells us.
[time=1103] 1 Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 9 says this.
[time=1106] The Apostle Paul writes, "This is what the Scriptures mean when they say, 'No eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined what God has prepared for those who love him.'" Love that verse because Jesus said, "I'm going to prepare a place for you." And Paul is reminding us today.
[time=1121] No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has even imagined what is being prepared for us who love God.
[time=1128] And that's what Jesus says at the end of verse 2.
[time=1130] He says, "I go to prepare a place for." He says it multiple times here in this passage.
[time=1133] And here's what I want to remind you about that.
[time=1135] Look up here for a second at home too.
[time=1136] Look at that screen.
[time=1137] Jesus is ahead of you.
[time=1141] And here's why I say that.
[time=1142] Sometimes, if you're like me, we think Jesus is behind us.
[time=1146] We think, well, if God would just do things this way, it's very clear, God.
[time=1151] It's black and white.
[time=1152] You ever been that and you're like, well, you'd never admit it.
[time=1155] But like, if God you would just do things this way, things would go better.
[time=1159] And so it feels, and we put Jesus behind us.
[time=1162] I came to remind somebody today that Jesus is always way out in front of you.
[time=1167] That which is keeping you up at night right now, that you are so filled with anxiety over.
[time=1172] Jesus is sleeping just by He ain't sleeping because there's none of that up there.
[time=1175] But if He was, He'd be sleeping.
[time=1177] Jesus is not worried about what you're worried about.
[time=1180] That that is keeping you up at night right now.
[time=1182] That that is surprising you.
[time=1184] He is not surprised by it.
[time=1185] He is not worried about it.
[time=1187] He is ahead of us.
[time=1189] He is already preparing a place for us.
[time=1192] He's already won the victory.
[time=1194] And He's already preparing a place for what eternal life is going to look like in the Father's house as we live in the Father's goodness.
[time=1200] Because by Jesus and His Word, He is coming back.
[time=1204] And when He does, He's going to take us to be there forever.
[time=1207] Do you believe it?
[time=1208] Celebrate it in this place today.
[time=1212] And as you process that, let's go to number three.
[time=1214] I jumped to add to it anyway.
[time=1215] It's the Father's coming.
[time=1216] He is coming back.
[time=1217] Write that down.
[time=1218] We have doubts about the Father's coming.
[time=1220] You know, we've talked for centuries.
[time=1222] Jesus is coming back.
[time=1223] Today could be the day.
[time=1224] And the Bible makes it really clear only the Father knows the day and time.
[time=1227] But yet we often get very consumed with the when and the how that He's going to come back.
[time=1232] Maybe so much to the point where we start to doubt it if it's even going to happen.
[time=1236] And maybe you're even at that place today.
[time=1238] And that's what Jesus talks about here in verse three.
[time=1240] Look there with me what He continues and says.
[time=1242] And if I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again.
[time=1246] And we'll take you to myself that where I am, you may be also.
[time=1250] When you read verse three, here's what I hope you can take away.
[time=1253] I hope you can take away this simple statement that God wants to spend eternity with you.
[time=1261] How many of you looked in the mirror lately?
[time=1263] I have.
[time=1264] I try to do that every day.
[time=1266] It's a good habit sometimes.
[time=1269] But literally I've walked with people that say I don't want to look at myself.
[time=1275] When I look at myself, I often think, why would God want to spend eternity with a guy like
[time=1281] me?
[time=1282] Why would He love me that much?
[time=1285] Some of you still don't believe He does.
[time=1287] And God sent me to be a voice in your life to remind you that He does.
[time=1290] That He always has, that He does right now, and they always will.
[time=1294] You're never too far going for the love of God, the Father through Christ Jesus.
[time=1298] And I praise God for that.
[time=1300] But God wants to spend eternity with you with three things here.
[time=1302] Jesus is ahead of us.
[time=1303] If I go to prepare a place, He says, the second thing, I'll come back again.
[time=1307] I will come again.
[time=1308] That means Jesus is coming back.
[time=1309] And when He does, He's going to wipe away every tear.
[time=1311] He's going to fix everything, all of these problems, all of these troubles, all of these things that we ultimately have in our life and we have doubts about.
[time=1319] He's going to get rid of all of those things.
[time=1321] So that number three can happen.
[time=1323] Jesus will be with us forever.
[time=1324] Jesus wants to be with you forever.
[time=1327] He says, why?
[time=1328] Why am I doing all this?
[time=1329] That where I am, you may be also.
[time=1332] Verse 4, 7, when we talk about living in the last days, reminds us of this.
[time=1336] Peter writes, the end of all things is at hand.
[time=1338] Those pictures I showed you just remind us that the end of life is coming.
[time=1342] And if, you know, this Jesus doesn't come back first, your life will end.
[time=1348] Sit in that for a minute.
[time=1349] That's a sobering thought.
[time=1350] And so we have to be prepared for the coming of Jesus, prepared for eternity.
[time=1354] The end of all things is at hand.
[time=1356] Therefore, what do we do?
[time=1357] Be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of your prayers.
[time=1360] That phrase for the sake of your prayers doesn't mean God's not going to listen.
[time=1362] But it does mean that, listen, if you ever notice that when you get so consumed and you're consumed and distracted by things that don't pertain to the eternal, you're consumed with earthly things that aren't going to have any significance in eternity.
[time=1373] It affects everything you do, doesn't it?
[time=1375] It affects you spiritually.
[time=1377] It affects you mentally.
[time=1379] It affects your prayer life.
[time=1381] It affects how you process.
[time=1382] It affects how you see the problems in your world.
[time=1385] It affects how you treat your loved ones and all of your relationships.
[time=1388] And that's what we're reminded of.
[time=1390] And here's what I see happening so much.
[time=1392] We see people so consumed with how and when things are going to end, that they end up in this fear-driven anxiety about the coming of Jesus, about the end of the earth.
[time=1404] So here's what I want to tell you.
[time=1405] Because Jesus is coming soon, because the end is near, we must, as believers today,
[time=1411] live with a hope-driven urgency, not a fear-driven anxiety.
[time=1417] And here's what that means for you and for me.
[time=1419] That means we don't walk around frantically afraid in this fear-driven anxiety mode worried about how the world's going to end.
[time=1426] We know how the world's going to end.
[time=1427] We know who holds tomorrow.
[time=1429] We know the Jesus who said, "I have overcome the world." And the win and the how, we can study it, we can read Scripture so we should.
[time=1437] But our biggest job as believers today is to have this hope-driven urgency for the goodness of God, for the coming of Jesus, for the gospel so that we take the hope that we have to a hopeless world.
[time=1450] That's what God wants us to be doing because the Father's coming back.
[time=1454] How's he coming?
[time=1455] He's sending his son Jesus after his kids.
[time=1457] And oh, what a day that's going to be.
[time=1459] The Father's goodness, the Father's house, the Father's coming right down number four, the Father's way, the Father's way.
[time=1465] In verses four and five, we see some of the doubts coming in.
[time=1468] Jesus already knew, he's already been speaking into these doubts, but doubting Thomas shows up or honest, Thomas, however you want to look at him.
[time=1475] Because verse four, Jesus says, "Hey, you know the way to where I'm going." Thomas says, "No, we don't know where you're going, so how in the world can we know the way Jesus?" And then Jesus says in verse six, "I am the way, the truth and the life." No one comes with the Father except through me.
[time=1490] Have you noticed in life that God's ways are not your ways?
[time=1494] God's timing is not your timing.
[time=1497] Your thoughts are not your thoughts, they're way higher, and so many times we think God's behind us and we're out front, but I've already reminded you God is ahead of you, his ways are not our ways, but we often doubt his ways, what God does or does not do, and even how he has given us a way to know him, to have a relationship with him, to have eternal life, to spend eternity in heaven.
[time=1515] You know, why is there only one way?
[time=1516] People ask that.
[time=1517] You know, I think there's a bunch of ways to heaven.
[time=1519] And so we doubt the Father's way.
[time=1521] And I love what Jay Vernon McGee, I just love Jay Vernon McGee anyway.
[time=1524] He's a great pastor, writer, author, just a great man of God.
[time=1527] He writes it this way about the Father's way.
[time=1529] This is God's universe and God does things his way.
[time=1533] You may have a better way, but you don't have a universe.
[time=1538] And I think that is so well said.
[time=1540] We're so reminded in times of doubt that God is here and we are here, but God became a man.
[time=1546] The Word became flesh and dwelt among us too.
[time=1548] Walk among us to be tempted, as we're tempted, yet to do it without sin.
[time=1553] Jesus came to do, and He defeated death, defeated hell, defeated the grave, defeated sin.
[time=1558] And He rose from the dead with the victory.
[time=1560] And I'm so thankful that God made a way.
[time=1563] And in verses four and five, we see some of the doubts.
[time=1565] So I want us to look at verse six.
[time=1566] Let's put it on the screen for you so we can just let it sink in.
[time=1568] Three things that Jesus said.
[time=1570] He said, "I am the way, I am the truth, and I am the life." We don't come to the Father except through Him.
[time=1577] And so I want to break that apart with you for just a moment.
[time=1579] And I think there's two big distinctives to Christianity.
[time=1582] You know, when we talk about the way, the way is narrow.
[time=1584] If you are going to find it, Scripture reminds us of this.
[time=1587] Jesus is the only way to the Father.
[time=1590] He's the only way to eternal life.
[time=1592] And people struggle with that.
[time=1594] Maybe you struggle with that.
[time=1595] Like I think there are multiple ways to God and we're all going to get there together.
[time=1598] We're all going to get there the same way, but not according to Jesus and not according to this truth.
[time=1603] And I want to break that apart for a minute.
[time=1604] And I think there's two big distinctives of Christianity that any other ways that you may discover and research in today's time that you will never find anywhere else.
[time=1614] Number one is grace.
[time=1615] Christianity is the only way, path, religion, whatever words you would use that offers grace.
[time=1620] Everything else is very works-based.
[time=1622] It's very much about you being good enough, one helping somebody else, getting past some platform and level that's so ambiguous you can't ever really know anyway and have peace to really know how good is good enough.
[time=1633] Jesus is the only one who offers grace.
[time=1635] We're saved by grace through faith, not of works.
[time=1644] Or then I would boast about it.
[time=1646] I would be God.
[time=1647] I would be the God of my own destiny and I'm not.
[time=1650] That's the reality of that.
[time=1652] And grace is number one.
[time=1653] The resurrection is number two.
[time=1655] Every other founder of ministries or religions, they're commemorated in a tomb, not my Jesus.
[time=1661] The tomb is empty.
[time=1663] And because he lives, I can't just face tomorrow.
[time=1665] I can have eternal life and have it now and have life to the fullest today.
[time=1670] That's the kind of God that we serve.
[time=1671] So there's a couple of distinctives.
[time=1672] But the way, did you know Jesus, even though Jesus, listen really clearly, Jesus is the only way to heaven.
[time=1678] Jesus is the only way to the Father.
[time=1681] Jesus is the only way to eternal life.
[time=1685] But there are many ways that you can meet Jesus.
[time=1689] Some of you are like, no wait a minute.
[time=1691] Did he say that right?
[time=1692] I said it right.
[time=1693] Because I think about it, if I polled everybody in this room, he calls himself a child of God.
[time=1698] What way, what method, what avenue did God use to bring you to faith in Jesus, to become a child of God?
[time=1704] Some of you would say, oh, for me, it was a circumstance where it was a car wreck or it was this terrible circumstance where God really opened my eyes.
[time=1711] And for some of you, it's going to be a multiplicity of all these things.
[time=1714] It was somebody that came along my path and shared Jesus with me and shared about their own testimony and their own faith.
[time=1719] Well, for me, it was reading the Word, and God just brought it to life one day.
[time=1723] I was praying one day, and it's like God spoke to me in my heart, and I knew I was not saved, and I knew I wasn't trusting in Jesus.
[time=1728] So I just love this about God.
[time=1730] We fuss sometimes about how God only made this one narrow path, this one narrow way.
[time=1735] But God has given us so many ways to find and follow Jesus.
[time=1739] There are many ways to encounter Jesus Christ.
[time=1742] Paul encountered him on the road to Damascus with this bright blinding light.
[time=1746] I don't know what your bright blinding light was.
[time=1748] Or maybe you're still waiting on it.
[time=1750] But God has made a way that, listen, that John 3 16 can be true, that whoever believes in him would not perish but have ever lasting life.
[time=1760] For God so loved that whoever believes in him.
[time=1764] That includes all of us.
[time=1765] And he's made so many ways that we can encounter Jesus.
[time=1768] And I believe one of those ways for you is today.
[time=1770] But Jesus is the only way to the Father.
[time=1772] Jesus is the only way to heaven.
[time=1774] Jesus is the only way to eternal life.
[time=1777] The truth, the world is so full of abstract truth.
[time=1781] Find your own truth.
[time=1783] You'll hear.
[time=1784] And here's what I know.
[time=1785] And in this world full of abstract truth, Jesus is the absolute truth.
[time=1789] He is the truth that you're looking for.
[time=1791] And I want to speak to those of you who say, yeah, I'm fine with the abstract truth.
[time=1794] I'm fine with finding my own truth, kind of finding my own way.
[time=1798] I know something about you because I know something about humanity because as we often said in the South, I are one.
[time=1804] I'm a human.
[time=1805] I can relate with you.
[time=1807] Here's what I know.
[time=1808] I know that deep down inside of you, the abstract, subjective truth that you're trying to find is not fulfilling you.
[time=1818] I know that deep down inside of you, you long for something in a shifting sand, sinking sand kind of world.
[time=1826] You're longing for something that's going to last.
[time=1829] You're longing for something solid.
[time=1833] You're longing for something concrete.
[time=1835] You're longing for something absolute in an abstract world.
[time=1840] And I want to introduce you to what you've been looking for.
[time=1843] His name is Jesus Christ.
[time=1845] He is the way.
[time=1846] He is the truth.
[time=1848] And lastly, he is the life.
[time=1850] We don't come to the Father except through him.
[time=1853] He is the life.
[time=1854] John 15 is the next chapter.
[time=1856] You're welcome there in case you were asleep.
[time=1858] John 15, Jesus talks about how he is the vine and we are the branches.
[time=1862] What that means is as a branch, we're going to wither away and die unless we're connected to the source of life, which is the vine.
[time=1869] And in the same way, we don't have life unless we are connected to Jesus.
[time=1873] He is the vine and we are the branches.
[time=1875] And so we don't have life.
[time=1876] We don't have a way.
[time=1877] We don't have truth.
[time=1878] And we don't have life apart from Jesus Christ.
[time=1881] Thomas Kempis said it this way.
[time=1883] Without the way, there is no going.
[time=1885] Without the truth, there is no knowing.
[time=1887] Without the life, there is no living.
[time=1889] Jesus is all of those things wrapped into one.
[time=1892] The best illustration I've ever heard of this is a terminal illness.
[time=1896] And I say that sensitively because there are so many of you fighting terminal illnesses in our church body right now.
[time=1901] But if you, when you talk about the way and you're doubting the way and shouldn't there be other ways, if you have a terminal illness and you go to the doctor and the doctor says you are going to be killed by this illness.
[time=1910] It is a terminal illness.
[time=1911] There is no way around that.
[time=1913] One, I don't know what your first questions would be.
[time=1915] We all have different personalities.
[time=1916] But one of your first questions is going to be, well, what can I do about it?
[time=1920] Is there anything that can be done?
[time=1922] And here's what would happen.
[time=1923] If that doctor said to you, well, there is one way out.
[time=1927] There is one cure.
[time=1929] There is one way you can overcome this illness.
[time=1931] And here's what it looks like.
[time=1933] What I don't think is going to be very common for most of us is that we go, well, I don't really like that way.
[time=1940] I want the red band-aid, not the blue one.
[time=1943] What you're not going to do is say, well, you know, I know that's the only way, but I want a better one.
[time=1950] I want a different one.
[time=1951] What I know is that when we are terminal and we are desperate, we don't get overwhelmed and consumed by which way we want.
[time=1960] We're just glad there is a way.
[time=1962] And my friends, I came to tell you today that because of sin, the wages of sin is death.
[time=1967] And we all have to pay that price because of our sin.
[time=1970] We are all terminal, but God gave us a way.
[time=1975] And his name is Jesus.
[time=1977] The last thing I want to talk to you about, the doubts that Jesus spoke to today is the Father's presence.
[time=1982] Write that down.
[time=1983] The Father's presence.
[time=1984] Some of you struggle with feeling like God's a million miles away in your life perhaps right now.
[time=1989] Jesus said, if you know me, you know my Father.
[time=1991] Verse 7, and underline this in your Bible.
[time=1993] But from now on, but from now on, you do know.
[time=1998] From now on, I believe today can be from now on moment for you.
[time=2001] And Philip shows up and says, but hey, show us the Father.
[time=2004] I don't really know that he's here.
[time=2005] And he doubted the presence of the Father.
[time=2008] And Jesus says, whoever has seen me has seen the Father.
[time=2010] We are one and we're available to you, Philip.
[time=2013] We're available to the world.
[time=2014] We are one.
[time=2015] And some of you had a great earthly Father.
[time=2017] I've got to end our time by just helping you reflect on your own earthly Father because how our earthly Father influenced and impacted us, influences and impacts how we see our heavenly Father.
[time=2027] And our ability to see him for who he is.
[time=2029] Some of you had a great Father who was super present, who was a really good Father, a solid Father.
[time=2034] He was there.
[time=2035] And he pointed you to the truth.
[time=2036] He pointed you to Jesus.
[time=2037] And if that is you today, what you had was a miracle.
[time=2041] And I hope you're very grateful for that.
[time=2043] But some of you, you have an absent Father.
[time=2046] You had a distant Father.
[time=2049] You had an explosive Father.
[time=2051] You had a drill sergeant Father.
[time=2052] You had a weak Father.
[time=2054] Some of you didn't even get to meet your Father.
[time=2056] Maybe it wasn't his fault and he passed away.
[time=2058] Maybe he was there.
[time=2059] But you never had a connection.
[time=2060] And so now if you talk to your parents, you talk to your mom because you didn't connect with that.
[time=2064] Some of you in a room this size and in a listening audience this size were abused by your Father.
[time=2069] Either physically and or sexually.
[time=2071] And the list goes on and on.
[time=2073] And I'm not saying all this to try to bring all this up in you.
[time=2075] But I do know that it gets in the way sometimes for you to see God for who he really is.
[time=2080] And I want to point you to the Father's presence in your life in a way maybe you have been missing for just a few minutes if you allow me to do that.
[time=2087] Unfortunately your experience if it was in that negative category is kind of the norm these days.
[time=2092] So dads this is a big challenge to us.
[time=2094] And don't worry moms and ladies in the room I want to share directly to your heart as well today that this experience I've read a lot in years past and a couple of things that have stood out.
[time=2103] There's a book called Families in Faith.
[time=2105] And it was written and did studies to show the quality of a child's relationship with their Father and its impact on their faith growing up.
[time=2112] And it was written by a sociologist.
[time=2115] And here's what they found.
[time=2116] They found that the most impactful part of what shapes a child's
[time=2123] faith as they grow is their relationship with their Father.
[time=2127] Beyond just faith our relationships with our dads can be one of the big shaping influences in just life and society.
[time=2133] Do you know today in these stats, ebb and flow?
[time=2135] But national stats right now show that 71% of high school dropouts came from a fatherless home.
[time=2141] 75% of teenagers and substance abuse centers right now came from fatherless homes.
[time=2145] One of those same studies and a quote, almost every social ill faced by America's children is related to fatherlessness.
[time=2152] And this is a huge one.
[time=2153] Focus on the family.
[time=2154] Perhaps you've heard of them did a study on the impact of who comes to Christ in a family and the impact that it has on the faith of the rest of the family.
[time=2162] And what they found is that if a child is the first to come to faith in Jesus Christ in a family, there's a 3.5% chance that everyone else in the family will come to Christ as well.
[time=2171] The stat goes up for moms.
[time=2172] If a mother in a home is the first to come to Christ in a family, there is a 17% chance.
[time=2178] And some of you are that.
[time=2179] I've talked to some of you ladies who are that.
[time=2180] You're the first generation Christian in your home or you're one of these children and you fit the 3.5%.
[time=2186] But when a father is the first to come to Christ and lead their family into that, that percentage of chance that everyone else in the home will come to Christ is 93%.
[time=2195] Dad, you got a lot of weight.
[time=2199] And God has called you to be the servant leader in your home.
[time=2203] And some of you didn't get that.
[time=2206] Some of you fit the statistics because you were injured.
[time=2209] Listen, I want to speak to those of you who that's true of you.
[time=2211] You had a distant or explosive or abusive or whatever father, however you would label your earthly father.
[time=2218] I want you to know that God, your heavenly father, loves you in a way that maybe you were deprived of in some ways and you may never get over.
[time=2226] You won't.
[time=2227] You will never forget but you can forgive because your father has forgiven not just that earthly father but you.
[time=2232] And listen, he loves you.
[time=2233] Your heavenly father loves you so much.
[time=2237] And all the pain that Satan has been using as dirt in your life, your father wants to use it as a soil to grow you up in your identity in Jesus.
[time=2245] Your identity is not in anybody on this earth.
[time=2247] Your identity is in Jesus and Jesus alone.
[time=2250] And he loves you in a way that no humanless earth could ever love you.
[time=2254] And I want to speak to the moms in the room, the single mothers, those that maybe were abandoned by a husband, maybe you lost a husband, and many of you fill both roles.
[time=2264] I can name many of you and see some of you in the room right now.
[time=2267] And I want to speak directly to your heart for a minute.
[time=2270] I can't imagine the weight that you carry trying to fill both roles.
[time=2275] But my father can.
[time=2277] And I want you to know that I salute you.
[time=2280] I respect you and I celebrate you because you're carrying that weight well.
[time=2286] And you may have ways you could do it better and God's going to equip you.
[time=2289] But here's what I want to share with you if you're in that category of a mom or a woman who is having to carry both of these roles and all that way.
[time=2296] Listen, look at me for a minute.
[time=2298] You are enough because the God, the heavenly father who loves you is enough.
[time=2305] Where you fall short, he won't.
[time=2308] You're enough because God says you are enough.
[time=2313] And you may be waiting on him to provide and you may be waiting on this role to fill to a man or a so-and-so of this or that.
[time=2319] But God is enough in you right now and your identity is in him today.
[time=2324] Your heavenly father loves you so very much.
[time=2329] And God wants you to live in that, to walk in that in a way that maybe you have been missing.
[time=2333] Maybe you've been doubting the father's presence because you have never healed from the earthly father's impact.
[time=2339] Today God wants to set you free, to see how much he truly loves you and how much he cares for you.
[time=2345] Are you earning to matter today?
[time=2347] Like Philip said, "I don't know if I can really trust the presence of God.
[time=2350] I don't see him.
[time=2351] Jesus show us him." Jesus said, "I am showing you him." The great I am became flesh and dwelt among them.
[time=2357] If you're longing to matter, you matter to your father.
[time=2360] If you're longing to be special, he says there's no one more special to me.
[time=2364] If you're longing to have value to your father, God, your heavenly father says no one has more value to me.
[time=2369] I know the number of hairs on your head and I sent my son to die for you.
[time=2375] Psalm 68 verse 5 says, "A father to the fatherless, a defender of widows is God in his holy dwelling."
[time=2381] The same God, Hebrews 13-5, he says, "I'll never leave you or forsake you." Psalm 34 verse 18 says, "God is near to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit." He's a father to the fatherless.
[time=2392] First John 3-1 is what I'll leave you with today.
[time=2394] It says, "See what great love the father has lavished on us that we should be called children of God."
[time=2401] And that is what we are.
[time=2404] Let that be your declaration this week.
[time=2407] The reason the world does not know us is that it didn't know him.
[time=2410] It means we're going to be long to the father. We're a part of his family and he calls us his own.
[time=2417] Your father loves you.
[time=2419] So I challenge you to look for his presence in a way maybe you've been missing this week.
[time=2423] I just want to ask you to buy your heads and ponder that for just a moment.
[time=2425] Believers, I just want to ask you to ponder this question for a few minutes.
[time=2430] In the room, online, on the screens, wherever you're at, how can you walk in your father's presence this week
[time=2439] in a way you've been missing last week?
[time=2442] How can you walk in your father's presence knowing that he is with you, watching the fate in him overcome the doubts that you've had?
[time=2449] If you're a believer in the room, ask God.
[time=2451] I believe he's going to put some steps on your heart right now.
[time=2453] Pray and ask him right now.
[time=2454] But some of you would say, "I'm not really sure I have a personal relationship with God the father through Jesus Christ." And right now, I want to give you a chance to accept him wherever you're at.
[time=2462] I can't save you, but Jesus sure can.
[time=2464] That's why he came and the gospel is that Jesus came and paid a price for your sin that you could never pay.
[time=2469] He lived a sinless life you couldn't live.
[time=2471] He died on that brutal cross.
[time=2472] And as his blood was shed, the remission for our sin, the forgiveness of our sin came through him.
[time=2477] He paid the price, as your substitute, as your sacrifice.
[time=2480] He took on your penalty, and then he rose from the dead.
[time=2485] That's the best part.
[time=2486] He's alive.
[time=2487] He defeated death.
[time=2488] He defeated your sin.
[time=2489] He defeated hell.
[time=2490] He defeated the grave.
[time=2491] And being saved is a belief in him.
[time=2493] Anyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
[time=2496] Your job is to confess with your mouth that Jesus is who he says he is.
[time=2500] That Jesus is Lord and that God has raised him from the dead.
[time=2502] Trusting in him and not in you or anybody else's faith, but your own faith to save him.
[time=2507] Trusting in his work inside of you for salvation.
[time=2509] I'm not going to lead you in a prayer because your heart's screaming.
[time=2511] There's no right prayer that saves you.
[time=2513] It's your heart being laid at the foot of the cross.
[time=2515] Will you take that step right now in the silence of this moment wherever you may be?
