[time=0] Colossians chapter one, verses one and two, our series is called "Maturity University." And so today's kind of an intro into that series and I'm so thankful for Dr. Wagi.
[time=11] I'm so thankful to be a part, my friends, of the global church of Jesus Christ.
[time=16] And I know today you may look around and feel like we're losing sometimes. You ever feel that way?
[time=23] Oh, I do sometimes, but I want you to know that the church of Jesus is alive and well.
[time=31] And it's because of friends just like Dr. Wagi and he's leaving and going and we're wearing him out.
[time=36] He's going to be ministering to us while he's here. He's going to be teaching in our school.
[time=40] So much great things that God is going to do through him. And it's all because, listen, God in his church will prevail. Maybe it came today just to hear that.
[time=49] That's a big foundation for us growing up in the unity, growing up in the equipping of the saints,
[time=55] the building up of the body of Christ, the maturity that we're going to look at.
[time=59] So we're going to dig into that here together today. And I'm going to give you three things before we dig into the verses. I'm going to give you context, the church and the culture of Colossae. That is the town. You'll hear it pronounced different ways. Colossae Colossians.
[time=72] This is who Paul wrote to. And I want us to walk through the context for just a couple of minutes.
[time=77] Then let's look at the church that he wrote to. And then I want to tell you a few things about the culture that you're going to find is pretty similar to our own. And then we'll go into verses one and two, and I'll give you some building blocks today of maturity. First of all, let's talk about the context of Colossians. Just a little bit about where Paul wrote when he wrote.
[time=95] He wrote to the church at Colossae around AD 60. So this is when he wrote. And while he wrote,
[time=102] how many of you know where he wrote from? Set it out if you didn't know it.
[time=104] He was in house arrest. He's in prison. In Rome, he's awaiting trial. And so he's in house arrest.
[time=111] He is in prison. He is awaiting trial. And yet he is ministering to the body of Christ.
[time=116] You can read about that. Acts chapter 21 through 28. Great context if you want to read some more.
[time=122] And he wrote this letter to the church at Colossae about the same time that he wrote three other books of your Bible. Three other epistles or letters, the book of Ephesians that we just read from. He wrote this about the same time. Ephesians, Philippians, the joy book itself,
[time=136] as we know it. And we've preached through that here at Blackhawk in years past. And Philemon as well. And so we'll see his story overlap with Apaphras in a minute who's a part of this story.
[time=145] So this is a little bit about the context. Really, when you look at this story, the book of Colossians is really widely considered to be the least of the cities, like the smallest, the least significant in so many ways of the cities that Paul wrote to. And I love that about Scripture because you always wonder, why are there so many names in Scripture? Why are there so many towns that we don't even know anything about anymore? It's because God cares about the least of these. God uses every corner and every context and every
[time=175] culture. And his word prevails in every corner you can't even imagine. Whether that's in Egypt, whether that's in the United States, whether that is in Colossae during this time that Paul
[time=186] wrote. And so here's the thing. Paul led a couple of people to Christ in his three-year ministry to Ephesus. One of those people was Apaphras. Look at your neighbor and say, "Apaphras, he can do it." Try again. Apaphras. Apaphras. You got it. Now you know the pastor of this church
[time=204] here, as we know it, in Colossae is Apaphras. But Paul led Apaphras to Christ, was a convert in his
[time=211] ministry while he was ministering in Ephesus. Another person that he led to the Lord is Philemon, which is why you see some of the context. Philemon 19, Philemon 2, you can go and read some of that.
[time=221] And Apaphras, though, would start the church at Colossae. And we see that in verse 7 of chapter 1.
[time=227] We'll get to that actually next week. But now let's go to the church. There's a little bit of the context. He's writing to them. And what we know about the church, there's always an occasion that Paul writes about. Usually it's when people are being a knucklehead. When there's a problem in the church, Paul writes. And he writes to rebuke or correct or to exhort or to encourage. And the
[time=245] occasion of this letter is actually probably the least known clearly out of all of the epistles.
[time=250] Like we don't totally see a clear picture, but we gain a lot from what Paul writes. And so here's a few of the things. This is a newer church. It's probably about 5 years old. So I think about the journey, even though our church is well over 50 years old, we've been together for about 5 years.
[time=266] And so I see a lot of similarities in that. And it's made up primarily of Gentiles. Paul's mission, these are non-Jewish people, was to spread the good news of Jesus across the entire world.
[time=276] Beyond the Jewish circle to the Gentiles. And so this church was made up of those people
[time=282] that he had led to Christ and his ministry to Ephesus. We've talked about a paphras who is the pastor. One of those converts acts chapters 19 and 20. You can read more about that. And what we learn in Colossians chapter 4 is that a paphras, while Paul is in prison, he has gone to him and he ends up staying with him. Even though there's these things that Paul needs to address in Colossae, a paphras ends up staying with Paul. And we learned that in Colossians 4, we'll read more about it. But here's a few things we do know. When it comes to the church, we've looked at some of the context, we've looked at the setting of this writing.
[time=314] The church now, though, as we're digging into that, there's a combination of legalism, Jewish legalism, and Eastern philosophy, and Gnosticism, and all kinds of different things
[time=325] that are attacking the church. And we can relate to that. We may have different terms for those
[time=331] things, but today the same thing is happening. What it was doing is it was threatening the knowledge. It was threatening the correct doctrine. It was threatening the real understanding
[time=342] of who Jesus is. That's what's going on. And does that sound familiar? Raise your hand if that sounds familiar. You see any attacks on who Jesus is, the preeminence, the God head of who God is,
[time=354] and who God made flesh and dwelt among us, how he made himself flesh and dwelt among us,
[time=360] the deity of Jesus. All of these things were being attacked then, they're being attacked even today. And the essence was, get this, a few things that tie us to spiritual maturity, maturity, university. The essence is that they were seeking, you'll see phrases like this in Colossians, spiritual fullness, even spiritual perfection. You'll see words like that during
[time=381] this time by making, this is the point, they were trying to make Christianity. They were trying to
[time=387] make following Jesus about Jesus plus something else. And we do the same thing today.
[time=396] All of these different words, the narcissism, the heretical doctrines that were infiltrating
[time=402] the church and all the churchy theological terms that we could go into, and I'll go into a couple of more of those. What you need to know, if you said that just, whoa, I didn't hear, I didn't understand a word of that pastor, what you need to hear is that Paul's writing to this church.
[time=417] In a context to a church, and in a second I'll talk to you about the culture. That's what I want us to talk about next before we dig into the passage, where they were trying to make Christianity Jesus plus something else. But true spiritual fullness, true spiritual maturity is
[time=432] Jesus plus nothing. And that's why chapter one, we're going to see my favorite. I know you hear
[time=439] that all the time from me, but this is really my favorite chapter in the Bible when it comes to just who is Jesus and how Jesus is enough. You'll see that especially next week and especially the
[time=452] week after that as we dig in for a few weeks now to chapter number one. So this culture is a lot like our own where spiritual fullness is often made, Jesus plus anything. And listen, anytime your spiritual maturity, your journey of faith becomes Jesus plus something else. You always go
[time=469] backwards in maturity, not forward. And this is kind of an alignment check. You ever get your car
[time=475] aligned? It's kind of pulling to the left and pulling to the right. You think of the church at Galatia, they pull to the right, they're super over conservative and they take the rules of God and they add more rules and they become legalistic. The church at Corinth is a good example. They pulled way left and they got wild and crazy and took all these liberties that we have in Jesus and took them to the nth degree. And Paul is writing to them to say, let's get back true center.
[time=498] Let's focus on the Christ that started the church. And anytime we make it Jesus plus something
[time=504] we veer to the left and we veer to the right. And that's the culture that's there and a little more about this culture. It was written in an age of, you could call it syncretism. Syncretism is where you're trying to sink. You're trying to merge a bunch of different religions, a bunch of different philosophies, a bunch of different ways to God and say, well, we'll just kind of bundle it all together and because there's probably some good in each of those. So let's just bundle it together and that'll be our faith. That'll be our way. That'll be our religion. That'll be our spiritual journey. That's the age Paul's writing in. That's the age we live in today is like, hey, there's many paths. And we looked at John 14 last week if you missed that and we learned say it with me. If you know John 14, 6, Jesus said, I am the way and the truth and the life and no one comes to
[time=547] the Father except through me. And Paul is keeping us center on that very point. Here are a few words
[time=554] you'll see about this culture. And these are words that's interesting. As you study the culture of Paul's day, you study the climate, you study the context, you study the church, the Gnostics and the other heretics that were coming in and threatening a lot of these doctrines. There's a few key words that were actually their language and translated into English. It's words like fullness, perfect, complete. Those are three that you see frequently in Paul's writing to the church at Colossae. But these were actually the language that those heretics that threatened the preeminence
[time=584] of Christ, the understanding of who Christ is. These are the kind of words that they would use and Paul took them, Paul so brilliant. Paul took them and he redefined them according to Christianity.
[time=595] He redefined them according to true spiritual maturity, redefined them according to Christ.
[time=601] And that's going to be a beautiful picture for us of maturity, university and really understanding because I believe, I really do church, that we so often misunderstand what it really looks like to be mature in Christ. A lot of times we think it's church attendance and we think it's head
[time=616] knowledge and we think it's this and we think it's that and a lot of them have done this class and have achieved this thing. I got this gold star in Sunday school and all these things are wonderful.
[time=624] But a lot of times I think we missed the point, the transformative heart level maturity that Jesus
[time=630] wants to bring in our life. So he gives correct definition to these maturity terminologies.
[time=636] So here's what I'd like to do. Now that we have that context, we know a little bit about the church and I encourage you to keep reading. We're going to keep talking about all these and certainly the culture. It gives us a good understanding of who Paul is writing to and now you can probably relate to it. So I would like for us to do something we hadn't done in a while as we read these first two verses. You've been seated for a while. Will you stand for just a minute? And I want to read the first two verses and let's stand just in honor of the reading of God's Word. Let's stand in honor of saying I'm going to stand on what it really means to grow in my faith these three months
[time=666] because we're starting a three-month journey today. And as you stand whether you mean it or not today in your heart, will you do a heart check as Dr. Wergie asked us to do a moment to go and say what am I standing on these days? Am I standing on a false understanding? Are there things that
[time=680] maybe I need to humble myself about and let God penetrate my heart about even today as we go through these first two verses and get some building blocks and foundations? What does God want to do in your heart? Let's read together. You ready for the Word, Black Hawk? Colossians chapter one, we're only going to read the first two verses and then we're going to spend the rest of our time on it today. Colossians 1, Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God and Timothy our brother
[time=706] to the saints and faithful brothers in Christ at Colossians. Grace to you and peace from God
[time=714] our Father. God, I pray right now as we stand together in the room and many watching us on a
[time=720] screen whether they're standing or not, we do stand on your word. And Lord, as we look at these two
[time=726] verses, as we build on the foundations that we read from Ephesians chapter four and now from Colossians chapter one and from this context and the church at Colossae and even the culture that the apostle Paul wrote to God, it is so much our culture today. The Word of God is timeless, the Word of God is universal. And God, I pray right now that these words from you would become
[time=748] a word for us in our daily lives that would transform us, not just something we would know with our heads, but that we would be transformed with in our hearts, that our hands and our actions and our feet and our walk with you would truly be affected this week. I pray all this in the powerful name of Jesus and all God's people said, amen. If you're ready to study the Word, have a seat this morning and I want us to break apart these a couple of verses. Haven't you been blessed already this morning? Dr. Augie's Word, we could have just prayed and said amen and you could have gone out early, but hey, it's so much fun. Let's keep it going. And we've read these first two verses and we're going to go verse by verse through Colossians. And today I brought a backpack. Do you bring your backpack? I don't know if you saw the picture, but young and old,
[time=788] we're all called to have a backpack. So I brought my backpack. How about you?
[time=796] Let it go. I won't sing the rest. Thanks to little Miss Kaya who just started preschool for
[time=804] a loaning dad, the backpack I asked her yesterday. I said, hey, can I borrow your backpack for a
[time=810] church tomorrow? And she went. And then she went, no. But I talked her into it. And so, hey, I want
[time=819] to challenge you. I do have a serious point with this frozen Elsa on a backpack, young moms and
[time=825] grandparents. How many of you have had frozen on your playlist for a long time now? Yeah, exactly.
[time=831] Those of you who missed out on that, well, you missed out on that. In this backpack, there's some blocks. And before I get to those building blocks today, I want to challenge you. I want to challenge you. Don't ever think you've arrived when it comes with maturity. Sometimes, especially
[time=848] in our Western Christianity and our view of faith and our view of maturity, we like to think maybe I've arrived. I've gotten there. I've done enough. I'm just going to sit for a while.
[time=859] But what I love about the graphic that we have for our series is that it shows young and old with
[time=865] a backpack on. So, I want to challenge you, as we start digging into these building blocks today and in 12 months, will you strap on your backpack? Will you go to school? Will you become a lifelong
[time=878] learner and let Jesus keep pouring into you? That's my challenge to you. And as we do that today, I want to give you four building blocks of maturity. And so, building block number one, there you go. We'll start with a green one, and we're going to build together as we strap our backpack on. Four building blocks of maturity. Number one is submission to God's authority. Write that down. We're going to go verse by verse. This is the beginning of verse one. We see this phrase, Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus. Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus. And here's what an apostle was,
[time=908] an apostle literally translated. It's a messenger sent by God, a messenger sent by God. So, Paul
[time=916] says, I am an apostle sent by God. I am under the authority of Christ Jesus. I'm sent by him.
[time=923] He is the boss. And so, right off the bat, we read through these intros, don't we, if we're honest? I know I do. And we just, we breeze through them and we say, let's get to the meat.
[time=931] But there's so much meat even in just how Paul introduces this study by saying, I am an apostle of Christ Jesus. Now, remember, this is the Paul who knew everything. He studied under a gomelio. He was a, he knew all of these languages. He persecuted Christians. He was a leader who led a revolt
[time=948] against Christianity to eradicate it from the face of the earth. And he met Jesus on the road to Damascus. He blinded him. He changed his life. And now all of that skill became rubbish to him.
[time=960] But then God took all of that skill that became rubbish to him in comparison to knowing Christ Jesus. And he used it for his glory. And he sent Paul. But Paul had to start with this building block,
[time=972] this foundation of being in submission to God's authority, not his own authority. Paul, an apostle,
[time=980] a messenger sent. In the Bible, there's kind of two applications of apostle. You see those, number one, it's like a position that Jesus appoints. And that's like the disciples. That's those that walked and talked with Jesus. So that'd be one way you see the word apostle showing up or an application of apostle. It's somebody who was sent by Jesus, a position given by Jesus. Number
[time=999] two would be in the context, as we see Paul in quite a bit, as kind of a father to the churches.
[time=1004] That's the second one. So a position given by Jesus and this father to the churches. And Paul is
[time=1011] both. He was chosen and sent by Jesus himself as he met him on the road to Damascus. And he's a
[time=1017] father to these churches. And that's why he's writing to them. So Paul is both. But here's what I want you to see from verse one, just from the first part of verse one, is that Paul submitted to God's authority first. He was sent by God. He was not sent by a counsel any longer. He was sent
[time=1034] by the God of the universe. And he submitted to his authority. And so Paul is an example of submission.
[time=1039] Get this to Christ's authority. And then he became a representative of Christ's authority.
[time=1045] But listen, if you want to be a representative, if you want to have authority, if you want to lead in authority, well, you've got to first be one who submits under the authority of the God
[time=1057] of the universe. Paul shows us both. He has, I don't know of a leader in God's church who has more authority when he speaks than the apostle Paul, right? He wrote most of your New Testament in case you didn't know that. I'd say he's got a lot of authority. But the authority he was given came from the authority he submitted to first. He submitted under the authority of God. And then because of that, he was able to lead well in authority for God. The same thing is true of us.
[time=1082] It's a building block of maturity. We've got to start as Paul starts this letter in submission to God. And so as we think of that today, and I'd say it to you this way, if you want to be mature, you got to submit under the master. When it comes to maturity university, if you want to be mature, you got to submit to the authority of the master. Paul shows us a picture of that.
[time=1103] He had every reason not to. He was the top of the food chain in every kind of way you could imagine, but he submitted to the authority of Jesus. I want to ask you a personal question that'll help you with your building blocks of maturity. And that question is how have you been bucking the authority of God in your life? Just think about that this week. I think it'll be a
[time=1123] big building block. And he'll show you an area where maybe you've been pushing back on his authority wanting to be in the driver's seat, wanting to be in charge. Not if you know what that's like because you've been there done that. You want to be in charge. All two of us agree that we want to be in charge sometimes, but God has got to be on the throne. And listen, he's going to be whether we like it or not. Every knee is going to bow and every tongue is going to confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God, the Father. So my challenge to us is let's bow now.
[time=1151] Paul shows us that in verse one. Building block number one is submission to God's authority.
[time=1155] Building block number two is commitment to God's will. Write that down. Commitment to God's will.
[time=1161] At the end of verse one, we see another phrase. So Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, he submits to the authority of God. Second thing here, by the will of God.
[time=1170] By the will of God. Are you submitted to the authority of God and are you committed to the
[time=1176] will that God has for your life? That seems like a natural outflow. And then by the way, you notice if I was going to add another one and I was going to give you five, which I won't do today, but we could go even further even with these two verses. The end of the verse, and Timothy, our brother, and Ephesians 4, the building up of the body, the equipping of the saints. That is
[time=1193] what Paul devoted his life to. People like Timothy, the people he wrote to in Ephesus,
[time=1200] it's the building up of others. So what I'd say to you is that another building block within this, a part of God's will that we're to be committed to as we submit to his authority.
[time=1209] Is to be a spiritual parent. Spiritual maturity means you're a spiritual parent that we go from spiritual dead, spiritually dead, to spiritual infancy as we grow in Christ, to spiritual childhood,
[time=1221] to spiritual young adulthood, to spiritual parenthood. And the one distinctive thing about a parent, we all look different, act different, have different philosophies, all these differences.
[time=1230] But the one thing we always have in common, if we're a parent, is that we have kids.
[time=1235] You have kids. And that's a part of spiritual maturity. Paul is a picture of that maturity because it is the will of God that we would pour into others and build them. This is a picture of maturity,
[time=1247] commitment to God's will. And before I break this apart a little more and give you kind of some definitions, what is God's will for spiritual maturity? What is spiritual maturity? I want to give you an illustration. How many of you are Notre Dame fans? Oh, had to be Notre Dame, didn't it?
[time=1261] Notre Dame fans. You like the game this weekend? Pretty good game. I'm a Georgia fan, go dogs.
[time=1266] Buy myself on that one, kind of figured. My Georgia friends are watching probably, you're shouting with me. But Notre Dame did a pretty good job, college football. And did you see how they won though? Wow, if you missed the game, so the quarterback dislocated his finger.
[time=1282] He dislocated his finger. This is at the end of the game. There's less, I don't know, less than two minutes left. Notre Dame fans could tell me the exact minute and second probably. And they're down and they have to score a touchdown. But he dislocated his finger. So what does this guy do?
[time=1296] He runs over to his trainer on the sideline, sticks out his weird looking finger and he goes, and he cracks it right back in the case. He pops it back into place and he runs straight back out onto the field and he throws the game winning touchdown. Pretty impressive. And I share
[time=1312] that story not because I'm a Notre Dame fan. Jesus loves everybody no matter who you root for.
[time=1316] And I'm thankful for that. I share that story because here's what I think many of you need to do today. Think you've gotten something dislocated in your faith. I think that maybe you have
[time=1327] unlike that quarterback, maybe with your dislocated finger, whatever it is that hurt you in your journey of faith. Run over to the sidelines and instead of going to the trainer and saying, I want to get back in the game, you hit in the corner. And maybe in your journey of growth,
[time=1343] you've been hiding on the sideline for years. And I think that God wants you to recommit to his will.
[time=1349] He wants you to grow. And it's time to pop that baby back into place and get back in the game.
[time=1356] And so when it comes to your spiritual journey, will you be committed to God's will just like that quarterback, just like Paul is here. He's an apostle by the will of God. And notice that he
[time=1366] doesn't have all that it takes. How is he an apostle? By the will of God, because God equipped him, because it is the will of God that he would do that. And it's God's will for you to get back in the game. And I forgot to get my second block. What color should this one be yellow?
[time=1378] All right. So this is our second one. We're building foundations today from my frozen backpack.
[time=1383] That's number two commitment to God's will. So let's talk about what is spiritual maturity.
[time=1387] I would like to point you if I pulled the room right now, we said, what is spiritual maturity?
[time=1392] You guys would give a lot of really great answers. You'd give a lot of answers that are biblical.
[time=1396] You would give a lot of answers that are a part of a maturing, growing Christian process.
[time=1401] Most of the time when I've asked that question, it boils down to things like knowing the word and being obedient to the word, which not if you agree and it's not a trick question. You should agree. It is obedience to the word and knowing the word is the law. And Jesus spoke to that.
[time=1414] And I want to put you to John 13. I won't read it to you today, but I'll quote part of it to you.
[time=1418] John chapter 13 verses 34 and 35. We looked at him just a few weeks ago in our John series.
[time=1423] Jesus said, Hey, a new command I give to you. He spoke into this obedience, into the holiness
[time=1429] of God and how it is to be replicated through our lives in walking out our faith. And he said, a new command I give you. And they said, Oh, let's get the pins out, right? And he said, love one another. And I would imagine the disciples kind of thought to themselves,
[time=1444] it's not real new Jesus. That's one of the oldest ones in the book. But what he said next is what made it new. He said, love one another as I have loved you. Jesus was asked by a lawyer, Hey, what's
[time=1458] the most in the motive of trying to trip him up? What's the most important command in all the law, Jesus? And you know what he said? Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength. The second is like it to love your neighbor as yourself. So essentially he was asked, what's most important to God? What's God's will? What's at the top of God's list? And you know what
[time=1477] Jesus said? Relationships. And then he built on that with the disciples in John 13, 34 and 35.
[time=1484] When he said a new command, I give you a new one. So here was the most important commands.
[time=1488] Now I gave you a new one. And what is it to love one another? But not like you have in the past.
[time=1493] Like I have loved you. I've given you a model. I didn't just tell you what to do. I showed you how to do it. And so I want to show you what I think is a great illustration and picture
[time=1504] of these building blocks and this building block of being committed to the will of God. What is spiritual maturity? I think it looks something like this that we have. And this model, it's
[time=1514] interesting. I'm so thankful for real life ministries in post falls Idaho. This is an adapted model from their resources that they just give out so freely. And I've been blessed by them, been in partnership with them for going on 10 years now. It's just a phenomenal church doing great things, especially in the realm of discipleship and relational discipleship. And so I'm in the relational discipleship network with other pastors in just this last week. We did a Zoom and we talked about of all things, spiritual maturity, as we're going into the series, what a help it was. And we rehash this. And here's what it looks like. That we have a relationship with Jesus. And that relationship with Jesus touches our relationships in the home. Love like Jesus. A new command I give you. Love as I have loved you in the home, in the world, and in God's
[time=1556] church and the family. This is here there and it's everywhere. And so when I see this image, and if you were going to write one thing down about maybe a quick overarching umbrella definition of what does it mean to be spiritually mature? And how do we see it? How do we gauge it?
[time=1569] What metrics do we use to measure it? I would say that Jesus changes everything.
[time=1575] Look at your neighbor and tell him that right now. Jesus changes everything. He changes things
[time=1582] at home. He changes things with my relationships with church family and God's family. He changes things with the world, with the people at Walmart, with the people at my job, my co-workers, all of these places here, there and everywhere. I think of the great commission. It's Matthew 28, 19 and 20. We're to go there for and to make disciples. And you know the literal translation
[time=1602] of that is as you are going. Did you know that? Literally translated as you are going.
[time=1608] So as you go home, as you go into your life group and have relationships with others in the church, as you go into the world to work, into the grocery store, into the gas station, and to that knucklehead family member that you would just assume not have a relationship with sometimes, but God made you family. You can choose your friends, but you can't choose your family as you are going. And as you answer their phone call, as you go through those tough relationships in your life, in all areas, Jesus changes everything commitment to God's will. This is God's will for
[time=1640] us that He would change every area of relationship. And so spiritual maturity starts as a relational
[time=1646] thing. I've shared with you many times that spiritual maturity is not intellectual, it's transformational. It's got to start in our head and we're going to read about knowledge and how we are to know God and to know the things of God, to know the word of God. But that's not enough.
[time=1660] That's not true spiritual maturity. It's when it penetrates all of the spheres of our relationships
[time=1666] that true maturity starts to show up. So it's commitment to God's will as you are going.
[time=1674] What area of as you are going this week do you think you could use some spiritual maturity?
[time=1678] Maybe write that in the corner of your notes, cover it up with your hands so nobody sees it.
[time=1682] But maybe think about that this week. Let's go to our third building block. Number three
[time=1688] is reception of your identity. You got to receive your identity. Let's go to verse two,
[time=1696] reception of your identity. In verse two, the beginning of it, to the saints and faithful brothers in Christ. Reception of your identity. Your identity is a cornerstone, is a building block
[time=1708] of spiritual maturity. And here's the thing. We talk about sinners and saints in which am I?
[time=1715] Well, I'm kind of both. What should I call myself? Let me talk about the differences in those two sinners. We're sinners. Listen by nature. How many of you had to teach your kids to sin?
[time=1723] We have a sin nature and it bubbles up no matter what. Nobody had to teach you to sin either.
[time=1729] Remember that when you're parenting your kids and your grandkids and influencing all of those other people. We're sinners by nature. We're sinners by choice because we make bad choices.
[time=1738] I haven't even made a bad choice this week. Anybody? All right. Good honesty. We try to live with vulnerability here at Black Hawk. We are sinners by nature and choice. But listen, if you're a child of God, you are a saint by identity. Sin is something that defines your
[time=1753] occasional or maybe even frequent activity. Your actions. Sin, sinner, is something that defines
[time=1759] your activity. But listen, saint defines your constant identity. Your activity is defined by this word sinner. And how many of you still do that sometimes? You still realize I'm in a flesh suit? Yeah, it describes me. I'm a sinner by nature. I'm a sinner by my dumb choices that I make.
[time=1774] But that describes my activity. My identity is described by this word saint. And I want to show
[time=1780] it to you in Scripture. And listen, you don't get to enter into sainthood unless you first recognize I am that ugly, nasty sinner who is dead in my trespasses and sin. But when you do that and you receive an identity from Jesus, then you now have this permanent identity that overrides
[time=1796] that previous identity. It's what you do versus who you are. Maybe you've been in the building blocks of your life and your walk of faith, letting what you do define you.
[time=1807] Jesus looks at you and says it's who you are that defines you. And who you are in Christ is just that,
[time=1813] in Christ. A sinner who's been washed clean by the blood of Jesus. When Jesus looks at you and
[time=1820] God the Father looks at you, He sees a spotless, loved part of His family through the blood and
[time=1828] the identity given to us by Jesus. Some of you, that's your big building block that's holding you back and growing in your faith. This is a building block of maturity, and we have to live in it.
[time=1837] In this life, listen, there's progress. How many of you look back and it's like, you know what, I'm not where I want to be, but I'm sure not where I used to be, not if you agree. Like, man, I've come a long way. In this life, there's progress. In the next life, there is perfection.
[time=1851] In this life, progress. In the next life, perfection. This is sanctification and glorification for all of you theology studies out there. Sanctification is the process we go through in
[time=1862] this life of becoming made into, conformed to the image of Jesus. Sanctification is
[time=1868] daily becoming more and more like Jesus. In this life, we have progress. In the next life, we get
[time=1875] glorification. That's the perfection. We get a glorified body. Who's excited about that glorified body? Who's even more excited about Jesus washing away all of your sin? There'll be no more sin.
[time=1884] There'll be no more sickness. Cancer will be no more. Tears will be wiped away. And this life
[time=1890] is progress. And the next life is perfection. And there'll be all these reunions with those that you've lost who are in Christ and will be together forever with Jesus. And oh, what a day that is going to be. But right now, we're in the process. Right now, we're making progress. You're
[time=1908] not where you're going to be. You're not where you want to be, but you're not where you used to be either. God is growing you. So I ask you, are you a saint? And if you couldn't say yes to that,
[time=1918] challenge you this week to work on it in the mirror. If you're a child of God, this is a building block.
[time=1923] You've got to receive that. And I notice I said receive, reception of your identity. Not achievement of your identity, reception of your identity. It is a received identity. And some of you are just
[time=1935] pushing back on receiving that identity. And this week, I want to challenge you to look in the mirror
[time=1941] and be able to say, I am a saint. I know you didn't act like one. Probably right before you went to the mirror. You sure didn't think like one that day, right? But receive that identity in Christ.
[time=1952] Reception of your identity. Over 200 times in the Bible, we're referred to we being Christians,
[time=1959] followers of Jesus. We're referred to as holy, righteous, or saint. Did you know that? Wow.
[time=1964] I don't deserve that. That's why it's a reception of an identity. So in your business cards, it should write name, title, and your business, comma, saint.
[time=1974] That's what you should write on your business cards. You should believe it. Maybe don't do
[time=1982] your business card, but believe it here and certainly believe it here. So how can a center become a saint? Two words for you. Ready for them? Let's go back to the verse here. If we can, go back to the previous slide. There we go. In this verse, to the saints and the faithful brothers, how can a center become a saint? Say it with me. In Christ. That's the answer. How can a center
[time=2003] become a saint? In Christ. In Christ, we can become a saint. Only a few times in scripture
[time=2010] believers even called a Christian. Did you know that? Only a few times. But over 200 were called
[time=2016] holy, righteous, and saint. Paul's writing is alone. Listen, over 200 times he tells us that we're in Christ. Paul loves that phrase. And so should we. So here's how I'd say it to you right this
[time=2027] down. Salvation and sainthood are received, not achieved. They are received. That's why it's a
[time=2033] reception of our identity. That is the building block. If you didn't earn it, you can't lose it.
[time=2038] And if you didn't achieve it, you can't boast about it. How are we saved? Ephesians chapter 2, 8 and 9. We're saved by grace through faith, not of works, lest we would boast about it.
[time=2050] And I'm thankful that God is the giver of that salvation. Thank therefore for us, maturity means listen, living out who you are. This is not in your notes today, but you should write this down.
[time=2060] When it comes to living out who you are, this is holiness. Are we called the holiness? Church, not if you agree. We're called to holiness. We're called to live set apart. We're called to look different. But sometimes listen, we get it backwards. We say, I've got to look holy. I've got to have all these spiritual disciplines in place. And then I can have the identity in Christ. It's backwards.
[time=2079] We're doing this with it. It's time to get that straightened out. Paul's writing to us to align us.
[time=2084] We've got to receive the identity of who we are in Christ. And then we can pursue holiness. We can
[time=2090] through the strength and the power and the equipping of the Holy Spirit, live out the spiritual disciplines that we're called to. I'd write it down this way if I were you. Pursue holiness, not for approval,
[time=2101] but for alignment. I want to say that again. Pursue holiness, not for approval, not to receive an identity. I pursue holiness because I'm aligning with the identity that I was already given
[time=2112] by Jesus Christ. Maybe you've been getting it backwards. Pursue holiness, not for approval,
[time=2118] but for alignment. Number four, building block and we'll end our time with this thought and then
[time=2124] we'll get to verse three next week. Number four, the blue block here today is representation of the Father's heart. At the end of verse two, he says, grace to you and peace from God, our Father.
[time=2135] So this is our fourth building block that we're going to look at today and then we'll tie our time together. In Paul's introduction, listen, he represented the heart of God, the heart of the Father. And if you missed last week's message, I talked a lot about earthly fathers and heavenly fathers. You need to check that out, especially if you've had a checkered past with earthly fathers and maybe it affects how you view your heavenly Father. But Paul is representing the heart of the Father for grace and peace. And so here's the thing where there is no relationship, there is no
[time=2163] representation. You can't represent what you do not know. And so I want to challenge you this
[time=2170] week to know your Father's heart, to know your Father's heart with all of your heart, know his heart. You can't represent something or someone you don't know. And in this context and
[time=2182] this culture, the Greeks would have opened their letters with something about the grace of God typically. The Hebrews would have opened their letters with something about the shalom, the peace
[time=2192] of God. That would be very customary and typical. But it's interesting, Paul opens his letter with both. Why does he open his letter with both? It's because the Father's heart is so big he embodies
[time=2202] both at the same time, all the time. Grace and peace. You need some grace and peace in your life?
[time=2209] Well, these are building blocks of maturity. You thought, well, I thought we were supposed to get into more of the meat of maturity. We did. This is all the foundation. You missed these things. You missed these building blocks. You missed this simple introduction to Paul's letter.
[time=2222] Then this next three months of a journey is probably not going to take you very far. And I'm so thankful for grace and peace because all other religions, and I've studied and I struggled with is Jesus the only way? I really went through a time where I questioned my faith as a younger guy.
[time=2236] And what I found is that all other religions ultimately land on a performance-based,
[time=2242] works-based salvation. And I got a strive to get there and wonder how good is good enough. And
[time=2248] Christianity has two distinctives in my mind. It's grace and it's the resurrection. Our founder
[time=2254] is alive. We don't commemorate him in a tomb. And he's the only one that says, no, you're going to have to receive this salvation. You cannot achieve it. It's not workspace. So here's what I want you to know today. Your relationship with God, if you're a child of the king, listen, is parental,
[time=2269] not performance-based. If you were to ask me, you know, only your kid's worst days, dad,
[time=2276] Caleb's worst day, Callie's worst day, Kaya's worst day. How much less did you love them at the
[time=2284] end of that day? I say, I'm their parent. That doesn't change, right? And some of you would say, well, that didn't look that way in my house. And that's where I want to point you to your heavenly Father because he's the perfect parent. That's one thing I hope I at least get right,
[time=2298] even on their worst days, there's nothing they can do to cause me to love them less.
[time=2301] But I want you to know from your heavenly Father, he is the perfect parent today.
[time=2305] And there is nothing you can do to make him love you more. And there's nothing you can do to make
[time=2313] him love you less. He loves you with all of his heart and your relationship and your identity
[time=2320] that you receive from him. The Father's heart is one that is parental, not performance-based.
[time=2326] And you say, some will say, oh, but he's preaching that we don't have to be holy and it's not preaching against sin. No, that flows it. Again, don't get it backwards. The identity's got to be in place first. And then you won't be able to help but be transformed and changed because it's going from your head to your heart and then to your hands and how you live out personal holiness. These are building blocks of our faith. So let's look at these relationships one more time. These spheres of relationships. So look at them good again. And if you're like me, sometimes in this one in my Christian bubble, our vision right now to go to our 60th anniversary is to go beyond the Black Hawk bubble to reach people who are far from God but close to us. We're doing this by developing and sending out 1500 ambassadors. You're the ambassadors. But if you're like me, when you fill in names here, sometimes we create a bubble and it's like, well, I don't know a lot of people who are lost.
[time=2370] And I would challenge you, maybe go through your phone and look at your contacts and say,
[time=2376] how many people do I have in each sphere of relationship? And maybe God's going to prompt you this week. And with those things in mind, here's the closing question I want us to look at.
[time=2384] How should these building blocks of maturity impact your spheres of relationship this week?
[time=2391] That's the question I want to leave you with today. How should these building blocks of maturity?
[time=2396] As we start this 12-week journey, impact those spheres of relationship in your life this week.
[time=2402] When that's used to bow your heads and close your eyes today and just process that for a minute.
[time=2406] How should your spheres of relationship be impacted by these building blocks of maturity?
[time=2412] Submitting to the authority of God. Receiving your identity, being committed to his will
[time=2419] and representing your father's heart. Paul does that even in his intro. But what about your intro to the week on Monday tomorrow? How will you start that process? And as you ponder that, believers, some of you are here and some of you are watching the line and you say, "Today I just don't know that I'm a believer. Today I just don't know with all of my heart." Then I've surrendered my life to Christ. That I have a personal relationship with that father who offers grace and peace. That father who offers salvation that is received and not achieved.
[time=2447] And you're ready to receive it as his perfect gift to you today. If that's you right now,
[time=2453] I want to give you a moment to do that. The gospel is very simple. It's that you're a sinner and you need a Savior. We all sinned and fall short of the glory of God. But God, while we were dead and our
[time=2463] trespasses and sin, he sent forth Jesus the perfect sacrifice for us. He died to pay a price for your
[time=2470] sin and your place that you couldn't pay. He rose to defeat death hell in the grave so that you could receive salvation. Maybe you've been trying to earn it and achieve it. Receive it today in the name of Jesus. He's alive today. He rose from the dead so that you could have life. A prayer is not going
[time=2486] to save you. It's your heart being transformed. This is where maturity begins. It's where we go from spiritually dead to spiritual infancy. And some of you need to take that step in your own words.
[time=2494] We cry out to Jesus right now in the silence of this moment.
