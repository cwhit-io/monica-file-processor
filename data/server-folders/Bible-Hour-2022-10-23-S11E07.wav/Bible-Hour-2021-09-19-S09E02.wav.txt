[time=0] Is your backpack ever get a little heavy?
[time=8] The backpack of life, the burdens that we try to drag along?
[time=14] You're like, "What is this weird pastor doing?" If you're new with us, my name's Kevin, one of the pastors here, and we're in a series called Maturity University.
[time=22] And the truth is, this really is my backpack, and I do get accused of, like, "What are you keeping that thing, bricks?" But, I mean, I've got books and a lot of stuff, you just never know, right?
[time=31] That's what the backpack's for, but so many times we fill our backpack, or we allow our backpack, the things that we carry in life to get really heavy.
[time=39] How many of you came in today about like this, and you just barely made it to your seat?
[time=46] Maybe that resonates with some of you, but today, I want us to talk about that.
[time=49] We're going to talk a little bit about prayer, and prayer is part of kind of dragging the backpacks of life.
[time=54] This backpack represents our willingness to learn, I have my Bible in mind, you should get yours out, too, if you've got one, Colossians chapter 1 is where we're going to be.
[time=62] But that backpack represents a willingness in Maturity University.
[time=65] We're studying the book of Colossians, you can turn there in your Bibles, a willingness to say, "I've never arrived, and I still need to grow." But today, it also, as we look at prayer, represents a time where, in prayer, a lot of times, we'll bring our burdens and our backpacks to the Lord, and we'll lay them down at his feet, and then when it's time to go home from church, or to get up from the quiet time or that time of prayer, what do we do?
[time=89] We grab it again, and we go again, but today, I believe, God is wanting to you to be able to lay down some burdens to further cross.
[time=96] We're going to look at prayer today, and Maturity University, and by the way, where's my PFW crew?
[time=101] Where are they at?
[time=102] Hey, y'all got to do better than that.
[time=104] Let us know you're here in the corner up there.
[time=106] Hey, PFW.
[time=107] Whoo!
[time=108] All right.
[time=109] If you didn't know, we've got a great crew from PFW.
[time=112] They were all in our young adults' class this morning that meets every Sunday, and then they're here in church with us, so welcome to all of you.
[time=120] We're thankful for campus ministry there, and we are thankful for our partnership, and then they've got a young adult luncheon after church at 1230 as well.
[time=127] So if you're a young adult, typically, when people say, "Am I a young adult?" I say, "If you think you are, then sure." But usually, we kind of look at that as like 18 to 30-ish range.
[time=136] I think I got that close to right for you guys.
[time=138] We'd love to have you join.
[time=139] We've been talking about that, and so they're from a university, but so are we, because we are always challenged to grow and to learn something new.
[time=149] God's never done with growing.
[time=150] So today, I want to talk to you about how mature people pray.
[time=154] How mature people pray.
[time=157] How many of you would agree that the Apostle Paul is probably a good example of maturity that we could look to.
[time=161] Raise your hand if you would agree.
[time=162] You should.
[time=163] No trick question there.
[time=164] Yeah.
[time=165] This is the second part of kind of his introduction.
[time=167] He's introduced himself.
[time=169] We did verses one and two.
[time=170] Last week, I gave you some culture and context and some things about the church at Colossae, which is the Colossians.
[time=176] This is Paul's letter to the Colossians.
[time=178] He had never met them, but he had led their pastor and their church planter to Christ.
[time=182] His name is Apaphris, and so we are looking now at the continuation.
[time=186] Next week, we really get into the content of his letter, the depth and meaning behind why he wrote.
[time=192] But you see so much of it in his intro.
[time=194] We're in the first two verses, but now in verses three through twelve, we see a prayer.
[time=198] It's what Paul had been praying for the church at Colossae, for the Colossians.
[time=204] It's what Paul was praying for the Colossians, and it's what he would commit to continuing to pray.
[time=210] And from this prayer and the elements of this prayer really equal for us some marks of maturity.
[time=216] Marks of maturity.
[time=217] And so we're today going to look at marks of maturity and how mature people pray and
[time=223] these marks of maturity really come from Paul himself.
[time=226] They come from Paul and from what we learn from him, they come from his prayer, and they come from those he's praying for.
[time=232] They come from the Colossians, those that he was praying for and lifting up and encouraging
[time=238] and affirming.
[time=239] And so we're going to learn from them some marks of maturity, fifteen marks of maturity.
[time=245] And yeah, you heard that right, a fifteen point sermon, cancel your lunch plans.
[time=250] You ain't going anywhere today.
[time=251] No, we're going to do this together.
[time=253] We're going to go pretty fast, verse by verse through this.
[time=255] But I believe through this we are going to learn about some marks of maturity that are going to help you grow not just in your prayer life of knowing how to pray, knowing what to pray for, but how we can grow in our prayer life and grow in what we're praying for and
[time=270] living out based on the prayers that we pray.
[time=273] So look at your neighbor and tell them to say buckle up fifteen points coming your way.
[time=276] Tell them right now.
[time=278] Fifteen points, let's read Colossians chapter one, verses three through twelve and from that we'll pull these fifteen points and we'll dig in together.
[time=286] Are you ready for the word today church?
[time=289] Colossians chapter one, let's start in verse three.
[time=293] Paul says we always thank God, the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you.
[time=298] Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all the saints.
[time=304] Because of the hope laid up for you in heaven, of this you have heard before in the word of truth, the gospel, which has come to you as indeed the whole in the whole world it
[time=315] is bearing fruit and growing as it also does among you since the day you heard it and understood
[time=322] the grace of God in truth.
[time=325] Verse seven, just as you learned it from a paphras, our beloved fellow servant, he is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf and has made known to us your love again second
[time=336] time in the spirit.
[time=338] And so from the day we heard we have not ceased to pray for you asking that you may be filled
[time=345] with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding.
[time=349] Why so as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord fully pleasing to him bearing fruit in
[time=356] every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God.
[time=360] May you be strengthened with all power according to his glorious might for all endurance and patience with joy, giving thanks to God the father who has qualified you to share in the
[time=372] inheritance of the saints in light.
[time=376] And may God just take the reading of his word and multiply seeds and marks of maturity,
[time=382] fifteen to be exact in all of us this week.
[time=385] But again, let me give you number one right off the bat.
[time=387] Number one, some marks of maturity is upward glory and outward gratitude.
[time=391] You say, well, that's two.
[time=392] Okay.
[time=393] Well, you can make it a sixteen point sermon if you want to, but I kind of think these go together.
[time=397] And in verse three, Paul says, we always thank God.
[time=399] This is the upward glory.
[time=400] We thank God, the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you, and then he affirms
[time=406] the you, he affirms the people.
[time=407] So he prays with upward glory.
[time=410] He glorifies the father at the same time he gives out outward gratitude for the Colossians and for the people in his life.
[time=416] And I think most of the time, all of us tend one way or the other.
[time=421] We may be good at one and not so good at the other.
[time=423] We may be good at giving gratitude to people, but maybe not so much thanking God.
[time=427] Or maybe we're good at thanking God, but we're not so good at thanking and giving gratitude to people.
[time=432] Paul gives us a model that says we should do both.
[time=435] Let me give you an example.
[time=438] A lot of times we might say, well, you know, it's not you.
[time=442] All glory goes to the Lord, but glad that happened.
[time=446] I'm glad you're a part of it.
[time=447] Well, I think Paul gives us a different model.
[time=449] I think it's something like this, my brother Doug Crane, I'm going to pick on Doug.
[time=451] I'm going to thank Doug for something publicly.
[time=453] If you didn't know Doug served as our elder chairman for these last couple of years and has been on the elder board for, I don't know, like 30 years or something like that, right?
[time=461] No, he just finished his term, still serving on our council of elders in many other places.
[time=465] But Doug, I want to say to you, I thank God for you.
[time=468] Doug, God has done an amazing work in your life and that work has spilled out in my life.
[time=473] So I'm thankful that God has implanted in you so much that you've imparted to me.
[time=478] Thank you for loving me.
[time=479] Thank you for serving our church.
[time=481] Thank you for serving me by the grace of God.
[time=483] We're in this together.
[time=484] I thank God for you.
[time=486] And there's a little bit of a model.
[time=487] This is what Paul does when I pray.
[time=489] So Doug, I'm in every bit of that.
[time=490] That wasn't just an example.
[time=491] Can we thank Doug real quick?
[time=492] Let's do that as a church for serving in that way.
[time=497] Today, that's an example because sometimes we're like, well, I got to give all the glory to God.
[time=502] No, listen, God does the work.
[time=503] Every good thing comes from God, every single time.
[time=506] You're exactly right.
[time=507] But God uses people.
[time=509] And if God has used a person to have an impact in your life, we live in a world that is so void of gratitude, outward gratitude, and it's definitely void of upward glory as well.
[time=520] But the both and is what Paul models for us.
[time=522] Great relational principle for you.
[time=524] Word glory to God at the same time outward gratitude to people.
[time=529] Who should you think?
[time=531] What should you think God for?
[time=532] What can you give God upward glory and outward gratitude for today?
[time=536] Paul is an example of exhortation and encouragement and affirmation.
[time=540] And so many times, church, we just miss the power of our words, the power of encouragement,
[time=546] the power of celebration today.
[time=548] So may you not do that in this world that definitely has a lot of reasons not to celebrate.
[time=552] There's still plenty of reasons to celebrate.
[time=555] And the Gottman Institute did some research on what we average, and I tend, because I'm a perfectionist and especially when I'm tired, I tend to lean more towards the critical than the encouraging at times.
[time=565] How many of you, not if you say, yeah, me too, sometimes?
[time=567] Well, we average, and this number's probably gotten way worse through the last two years with the global pandemic and all of these kinds of things, but we average six criticisms
[time=577] per every one encouragement that we give out.
[time=582] I say it's time we reverse the ratio this week.
[time=585] Let's give some upward glory to God and some outward gratitude to people, and how are we going to do that?
[time=590] Well, let's go to number two, and it is these next three really are so interwoven.
[time=594] It is internal faith, internal faith.
[time=596] He says, we're praying for you since we've heard of your faith in Jesus Christ, and I want to talk to you about your faith, and really what I want to say to you about your faith today is, are you fueling your faith?
[time=608] Or are you fueling fear?
[time=611] Or are you fueling addiction, or sin, or bad habits?
[time=616] What is it that you're, get this, what is it that you're intake in life?
[time=620] What is it fueling?
[time=622] Because I believe that the internal foundations of your faith are going to be most greatly shaped by the intake that you allow into your life, and so are you watching too much news?
[time=633] Are you scrolling too much social media?
[time=635] Are you looking at images or videos that fuel things that are not pure and are not a part of this internal faith that God has given you?
[time=643] What is it that your intake is fueling?
[time=646] Your intake will always have a profound impact on your internal foundations of faith.
[time=653] So my question to you is, what are you fueling when it comes to your internal faith?
[time=657] Paul says, I pray for you, we've heard of your internal faith, and here's what happened with that internal faith, and your internal faith is always connected to number three, which is external love, number three, external love.
[time=666] The internal faith that you have will spill out into an external impact, in this case, it was love.
[time=672] Paul says, and he says this in verse four, but he also says it again in verse eight, and verse four, and of the love that you have for all the saints, everybody say that last word right there.
[time=681] What is it?
[time=682] Say it one more time real loud.
[time=684] That includes those people that you don't like, those knuckleheads, even the ones here in the church, and definitely the ones outside of it, all the saints, and then he says again in verse eight, and a path for us in verse seven, we'll see, has made known to us your love, this time in the spirit is a fruit of the spirit is a call of God.
[time=702] And so we'll look at all of those things, but the internal faith leads to external love two times in verse four, and in verse eight, Paul points out their love, their love for
[time=712] people, and then their love from the spirit, their love from above.
[time=716] Raise your hand if you could use some love from above to love those around you just a little bit this week, yeah, me too, internal faith that overflows into external love, and I wonder as Paul described the church at Colossae this way, I wonder how you describe black hawk ministries, if you wrote the letter to the black hockey inns.
[time=735] We say I've heard of your love for all the saints and how you love in the spirit, or
[time=741] what would he say?
[time=742] It's a good question for us to ask corporately as a church, but personally, the way you make an impact in that area is to live out what Paul is writing about, these marks of maturity, and then it leads to a third part, which is our number four, which is eternal hope.
[time=753] The why behind, get this, the why behind the internal faith that overflows into external love, he says, because, why is this happening?
[time=762] Because this is the why that drives us because we have an eternal hope, because of the hope laid up for you in heaven, are you glad that we have hope that is laid up for you, and for me in heaven today, Paul was, the church was, of this you have heard before in the word of truth, through the gospel, this is the gospel that there is an eternal hope that is going to give us an internal faith that will well up and overflow as an external love.
[time=787] And Paul is thanking God for these things and affirming these things.
[time=790] This is the why, heaven, listen my friends, heaven is near, and Jesus is coming again soon.
[time=798] We sang about it, we talked about it, we read about it in our time of worship today.
[time=803] Let's remember that thing, we did communion, let's remember this hope that is eternal.
[time=808] And when we do, it's going to cause number five to continue to spill out, and that is a growing gospel influence, a growing gospel influence.
[time=816] In verse six, he says, which has, here's what it does, which has come to you as indeed in the whole world, it is bearing fruit and growing.
[time=824] So the gospel influence and the gospel impact externally in the world is growing, and then he says, as it also does among you, internally, external and internal, since the day you heard
[time=836] it and understood the grace of God in truth.
[time=840] The truth points us to the grace of God, because what are we saved by?
[time=843] For we are saved by grace through faith, not of works, or then we would boast about it.
[time=849] That is the truth, and when we hear and understand it, it changes the world around us because God's doing something internally in us.
[time=855] In verse six shows us this growing gospel impact, and this is why we have the discipleship journey
[time=861] here at Blackhall.
[time=862] It's simply put as a spiritual road map to help you take your next step in your faith, because we believe growing people who always strap on their backpacks and are ready to grow and learn, always have a next step.
[time=872] You have never arrived, it's a growing gospel influence in all of our lives, from spiritually
[time=878] dead to spiritual parents.
[time=880] We all have a next step, and as we look at those next steps, listen, even if some of you need to lead a group, we've got Rick Raber, one of our elders, leading a group through disciple shift, which is just looking at the methods of Jesus and how he made disciples that apply to our life groups and to life in general.
[time=895] It's happening on Wednesday nights.
[time=896] You should come.
[time=897] The discipleship journey pastor Steve Webster right now is leading at nine o'clock every Sunday just through this discipleship journey for you.
[time=904] Maybe it's your next step.
[time=906] We've got avenues everywhere to help you take your next step, and I love this passage because as a whole it shows a spiritual journey of the church at Colossia, all these people.
[time=914] Let me give you a quick glimpse of it.
[time=917] So in verses five through seven, they heard the gospel.
[time=919] We see that verses five through seven.
[time=921] Verse four, we see they believed the gospel.
[time=924] Verse seven, we see they were discipled.
[time=926] A pastor came along.
[time=927] Paul became a spiritual grandparent.
[time=929] As this guy, he led to Christ, now goes and leaves other people to Christ, and the generations
[time=935] are being impacted, and so they were discipled, and then verse eight, they became faithful.
[time=939] And then the next few things Paul prays for things that he hopes will continue or build in their lives.
[time=944] It was nine that they would grow.
[time=946] Verse 10 that they would obey.
[time=948] Verse 11 and 12 that they would bear fruit.
[time=950] You see the progression, and here's a way we can look at it.
[time=953] I'm thankful for our friends at Real Life Ministries.
[time=955] They call this the five stages of spiritual growth, and it's a part of the discipleship stuff that if you are a life group leader here, you have been trained in a lot of these things.
[time=964] This is our image that we made of this.
[time=965] We all began spiritually dead.
[time=968] You were dead, and your trespasses and sins, but God sent Jesus, and as soon as you meet Jesus, you're given new life, you are made new, and you become a spiritual infant.
[time=977] You don't become a parent.
[time=978] You're not the apostle Paul, you're not the church planter, you're not the goddess discipling others.
[time=982] You're a spiritual infant.
[time=983] You're pretty dependent on people around you as an infant.
[time=986] And then the independence lessons or increases, and your dependence lessons a little as you become a spiritual child.
[time=992] And then as a spiritual young adult in maturity university, you start to realize life's a little bit more about things that are bigger than just me and my needs, and then you become a parent, and a grandparent, and you disciple others, and I want to help you, and you're going to see this image more.
[time=1005] We're going to dig deeper into this image, but I want to introduce it to you over and over again, because I want to help you determine and discern where are you at in the five stages
[time=1014] of spiritual growth in maturity university?
[time=1017] Are you spiritually dead?
[time=1018] I want to introduce you to Jesus today, so that you can become a spiritual infant and grow into a spiritual child and a young adult and a parent, and we're going to look further and further at how you can know where you're at, and listen to the truth is, I'm praying that God does a lot of eye opening in this series of what true spiritual maturity is and looks like.
[time=1036] So some of us that think maybe I'm a parent, maybe humbled to see a little more in spiritual
[time=1045] childhood than I thought, and God's ready to grow you, and the good thing is, He makes us in every one of these, one's not better than the other.
[time=1052] He meets you right where you are, but He never leaves you there.
[time=1055] He leads you forward to a next step, and that's why we're doing this series.
[time=1059] There's a growing gospel influence, and that leads to number six, because as you let the gospel influence grow, you'll become an ambassador, ambassadorship, write that down.
[time=1068] Our church vision going to our 60th anniversary in September of 2029 is that we would go beyond
[time=1074] the black-caught bubble.
[time=1076] That means going beyond geographically, physically, our campuses, but more than that, beyond our comfort zones.
[time=1082] Why?
[time=1083] That an internal and an external thing would happen, but to reach people, but before we get there, we want to do it by developing and sending 1500 ambassadors.
[time=1092] Ambassadors are people who are going through the discipleship journey, going beyond their comfort zone, across the one fives, locally, globally, all over the world and all of these different settings, whatever they may look like, that they are being developed and sent out.
[time=1106] An ambassador represents a foreign land.
[time=1108] Our citizenship is not here.
[time=1110] You thought you were a US citizen.
[time=1112] If you're a child of God, our citizenship, Philippians 3, is in heaven, and from it, be a way to Savior, Jesus Christ the Lord, and He is coming again, and in the meantime, we get to be an ambassador and represent the kingdom of God here on earth.
[time=1127] This is the ambassadorship that we see in verse 7, about a paphras.
[time=1132] Just as you learned it from a paphras, He was an ambassador, our beloved fellow servant.
[time=1137] He was an ambassador in our vision, is that we go beyond the black-caught bubble by developing and sending 1500 ambassadors for Jesus across all the one fives.
[time=1148] Why?
[time=1149] Here's the external part.
[time=1150] To reach people, to reach the lost, to reach people who are far from God, but close to us.
[time=1156] And God's got you a unique circle of influence.
[time=1158] Maybe somebody's far from God, but they've got a close relationship with you, and you can be the ambassador just like a paphras was, just like Paul was.
[time=1166] His pastor, a paphras who planted the church at Colossae, was spiritually dead, but in
[time=1172] Paul's three-year ministry, in Ephesus, Paul led him to Jesus, and he went from spiritually
[time=1178] dead to spiritually an infant.
[time=1179] Then he grew into a child, and then he grew into a young adult, and then he grew into a parent, and he planted a church.
[time=1185] God can do that in you too.
[time=1187] That is the call of ambassadorship today, and so that leads then to some practical things that Paul does that we can look at, and you see the growing gospel influence overflowing into ambassadorship, and as an ambassador number seven starts to happen, you honor people.
[time=1201] You honor others.
[time=1202] Paul made sure, at the end of verse seven, to honor a paphras.
[time=1205] He said he's a beloved fellow servant, but then he says, "Hey, listen, I want you guys to know." And Paul never met.
[time=1211] If you missed last week, go back, and I shared this context.
[time=1213] Paul never met these people in Colossae, so I said, "We have heard of your faith." But he wrote them to help them stay the course, but he found a lot of things to affirm and honor about them, but he specifically says, "Hey, I want you to know that your pastor is the real deal." He says he is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf, and this is, listen, we live in a culture and a society of dishonor today.
[time=1237] It's like people just look for ways to dishonor others.
[time=1240] We live in a culture and a society of hate today, but the more you grow up in Christ,
[time=1246] the more you shift a culture, and may it be so of us, black call, we shift a culture
[time=1252] of dishonor and hate to a culture of honor and love that stands out in a dark world as
[time=1258] a light for Jesus Christ.
[time=1260] It's one of the ways we can be an ambassador, and at times I've been criticized for, like, you should say more about the bad false teachers that are out there, and let me be real clear.
[time=1269] Our elders, and at any point, there's false teaching outside from another church and another pastor, and it's infiltrating the whole of our church body.
[time=1278] You better believe we'll speak to it, we'll call out-wise with the truth, always, that is our role, that is our goal, we will always do that.
[time=1285] However, what I'm not looking to do, and what our leadership is not looking to do is constantly look to dishonor other ministries.
[time=1293] If they're preaching the Bible, and if they're preaching Jesus, we're on the same team,
[time=1300] and I can give you a whole theological outline of how Paul fills the same way, and this is why he honors people.
[time=1304] We never even met them.
[time=1305] He didn't know everything that was going on there, but he knew they were preaching the Bible, he knew they were preaching Jesus, and that's why, if I have a problem, personally, with another pastor and another church, I'll go talk to him for sure, but that we don't make that public, because I want to honor other ministries, and the same thing goes for your marriage.
[time=1321] Honor your spouse, those of you who are married.
[time=1324] It drives me nuts sometimes where this great relationship, Cherith, shared about it a few minutes ago of the groom and the bride of Christ, which is the church, will dishonor, especially as a guy, let me speak to men for just a minute.
[time=1335] Stop doing this junk if this is you.
[time=1338] Don't dishonor your wife.
[time=1340] Don't dishonor your spouse to be able to be a part of the joke.
[time=1345] Don't let your spouse be someone that you dishonor so that you can gain some credibility with the buddies or whatever.
[time=1351] They're not real buddies if it takes you doing that.
[time=1353] I just want to speak some truth into some of you that may be doing it, honor your spouse.
[time=1358] Make sure you honor, and I know, listen, they're a knucklehead.
[time=1361] My wife will attest.
[time=1362] She's like, man, sometimes I have to look for something to honor, and that, dude, there are days, right?
[time=1366] We all have dishonorable moments, but may we look to honor each other and point out the good.
[time=1372] Do the same thing with your employers, even when they may not deserve it.
[time=1375] Find those good things.
[time=1376] Look to be an honoring person like Paul did here.
[time=1379] Do the same thing, employers.
[time=1380] Do that with your employees.
[time=1382] Look to honor people, whether you're a leader in an organization, you're married, you've got kids.
[time=1387] Look to honor your kids.
[time=1388] Look to find ways to love people and honor people the way that Paul did.
[time=1392] Number eight, it's going to take you walking in the spirit to do that.
[time=1395] That's number eight, walking in the spirit.
[time=1397] In verse eight, he says, "He's made known to us.
[time=1399] Here's your love again, your love." But this time he says, "In the spirit, in the spirit." And I had the opportunity to share with our secondary chapel for Black Hawk Christian School this last Thursday, right from this stage, and that's the seventh grade through twelfth grade of our school here at Black Hawk Christian School, and they're in a series called Known, and the point of the series is that we would know God, we would be known by God, and that we would make him known.
[time=1423] It's a great series, but to start the Know God part, we looked at knowing God as the father,
[time=1429] as the son, and as the Holy Spirit.
[time=1431] And so, of course, they gave the pastor the Holy Spirit, and I got to do the Holy Spirit.
[time=1436] But here's what I shared with the kids, and I want to share it with you as well.
[time=1440] Do you know what the Holy Spirit represents?
[time=1442] And as we sang earlier, we want the presence of God.
[time=1444] My favorite part of singing about those things is the evidence is all around.
[time=1447] You know why the evidence is all around, as we sang about it?
[time=1450] Because God and dwells believers, he's not in a place, he's in a people, and the evidence is you, and it's me.
[time=1456] So the Holy Spirit of God, when God sent forth His Spirit, it's why Jesus told His disciples, "Look, it's to your advantage that I go away, because as soon as I go and ascend to be with the Father, the Holy Spirit will come." And the Holy Spirit, here's what He represents.
[time=1468] He's a person.
[time=1469] He's a part of the Trinity.
[time=1470] He's a part of who God is and how He reveals Himself to us.
[time=1473] The Holy Spirit represents the indwelling.
[time=1475] It is the presence of God in our lives.
[time=1479] And what we do and what we've done in churches, as you know, entire denominations have been formed over our differences about the Holy Spirit, specifically about how the gifts, and I'm not saying these things don't matter.
[time=1489] We have stances on those things, and yeah, and it looks different than a church down the road than the one on the other road, for sure.
[time=1495] But we have allowed something that God has intended, His personal presence with us through His Holy Spirit, to become something that's so simple, something that is so needed, such
[time=1506] a vital, crucial part of our maturity, university, and growing in Christ.
[time=1510] We have allowed the presence of God through His Holy Spirit to become controversial and become divisive so that we don't even talk about Him.
[time=1517] We can't do that.
[time=1518] We've got to walk in the Spirit, and I thank God for churches like this church that say, "I see your love, and it's from above." It's a love that you couldn't pursue on your own.
[time=1529] May we be that kind of church, Black Hawk.
[time=1531] Say amen if you want to be that kind of church.
[time=1534] Let's do it.
[time=1535] Let's be that kind of church.
[time=1536] Let's walk in the Spirit, and He'll remind you of things through communion.
[time=1540] He'll help you remember what you need to remember and forget what you need to forget instead of the opposite.
[time=1545] But to do that, boy, it's going to take number nine, and that's prayer.
[time=1548] Prayer without ceasing.
[time=1550] Number nine, verse nine, we see, "And so from the day we heard, we've not ceased to pray for you." And that doesn't mean, like for you, you need to pray going down the road with your eyes closed.
[time=1561] Please don't do that.
[time=1562] That'd be bad.
[time=1563] But I want you to know prayer without ceasing doesn't mean I pray as I go to work, as I'm driving down the road before I go into meetings, as I'm in the middle of meetings, as meetings get tough, as meetings are fun, as we get together on Sunday mornings, as I go home to be with
[time=1575] my kids.
[time=1576] Here's what prayer is for you in a really simple manner.
[time=1579] Maybe you've been missing it.
[time=1580] Prayer is simply a constant conversation with God.
[time=1583] Did you know God wants to have a constant conversation with you?
[time=1587] Paul exemplifies that through this prayer and how He's praying for them.
[time=1591] You could summarize it by simply saying, "Pray and obey." You see the cycle?
[time=1595] As you pray to God, He'll help you obey.
[time=1598] And as you obey God, you're going to pray more, and you're going to see more of God's will, and you're going to grow in God's will.
[time=1603] So let's pray without ceasing.
[time=1605] So where is your prayer life?
[time=1606] Is it existent?
[time=1608] Is your prayer life more grumbling than it is growth-minded?
[time=1611] Is your prayer life forward-looking, or is it backward-looking?
[time=1615] And is it internal, or is it external?
[time=1617] And guess what?
[time=1618] God cares about all of those things.
[time=1620] You can pray for you.
[time=1621] Jesus prayed for Himself in John 17 before He prayed for those who had come, before He prayed for His disciples and His future disciples.
[time=1626] And sometimes He's like, "Well, I'm not even going to pray for that because I don't want God to find out." Secret, come here.
[time=1633] He already knows, but He still loves you, and He cares, but He wants to help your prayer
[time=1640] life grow, to where as you pray for yourself and your personal needs, it turns into external impact that you're praying for, just like what we see Paul doing here.
[time=1648] It turns into knowing God's will, which is number 10.
[time=1650] This is a mark of maturity.
[time=1652] As verse 9 continues, we see knowing God's will as a mark of maturity.
[time=1655] He says, asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual
[time=1661] wisdom and understanding.
[time=1663] This is knowing God's will.
[time=1665] And as we look at this today, I want to give you a few things because a lot of you are like, "I just really wish I could know God's will." Some of you came today like, "I just need to know God's will for this area of my life, my career, my relationships, or my spiritual journey, whatever it might be." If you're looking for God's will, then I've got a few things for you, a couple of key things.
[time=1681] The first one is, "If you want to know God's will, you must be in God's Word." God has given you a beautiful gift in His Word.
[time=1690] And He wants to reveal Himself to you.
[time=1692] And as we know the Word of God, we start to learn and know the God of the Word.
[time=1697] And the more we know the God of the Word, the more we see His heart.
[time=1700] And then the more we see His will starting to unfold in our life.
[time=1702] So if you want to know the will of God, be in God's Word.
[time=1705] And this is what Paul is teaching for the church at Colossae.
[time=1708] And for us today, the same thing is true of us as it is of them.
[time=1711] There were heretics, there were gnostics, there were philosophers of their day and our day that used these kind of words, specifically in Paul's day, like fullness and complete and wisdom and understanding and filled.
[time=1722] And what does that mean and what does that look like?
[time=1725] We're still asking the same things, but Paul gives us a new definition of biblical ways, Jesus-driven ways, to look at those definitions.
[time=1734] And the Holy Spirit, here's the thing, I want to speak specifically to my fellow pastors that may hear this.
[time=1738] My life group leaders that faithfully serve our church and the teachers that teach the Word of God.
[time=1744] And a trick question here, how many of you are teachers of the Word of God?
[time=1748] You should all raise your hand because you're all an ambassador, you're all a minister.
[time=1752] But some of us are called out in their specific callings that God has given me as the one they always shouldn't have done.
[time=1757] I had the aptitude test, I said I shouldn't be a public speaker and then God said I'll make that boy a preacher.
[time=1761] So you never know what God will do, so don't tell God never.
[time=1764] But let me speak specifically to those of you who teach the Word of God.
[time=1767] And I want to give you the greatest revelation that I have ever received from the Lord when it comes to teaching the Word of God.
[time=1772] And I really mean that, and it's real simple.
[time=1775] The greatest revelation I've ever received is that I am not the teacher.
[time=1781] And so that means all of you that don't like my sermon today, take it up with the teacher.
[time=1787] I mean, I'm just his mouthpiece, here's what I've learned.
[time=1790] The Holy Spirit of God is the teacher.
[time=1794] My job and your job is to stay out of his way, to be his mouthpiece, to be a vessel that
[time=1802] he can use.
[time=1803] This is why in our life we're one of our ground rules, one of the things, the methods that we use is silence.
[time=1809] Because I've learned, I ain't me in my big mouth sometimes when I don't like silence, I'll fill the silence thinking well this is what I'm supposed to teach.
[time=1815] But sometimes the best thing we can do is just let it sit for just a second and let the Holy Spirit work in the silence.
[time=1822] So how long is he going to go?
[time=1835] Let the Holy Spirit be your teacher.
[time=1837] This is how we can walk with a spirit.
[time=1839] This is how we can know God's will, is let the Holy Spirit be your teacher.
[time=1844] And that's why he meets us where we are as we open the Word of God no matter where you are.
[time=1848] This applies to your life group that you go to this week.
[time=1849] Let the Holy Spirit be the teacher.
[time=1850] I know you've got a facilitator and a life group leader.
[time=1852] Let's Sunday mornings.
[time=1853] I don't care who's preaching up here.
[time=1854] We're going to preach the Word of God, but the same teacher teaches here Sunday every single Sunday and it's the Holy Spirit of God, using the Word of God.
[time=1861] I don't care who's got the microphone, that's what you can expect.
[time=1864] Let the Holy Spirit teach you on Sunday mornings in your life group in your personal quiet times.
[time=1869] The Holy Spirit is our teacher.
[time=1870] And the last thing I'll tell you about knowing God's will is that it is always God's will to walk in God's ways.
[time=1877] So if you're confused about the unknown will of God, people come to me a lot.
[time=1881] Probably the most common question I get as a pastor is, "Pastor, how can I find the will of God in my life?" So it's an unknown will.
[time=1887] And we all have those questions.
[time=1888] I do too.
[time=1889] We all do.
[time=1890] And I'll always say the same thing.
[time=1891] It's if you want to know the unknown will of God in your life, do the known will of God in your life.
[time=1896] The more you do the known will of God in your life, the more he will reveal to you his unknown will.
[time=1902] Let me give you some examples.
[time=1903] If you're like, "Man, I just feel God stirring something and I don't know what he's asking me to do.
[time=1906] I don't have to.
[time=1907] I need to do this in ministry.
[time=1908] I need to do that." Well, here's what you know.
[time=1911] You know you're called to serve.
[time=1912] So use your gift somewhere, plug in and serve.
[time=1914] You know you're called to be generous and to give.
[time=1916] You know you're called to love people really well.
[time=1918] You know you're called to honor others, some of these marks of maturity we're looking at today.
[time=1922] You know you're called to speak truth and love in people's lives.
[time=1925] You know you're called to be an ambassador.
[time=1926] So find ways to do those very specific things and what God does is he will progressively, you ever notice that God doesn't just go, "There it is, all of it." Because here's the real deal.
[time=1936] We couldn't handle it all if God gave it all to us at once.
[time=1938] So he says, "Hey, follow my known will today and by tomorrow I'll give you a little more." And I'll give you a little more and you just keep walking with me.
[time=1946] That's how we know the will of God.
[time=1948] But then as the verse continues, it goes to the second part of that and that's doing God's will.
[time=1953] That's number, what are we at now?
[time=1954] 11.
[time=1955] So you look at your neighbor, say, "You're almost there.
[time=1957] You're doing good.
[time=1958] Doing the will of God.
[time=1959] Knowing the will of God leads to doing the will of God.
[time=1962] Look at the verse.
[time=1963] It says, "So as.
[time=1964] Why do we ask this that you're filled with the knowledge of His will and spiritual wisdom and understanding so as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to Him, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God?" And I'm going to talk about that word knowledge here in just a second.
[time=1979] But let's start with that first two, the little conjunction there of so as.
[time=1983] Why do we do this?
[time=1984] So as.
[time=1985] The so as.
[time=1986] The so that is the why and it leads us to the purpose of knowing the will of God and that is that we could do the will of God.
[time=1993] It means that we know so that we can go.
[time=1997] We know the will of God so that we can go out and be and do the will of God in our lives, bearing fruit.
[time=2003] And notice that the fruit, as we've talked about the spirit, is the fruit of the spirit, not the fruit of self.
[time=2009] And the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
[time=2014] And it comes from Him, not from us.
[time=2017] And so as we do the will of God, we will see this knowledge.
[time=2020] What is this knowledge?
[time=2021] There's a couple of key words for knowledge.
[time=2023] Listen, don't miss this.
[time=2024] There's gnosis in the Greek, gnosis.
[time=2027] And that's this imperfect, partial kind of head knowledge, something that you know but maybe you haven't applied or experienced at the fullest, deepest level.
[time=2035] There's gnosis.
[time=2036] That's not the word that Paul uses in this passage or in this prayer.
[time=2039] He uses the word, epic gnosis.
[time=2040] Look at your neighbor say, epic gnosis.
[time=2043] You just spoke Greek and you didn't even know you could do that.
[time=2045] Epic gnosis is not a partial, incomplete knowledge.
[time=2048] You could say this is like the super knowledge.
[time=2050] This is an experiential, perfect, precise, full, enveloping, consuming knowledge.
[time=2058] It goes from a head knowledge to a heart knowledge.
[time=2062] It's a full-on experiential knowledge that consumes us.
[time=2067] And here's how you can write it down.
[time=2068] It takes us from head knowledge, gnosis.
[time=2070] It takes us from accumulated knowledge to applied knowledge.
[time=2074] There's a big difference in filling notebooks and having accumulated knowledge and getting to the place where I have applied knowledge.
[time=2081] That's why James tells us, don't just be hearers of the word, only be doers of the word.
[time=2085] We know God's will so that we can do God's will.
[time=2089] Paul knows this so well that this comes from God.
[time=2092] We do our part but God does his part.
[time=2094] First Corinthians 3, 6, and 7, Paul said, "I planted a polished water but God gave the growth." This is all of him.
[time=2101] We can't do this stuff but he does it through us.
[time=2103] So neither he who plants nor he who waters his anything but only God who gives the growth.
[time=2109] So you do your part to know God's will, to let it be an experiential applied knowledge,
[time=2115] not just an accumulated knowledge and God will bring the growth that you can't bring on your own.
[time=2121] And when that happens, you realize real quick that it cannot be of me.
[time=2125] And that leads to number 12, which is God's empowerment.
[time=2128] You need God's empowerment for that.
[time=2130] It's the fruit of the Spirit, not the fruit of me, verse 11.
[time=2132] May you be strengthened with all power according to his glorious might.
[time=2137] We have never arrived and this growth comes from God, but listen, God didn't call you and give you his will for your life.
[time=2143] God didn't call you because you're equipped, but God always equips you when he calls you.
[time=2149] He's ready to equip you for whatever it is.
[time=2151] The same power that rose Jesus from the dead dwells in us.
[time=2156] We have God's empowerment.
[time=2157] We have God's presence right inside of us every single day, not just when you gather on Sunday, but when Monday comes.
[time=2163] And those tough Mondays happen.
[time=2165] And then we can do number 13 and that's displayed in our relationship.
[time=2167] It's a patient persevering joy.
[time=2170] At the end of verse 11, he says, "Why, why all this?
[time=2172] Why should we be strengthened with God's power according to his glorious might?
[time=2175] For all endurance and patience with joy." We have such an opportunity today, my friends, and here's what I mean by that.
[time=2184] Today is so filled with angry people.
[time=2188] If you noticed, people are so angry today and so a little bit of perseverance, a little
[time=2195] bit of patience, a little bit of joy, a little bit of grace goes a long, long way.
[time=2203] It stands out in a big, big way in a world where people are so angry.
[time=2208] We are called to build people up, people up to honor people.
[time=2211] So let's build one another up instead of beat one another up because listen, when Christians fight with Christians, everybody loses, especially non-Christians.
[time=2221] So may we be the kind of church that displays this patient persevering joy.
[time=2225] And then it'll overflow in 14.
[time=2227] Number 14 is Thanksgiving.
[time=2228] And remember, Paul wrote this from prison.
[time=2230] So it makes it have a little bit more pop, doesn't it, to see that Paul is saying, giving thanks to the Father.
[time=2234] He wrote this from prison, but he still displayed gratitude.
[time=2238] And that led to number 15.
[time=2239] Look at your neighbor.
[time=2240] Say, you did it.
[time=2241] We made it.
[time=2242] Number 15 is identity-driven impact.
[time=2246] He says, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints.
[time=2252] This is identity.
[time=2253] In light, that's your impact.
[time=2256] Last week I talked about the activity and our identity.
[time=2259] And a lot of times we think that my activity makes up my identity.
[time=2262] I've got to earn God's approval and earn God's love with my activity.
[time=2265] And then I can get the identity.
[time=2267] Jesus says, no, you're not going to be good enough to do that.
[time=2269] So I came and I did it for you.
[time=2271] I finished the work.
[time=2272] So now I give you an identity.
[time=2276] It now overflows into your activity.
[time=2280] This my friends are not just marks of maturity.
[time=2282] This is how mature people pray.
[time=2286] So let's do that together right now.
[time=2287] Will you bow your heads?
[time=2288] Let's just pray together and spend a few minutes.
[time=2289] I'm going to give you a moment to pray and even do this a little differently this week.
[time=2294] I want to give you a chance as a leadership team, we met this last Tuesday night and we just spent some time on our knees together.
[time=2300] And some of you are not able or may not want to do that.
[time=2302] That's okay.
[time=2303] But I want to give you a chance in just a minute to come and just fill the altar here in the front.
[time=2307] You can spread out at the seats.
[time=2308] You can get in the aisles.
[time=2309] Get on your knees.
[time=2310] You can stay in your seat.
[time=2311] But online at home, wherever you may be watching, maybe it's a good time to do that as a family right now.
[time=2316] Just to get on your knees together and just pray.
[time=2319] Today Christians, I want to ask you to pray for one thing.
[time=2321] What one mark, what one mark of maturity do I need to dig into this week?
[time=2325] I realize you probably have 12, probably have 15.
[time=2328] But what can we start small with this week?
[time=2330] What's one mark that God would have me to dig into this week?
[time=2334] Some of you are here and you would say, "I just don't know that I have a personal relationship with Jesus." The gospel, I've made it very clear Jesus did what you couldn't do.
[time=2341] He took your place on the cross, paying for your sin, a price you could never pay for yourself.
[time=2346] And he rose from the dead.
[time=2347] And because he lives, you can believe that Jesus is Lord, and confess with your mouth today that God has raised him from the dead.
[time=2353] And the Bible makes it clear.
[time=2354] And the Bible was written by a God who made it possible.
[time=2358] So God makes it clear to you today that you shall be saved.
[time=2362] In your own words I want to give you a chance to pray that right now you can start moving right now.
[time=2366] We're just going to have some music going on behind me.
[time=2367] And I'm just going to hit my knees and I want to ask you, will you lay your heavy burdens and backpacks down before the Lord and I'll come back and close us in just a couple of minutes.
[time=2375] So let's take a few minutes and do that right now.
