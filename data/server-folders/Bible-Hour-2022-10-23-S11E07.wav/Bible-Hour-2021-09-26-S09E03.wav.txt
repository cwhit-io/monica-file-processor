[time=0] Turn your Bibles to the book of Colossians.
[time=2] We're going to be in chapter one.
[time=3] We are in a series called "Maturity University." And I love this image because we've been strapping on our backpack every week.
[time=11] And you notice there's young and old, and we're in this together.
[time=14] And we always, because none of us have arrived, have something new to learn.
[time=19] So I pray you've come with open hearts, open ears, open hands to receive what the Lord has for you today.
[time=25] Maturity University, we're looking at what it means to be mature, to grow in our faith, even in a time where that gets so skewed.
[time=34] When it gets misrepresented and misdefined, we are looking at the book of Colossians, and there's so much truth packed in there about that.
[time=42] So today, I get to share with you about the truth about Jesus.
[time=46] We live in a world that gives us a lot of pictures of Jesus.
[time=49] We've been Colossians 1, verses 13 through 23.
[time=52] And whoa, I've got to tell you, I'm excited about today.
[time=54] I love preaching.
[time=55] I'm always pumped to preach the Word of God.
[time=57] But this passage and my job today, all we get to focus on today is who Jesus is.
[time=65] And I don't know what you're going through today, but a little bit of just looking at the person of Jesus Christ is always the way to go.
[time=72] And so I'm so pumped to be able to share the Word of God with you today.
[time=75] We've been strapping on our backpack, and I got a new one for you today.
[time=79] How many of you remember when these were all the rage?
[time=82] Now remember these bad boys, these clear, transparent backpack?
[time=87] And so man, how many of you ever had one of those?
[time=89] Right? Yeah, they were the style.
[time=91] Yeah, right.
[time=92] I know there's more of you.
[time=93] You just don't want to admit it.
[time=94] These things, actually, there's some story behind them.
[time=97] They're mandated and sometimes even a part of policies in schools throughout, even back to the late '90s, when the Columbine shooting, if you remember that happened, there were a lot of schools as a follow-up to that that made it a part of a policy that they would, the kids would have to wear clear, transparent backpacks.
[time=114] And the thing about that is, and why did they do that, is so that you could see what really was in there.
[time=120] And I think the same thing is true of the series, the same thing is true of what the Book of Colossians is doing.
[time=126] It helps us really get a good glimpse at what's really in the backpack of our faith.
[time=132] What is it that we really carry around?
[time=135] If we looked into our hearts, if we looked at the maturity that really resides inside of us, what's really in there?
[time=143] So I think that's one thing we can learn from our transparent, clear backpack today.
[time=147] Another thing is this, and Paul wants us to know this, and God wants you to know this.
[time=150] Listen, if there's any message, if there's anything that has to be clear, see what I did there, right?
[time=157] It has to be clear in our life is what we believe about Jesus Christ.
[time=163] And the third thing that really has to be clear in our life is how we take what we believe about Jesus and make it clear to a world that is so fuzzy.
[time=173] It is so convoluted.
[time=174] It is so muddy.
[time=176] It is so confused.
[time=178] May we be clear on what we believe about Jesus and how we make that clear in the world around us.
[time=185] Are you ready to strap your backpack on?
[time=187] And let's go today.
[time=187] We are so pumped that you're here, and a part of what God is doing.
[time=191] And God, listen, look at me for a minute.
[time=192] God's got a word for you today.
[time=194] God's going to encourage your heart today.
[time=195] I don't know what you brought into the room, but Jesus loves you, and he's got a great word for you today.
[time=201] The false teachers, as we look at the book of Colossians, Paul's writing a letter from prison.
[time=205] He's writing to the church at Colosses.
[time=207] Never even met these people.
[time=208] He's never been there, and Apaphras is the pastor.
[time=212] We've looked at some of the background in the earlier part of chapter one, but he's writing because there are false teachers in his day, just like there are today that listen, they wouldn't deny Jesus, but they would dethrone Jesus.
[time=225] And that's a lot of what happens when we talk about the truth about Jesus today.
[time=229] There are plenty of people who would say, "I don't deny that Jesus is a prominent person, that he's a huge figure, that Jesus is this great teacher, that Jesus is this or that Jesus is them." We may not deny Jesus, but so many pockets in today's world.
[time=243] When it comes to the truth about Jesus, do dethrone Jesus.
[time=247] He is not someone that I will deny, but I dethrone him by saying he's not really God, he's not really the king of kings, he's not the creator of the world, he's not the deity, the divine God, son of God that he claims to be.
[time=259] In the same way in Paul's day and in ours, people will say Jesus has prominence, for sure he's a prominent figure, Jesus has prominence, but he doesn't have preeminence.
[time=268] Preeminence is what Paul is writing about specifically in the content that we get to dig into.
[time=274] Now, preeminent means his first place, his superior is ahead of everything else, that in this case that he is God and he is the king of kings and the Lord of lords, the creator of the universe, that he is who he says he is.
[time=287] So in a world that says Jesus has prominence, but not preeminence, Paul is writing to correct and to align those that are going to read his letter and us, God is doing the same thing, we have to be clear about the truth, about Jesus.
[time=301] Why? Paul is writing so that it's clear, so that we can know this and live this out, that everything, everything, look at your neighbor and tell him everything, not some things, everything hinges on Jesus.
[time=313] So I've got seven truths about Jesus today, hey, that's way better than 15 if you're here with us last week, so we can do that.
[time=319] Let's talk about seven truths about Jesus, Colossians chapter one, we'll go verse by verse through, all the way through verse 23.
[time=327] Are you ready for the word today?
[time=328] Black call. Let's dig in.
[time=330] Number one is that Jesus is our savior.
[time=334] Jesus is our savior, let's reverse his 13 and 14, where we see this picture of who Jesus is.
[time=340] Paul continues right where we left off last week, he said, giving thanks to the Father, who qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints of light, you remember that identity that overflows into impact, and now he's going to give you the how that that can happen by talking about Jesus.
[time=353] Truth number one, Jesus is our savior.
[time=355] Verses 13 and 14 says he, Jesus, has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
[time=371] Jesus is our savior, when we read these verses, first of all, the name Jesus Christ, Jesus, means God is our savior.
[time=379] Christ is the anointed, the chosen one of God.
[time=382] Jesus is all of that.
[time=384] He is all of that in the word made flesh that dwelt among us.
[time=388] He has come and dwelt among us.
[time=390] Why? To be our savior, to be our salvation.
[time=394] I love these phrases.
[time=395] He's delivered us from the domain of darkness, and what has he done?
[time=398] He's transferred us to a different kingdom.
[time=401] There's these two different kingdoms.
[time=402] There's the kingdom of darkness, the domain of darkness, and he came to be our savior to transfer us from a kingdom of darkness that is based on sin, and a sin that leads to death, and based on nothing that is going to give us anything of substance for eternal life.
[time=419] But yet this is the kingdom in which we live.
[time=421] This is the kingdom that we often build with how we prioritize in our life.
[time=426] He's transferring us from the kingdom of darkness, the kingdom of sin, the kingdom of self-righteousness, to a new kingdom, to the kingdom of his beloved son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sin.
[time=438] This is why our vision at Blackhawk is to light the one-five.
[time=441] We want to go from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of light, for this kingdom of Jesus, the kingdom of God that he came to establish.
[time=449] Our vision over these next eight years going at our 60th anniversary in 2029 is to develop and sin.
[time=456] We want to go beyond our Blackhawk bubble, go beyond ourselves.
[time=459] We want to be real clear about this, about what we believe about Jesus.
[time=462] We want to do that by developing and sending out 1500 ambassadors.
[time=466] This is people that represent the kingdom that Jesus came as our savior to transfer us to, an ambassador who represents light, lighting the one-five, and that's the one-fives.
[time=476] That's across our street in our one-five zip code.
[time=478] That's among our city, it's among our nation, all the way to 15 regions all around the world.
[time=482] We want to develop and send ambassadors to go beyond their comfort zone.
[time=486] Why?
[time=487] To reach the lost, to reach those who are far from God, but close to us.
[time=491] This is why, because Jesus did that.
[time=494] Jesus came so that we could have salvation.
[time=498] John chapter one and verse 14 tells us this, "The word became flesh and dwelt among us." This is why he came.
[time=505] And we have seen his glory.
[time=506] Glory has loved the only son from the Father, full of grace and truth.
[time=513] Jesus is the full embodiment of all of that.
[time=515] And he was unseen.
[time=516] God is unseen, we're going there next.
[time=518] And he became seen.
[time=520] He is our savior.
[time=521] Number one, write this down.
[time=522] Number two is Jesus is our source.
[time=524] Go to verses 15 and 16.
[time=526] This is where the unseen nature of God becomes seen.
[time=530] Jesus came to be our savior.
[time=531] But before the word became flesh and dwelt among us, Jesus already was.
[time=537] Jesus, oh my gosh, this passage, we could talk about it for six months.
[time=541] There's so much there, but let's read verses 15 and 16.
[time=544] Before the word became flesh, here's what Jesus was.
[time=547] Says he is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.
[time=553] For by him all things were created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities.
[time=561] All things were created through him and for him.
[time=565] Look at your neighbor and say all things, all things.
[time=569] This is important.
[time=570] It's not some things.
[time=571] He not only created all things, but he is in all things in our lives.
[time=576] And we're gonna dig into that even with the next point, but let's talk about verses 15 and 16.
[time=580] He is our source.
[time=582] Jesus was before you were here.
[time=585] Jesus before all things were, Jesus was.
[time=588] Jesus is the great I am.
[time=590] Jesus is the creator.
[time=591] He is before all things.
[time=593] He was there the whole time.
[time=595] So he is the source of your earthly life, but Paul goes on to remind us that he's not just the source of your earthly life.
[time=601] He's the source of your eternal life.
[time=605] And so let's go through that verse.
[time=607] He's the image of the invisible God.
[time=610] Does God ever feel invisible to you?
[time=611] I'll be honest, there's times where even though I've been a child of God and I accept a crisis, my Savior, as a young child physically speaking spiritually, there are times that as a son of God, it just feels like God gets silent.
[time=625] Or maybe God feels a million miles away to you.
[time=627] Maybe you're in this room or you're watching us on a screen right now and that's exactly how we feel.
[time=632] And I think a lot of times, and the first thing I would tell you to do is to look to Jesus if you want to know who God is.
[time=638] Jesus said it this way, John chapter 14 and verse nine.
[time=641] He said, "He who has seen me has seen the Father." Jesus is our source of earthly life, of eternal life, but he's also our source of God's presence.
[time=650] And then he sends the Holy Spirit.
[time=651] He told his disciples, "Hey look, it's to your advantage that I die and I'm raised and I send to be with the Father because when I go, the Holy Spirit will come.
[time=658] You're going to have this advocate.
[time=659] You're going to have the presence of God with you.
[time=661] And Jesus is the source of that.
[time=664] He's the source of all of these things in our life.
[time=666] He's the image of the invisible God.
[time=670] If you want to see more of God in your life, do nothing more, nothing less than look at Jesus.
[time=676] He's the image of a God that seems invisible.
[time=679] He makes the unseen become seen.
[time=682] In Philippians chapter two, I want to read a couple of verses till you see some more of a picture of this about the image of God and how he laid down the deity of himself.
[time=692] He was fully God.
[time=693] That never changed, but he chose to empty himself of things so he could become fully man and come meet us where we are because he is our Savior.
[time=701] He is our salvation.
[time=702] He's the source of that.
[time=703] And so Philippians two, five through seven, have this mind among yourselves which is yours in Christ Jesus who though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped.
[time=715] But emptied himself by taking the form of a servant, that word servant, literally translated his bond servant as slave, it's the lowest of positions being born in the likeness of men.
[time=728] The word became flesh and dwelt among us and the God of the universe became fully man so that he could pay a price for us.
[time=735] That he could be our Savior.
[time=737] That he could be our source not just of earthly life but of eternal life.
[time=741] Jesus is our source.
[time=742] And this word image in the original language is the word from which we get our English word icon, icon.
[time=748] Think of an icon that comes to mind, a logo or an icon that makes you think of something else, just think of what?
[time=753] What comes to mind first, just think of it for a minute.
[time=755] For me, I don't know why but it was a Coca-Cola icon because it's very recognizable.
[time=759] And so when you see the red circle and the white cursive writing, that icon, here's what it does, it's an icon that connects you to the source of the Coca-Cola that they want you to go buy and drink.
[time=771] And so they're doing a good job.
[time=773] Marketing 101 is happening but that icon connects you to a source so that you'll do something with that source.
[time=780] And that is exactly what Jesus is.
[time=782] It's a very poor illustration that breaks down way short of Jesus but you get the picture.
[time=786] The icon of God, the image of God is Jesus Christ.
[time=791] And he connects us to the source of life, the God of the universe.
[time=796] Isn't it crazy to think that God would want us to have that as a source, as a revelation?
[time=800] Because people always try to speculate about who God is.
[time=804] And if you want to know who God is, here's what Jesus does.
[time=807] Philosophers and theologians and scholars, a lot of times we'll end up in speculation about who God is because Jesus came, listen, we go from speculation to revelation because God didn't just say, hey, speculate and guess and wonder who I am and I'm gonna be so mysterious.
[time=822] No, instead God said, I want revelation.
[time=824] I'm going to reveal myself to you.
[time=827] I'm going to become man, I'm gonna dwell on the earth to pay a price for you.
[time=831] You can't pay for yourself so you can know me.
[time=835] Jesus is that kind of a source.
[time=838] He is the firstborn of all creation, firstborn.
[time=842] A lot of times people will argue that this is says, oh, see, Jesus was created.
[time=846] He's the firstborn, well, that means he was born.
[time=848] Well, the word firstborn in scripture is used a couple of different ways.
[time=851] One is the way that maybe seems most rational to take it which means you're the firstborn.
[time=854] I'm the firstborn child in the river's family.
[time=857] And so that's one way it can be used.
[time=859] In this case, as you'll see in verse 16, that is not at all what is being described.
[time=863] Firstborn can be used in a family structure like that or it can be used to mean first rank.
[time=868] First rank or firstborn.
[time=870] In this case, it's first rank.
[time=871] He's the first rank, he is preeminent, he is above, he is superior to all of creation.
[time=878] And if you are still wondering like, well, I think it could mean that he was created and he's not the creator because that's what Paul is writing about.
[time=885] He was not created, he is the creator.
[time=888] He's the source of life.
[time=889] Verse 16 reminds us of that very thing.
[time=892] For by him, all things were created.
[time=893] That clears it up, doesn't it?
[time=895] And then this big list in case you're wondering what all means, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities, all things were created through him and for him.
[time=904] All comes from him, all belongs to him and all will give an account to him.
[time=909] At the name of Jesus, every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that he is Lord to the glory of God, the Father.
[time=918] Jesus is our Savior, Jesus is our source.
[time=921] Number three, Jesus is our sustainer.
[time=923] Verse 17, Jesus is our sustainer.
[time=925] He holds us together and he is before all things.
[time=928] In case you were still wondering about that, he always has been, he's always been the glue of the universe.
[time=933] He has always been this indescribable, uncontainable picture of who God is.
[time=938] He's before all things.
[time=940] And in him, all things hold together.
[time=943] Some versions will say consist in him, all things consist.
[time=946] He's the glue of the universe.
[time=948] He's before all things.
[time=950] This is really one of the most clear scriptures in all of the Bible about the deity of Jesus Christ.
[time=957] In fact, when we preach through our statement of faith last year, how many of you are here for that, the discipleship journey series we did, we preach through our statement of faith and we looked at the deity of Jesus, this is the passage that I preached to you.
[time=968] And we're here again because it's such a clear, rich, densely, theologically jam-packed section that gives us such a clear picture of who Jesus is.
[time=980] And he's not just the source of life, he's the sustainer of life.
[time=983] There is a religious viewpoint that has been popular for quite some time and especially in younger generations it seems that maybe a surge at times throughout history even now this is called deism.
[time=994] Deism is the belief that there is an intelligent creator that God created the universe, but that after God created the universe, he got disinterested in his creation.
[time=1004] That he did create, he is all powerful, but he just decided to leave it alone.
[time=1008] He decided not to govern, not to be sovereign, not to be engaged and involved with his creation.
[time=1014] It's like a God that would say I created you, I gave you life, that's all you're getting from me, now you go figure the rest out.
[time=1021] That would be a pretty sad place for me to live, I don't know about you.
[time=1025] And there's a lot of people that hold to that view, but this passage, I love this passage because it totally refutes this idea that God is a disinterested God.
[time=1034] God is not a disinterested God because in him, he's before all things, yes.
[time=1039] He did the creation part, that's the first part of that equation of deism, but the second part is what gets so often missed and it's the view of scripture and it's the view of Jesus that Paul wants to make so clear.
[time=1049] The backpack we must strap on is that Jesus is not just our savior and our source, but because he decided to be our savior, he is our sustainer.
[time=1057] He walks with us through every season of life and him all things hold together.
[time=1062] He is the glue of the universe and he's the glue of our lives.
[time=1067] Another deity focused passage you could write down is first Peter chapter number one, verses 20 and 21.
[time=1073] It says he was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in the last times for the sake of you who through him are believers in God who raised him from the dead and gave him glory so that your faith and hope are in God, in him all things hold together.
[time=1090] He was before the foundation of the world and now not only is he the creator, he's the sustainer, not only is he the foundation of life, he's the formation of life that holds it together and walks with us every single day.
[time=1104] Maybe you know the song.
[time=1105] I wanna speak it and sing it.
[time=1107] I wanna ask you to sing it with me if you know it.
[time=1108] You ready for it?
[time=1109] It's so true and it's so much what this verse embodies.
[time=1111] [MUSIC - 11 seconds]
[time=1127] Some of you came to church today to hear that Sunday school song to be reminded.
[time=1132] Listen, I don't know what you brought in with you today.
[time=1135] I don't know what feels out of your hands but whatever is out of your hands is not out of the hands of your Jesus.
[time=1143] He not only holds the whole world in his hands, he holds you in his hands.
[time=1148] John chapter 10, another reference you can go read, he says that nothing and no one can snatch us from the hands of the Father.
[time=1156] He's got us in his hands.
[time=1157] He holds the world in his hands.
[time=1158] He holds the universe in his hands.
[time=1160] He holds you in his hands and listen, he holds your situation in his hands.
[time=1166] And if he does that, that means even when things around us are crumbling, when your marriage is falling apart, when your relationships are crumbling, when it's out of your hands to find healing in a relationship, when your health seems to deteriorate and you have no answers, I'm thankful to know a God who, listen, if we're a child of God, he will heal us.
[time=1188] We will be healed.
[time=1190] Whether it's in this life or the next remains to be seen with him and listen, many of you are fighting those battles right now.
[time=1195] Many of you, I know in our church body right now, are fighting cancer.
[time=1198] My wife has a friend she went to school with and a little girl, the husband's been healthy his whole life.
[time=1205] He's 31 years old, they've got a sweet little girl and he got COVID and had all kinds of complications and he passed away yesterday.
[time=1211] And there's been stories like that here in our city and you are walking through stories like that and you've got rogue family members that are just chasing everything but Jesus and it feels so impossible, but he's got the whole world in his hands.
[time=1226] He's got you in his hands.
[time=1228] And listen, I could preach that all day, but the best thing I think I could do is let someone preach it to you who is living it.
[time=1234] I told you we've got a lot of people in our church body who are going through many things and many people specifically battling cancer right now.
[time=1240] It's been a theme of the last little while for us and many of you know coach Mark Davidson, our state championship basketball coach and he's been battling cancer and he had to take part of his family and you saw some of his family singing.
[time=1252] Ashton always does such a great job, but coach Davidson and Lisa and part of their family are in Arizona for a few weeks getting some focus treatment on his cancer and has just had a tough battle.
[time=1262] But I want you to listen to a message that he sent to the Black Hawk family that we've shared with much of the Black Hawk family and I want to share it with you.
[time=1270] And specifically, I want you to see what's clear in his backpack of faith and I want you to see specifically what it is that he asked us to pray for and then we're going to pray for them.
[time=1280] So check out this video from them.
[time=1282] - Black Hawk family, this is coach Davidson.
[time=1286] Of course my wife, Mrs. Davidson.
[time=1289] And we just want to give you guys a quick update on our situation.
[time=1293] And we will be flying out to Arizona for the next several weeks and we'll be getting some comprehensive cancer treatments.
[time=1303] And we want to thank those of you who have joined us in prayer that means so much to us.
[time=1309] And we asked you to continue to pray first and foremost that Jesus is exalted in this situation.
[time=1317] And we also continue to pray for complete healing.
[time=1321] And we thank you for joining us in that effort.
[time=1324] And so we will most definitely miss you all.
[time=1327] And I look forward to seeing you guys when we get back in November.
[time=1331] - And I just want to say thanks too for your fervent prayers for almost a year now.
[time=1338] And we just love you guys and just are so thankful for you loving us and our whole family and for praying with us.
[time=1345] And together, we are trusting the Lord that He's got us.
[time=1349] And so we look forward to being back with you in November, ready for basketball.
[time=1355] And we will all just be continuing to trust the Lord every single step of the way.
[time=1359] - Amen.
[time=1361] - Love you guys.
[time=1362] - Can we thank God for the Davidson family?
[time=1365] They'll watch this.
[time=1366] Listen, I don't know if we love them, that we're behind them.
[time=1368] (audience applauds) If that didn't make it clear what that guy and that gal and their family stands for, I don't know what else does.
[time=1380] They're the real deal.
[time=1380] They're one of our Deacon families.
[time=1381] Like I say, many families are struggling with cancer and fighting with cancer.
[time=1385] So I want to pray for the Davidson's right now as a church family and for all of you who are battling different ailments and different needs, God knows every single one of them.
[time=1393] So I just want to pause right in the middle of a sermon and lift these dear friends of ours up as they're in Arizona.
[time=1398] We're still joined in heart, Davidson's.
[time=1399] We love you guys.
[time=1401] Your church family's behind you.
[time=1402] They serve faithfully as Deacons and part of the church family here and school family for a long, long time.
[time=1407] So let's lift them up and I want to lift you up as well.
[time=1410] So let's pray together.
[time=1411] God, if I have ever heard a clear example, an illustration of the focus on the truths of Jesus, God, I just saw it.
[time=1421] The number one prayer request that coach Davidson asked us to pray for is that Jesus would be exalted in this situation.
[time=1430] So God, we do pray for that.
[time=1431] I thank you for their faithfulness that has made that stay at the forefront even through bad news and tough times.
[time=1438] God, we do pray for healing.
[time=1439] We thank you that there will be healing.
[time=1442] In all of eternity, God, we will live healed and whole, but God, we pray for it in the earthly life as well.
[time=1447] We pray that it would be a further testimony in the name of Jesus of your power over coach Davidson and over all of those who are battling cancer and other ailments of those who have needs and the relationships in the world where it feels like so much is falling apart and crumbling and falling through our fingertips.
[time=1463] We are reminded that you've got the whole world in your hands.
[time=1467] And I pray you would hold the Davidson's.
[time=1468] I pray you would hold your church family in your hands.
[time=1471] Sustain us as only you can.
[time=1473] God, you're our savior, you're our source.
[time=1475] You are our sustainer and we lay all of this at your feet today in the powerful name of Jesus.
[time=1480] All God's people said, amen.
[time=1482] Jesus is your sustainer.
[time=1484] Next thing is Jesus is your supremacy, write that down.
[time=1486] Jesus is your supremacy.
[time=1488] Versus 18 and 19, he is the head of the body, the church.
[time=1492] And listen, the church because of Jesus is no longer a place, it is a people and that is us.
[time=1497] So he is the head of you.
[time=1498] That makes that more personal, doesn't it?
[time=1500] He's the head of the body of the church.
[time=1501] He is the beginning.
[time=1502] In case you were still wondering about that, the firstborn, there's that word again from the dead, this time not just creation, but now over death, the firstborn from the dead that in everything he might be preeminent or hold first place, superior, supreme, for in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell.
[time=1521] I love that part of the passage.
[time=1523] Jesus is our supremacy.
[time=1524] Let's start with this statement in verse 18.
[time=1526] Jesus is the head of the body, the church.
[time=1529] Jesus is God, he is supreme.
[time=1531] We've looked at that and you don't pray prayers and you don't ask for prayers like what you just heard unless you believe that, unless you're trusting in a God who is supreme, who is superior, who is the king of kings and the Lord of lords.
[time=1543] And I'm thankful for people who embody that.
[time=1545] Here's a few things I've noticed during this pandemic season, amid the pandemic, post-pandemic, if you could even say that.
[time=1553] We don't even know what to say these days, do we?
[time=1555] But I've noticed God do a lot of really good things and I've noticed the enemy get a lot of footholds during this time of a pandemic.
[time=1562] Let me talk about the good things first.
[time=1563] I'm a bad news first guy.
[time=1565] Let's do it backwards just for fun today.
[time=1567] The good thing is that God takes horrible things and redeems them for his glory.
[time=1571] We've baptized people here at the church that had not darkened the door of this church and really any other church.
[time=1576] And they accepted Christ through watching us online.
[time=1579] Well, everybody else was here and it was me and I don't know, eight to 10 other people that were floating around this place and there was nobody in the seats.
[time=1585] I only had cameras and I just got to come into your homes.
[time=1588] People came to know Christ and we've baptized people and people who either have gotten out of church or never were in church to begin with.
[time=1594] Now we're in a great reset right now with churches.
[time=1597] And so God's doing great things.
[time=1599] Be encouraged, the church is moving forward.
[time=1601] But the enemy has also used this to get a foothold as well, the churches in our area we talk about sometimes.
[time=1606] It feels like a church carousel sometimes because we live in a consumeristic society.
[time=1612] And listen, I'm not saying that anybody that leaves this church or another church or goes to another church, God uses that to start new seasons and new people.
[time=1618] And we celebrate that, I champion that.
[time=1621] But I've noticed that Satan has often gotten a foothold in fostering an environment where we build critical spirits and we start looking at God's church in a way that I don't believe is very pleasing to God.
[time=1635] It's through this lens of American consumerism where it's about me.
[time=1640] And so I want to remind us, 'cause listen, we cannot look to look at me church.
[time=1643] We cannot be that kind of church and honor the founder of the church who is Jesus Christ.
[time=1649] And here's what I mean by that.
[time=1650] So many times we end up criticizing God's church more than championing God's church.
[time=1655] If you ask you, are you a champion of God's church or a criticizer of God's church?
[time=1658] And here's the thing, will there always be reasons to criticize God's church?
[time=1662] Yes, you want to know why?
[time=1663] 'Cause it's filled with people like you and me.
[time=1664] And we're all flawed and we're all sinful people.
[time=1667] And anytime we're around, there'll always be reasons to criticize the church.
[time=1670] And listen, you could say a lot about me and it would be fine.
[time=1673] But what would really get me riled up is if you start talking about my bride.
[time=1677] Say something about Jessica and we got problems.
[time=1679] But Jesus feels the same way.
[time=1683] The bride of Christ is His church.
[time=1685] And God wants us to be builders of His church.
[time=1688] God wants us to build one another up, not tear each other down.
[time=1692] God wants us to be a champion of God's church.
[time=1694] Find reasons to champion your church and the global church.
[time=1697] And listen, wherever that is, and even though we do end up having seasons come and go of where we put in our roots, God moves us.
[time=1704] I'm a picture of that.
[time=1706] I came from Georgia to Indiana.
[time=1707] Those are good things.
[time=1708] We champion those things.
[time=1709] We are on the same team, but wherever you are rooted and planted as a part of the team, the body of Christ, be a champion of God's family.
[time=1719] Why? Because Jesus is the head of the church.
[time=1721] It is His church.
[time=1722] He is building His church.
[time=1724] And even the gates of hell will not prevail against it.
[time=1727] Write this down, consumerism.
[time=1729] This is so big in us.
[time=1730] Consumerism decreases as our focus on Christ increases.
[time=1735] When it comes to God's church, when it comes to Jesus church, consumerism often creeps in and it's a menu, restaurant mentality that the customer is always right.
[time=1744] And I've got news for us in this church.
[time=1746] And in God's church, the customer is not always right because it's not about us to begin with.
[time=1750] We serve an audience of one and it's Jesus church and He is building His church.
[time=1755] And He has given us leadership of which I'm privileged and humbled to be an under shepherd, under the owner of this church with our elders and our pastors and our leaders.
[time=1763] And it's why we must be committed.
[time=1765] And our leadership is committed to follow His voice, to do what He asks us to do for His church, not leading with a menu mentality that serves all of us, but leading with a mission mentality that does what God says to do for His church so that we can move His mission forward because it's His church to begin with.
[time=1783] This is the kind of church that God has called us to be.
[time=1786] He is our supremacy.
[time=1788] It is His church.
[time=1789] There's no power struggle.
[time=1790] People say there's power struggles in the church.
[time=1792] There's no power struggle here.
[time=1793] I'll lay that down.
[time=1794] It's not my church.
[time=1795] It's not the oldest church, it's not your church.
[time=1797] This church belongs to Jesus Christ.
[time=1800] May He build us up to look like He wants us to look.
[time=1804] He is our supremacy.
[time=1806] John 3 in verse 30, "He must increase, but I must decrease." This is my prayer over me and over all of us every Sundays.
[time=1813] It's not me that gets up here.
[time=1814] Listen, the Holy Spirit is your teacher.
[time=1816] The Word of God is our roadmap.
[time=1818] I just get to be the voice and the vessel that God uses along with whoever else may stand here.
[time=1822] May God through His church and in His church use His Word and His Spirit to build up His people.
[time=1828] May we and I decrease.
[time=1831] And may He increase.
[time=1832] That's my prayer for us.
[time=1833] Why?
[time=1834] Because He's the beginning.
[time=1835] The end of verse 18, the first born from the dead.
[time=1837] That again is His first place over death.
[time=1840] You don't believe He's supreme.
[time=1841] I don't know about you.
[time=1842] How many of you have figured out how to defeat death?
[time=1844] Anybody?
[time=1845] As all hands drop to the floor, Jesus, listen, Jesus told them that, hey, I'm going to rebuild this temple in three days.
[time=1850] They thought it was about a place, but He came to say no.
[time=1853] I'm coming to turn the presence of God moving it away from a place to a people.
[time=1858] And I'm talking about that this temple will be torn down.
[time=1860] And after three days, I will be raised from the dead.
[time=1863] And He told people that.
[time=1865] And then it happened.
[time=1866] And He showed back up.
[time=1867] They put Him in a grave.
[time=1868] They put Him away forever.
[time=1869] The enemy rejoiced.
[time=1870] And after three days, He showed back up and said, see?
[time=1874] Here I am.
[time=1875] He's alive.
[time=1876] And I don't know about you but anybody who can predict His own death and resurrection and can be preeminent and can be superior and can be the first born.
[time=1884] The first rank can defeat death.
[time=1887] I say they're the boss.
[time=1889] And that's who we follow.
[time=1890] Every other religion-- listen, every other religion, we are the only faith component.
[time=1897] Christianity is the only faith in which the founder of that faith, the founder of that religious perspective, claimed number one to be God.
[time=1905] But number two is alive and defeated death.
[time=1908] Every other religion, you're going to go commemorate its founders and its leaders in a tomb.
[time=1912] But not my Jesus.
[time=1913] You go to where His tomb is and where His body was laid.
[time=1916] And you ask people, where is Jesus?
[time=1917] They'll have to say, I don't know.
[time=1919] He's risen.
[time=1920] He's alive.
[time=1921] In church, I want you to know today, He is risen.
[time=1924] And because He lives, I can face tomorrow.
[time=1926] But because He lives in this earthly life, I can have eternal life.
[time=1930] And it starts today.
[time=1931] I can have life to the fullest because He's my Savior.
[time=1934] He's my source.
[time=1935] He's my sustainer.
[time=1936] But He is my supremacy.
[time=1938] At the name of Jesus, every knee is going to bow.
[time=1940] So I choose to bow now.
[time=1943] That's the kind of church that He's building.
[time=1945] He's the firstborn from the dead.
[time=1947] I thank God that in Him, all the fullness of God is pleased to dwell.
[time=1951] And if He's not risen, Paul says this to the church at Corinth.
[time=1954] 1 Corinthians 15, 14, if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is in vain.
[time=1958] And your faith is in vain.
[time=1960] And people will say, man, you talk about the resurrection a lot, pastor.
[time=1964] And so this is just a phrase, don't ever use it with me.
[time=1967] I'm going to give you my answer.
[time=1968] All right, don't you think you should talk about something new?
[time=1970] One word answer, real clear.
[time=1972] Nope.
[time=1973] There's never going to be anything better to talk about than that upon which our faith completely hinges.
[time=1979] And that is the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=1981] He's the firstborn from the dead.
[time=1983] And in Him, verse 19, for in Him, all the fullness of God, all the fullness of God is pleased to dwell.
[time=1990] Did you know it was the claim to be God that ultimately God Jesus killed?
[time=1994] They said, why are we going to go after Jesus?
[time=1997] Well, He's claimed to be God.
[time=1998] It's blasphemy.
[time=1999] You can't do that, right?
[time=2001] And it's this deity claim of Jesus, that He is God that God Him killed.
[time=2006] But it's that very claim that gives us the hope that we can never receive on our own today.
[time=2012] All, just like all scriptures inspired by God and profitable for rebuke and correction and training up in righteousness.
[time=2018] It's just the Greek word, all the fullness of God.
[time=2021] What does that Greek word mean, pastor?
[time=2023] You're ready for it, it's deep.
[time=2024] All, every darn bit of it.
[time=2028] Every piece, every nook and every cranny, every single bit of the fullness and the presence of God.
[time=2035] Listen, it's pleased to dwell with Jesus.
[time=2039] We can know Him.
[time=2039] All the fullness of God dwells in Him, just like all scripture and just like all people.
[time=2044] He wants all people to know who He is and to reach repentance.
[time=2047] Just like all of us are sinners and in need of a savior.
[time=2052] Jesus in His supremacy is our true north.
[time=2056] It's our compass.
[time=2057] In a world that pulls us west and east and south, our true north is always the supremacy of Jesus.
[time=2062] He is sovereign, He is on the throne and you can trust Him.
[time=2066] You can follow Him, He's the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.
[time=2070] Number five is that Jesus is our sacrifice.
[time=2072] All right, that down.
[time=2073] Verse 20 tells us and through Him to reconcile Himself all things.
[time=2077] There it is again, all things.
[time=2078] That would mean everybody's gonna get there, but it means it's available.
[time=2080] Listen, some of you don't believe the all things here to reconcile all things.
[time=2083] You're a part of that.
[time=2085] God has made His salvation available to you because of His sacrifice.
[time=2089] All things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of His cross.
[time=2094] Peace only comes by the blood of Jesus.
[time=2096] There must be a sacrifice.
[time=2098] There must be death where there is sin.
[time=2100] The penalty of sin, the wages of sin is death and Jesus came to be that sacrificial lamb, a spotless, perfect sacrifice for us.
[time=2109] We don't have peace with God and we don't have the peace of God apart from a sacrifice, apart from blood atonement, blood atoning for, making up for our sinfulness and death.
[time=2122] Our sin is a declaration of war against God.
[time=2125] And we've all sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[time=2128] So we're in big trouble is what that means.
[time=2130] Translation, but Jesus came.
[time=2133] Romans 5, 8, 9 says this, but God shows His love for us and that while we were still sinners Christ died for us since therefore we have now been justified by His blood.
[time=2144] Everybody say justified.
[time=2146] We're gonna come back there.
[time=2147] Much more shall we be saved by Him from the wrath of God.
[time=2151] In this series of maturity universal, we looked at sanctification that leads to glorification.
[time=2155] Glorification is the end result when we get a new body.
[time=2158] Raise your hand if you're ready for that day.
[time=2159] Ready for that new body.
[time=2160] All right, we're ready to be made perfect.
[time=2162] We're ready to be made whole.
[time=2163] We're ready to be in the presence of God forever.
[time=2165] This is glorification.
[time=2166] This is the promise of God to those who follow Him, who are the children of God.
[time=2170] We will be with Him forever.
[time=2171] This is glorification.
[time=2173] To get there, there is sanctification.
[time=2175] This is the process of becoming like Jesus.
[time=2177] The maturity process of being conformed to His image.
[time=2180] But listen, before there can be sanctification that leads to glorification, there must be justification.
[time=2186] And that's a lot of Asians.
[time=2188] But here's what justification means.
[time=2191] It's just if I'd, everybody say that with me.
[time=2194] It's just if I'd never sinned.
[time=2198] That's what justification means.
[time=2200] It means that God looks at us through the lens of Jesus and it's justified, never sinned.
[time=2206] We're justified so that we can enter a process of being sanctified so that one day we can be glorified with Him forever.
[time=2212] Now that's maturity, university, my friends.
[time=2215] That's the process I want to grow into.
[time=2217] Through Jesus, we become family.
[time=2218] But the bigger picture of that sacrifice is number six.
[time=2221] And that is that Jesus is our substitution.
[time=2224] Jesus is our substitution.
[time=2225] Versus 21 and 22 are contrasting verses.
[time=2229] Verse 21 tells us about us.
[time=2230] And you who once were alienated, hostile in mind and doing evil deeds.
[time=2235] Glad it doesn't end there.
[time=2236] There's a swap that goes on here.
[time=2238] This is the gospel.
[time=2239] Now we go to verse 22.
[time=2240] What does Jesus do about that?
[time=2242] So that He has now reconciled in His body of flesh by His death in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before Him.
[time=2251] This is the beauty of the gospel.
[time=2253] Jesus is a substitutionary sacrifice.
[time=2256] He didn't just sacrifice Himself.
[time=2258] He swapped places with us.
[time=2260] He took our place.
[time=2261] He took our alienation from God and our hostility and our evil minds, our evil deeds and our sin and our death.
[time=2269] He took that and swapped places with us on the cross so that we could be presented before Him as instead of evil and hostile, we could be presented as holy and blameless and above reproach, that is what Jesus has done.
[time=2284] Second Corinthians 5, 21.
[time=2286] For our sake, He made Him to be sin, who knew no sin.
[time=2291] So that in Him, we might become the righteousness of God.
[time=2296] The gospel is that Jesus didn't just sacrifice Himself.
[time=2299] Jesus substituted Himself.
[time=2301] Jesus took our place.
[time=2304] It was my sin that put Jesus on the cross.
[time=2308] He had none, yet He took mine and He gave me His righteousness.
[time=2317] That's the beauty of the sacrifice and the substitution of Jesus.
[time=2321] I don't deserve that.
[time=2322] I don't know about you, but Jesus makes all of that possible for us.
[time=2325] Jesus traded places with me, condemnation for salvation,
[time=2331] separation for reconciliation.
[time=2334] It's a pretty good deal.
[time=2335] That's the gospel.
[time=2336] That's the good news of Jesus Christ.
[time=2338] And here's the thing, go to verse 23, and this is number 7.
[time=2341] Jesus is our strength.
[time=2342] In verse 23, if indeed you continue in the faith, stable and steadfast, not shifting from the hope of the gospel you have heard, which has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I, Paul, became a minister.
[time=2355] I don't know about you, but I'm going to need some strength from on high if I'm going to be stable and steadfast and not shifting from the hope of the gospel in today's time.
[time=2363] Not if you agree.
[time=2364] I need some strength from on high, and that's the beauty of knowing Jesus.
[time=2367] He is not just the giver of those things, but He sustains us in those things.
[time=2372] He gives us the strength to be stable when we feel unstable, the strength to be steadfast when we feel like giving up.
[time=2378] He gives us the strength to stay focused, not shifting from the hope of the gospel, even when we feel hopeless.
[time=2386] I don't know where you're at today, what makes you feel hopeless, but I came to tell you today that everything, write this down, remember this.
[time=2393] I share this with you all the time, and I'm going to share it till the day I die, until Jesus comes everything.
[time=2397] Not some things, everything you're looking for, the strength you lack, the healing you need, the peace that you've been coveting, the emptiness you're trying to feel, everything you're looking for can be found in Jesus.
[time=2412] The same word, epicnosis for knowledge that we'll see a lot in Paul's writing to the church at Colossae.
[time=2417] Peter uses it in Second Peter chapter one and verse three, where he says, "His divine power has granted to us all things." All, there it is again, all things that pertain to life and godliness through the knowledge, this heart level, experiential knowledge, not just ahead knowledge, of him who called us to his own glory and excellence.
[time=2435] If you missed all that, all seven of those truths, here's what it can be summed up as Jesus is the great I am.
[time=2441] My brother might roll in front of there, it was his phrase, it's such a great way of summarizing this passage, he's the great I am.
[time=2447] What do you need him to be, he is that, I am.
[time=2449] He's that and then some, he is everything you're looking for, and then things you don't even know you need.
[time=2455] That's my Jesus.
[time=2458] So I wanna challenge you to rest in that this week, and here's the question, how can I rest in Jesus this week?
[time=2463] 'Cause if you're gonna be clear about what you believe about Jesus and make it clear to those around you, you gotta be rested in that.
[time=2470] You gotta have a peace and a contentment, even though it's a storm filled life.
[time=2474] How can I rest in Jesus this week?
[time=2476] I wanna ponder that question with you, so I wanna ask you to bow your heads for a moment and just close your eyes and just spend some time with God and believers in the room.
[time=2482] What is it that you can do to rest in Jesus this week?
[time=2485] What is it that you can do to make clear what you believe about Jesus and to make it clear to others?
[time=2491] It starts with resting, and what area do you need to find rest in who Jesus is this week?
[time=2495] And what could it look like for you to take a step in that direction?
[time=2498] For some of you that are watching us online in the room right now, you would say as believers are praying, I just don't know, I've heard who Jesus is, and boy, the spirit of God is just moving in my heart, and I've realized I'm a sinner, and I need to save you.
[time=2511] And I wanna be a part of God's family, and I don't know that I know, that I know, that I'm a part of that family.
[time=2516] If that's you, I wanna give you a moment just to pray.
[time=2518] The gospel is clear and it's simple.
[time=2520] You're not saved by a prayer, you're saved by your heart being fully given to Jesus.
[time=2523] By trusting in Him for salvation and no one else, the gospel is that we have all sinned, and that sin, the wages of sin is death, and it's eternal death.
[time=2531] But God, while we were yet sinners, sent Jesus Christ, He was that perfect sacrifice, dying on the cross for you and for me.
[time=2538] But He rose from the dead.
[time=2540] He didn't stay dead, He rose from the dead, and He won the victory over death so that moments like this could happen, so you could trust in Him.
[time=2549] Romans 10 reminds us that anyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
[time=2553] Wherever you're at, I wanna give you a moment just to trust in Jesus as your Savior, to ask Him to save you, ask Him to forgive you.
[time=2558] Tell Him He believe He is who He says He is, that He did die for you, that He is alive.
[time=2562] Let Him know that you believe that, and you're gonna trust in that and nothing else.
