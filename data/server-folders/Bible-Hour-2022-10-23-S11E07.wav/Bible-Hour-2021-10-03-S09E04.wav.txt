[time=0] All right, look at your neighbor, tell them to say, "Bookle up." What are we going to dig into the Word today?
[time=5] Get your Bibles out.
[time=6] Let's go to the book of Colossians.
[time=7] We are in a series right now church called "Maturity University." And we're studying the book of Colossians.
[time=12] We're still in chapter 1.
[time=13] So today will be our fourth week.
[time=15] And so if you're new with us, don't worry.
[time=17] Today's message I believe is going to hit you right where you live.
[time=20] But every week we're digging into verse by verse through this book of Colossians.
[time=24] And today, I want to talk to you about making the most of the worst times.
[time=30] And no doubt, that's very relevant.
[time=32] Just I hear this almost every week right now is like, "Man, just in general, in our nation, in our world, these are just the worst times.
[time=40] These are just such a tough time, whether that's individually or collectively." And so this is very relevant for us.
[time=46] And no doubt as we go through that, and we're looking at spiritual maturity right now through Maturity University, looking at Paul's writing to the church at Colossi.
[time=55] So hopefully you've been able to dig in with us and see the context to which he was writing.
[time=59] But Paul writes today about suffering.
[time=62] As Colossians 1, we'll start in verse 24 where we left off last week.
[time=66] And we'll get into chapter 2 today.
[time=68] Believe it or not, we're going to get to chapter 2, Lord willing.
[time=71] But here's the thing, every week we're talking about strapping on our backpack, right?
[time=74] And it represents that none of us have arrived, and that we always have something to learn.
[time=79] And we believe that here at Black Hawk.
[time=81] I got a little bit of a different bag to strap on today.
[time=88] This is a fanny pack, in case you've never seen one of these bad boys before.
[time=93] Bet you never had a preacher wear one of these, right?
[time=96] It's a little bit small, too.
[time=98] There we go.
[time=101] All right, we got it. Thank you. That's right.
[time=103] I appreciate that.
[time=103] Here we go.
[time=104] So can you guys take me seriously if I preach the whole message in this?
[time=108] But here's the real deal.
[time=110] I want this to be seared into your memory, not me.
[time=113] But this statement, this thought.
[time=114] And here's what I want you to know, if we're going to make the most of the worst times, make the best of the worst times.
[time=119] It's going to take a little bit more than a fanny pack faith.
[time=122] The little strap on faith that you just strap on at times when you need it.
[time=126] The prayer that you pray on your way to a tough thing.
[time=129] Real spiritual maturity goes way deeper than a strap on quick fanny pack faith.
[time=135] So how many of you have one of these?
[time=136] Just be honest, look at your neighbor.
[time=138] All right, there you go.
[time=139] That's right, be honest.
[time=140] They're helpful.
[time=141] They're good tools.
[time=142] But men, to go through the worst of times is going to take a little bit more than that kind of faith.
[time=148] It's going to take the backpack kind of faith.
[time=149] It's going to take a fate that goes way beyond what a bag can hold.
[time=153] So let's make the most of the worst times.
[time=154] And I'm going to take this off because you ain't going to take me seriously at all.
[time=157] If I don't, but today I want us to talk about going beyond a fanny pack level of faith.
[time=162] I want us to go really into what it means to be spiritually mature as we look at the book of Colossians.
[time=168] Paul had a lot to say about that.
[time=170] Let's look at making the most of the worst times.
[time=172] And as I go into this, I'm going to give you four ways that Paul outlines that he did this and he challenges the church at Colossae to do this and the church of Jesus to do this.
[time=181] And I got to stop and be a pastor for just a minute because right now in our church body, there are people who are battling all kind of diagnosis, people who are battling cancer, people who have lost loved ones, people who are hurting at all time high kind of levels right now.
[time=199] And my pastor's heart is broken for so many in our church body who feel that way.
[time=203] And so many of you would say something like this to me.
[time=205] If I were in your shoes, I would probably say something like this to me like, "Who do you think you are to tell me how I'm supposed to respond in my suffering?" And in my situation, to which I would say, "I can't." And you may say, "Well, you don't know me. You don't know what I'm going through." To which I would say, "You're exactly right." So my heart for you today is simply this, that God loves you so deeply.
[time=229] And God has given us his word and it is filled with examples of people like Paul who really went through deep times of suffering.
[time=237] And God wants to show you his heart for you today in the midst of the pain that you brought in.
[time=244] The backpack that you strap on every day, the pain and suffering.
[time=247] I don't know what your's looks like, but we all are either coming out of a time like that, or in a time like that, or going into a time like that, or maybe all of those simultaneously wherever you are.
[time=256] I today just simply want to be a voice from God.
[time=259] A vessel that God uses to look at his word and let you see a glimpse and his heart for you. Does that sound fair?
[time=265] Let's dig in today to making the most of the worst times, making the best of the worst times that we face.
[time=271] I'm going to give you four ways that Paul did that.
[time=273] The first one, write this down, is to view your suffering as an opportunity for growth.
[time=278] And Colossians 1 will read as we go here. We'll pick up in verse 24.
[time=282] Let's start there. You ready for the word today?
[time=284] Use your opportunity. View your opportunity.
[time=287] This is what I pray over. You pray God changes how you see the suffering that you're in the middle of today.
[time=292] And so let's start with what Paul says about suffering in verse 24.
[time=296] Paul says this, "Now I rejoice in my sufferings." How many of you, that's your go to? It's like, whoa, suffering.
[time=304] No, I don't typically look at it that way.
[time=306] And so there must be some different way that Paul is teaching us to see sufferings.
[time=310] If that's what I would start, now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake.
[time=315] And in my flesh, I am filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body that is the church.
[time=324] Now if you're like me, you read that. That's kind of a confusing verse.
[time=328] And you're like, what is Paul saying about that one?
[time=330] It's a highly debated verse. It's a big time controversial verse.
[time=333] There's scholars and I've read dozens and dozens of commentaries on it.
[time=336] And I'll tell you, a lot of them say about the same thing that I'm going to say to you is that there's plenty we know from scripture and from Paul's writing to interpret this clearly.
[time=344] But hey, I don't know exactly what Paul was talking about.
[time=347] So I'm with that posture going to walk us through that in just a second.
[time=350] But before I do, it's important to note that three times in the passage we're going to read through the beginnings of chapter two and verse number five, where we'll get to today, Lord willing, three times Paul talks of his struggle and his suffering and the turmoil that he feels.
[time=364] You see it in verse 24, we just read verse 29 that's coming up and in the first verse of chapter two.
[time=369] But in this first verse, this debated verse, here's the question that comes to mind.
[time=373] Does Paul mean that the suffering, that the sacrifice of Jesus is not enough?
[time=379] Is he saying that Christ's suffering and Christ's sacrifice and his work on the cross is lacking, therefore I'm going to finish it?
[time=387] And so to answer that, first of all, at face value, it looks that way a little, doesn't it?
[time=392] Can we own that and admit that? What is Paul saying there?
[time=395] And to answer that, here's what I want to tell you.
[time=397] Anytime we run into an unclear verse or a verse that's more unclear, less clear in Scripture, here's how we are to interpret that.
[time=404] We have the whole of God's Word.
[time=406] So when there is a verse that is less clear, we go and look at it in comparison and in context with the whole of Scripture that is clear.
[time=414] And I want you to know that if Paul himself and his own writings, he wrote most of your New Testament, it's clear about anything.
[time=420] It is that the finished work of Jesus on the cross is enough, period.
[time=425] No questions asked.
[time=427] This is the guy who persecuted Christians.
[time=429] This is the guy who said, "I'm the chief among sinners." This is the guy who Jesus radically transformed and he gave his life to the message of Jesus.
[time=438] And so no, he doesn't mean that the sacrifice of Jesus is not enough.
[time=442] So hey, since Jesus couldn't finish the job, I'm going to step in.
[time=446] No, not quite, is that what Paul says.
[time=448] So what is he talking about?
[time=450] And it's interesting, and I want to point out something in the tension.
[time=453] I'm just going to let you sit in the tension for a minute.
[time=455] You're light.
[time=456] You want to tell us what it means then because we don't like this, right?
[time=460] But it's in moments of tension.
[time=462] It's in moments like Peter talked about.
[time=464] Do you know Peter who wrote part of your New Testament as well?
[time=466] He talked about Paul's writings.
[time=468] Did you know that?
[time=469] In 2 Peter chapter 3, I think it's verses 15, 16 right in there.
[time=472] Peter talks about how Paul wrote about these same kind of topics.
[time=477] And here's the Kevin Para phrase version of what Peter said.
[time=480] He said, "And as you read Paul's writings, it's hard to understand." And I want you to realize that when we talk about maturity university getting beyond a fanny pack faith and really strapping on the weight of growing in Christ and true
[time=496] spiritual maturity, it's in times of tension, it's in times where we're willing to say, "I don't really know that sometimes God might grow us the most." So I just couldn't let that moment pass because that applies to suffer.
[time=508] If that doesn't apply to suffering, I don't know what it does.
[time=510] But it also applies to us understanding what God is teaching us in Scripture and those kinds of things.
[time=516] And so just like Peter, maybe we don't always understand fully exactly what Paul was trying to say, but we do know plenty from Scripture.
[time=522] And I want to point some of those things out.
[time=524] So it sounds like Jesus didn't finish the job, is that true?
[time=527] Absolutely not.
[time=529] When Jesus said, "It is finished on the cross," he meant it.
[time=533] Paul believed it.
[time=534] All of the writers of the Bible, and who's the writer of the Bible?
[time=537] The Holy Spirit.
[time=539] He used human vessels who were carried along by the Spirit of God.
[time=543] God has made that clear.
[time=544] If that's not clear in Scripture, nothing else is.
[time=546] And so I want you to be real clear about this.
[time=548] This is true from Paul, and this is true of suffering.
[time=550] A lot of times we try to add things to our faith.
[time=552] Write this down.
[time=553] That Jesus plus anything ruins everything.
[time=562] Paul knew this.
[time=563] We know this from the whole of Scripture.
[time=566] So what does Paul mean then, Pastor?
[time=568] Glad you asked.
[time=569] I'll do my best to unpack a few of the things.
[time=571] One of those things is the words he uses for "fill up." I'm here to fill up what is lacking is what he's saying.
[time=576] He's saying, "I'm going to keep going." And let me tell you what that means in this original language.
[time=581] Fill up is a very strange, compacted version of words.
[time=586] Putting together of words in the Greek language.
[time=589] Literally, you could translate it something like it's a continuum.
[time=592] It speaks of like a continuation of something through a repetition.
[time=597] So it's a repeating pattern that maybe you continue.
[time=600] And so what is Paul talking about when he's saying, "I'm going to fill up these afflictions." Christ afflictions that are lacking.
[time=606] He's saying, "What's not done?
[time=607] I'm going to keep going." And so Paul ran into Jesus on the road to Damascus.
[time=612] Did you know that?
[time=613] He persecuted Christians.
[time=614] He killed Christians.
[time=615] He threw Christians in prison.
[time=616] But Jesus met him on the road to Damascus and he blinded him with a light of his presence.
[time=621] And he lost his sight.
[time=622] And Jesus was sending Ananias, who was a disciple, to Paul to restore his sight because God had big plans for Paul.
[time=629] In case you haven't noticed, we're reading from the Word of God.
[time=632] His writing to the church at Colossae today.
[time=634] And in Acts chapter 9, verses 15 and 16, here is what, because Ananias didn't want to go to Paul, by the way.
[time=640] He's like, "He might kill me. I don't think I want to do that." And Jesus is telling him, "No, I want you to go, and here's why." Here's where we pick up that story, verse 15.
[time=647] But the Lord said to him to Ananias, "Go, for he has chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles."
[time=654] He was the missionary that the Gentiles to take the gospel beyond his current circles.
[time=659] And kings and the children of Israel don't miss verse 16.
[time=662] "For I will show him how much he must read it with me, how much he must suffer for the sake of my name."
[time=671] So here's how I would define where Paul is taking this verse.
[time=674] Write this down in your notes.
[time=676] Jesus finished the work of salvation. Can I get an amen?
[time=679] It is finished.
[time=680] The finished work of Jesus is enough. Jesus plus anything ruins everything.
[time=683] Jesus finished the work of salvation, but left for us a continuation of his work of suffering for God's glory.
[time=692] And not an amen in the house.
[time=694] So I don't think I really like the continuation of that, but this is where we've got a view suffering differently.
[time=700] Because that's what Paul taught us to do, is view our suffering as an opportunity for growth.
[time=704] The same Paul that wrote this wrote Philippians chapter 3 and in verse 10, he's talking about how all the things he used to count as gain their loss and their rubbish compared to knowing Jesus.
[time=714] And he says this, Philippians 3-10, "That I may know him in the power of his resurrection, and that I may share in his sufferings,
[time=724] becoming like him in his death." This is a guy who understood what it meant to view suffering as an opportunity to look like Jesus.
[time=732] Paul begins this sectional suffering, listen with a clear reminder for us today that we've got to follow his example, the example of Jesus in looking at suffering as an opportunity to be more like Jesus.
[time=744] That's growth, that's spiritual maturity.
[time=747] And so I've compiled for you, and these are in your notes, so I'm going to go fast through them because I've looked at a lot of lists that different scholars and teachers have made of the different types of suffering and scripture. You'll find lists from 30 different types to 3 different types.
[time=759] I've got 10. I've tried to combine it into 10 types of suffering that you will find in scripture.
[time=764] And don't worry if you can't write these down, they're not going to be on the screen.
[time=767] They're in your notes. So if you're watching live, just click that notes tab.
[time=770] If you've got the app, you just go to the online bulletin under the Gather section there, and you can find all of these notes, just like you can every week.
[time=776] Some of you didn't know that, and now you can take better notes. You're welcome.
[time=779] But let me give you these 10 types of suffering that we see in scripture.
[time=783] Number one, I'll call it creation suffering.
[time=785] It's because we live in a broken fallen sinful world that broken fallen sinful people call suffering.
[time=791] And the broken fallenness, the sin that is so encapsulating in our world today, it causes suffering.
[time=798] And so we live in a broken world, so creation suffering. Number two, consequential suffering.
[time=802] This is the sowing and reaping principle that you reap what you sow.
[time=805] How many of you made a bad decision this week?
[time=807] How many of you have you had consequences because of that bad decision this week?
[time=810] You reaped what you sowed, and sometimes we bring suffering on ourselves with our crazy dumb decisions.
[time=818] I'm glad that I'm not alone in doing that, consequential suffering.
[time=822] Corrective suffering is the type of suffering where God allows suffering and uses it to redeem it as a faithful father to correct us.
[time=832] You have revered off a path, and it was in a time of suffering.
[time=835] It was in a time of pain that God got your attention and helped you get back on the course.
[time=839] Corrective suffering, you see this throughout scripture.
[time=842] Write this down, collective suffering.
[time=845] Collective, this is practically speaking what we felt on 9/11.
[time=849] As a nation we hurt, didn't we?
[time=851] We felt that together, and throughout scripture the nation of Israel had times of mourning.
[time=856] You think of the Israelites in Egypt, they mourned, and they hurt together.
[time=861] It was a collective suffering as they were in bondage in Egypt, and so you see that throughout scripture.
[time=867] Compassionate suffering.
[time=869] Some of you have a great gift of empathy, and you feel what others feel.
[time=873] And in scripture we're commanded to weep with those who weep.
[time=876] We are commanded to bear one another's burdens.
[time=880] And I felt this kind of suffering this week preparing for this message, knowing how many of you are suffering.
[time=886] I feel so unqualified to tell you how to suffer.
[time=888] Be honest with you.
[time=890] But God's word has such a powerful truth, and it's full of so many promises I'm honored to be able to be a vessel of God to point you to that.
[time=897] So compassionately I suffer and I hurt with you. Compassionate suffering.
[time=901] Spiritual warfare suffering.
[time=902] This is because we have a real enemy who seeks to steal, to kill, and to devour every single ounce of the work of God in your life.
[time=909] He wants to kill you, he wants to destroy you, and he wants you to be in hell and eternal damnation with him forever, and he'll do nothing.
[time=916] He will hold nothing back to stop that from happening.
[time=920] He will make sure he does every single ounce that he can to tear you and your family and our church apart.
[time=927] And spiritual warfare brings about suffering.
[time=929] Some of you are in the middle of that.
[time=931] Number seven, gospel opportunity suffering, I'll call it.
[time=934] This is where in our suffering we have opportunities, and sometimes it's maybe persecution that you face because you accepted Christ, and you talk about Jesus in the workplace, and people give you a hard time about that.
[time=945] Things like that where you have the opportunity and you're suffering.
[time=948] People want to harm you because of your faith in Christ, but it's an opportunity for testimony.
[time=952] It's an opportunity for a witness.
[time=954] It's an opportunity to be light in dark places.
[time=957] You see that Paul is in the middle of that right now.
[time=959] Where's he riding from again?
[time=960] Prison.
[time=961] He's riding from prison.
[time=962] So he is kind of an authority on suffering.
[time=965] He was going through almost all of these.
[time=967] You can do that, by the way.
[time=968] Many of them simultaneously.
[time=970] Gospel opportunity suffering.
[time=971] Providential suffering.
[time=975] This is where God is doing something way bigger than your situation.
[time=979] But in your situation you may be going through some things, maybe even like a Joseph in scripture where you didn't do anything wrong and you're kind of a victim.
[time=986] You did nothing wrong, but wrong is being done to you.
[time=988] Joseph ends up in a pit and in a prison, but he was intended by God in his providence to become the prime minister of a nation.
[time=996] No one saw that coming, and God was doing something way bigger even through the suffering that didn't make sense that anybody could see.
[time=1003] And I would argue that applies to absolutely every type of suffering we go through.
[time=1006] We see that in scripture.
[time=1008] Two more mysterious suffering.
[time=1009] This is where you just don't know.
[time=1011] Deuteronomy 29-29 says the secret things belong to the Lord, but the things revealed belong to us and our sons forever.
[time=1017] It means God has shown us what we need to know, but there will be secret things, and we just don't know.
[time=1022] There's times as a pastor I'm sitting with people and it just makes no sense.
[time=1025] Why would God let this happen?
[time=1027] And I used to try to fill in those blanks with answers until one day I realized I'm not the answer and I don't have the answers, but I know the answer.
[time=1034] And so here's how I started handling those situations.
[time=1037] When I don't know, I'll say, I don't know what God's doing.
[time=1040] Why is God allowing this to happen to me, Pastor?
[time=1043] I don't know.
[time=1045] But I'll tell you what I do know.
[time=1047] I do know that he's good.
[time=1049] I do know that he's trustworthy.
[time=1052] I do know that Romans 8 and 28 is true.
[time=1055] This says all things work together for the good of those who love him and are called according to his purpose.
[time=1062] God has a purpose.
[time=1063] I do know you can trust him, but there are mysterious elements to sometimes what we go through in this life.
[time=1069] I mean, if you're going through situations right now that I just wish could go away, and I don't know what God's doing, but I know he's got a plan.
[time=1075] And sometimes it fills mysterious.
[time=1076] Last but not least is I'll call it end time suffering.
[time=1079] End time suffering.
[time=1080] Did you know Jesus is coming again?
[time=1082] We're looking at a list of 10 types of suffering.
[time=1085] We need to know this one.
[time=1086] So don't miss this.
[time=1087] Jesus is coming back.
[time=1089] And when he does, suffering is no more.
[time=1092] Every tear is going to be wiped away.
[time=1094] And all of the pain that you're going through, he took it on the cross so that that moment when he comes again, suffering is totally defeated.
[time=1103] It's cast into the lake of fire, and it is no more and will be with him forever.
[time=1109] I don't know when he's coming, but I know he's coming.
[time=1112] And I know that is setting up right now for it to happen.
[time=1115] Is it going to be soon, Pastor?
[time=1116] I sure hope so.
[time=1117] Come Lord Jesus, come.
[time=1119] But until then we're called to suffer for the glory of God.
[time=1123] And that's what Paul is teaching us.
[time=1125] And the season, we know that Scripture teaches us the season before the coming of Jesus, the second coming of Jesus.
[time=1131] When he begins that process to make everything right and to fix everything, we know that it's going to be marked by increased war.
[time=1138] We know it's going to be marked by violence and evil, spiritual warfare, global conflict.
[time=1143] Have you noticed some of those things are going on around us these days?
[time=1146] So I say to us, Church, as we suffer, let's get ready for Jesus because he's coming back.
[time=1151] There's in time suffering.
[time=1153] But here's what I know.
[time=1154] There's 10.
[time=1155] You may say there's 40, Pastor.
[time=1157] You could break all these into 20 categories.
[time=1159] You can call it what you want.
[time=1160] I just want to give you a picture.
[time=1161] Paul's going through many of these at once.
[time=1163] Maybe you are too.
[time=1164] But here's what I've learned about suffering is that suffering is very complicated, isn't it?
[time=1169] Suffering is very complex.
[time=1171] It's hard to understand.
[time=1173] It's hard to get our arms around it.
[time=1174] How could a good God allow bad things?
[time=1177] There's so many questions that surround our suffering.
[time=1180] But Paul is experiencing multiple of these at the same time, but here's what he's choosing to do.
[time=1184] He's choosing to view his suffering as an opportunity to look like Jesus, to grow in his walk with Jesus, to help others grow in their walk with Jesus.
[time=1193] Paul is choosing to be vulnerable about his suffering so that his suffering can impact other people, which is number two.
[time=1200] So view your suffering as an opportunity for growth.
[time=1202] Number two is this.
[time=1204] Steward means to manage something that's not yours, to manage something.
[time=1208] Steward, you're suffering for Jesus and others.
[time=1213] We get this from verses 25 through 27 where Paul talks of how he stewards his suffering.
[time=1219] And it's not what you might think, it's not like, man, you guys should see how terrible I've got it, man.
[time=1224] It's just awful.
[time=1225] What does Paul do?
[time=1226] Let's read it together.
[time=1227] Verse 25 picking up right where we left off.
[time=1228] He just talked about suffering for the sake of the church.
[time=1231] And then in verse 25 he says, "Of which I became a minister according to the stewardship from God that was given to me for you."
[time=1241] Notice the for you to make the word of God fully known.
[time=1244] The mystery that he calls the gospel of mystery three times in this passage, but he answers what the mystery is several times as well, so don't miss it.
[time=1251] The mystery hidden for all ages and generations, but now revealed to his saints.
[time=1256] We've looked at our identity as saints.
[time=1258] We're sinners by nature and choice, but saints by identity, by the glory of God.
[time=1262] Verse 27 to them, "God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory that is of this mystery."
[time=1273] Which is, don't miss it.
[time=1274] Here's the answer.
[time=1275] Which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[time=1279] We're going to unpack the hope of glory even more in chapter 3.
[time=1282] It's a theme that Paul uses.
[time=1284] We'll look at it some today.
[time=1285] But as we look at this, steward your suffering for Jesus and others.
[time=1288] Verse 24, what did Paul say to do with suffering again?
[time=1291] He said to rejoice in suffering.
[time=1294] That takes joy.
[time=1295] J.O.Y.
[time=1296] The best acronym I've ever seen for joy is Jesus others yourself.
[time=1300] Jesus others yourself.
[time=1302] Paul is saying, I'm stewarding.
[time=1304] I'm managing.
[time=1305] I'm viewing.
[time=1306] I'm leveraging my suffering for the glory of God in Christ Jesus and for other people.
[time=1313] Joy.
[time=1314] You want to have joy in your suffering?
[time=1315] Put Jesus first.
[time=1316] Put others next and then put yourself last.
[time=1318] But if you're like me in our selfish world where we're so selflessly wired, when we suffer, I tend to think about what's best for me.
[time=1326] How can I get out of this?
[time=1328] How can I make this better?
[time=1330] How can I maybe promote myself or get sympathy?
[time=1333] That's kind of where we typically go.
[time=1335] So with your grace, I want to ask you to give me some grace to talk to you a little bit about two different mentalities in suffering.
[time=1341] If you're going to steward your suffering.
[time=1343] It's a victim mentality and we live in a victim mentality world.
[time=1347] It's just so rampant.
[time=1348] It's rampant in the church with a victim mentality or a steward mentality.
[time=1352] I want to compare in contrast the two.
[time=1354] Paul obviously advocates for a steward mentality even in your suffering.
[time=1358] And this is hard to preach to people who I know who are hurting in so many ways.
[time=1362] So listen with all grace.
[time=1363] Hear how Paul lived this out and by God's power in his grace, he'll help you live it out too.
[time=1369] And so victim mentality.
[time=1370] Listen, that starts with this statement.
[time=1372] I need you to know today that you're suffering and your pain is not your identity.
[time=1380] Your suffering and your pain is not your eternity.
[time=1384] Jesus is coming back.
[time=1386] He's not who you are, saint.
[time=1388] Doesn't define you.
[time=1389] You're suffering.
[time=1390] Listen, it does not define your identity.
[time=1392] Your identity though defines how you respond to your suffering.
[time=1397] God's purpose.
[time=1399] And God, look at me.
[time=1401] God has a purpose for what you're facing.
[time=1403] You say, well, tell me what it is.
[time=1405] I may not be able to.
[time=1406] But I trust the one who's in charge of it all.
[time=1409] I know that he's good.
[time=1411] I know that he's trustworthy.
[time=1412] And God's purpose means, listen, that your pain is never wasted.
[time=1418] God never wastes pain in his purposes.
[time=1422] And I came to share that with you today.
[time=1424] You can write it down this way that circumstances don't define who you are.
[time=1428] But they provide a platform for who you are to shine.
[time=1432] Your identity is not what you're going through.
[time=1435] But what you're going through lets your identity show the world who Jesus is and who he has made
[time=1441] for you to be.
[time=1443] It's tough to live out, isn't it?
[time=1445] Rolls off the tongue, makes sense.
[time=1447] But wow, it's hard to live when we're going through suffering.
[time=1449] And a victim in town, he makes life about me.
[time=1451] But Paul, in his suffering, I'll give you a few things he made his suffering about.
[time=1454] Verses 25 through 27 that we read.
[time=1456] Verses 25, he made it about making the Word of God fully known.
[time=1460] That was the first thing he talks about.
[time=1461] Verses 25, Verses 26, he makes it about ministry.
[time=1464] He makes it about the gospel, which he calls a mystery that's now made known in Christ.
[time=1469] He talks about who's at four, saints, Verses 26, to the saints.
[time=1473] This is who it's intended towards our identity in Christ.
[time=1475] And he's suffering for them.
[time=1477] As we saw already in Verses 24, we'll see it over and over again.
[time=1480] Verses 27 is God's glory.
[time=1482] It's other people.
[time=1483] He says that it would happen among the Gentiles.
[time=1485] He's the missionary to the Gentiles, to people who previously weren't considered to be a part of the faith that God can give, the faith community that God had created.
[time=1494] But Jesus came and changed all of that.
[time=1496] And Paul says that's what I'm suffering for.
[time=1498] I'm suffering for the hope of glory, which is Christ in you.
[time=1504] Three times Paul talks about mystery.
[time=1506] Verses 26, Verses 27, Verses 2 of chapter 2.
[time=1509] But listen, don't miss this.
[time=1510] Some eight times in this passage.
[time=1513] Paul talks about Christ in us that is empowering us in various forms.
[time=1519] Some eight times.
[time=1521] And some three more times he talks about God as God the Father as the one who gives.
[time=1525] That strength.
[time=1526] That gives.
[time=1527] All right.
[time=1528] So over ten times in just this passage, Paul is realizing that as he stewards his suffering for Jesus and for others, it's not about him.
[time=1536] It's about Jesus who empowers him.
[time=1539] And it's about impacting other people.
[time=1542] That's what Paul is teaching us as we look at this.
[time=1544] You could write it down this way.
[time=1545] Victim mentality uses suffering for at least a few different things.
[time=1548] A victim mentality in suffering really uses suffering for self-promotion or sympathy.
[time=1554] And we tend to do that, if for honest.
[time=1557] And we tend to whine and we tend to complain.
[time=1561] And again, I have no right to stand up here and say I wouldn't do the same thing if I was suffering in the way that you are.
[time=1567] But that's what victim mentality does.
[time=1569] But that's not the mentality that Paul is putting forth here.
[time=1572] Victim mentality uses suffering for self-promotion and sympathy.
[time=1575] But steward mentality, here's the contrast, uses suffering for selfless service.
[time=1580] For selfless service that glorifies Jesus and impacts other people as a ministry.
[time=1587] This is what Paul describes as stewarding his suffering for Jesus and others.
[time=1593] Then it's yourself.
[time=1594] That's where you can find joy even in the midst of your suffering.
[time=1598] And that leads to what will happen in number three.
[time=1601] So it's to view your suffering as an opportunity for growth, steward it for Jesus and others.
[time=1605] But to turn your suffering into your ministry.
[time=1608] And we see that in verses 28 and 29.
[time=1610] And at that we're going to be at the end of chapter one.
[time=1613] Can you believe it?
[time=1614] Look at your neighbor say you made it.
[time=1616] You made it.
[time=1617] But there's chapter two and three and four and we're going to keep going.
[time=1619] I can't wait.
[time=1620] But let's read those verses because Paul talks about his ministry and how he's turned his suffering now into a ministry because he's stewarding for Jesus and others.
[time=1627] Verse 28, Paul says, "Him Jesus, Him we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone
[time=1634] with all wisdom that we may present everyone mature in Christ."
[time=1640] Sounds like maturity, university to me.
[time=1643] This is his ministry, verse 29.
[time=1645] For this, this is probably my favorite verse we're going to look at today.
[time=1649] I say that every week.
[time=1650] They're all great.
[time=1651] But wow, don't miss verse 29.
[time=1653] For this, I toil, struggling with all of my might.
[time=1659] That's what we would say typically, right?
[time=1662] Is that's not what the, is it your Bible say that?
[time=1664] Oh, it's on here too, yeah.
[time=1666] So what does Paul say?
[time=1669] Struggling with all his energy that he powerfully works within me.
[time=1677] Oh my gosh, this is so powerful and it's going to help you so much to turn your misery
[time=1683] into your ministry because your greatest ministry will often come from your greatest misery.
[time=1690] A couple of key reminders of Paul, we're talking about his ministry and stewarding his ministry.
[time=1694] First of all, if you are a follower of Jesus, I got a really important message for you.
[time=1699] And Paul shares this over and over throughout all of his writings of the body of Christ.
[time=1703] If you're a follower of Jesus, if you claim to be a disciple of Jesus, you are in full-time
[time=1709] ministry.
[time=1711] You are a part of the team sport that church is.
[time=1714] You are a part of the body of Christ.
[time=1716] It's not the elders and the pastors and the senior pastor.
[time=1719] Hey, we're a part of it too, but we're just that.
[time=1721] We're a part of that.
[time=1722] We are the body of Christ.
[time=1724] You are in full-time ministry and God has a plan to use you.
[time=1730] So stop believing the lie that you're inadequate.
[time=1733] Stop believing the lie that you're not good enough to be on a stage with a microphone.
[time=1737] Listen, the biggest sermons that ever get preached do not happen with a microphone with lights on you.
[time=1742] The biggest sermons that ever get preached are people who live out full-time ministry in times of suffering.
[time=1748] When maybe nobody else is looking, but God sees and people look in and they see full-time ministry at work through your suffering.
[time=1755] Those are the loudest sermons, so you, my friend, are in full-time ministry.
[time=1760] Second thing that we see about that ministry from Paul is that it is Christ's energy that compels that ministry.
[time=1767] It's Christ's power that gives you the ability to be in ministry.
[time=1771] Every believer's ministry is driven by the power of Jesus, not by the power of you or me.
[time=1777] That should be relieving.
[time=1779] You thought it was about you.
[time=1780] It's not.
[time=1781] Your ministry comes from Jesus.
[time=1783] So write it down this way, and this is true of Paul, that your greatest pain can unlock your greatest purpose.
[time=1789] I do believe that.
[time=1791] Your greatest ministry can come through your greatest misery thing that hurts the most.
[time=1795] So again, remind me, where is Paul writing from again?
[time=1798] He's in prison.
[time=1799] House arrest, Rome, he's a waiting trial.
[time=1801] All these things are going on.
[time=1802] He's in all kinds of suffering of those 10.
[time=1804] I don't know how many he's got.
[time=1805] He's got a pretty big list of them.
[time=1807] But Paul is suffering.
[time=1809] He's writing from prison.
[time=1810] And look, the Bible that we hold in our hands, he wrote most of your New Testament.
[time=1814] You know that?
[time=1815] And a lot of it he wrote from prison.
[time=1818] His greatest pain became the greatest purpose that God would ever bring about through his life.
[time=1824] This persecutor of Jesus, this persecutor of Christians, this chief among sinners.
[time=1829] And his greatest pain and his greatest suffering, we now read about it every single day.
[time=1834] We hold it in our hand as a word from the living God.
[time=1838] Don't believe the lies of the enemy who say your pain is wasted.
[time=1842] And God just doesn't care about you.
[time=1845] God wants to do the greatest ministry and accomplish his greatest purposes through even your greatest pain.
[time=1850] And proclaiming Jesus is what leads to spiritual maturity versus 28 and 29 as we just read.
[time=1855] We see that is to present everyone.
[time=1857] This is his ministry.
[time=1858] Present everyone in airshot of his ministry as someone who is mature in Christ.
[time=1863] And don't miss verse 29.
[time=1865] It is his energy that he is giving and working and empowering within Paul that makes it possible.
[time=1872] And the same is true of you.
[time=1875] How many of you have done self-help Christianity before?
[time=1879] Self-effort fate before.
[time=1882] How many of you made it three steps before you feel flat on your face and realize that I can't get far
[time=1888] except from a power that is working within me that is way bigger than me, right?
[time=1893] That is what Paul is talking about.
[time=1895] And if you want your misery to become ministry, if you want to turn your struggle into a ministry
[time=1901] as Paul did, and we read about in his letters just like this one to the church at Colossae, then you've got to realize that you cannot.
[time=1908] It's not self-help, it's Christ-help that you need.
[time=1912] You can't do it on your own, and while that sounds so discouraging, it's so freeing.
[time=1918] Because if I can't do it, either I'm just dead, and guess what?
[time=1922] We are apart from Jesus.
[time=1924] But God sent forth his Son so that while we were dead and our trespasses and sins,
[time=1930] we're made alive with him through Christ.
[time=1933] It's his energy that makes it possible not just for you to survive your struggle, but to thrive and to use it for ministry, for the glory and for the kingdom of Jesus.
[time=1944] God's not done with you.
[time=1946] Stop believing the lies that you just got to wallow in the victim mentality and look for how God wants to use even the worst of your life to do the most for his kingdom.
[time=1956] People are watching you, so glorify God in how you go through this time of pain.
[time=1962] God loves you, and I say that with so much love.
[time=1965] It's hard truth to live out, easy to preach, and it's like, man, amen.
[time=1969] But Monday happens, and the pain comes back.
[time=1972] Some of you are grieving right now.
[time=1974] Some of you are going through so many struggles right now, but God's energy is what's going to carry you.
[time=1979] Paul says it's Christ in him that he's leaning on.
[time=1982] Paul reminds us, listen, that true maturity is not based on self-effort, but on Christ's energy.
[time=1989] You want to go beyond a fanny pack faith, you've got to have Christ's energy.
[time=1992] Self-effort is only going to get you so far, and we found probably by now that that's not very far.
[time=1997] And when you do, your focus will be on Jesus, which is the last point I'll make today.
[time=2001] Number four is focus on Jesus and your suffering.
[time=2004] Chapter two, hey, you made it to chapter two.
[time=2007] We got there.
[time=2008] We've completed chapter one, but I want to start chapter two because Paul continues talking about his suffering.
[time=2013] Look at verses one through five, and through that I'm going to give us a few ways, practically speaking, that you can focus on Jesus this week, no matter what your suffering is.
[time=2020] We got to verses one through five. Paul says, I want you to know how great a struggle there it is again.
[time=2025] I have for you, notice who it's for again, and for those at Laodicea, and for all who have seen me,
[time=2031] who have not seen me face to face. Remember, he's not seen or met many of these people, but he's heard of their struggles and their maturity and the things that God's doing in their lives.
[time=2040] Verse two, that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love to reach all the riches
[time=2048] of the full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of God's mystery, which is Christ,
[time=2055] in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
[time=2059] I say this in order that no one may delude you with plausible arguments.
[time=2064] In Paul's time, just like today's time, if you remember, there were these people that were trying to say Jesus isn't the things that Jesus is, that Jesus isn't who he says he was.
[time=2072] He's prominent, but he's not preeminent.
[time=2074] The same thing is true for us today, and they have these plausible arguments, things to cause us to veer off course.
[time=2078] Verse five, "For though I am absent in body, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing."
[time=2084] There it is again, joy in midst of suffering.
[time=2088] To see your good order, some versions will say you're disciplined.
[time=2091] I like that, you're disciplined.
[time=2093] And the firmness of your faith in Christ.
[time=2097] Verse one, Paul saying to us, "I want you to know the why behind my struggle.
[time=2102] I want you to know the why behind my joy." And then he gives us a few things to consider, and I've just packaged it as three things we need to consider if we want to focus and fix our eyes on Jesus in the midst of suffering.
[time=2112] Write these down.
[time=2113] Number one, consider content.
[time=2115] The beginning of verse two, Paul says, "I'm just praying that your hearts could be encouraged, that their hearts could be encouraged." And so I ask you today, what intake?
[time=2126] What are you consuming to encourage your heart and to keep your heart encouraged?
[time=2133] Or maybe what is it that you're consuming?
[time=2135] What intake?
[time=2136] What are you listening to?
[time=2137] What are you watching?
[time=2138] What are you reading that is causing your heart to be discouraged?
[time=2143] Maybe you've been scrolling too much and not taking in the word of God enough.
[time=2150] Maybe you've been listening to what somebody has been saying about you too much and not reading and praying and talking to the creative, the universe who sees you as holy and blameless and above reproach.
[time=2161] Remember that from last week?
[time=2163] Maybe, just maybe.
[time=2165] Your intake is causing your output to not look quite like a spiritually mature person right now.
[time=2172] And I think those two absolutely go together.
[time=2175] Paul talks with this, and that's why he's writing this.
[time=2177] He's saying that your hearts would be encouraged, and he's already talked about his teaching and warning everyone and teaching them with all wisdom and all understanding and all knowledge.
[time=2184] All go together.
[time=2185] And then in verse 4, he says, "Why am I doing this so that you won't be pulled aside by these plausible arguments, so that you won't be deluded, so that you won't be distracted." So consider your intake today.
[time=2196] What are you taking in?
[time=2197] And I challenge you to find ways you version.
[time=2199] It's the Bible app.
[time=2200] If you didn't know about that, it's a great app.
[time=2202] It's free.
[time=2203] You can download it.
[time=2204] They've got reading plans.
[time=2205] They'll take you through the Bible.
[time=2206] All throughout the year, you can read through the Bible in the year.
[time=2208] You can do a two-week devotional of three or four or five or fifteen-week devotional.
[time=2212] You can do it with friends.
[time=2213] We have more tools and more studies available to us than ever before.
[time=2218] So ask you, what's your intake like?
[time=2221] Because your intake, your input will determine your output.
[time=2224] And if the output doesn't quite look like much more than a fanny pack faith, then maybe your content has something to do with it.
[time=2233] Paul teaches us that, and then he goes further.
[time=2235] And so consider your sermons.
[time=2237] And by the way, when it comes to content, look at me for a minute.
[time=2240] You're standing on me to feed you every Sunday.
[time=2244] And it to be enough to carry you throughout the week, you are sadly mistaken.
[time=2248] Because fanny pack faith says, "Well, I can just get all I need on Sunday, and it fills me up for the week, and I'm good to go." But true spiritual maturity says, "I need the Word of God.
[time=2258] I need the person of God.
[time=2259] I need to know Jesus at a deep level every single day of the week." No matter what's going on, I'm going to make sure I feed myself.
[time=2267] I'm going to make sure I plug into the Word of God.
[time=2269] I'm going to make sure I spend time with my Creator.
[time=2272] So consider your books you're reading.
[time=2274] Consider what you're watching on a screen.
[time=2275] The podcast that you're listening to.
[time=2277] The question is, what voices are you allowing to have a voice in your life when it comes
[time=2283] to the content of life?
[time=2284] We're going to pour out the Word of God.
[time=2286] I pray it's a great start.
[time=2287] It lights a fire in you.
[time=2288] But that fire has got to get kept burning by you throughout the week.
[time=2291] So consider content.
[time=2292] Number two, and at the end of verse two, Paul reminds us, "Consider community." He says that your hearts may be knit together in love.
[time=2300] This is relationships.
[time=2302] This is life groups.
[time=2303] This is community that God says, "Listen, the content is great.
[time=2306] The content is important." Number one, consider content.
[time=2309] Number two, consider community.
[time=2311] Why?
[time=2312] Because content alone is not enough.
[time=2315] Just knowing the Word of God does not mean that you're going to be able to know the God of the Word.
[time=2320] Just knowing stuff at a head level does not mean you're allowing God to transform you at the heart level so that at the hands level you're living it out.
[time=2328] The way that happens is that we go deeper.
[time=2331] You want more depth?
[time=2332] It's not just content.
[time=2333] It's community.
[time=2334] I'm listening to this content.
[time=2337] I'm taking in this content, but who's holding me accountable with that content?
[time=2341] Who's walking that path with me?
[time=2344] Who is processing what we're hearing and what we're receiving and what our input looks like?
[time=2349] Who is doing that with me?
[time=2350] We say at Black Hawk often that we believe in circles.
[time=2353] These are our life groups.
[time=2354] Small groups of people, they meet, I think we've got them seven days a week right now.
[time=2357] We're constantly looking to add more.
[time=2359] We've got a class right now with new life group leaders because the demand for them is even greater than the groups we have.
[time=2364] That's a decent problem to have, but we're going to solve that puppy because we've got to have a place for everybody to have community.
[time=2369] Why?
[time=2370] We believe in circles because a row can't know.
[time=2373] Look at your row.
[time=2374] Tell them, say, "You don't know me." You can say it.
[time=2377] No, seriously, say it.
[time=2378] Tell them, "You don't know me.
[time=2380] You don't know me." A row can't know what you're going through.
[time=2383] You may sit by those people every single week, but unless you're in community in a circle with them during the week, you're not doing what Jesus instituted.
[time=2391] Jesus taught the disciples things, but he did life with the disciples.
[time=2395] Jesus, this was Jesus' idea, by the way.
[time=2396] It wasn't Paul's and it wasn't Black Hawks.
[time=2398] Jesus started the first small groups.
[time=2400] We believe in them and we want to help you get in them because we've got to consider community.
[time=2404] You were created for community.
[time=2406] You need each other.
[time=2407] Now look at that neighbor that you didn't want to say that main thing to a minute ago and say, "You need me." And tell them, "I need you, and I need you." Consider community.
[time=2415] And last but not least, consider Christ.
[time=2417] Consider Christ.
[time=2419] In verse three, Paul says, "All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are in Christ." Hear me when I say to you, my friends, that knowing Jesus and making Jesus known is the essence of the Christian faith.
[time=2431] Knowing Jesus and making Jesus known is the heart of spiritual maturity.
[time=2437] In verse five, Paul's delight was in how disciplined they were in these areas.
[time=2442] Paul's delight was in how they had such a firm faith that stood in the test of time and of struggles and of problems.
[time=2452] As we view our circumstances differently, as we view our struggle as an opportunity to grow and to look like Jesus,
[time=2459] to identify with Him in His suffering, then we're going to be able to steward our suffering for Jesus first and then for others.
[time=2464] And then ourself is last, then we're going to have joy in that time.
[time=2468] And when we have that stewardship happening, then our suffering all of a sudden starts to look more and more like a ministry
[time=2474] that you never even dreamed that you could possibly have.
[time=2477] And at all it's possible because we consider Christ.
[time=2480] It's always possible because we fix our eyes, focusing on Him, the middle for suffering.
[time=2485] I want to ask you to just bow your heads and close your eyes today.
[time=2488] This is how we make the most of the worst times.
[time=2492] In the maturity university today, I pray that as believers, God has identified for you an area that you need to steward better in your suffering.
[time=2500] What area, here's what I ask you, what area of suffering has God asked you to steward better, to steward differently this week?
[time=2509] Just start with one thing and whose power is it again that's going to empower you?
[time=2514] It's Christ's energy.
[time=2515] It's Christ in you that's the hope of glory.
[time=2517] It's Christ in you that's the hope that you need to cling to in this suffering.
[time=2520] So ask God to show you how you can walk differently in the midst of your suffering.
[time=2524] God's going to show you.
[time=2525] But some of you are here as believers are praying and you would say, "Gosh, my heart is churning.
[time=2528] The Holy Spirit is just convicting.
[time=2530] It's prompting me.
[time=2531] I don't even know what He's doing right now.
[time=2532] But as I've heard the gospel, I've realized that I'm such a sinner and I fall short of the glory of God.
[time=2537] And I've been trusting in works.
[time=2538] I've been trusting in me.
[time=2539] I've been trusting in someone else's faith.
[time=2541] I've been trusting in anything other than Jesus to save me.
[time=2544] But the gospel, my friend, is simply this.
[time=2546] If that is you, the gospel is that, yes, you are a sinner.
[time=2548] Your righteousness is as filthy rags.
[time=2550] You can never meet the requirements, the holy standards of God.
[time=2554] That's why Jesus came.
[time=2556] He met those standards.
[time=2557] He lived the sinless life you couldn't live.
[time=2559] And He took your place on the cross.
[time=2561] He died for your sins.
[time=2564] But He didn't stop there.
[time=2566] He rose from the dead.
[time=2567] He defeated death.
[time=2568] He defeated your sin.
[time=2569] He defeated hell.
[time=2570] He defeated the grave so that you could have eternal life.
[time=2572] Not just in eternity, but starting right now in the earthly.
[time=2575] Jesus has won that victory.
[time=2577] And salvation comes simply from the fact.
[time=2580] Listen, that anyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
[time=2583] Anyone who confesses with their mouth that Jesus is the Lord, believing that God has raised Him from the dead.
[time=2588] That Jesus is who He says He is.
[time=2590] Will be saved.
[time=2591] We ask Him to forgive you today.
[time=2594] And the Word of God, God Himself promises He will meet you where you are.
[time=2599] And eternity will be changed forever.
[time=2602] So I want to give you a second to do that.
[time=2605] I'm not going to lead you in a prayer because a prayer doesn't save you.
[time=2607] Prayer is just the mode we express, a heart condition to the Lord.
[time=2610] So do that to Him right now and He'll meet you where you are.
