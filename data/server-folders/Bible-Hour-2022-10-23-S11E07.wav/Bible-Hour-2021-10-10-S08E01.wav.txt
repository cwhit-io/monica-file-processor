[time=0] are here to exalt none other than Jesus Christ in this place.
[time=4] And may it be so of us for decades to come.
[time=6] [AMEN] I am so glad to be a part of today.
[time=9] I can't think of a more special person to be sharing with you.
[time=13] I'm not preaching today.
[time=15] I get to sit and be preached to today by my dear friend, Pastor Yimod, all the way from Egypt.
[time=20] Can you welcome my friend, Pastor Yimod?
[time=22] Yes.
[time=23] [APPLAUSE]
[time=26] So Pastor, I can't think of anyone.
[time=28] I'd rather have standing here than my brother and my friend.
[time=30] We welcome you.
[time=31] And Pastor Yimod, if you don't know him, many of you have seen him many times already.
[time=35] But he's a dear friend.
[time=36] He is an amazing preacher of God's Word.
[time=39] He is an excellent leader for the kingdom of God at the church there in Sohag.
[time=44] And so to all of our brothers and sisters that I'm sure are watching us today from Egypt, we are so glad to call you family.
[time=50] And what a testimony of the kingdom of God we get to be a part of today, right?
[time=55] To all around the world be joining together for the glory of God and the gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ.
[time=61] And so today, Pastor Yimod, you preach with freedom.
[time=63] You preach with boldness what God has laid on your heart.
[time=65] And so Blackhawk, may we open our arms, open our hands, open our ears, and open our hearts because God has a very special word for you today from my friend.
[time=74] Can we give Pastor Yimod a warm Blackhawk welcome as well as Joseph, my brother, over here?
[time=78] Yes.
[time=79] [APPLAUSE]
[time=82] And my brother Joseph here is our translator.
[time=84] We all know him.
[time=85] He's part of the Blackhawk family.
[time=86] But we love you, Joseph.
[time=87] He's going to make it where you can.
[time=89] If you've never heard an Arabic sermon, raise your hand if you have.
[time=92] If you have us have.
[time=93] In Egypt, yeah, well, you're going to today, but Joseph's going to make it where you can understand and follow along.
[time=97] We love you guys.
[time=98] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[time=105] I'm very glad and happy to be here today.
[time=109] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] I want to just point three things before we start.
[time=116] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[time=124] I carry the greetings from Suhagg, leaders, and congregation, all the ministers and to you.
[time=131] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[time=138] We thank the Lord for our partnership between Suhagg, church, and Blackhawk.
[time=145] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] We thank God for the body of Christ.
[time=152] That's all around the world.
[time=154] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[time=160] It will be a time where we all stand together before God.
[time=164] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] From every nation, every tongue, and from everywhere.
[time=171] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Through Jesus' blood, and we have been saved.
[time=179] Hallelujah.
[time=181] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] One more thing I want to share.
[time=185] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[time=191] We thank God for Kevin's ministry here and his leadership.
[time=195] It's been five years here in Blackhawk.
[time=197] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] He is a leader, has a vision for the kingdom and for his life.
[time=208] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Last but not least, I want to say happy birthday to Jessica.
[time=215] OK.
[time=218] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] If we stand to read God's word from Hebrew 11-- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] 8, verse 8 to 10.
[time=231] OK.
[time=233] And he went out, not knowing where he has going.
[time=237] By face, he went to live in the land of promise as in foreign land.
[time=243] Living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise for the look-- for he was looking forward to the city that has foundations whose designer and builder is God.
[time=257] [AMEN] You can see it, you can see it, please.
[time=260] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[time=268] Chapter 11 in Hebrew talks about men of faith.
[time=271] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Talked about many men from the Old Testament.
[time=280] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] They lived a good journey of faith was a God.
[time=287] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] So we call them the men of faith.
[time=292] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Men like us and everything.
[time=297] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Lived in many challenges the same as we do, and sometimes harder than our life right now.
[time=306] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Faced many challenges and risks in life.
[time=312] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] But they lived a real journey of faith was God.
[time=318] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[time=324] One of the famous Puritans.
[time=326] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[time=335] He called Hebrew 11 the Gospel of Maritas.
[time=339] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[time=347] Hebrew 11 talk about men that they gave their life as a sacrifice to God in a journey of faith.
[time=353] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] One of them is Abraham.
[time=359] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] We learn a lot of lessons from Abraham's life.
[time=368] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[time=376] The Holy Spirit and the Bible have showed us in many, many, many of faith and that we should learn from their life.
[time=385] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And today's we're talking about lessons from the life of faith.
[time=394] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And that would have two parts in it.
[time=401] The first part or first point is the start of the journey of faith.
[time=406] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[time=415] In Hebrew 11, it says when Abraham was called by faith, he obeyed.
[time=421] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And in Genesis 12-- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[time=434] God have told Abraham to leave your land and your family and go to the where where I show you.
[time=440] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] To start our journey of faith was God.
[time=446] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] There are two things we need to learn.
[time=449] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] The first thing is to leave behind.
[time=456] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] What did Abraham left?
[time=460] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] He left the land where he was born.
[time=466] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] He left his roots.
[time=469] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] His culture.
[time=472] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] His relations?
[time=475] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] His circle of comfort.
[time=479] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And sometimes very painful and hard.
[time=484] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] To go outside your circle of comfort and comfort zone, that's what we use to live in every day.
[time=496] That's hard.
[time=497] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] It's hard to leave behind your roots.
[time=505] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[time=512] The country, city, and the culture are used to.
[time=515] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Sometimes it's risky and painful.
[time=522] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] I remember when God asked me to study theology.
[time=528] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] I was 17.
[time=532] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[time=540] And God have told me to leave your family and you leave your city and travel to study in the school,
[time=549] in Cairo.
[time=550] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And it was painful for me at that time.
[time=555] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] So to live a journey of faith, you need to live.
[time=561] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Abraham left many other things.
[time=567] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] So what did God call you to leave behind today?
[time=573] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] What are the things that you hold on to it?
[time=583] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] But it's in your way to go on the journey of faith was God.
[time=590] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] It could be many things we love.
[time=596] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Could be relations.
[time=602] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Sin.
[time=606] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Some comfort zones and circles that I like to be in.
[time=612] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And God have telling you now that you need to leave it behind.
[time=617] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And what should we do and how should we act when we hear that voice?
[time=627] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] If the Bible is asking us to leave what's in the past
[time=636] and look our fix our eyes on forward on.
[time=640] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[time=646] So it has to start.
[time=647] The journey of faith has to start that we leave behind what we hold on to.
[time=652] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] But the second point also here that we need to accept to obey God and accept the risk.
[time=662] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] God have told Abraham leave to the land I show you.
[time=670] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Abraham didn't know where he's going.
[time=674] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] But God told him leave and go where I show you.
[time=681] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] So our journey of faith has some risk.
[time=689] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Our journey of faith is directly related and connected to our obey in faith.
[time=701] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] God have called the church to accept the risk.
[time=707] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] To get out of their comfort zone.
[time=710] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] To go out to the world.
[time=713] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] To preach the gospel.
[time=716] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Send missionaries.
[time=718] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Church planting.
[time=721] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] But this is our message.
[time=724] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] So God is calling the church to go out of their comfort zone.
[time=731] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[time=737] And God of asking, and he want to break down all the borders that the church built around itself.
[time=742] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] God have asked the disciples to go out to the whole world.
[time=752] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[time=758] And I see that Blackhawk accept some of those risks and they go out to the world.
[time=764] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[time=771] And I know that the church here support many missionaries away from Fort Wayne.
[time=776] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And I know in many countries like Kenya, Uganda, and France, and many other countries like India.
[time=787] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[time=794] So the journey of faith always has some risk.
[time=797] And you go out of your comfort zone to sometimes risky zone.
[time=802] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] The second part of the message?
[time=806] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] How to continue in the journey of faith after it started.
[time=811] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] It's not just to start in the journey of faith.
[time=817] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And it's a dynamic for you need to continue in the journey of faith.
[time=824] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] It's not something you started and it's one step to take.
[time=829] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] It's a dynamic journey that you take with God.
[time=836] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] So in Hebrew 11, God have told us about Abraham that he was a foreigner in a promised land.
[time=848] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] To have a true journey of faith.
[time=853] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Here Abraham has realized two main points.
[time=859] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] So he understood he had a better understanding of life.
[time=866] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] So what's the life for you?
[time=873] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Some say that I need to find a comfort zone.
[time=879] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Sometimes to live a dream that I have a nice family and a house and life.
[time=887] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Some think that, OK, the life is uses and it's just eat and drink.
[time=894] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[time=901] Some would think that it's all about collecting money or making big projects.
[time=905] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Sometimes some people like traveling.
[time=912] They consider it like a big, golden life.
[time=914] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] That can be a part of your life.
[time=919] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] It's not bad to do some of those things.
[time=924] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Oh, but this is not the life that you're under-- shouldn't be your understanding of life.
[time=932] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] So what did the life mean to Abraham?
[time=937] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] So life for Abraham that meant two things.
[time=943] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] He knows he's a stranger and he needs to be a foreigner in this land.
[time=951] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] What does it mean that we're foreigners in here?
[time=956] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Two things.
[time=958] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] My language is different.
[time=961] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] We live in a world.
[time=964] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And our language should be different than the world.
[time=969] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] The language of this world is to curse.
[time=975] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] But our language should be to bless.
[time=981] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] The language of the world to be selfish and they don't mind to hurt us.
[time=987] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] But our language should be prey for the world.
[time=993] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] The second point.
[time=995] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] That my principle and ethics are different than the world.
[time=1000] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] We are we're called as a church to live a different life for the kingdom.
[time=1008] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] So you can read Matthew 5, 6, and 7 to read how God want us to live.
[time=1017] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] How to live as in heaven here on earth.
[time=1025] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] The values for the world is to revenge sometimes.
[time=1033] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Our language should is to forgive.
[time=1039] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] So sometimes the language for the world is to break down.
[time=1044] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] But our language should be to build and grow.
[time=1050] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] The values of the world how to take.
[time=1055] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] But for the church is how to give.
[time=1060] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[time=1067] So we are as foreigners on earth that our language, our ethics, our goal should be completely different in the world.
[time=1073] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Here is the second point.
[time=1077] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] That our life is a journey.
[time=1081] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] The Bible says about Abraham that he lived in tents.
[time=1090] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] What does it mean that Abraham lived in tents?
[time=1094] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Abraham was very rich.
[time=1098] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] He could have built a palace.
[time=1102] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] He had many things.
[time=1105] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] But he lived in a tent.
[time=1109] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And advantage in a tent that he can move from a place to another.
[time=1116] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] He realized that his life is a journey, and he will move from a point A to point B.
[time=1126] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] To continue on our journey with God.
[time=1131] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] We need to have a better understanding for life.
[time=1136] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] We are foreigners.
[time=1139] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And our life is a journey of faith with God.
[time=1145] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] This journey starts with God.
[time=1149] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And it ends also with God and in God.
[time=1154] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] From the start to the end.
[time=1157] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] God is with me through the life.
[time=1162] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Amen well, which it means God was us.
[time=1167] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] We face the challenges.
[time=1170] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] But we realize that God is with us.
[time=1175] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And one application here.
[time=1179] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] In our faith in the journey of faith.
[time=1184] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] God Abraham had a vision for the invisible.
[time=1191] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[time=1197] He has his eyes fixed on that city that God has built and created.
[time=1202] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] He lived on earth.
[time=1205] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] But his eye fixed on heaven.
[time=1208] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] He was walking on earth.
[time=1210] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] But his heart was up there with God.
[time=1213] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] He was waiting for the eternity.
[time=1218] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Oh, he had life with hope.
[time=1224] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] His life with hope generated a desire to live a real journey of faith with God.
[time=1234] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[time=1240] Hope is the engine in which it helps us to go in our faith, if journey of faith was God.
[time=1246] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] That's Abraham's story with his relation with God.
[time=1252] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] So I'll let you write your journey with God right now.
[time=1259] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] What would you write with your life, with your journey of faith with God?
[time=1265] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Do you know that you have a reason, that God has a reason for you to be here in life?
[time=1272] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] We pray that God would lead us and help us to live that journey of faith with him.
[time=1282] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] We live here on Earth, like in Albania, Ma'am.
[time=1286] But our heart is with God.
[time=1288] [AMEN - 1 seconds]
[time=1290] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1298] Before he walks out, can we pray for Pastor Iman, and for our brothers and sisters in Egypt.
[time=1303] And then I want to give a closing challenge, an opportunity to respond to what's been a great challenge.
[time=1307] Thank you, Pastor.
[time=1308] But I want to pray for you, and for your church, and our brothers and sisters in Egypt.
[time=1311] So let's pray together.
[time=1312] If you will, extend a hand just symbolically laying hands on them together as a church body today.
[time=1317] God, we thank you today for this faithful man of God.
[time=1320] We thank you for the body of Christ, the local body of Christ, and so have, and beyond, in the region there in Egypt, that he represents.
[time=1328] And God, I pray your greatest blessings over them.
[time=1331] Thank you for this challenge.
[time=1332] He has issued to us from your word.
[time=1334] Thank you for modern day Abrahams, like Pastor Iman, like Joseph, like my brothers and sisters in Egypt, like their church Lord, where we are called to go beyond our bubbles and our comfort zones to take a step of faith today.
[time=1349] So God, as he has continued to lead by taking steps of faith, I pray that you would continue to guide.
[time=1355] I pray that you would continue to bless.
[time=1357] I pray that you would continue to provide for their church, for his family, and Lord, we are so honored and humbled to be partners in this great ministry that you have given to Pastor Iman and to our brothers and sisters in Egypt and all around the world.
[time=1371] And we pray all this and we thank you for all of this and the powerful, matchless name of Jesus.
[time=1375] And all guys, people said, amen.
[time=1377] God bless you.
[time=1378] Can we thank Pastor Iman one more time for being here and sharing with us today?
[time=1381] God bless you, brother.
[time=1382] (congregation applauding) Church, you've been challenged today.
[time=1386] Can I get an amen?
[time=1388] What a beautiful testimony.
[time=1389] I just want you to pause for just a minute as we begin to close our time together, respond to what God is doing to pause and sit in, to ponder for just a minute, the power of the gospel, the power of the kingdom of God, the unity of the body of Christ.
[time=1406] You just heard a message, maybe for many of you, the first time ever you've listened to a sermon in Arabic, but you see the same heart, don't you?
[time=1415] You see the same word of God, don't you?
[time=1417] You see the same message, don't you?
[time=1419] You see the same vision, don't you?
[time=1420] That is the power of the gospel.
[time=1423] And I want you to know my friends, you're not gonna get that anywhere else in the planet, other than through the power of Jesus Christ, His Holy Word, and I thank God that we're a part of a winning team just like that.
[time=1435] Can I get an amen?
[time=1436] Let's celebrate that and just thank God that he unifies us from all over the world, all over the world.
[time=1444] And hey to my brothers and sisters watching us from all over the world, thank you for sharing your pastor, for those of you in Egypt, we pray that you've had a glorious day, thanks for joining us from way across the seas.
[time=1454] We are one family in Jesus.
[time=1457] And today you've not only been reminded of that, but you've been reminded my brothers and sisters to take a step of faith.
[time=1462] So I wanna ask you a couple of questions.
[time=1464] What risk is God asking you to take?
[time=1467] What Abraham next step in your faith has God prompted inside of you today?
[time=1474] In what way does the hope that we have in Jesus Christ generate this desire to take a step in your journey of faith?
[time=1483] The journey doesn't just start, but it continues.
[time=1485] And some of you needed to be reminded to continue.
[time=1487] So Pastor, you might thank you, my brother, for a wonderful reminder for me and for all of us today.
[time=1492] And it's no coincidence, by the way, I don't believe in those.
[time=1495] When we have a God who sits on the throne, there's no coincidence.
[time=1498] He uses everything for his honor and for his glory that a part of my story and Jessica's story, our family story of coming to Indiana was in fact a few different verses, but a few different people in scripture.
[time=1509] One of them was Abraham.
[time=1511] Go to a land that I will show you, a land that he didn't know about.
[time=1514] And I was reminded of that today because there was Isaiah 43, 18 and 19 where God says, "Behold, I'm gonna do something new.
[time=1522] "Will you not perceive it?" In the Hebrew that word perceive it doesn't mean see it.
[time=1526] It means we do not embrace it.
[time=1528] We do not adopt it.
[time=1529] We do not make it a part of who you are.
[time=1531] He says, "Behold, I'm gonna do something new.
[time=1533] "I'll make way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert." In that same passage, he also talks of forgetting what lies behind.
[time=1541] Philippians three kind of language that's unified in scripture, forgetting that which lies behind and pressing on to the goal, the surprise of the high call of God that is in Christ Jesus.
[time=1550] I remind you of that today and ask you again, what risk has God asked you to take?
[time=1555] I thank God for Abraham's journey as God stirred in us this desire or even this restlessness to get ready to be uncomfortable.
[time=1562] I was reminded of Abraham in that journey and our journey to coming to Fort Wayne.
[time=1566] I was asked in the process, "What do you know about Fort Wayne, Indiana?" I said, "Well, I know it's in Indiana "and I'm guessing it's pretty cold there compared to Georgia.
[time=1577] "That's all I knew.
[time=1578] "I didn't know what God was doing, "but God started a new journey in me.
[time=1581] "I was reminded of that and plastered above my door "in my office here in our facility right now "is what I pray over our church, "what I pray over you and your next step in your journey." And that statement and that mindset is this, the answer is yes, Lord, now what's the question?
[time=1597] The answer is yes, Lord, now what's the question?
[time=1601] That's the journey of faith that Abraham went on.
[time=1603] That's the journey of faith God has called all of us to.
[time=1606] We like to say, "Well, give me the question, Lord, "and I will give you my yes, but let me process the data, "do the research, and pray about it, "and get back to you after a couple of days.
[time=1616] "I want to remind you today that you don't have to pray "about what God has already sent you to do.
[time=1621] "God has called you to take a step of faith." What risk has he called you to?
[time=1625] Pastor, in mind, I thank you for that challenge for all of us today, and I challenge you just to bow your heads for a moment.
[time=1630] And, Ponder, what does it mean for you to take your next step today?
[time=1633] Believers that are in the room, believers that are watching us on a screen from all over the world.
[time=1638] What step of faith has God called you to do?
[time=1640] How can you embody the Abraham mindset in a journey of faith saying, "God, the answer is yes, now what is the question?" My yes is on the table before I even know what it is that you're asking me to do.
[time=1652] What does that look like for you?
[time=1653] What next step has God called you to take?
[time=1655] What risk has God called you to step out on beyond your bubble, beyond your comfort zones?
[time=1660] A big part of our vision here today.
[time=1662] So, believers, as we ponder that today, some of you are here, and a part of my journey was a commitment and a covenant that I made to the Lord at the age of 17, when God called me to preach, and I was scared to death.
[time=1674] And it was a covenant I made with the Lord that every time someone would be crazy enough to give me a microphone, I'd make sure the gospel was clear and I'd give people a chance to respond.
[time=1681] And no doubt, as you've heard today's message, he talked about continuing the journey of faith, but some of you need to go back to the first point and start your journey of faith.
[time=1689] As our heads are bowed, our eyes are closed, believers were praying, what next step, what risk can I take?
[time=1694] Some of you would say, I need to begin that journey of faith today and the Holy Spirit of God is prompting inside of you and understanding of the gospel.
[time=1701] You're realizing that I'm a sinner and I need a savior.
[time=1704] We have all sinned and we all fall short of the glory of God.
[time=1707] This is the good news of the gospel.
[time=1709] But Jesus came, God saw the state that we were in because of our sin, and he did something about it and that something was sending his son, Jesus.
[time=1718] And he lived the sinless life that we could never live.
[time=1720] He who knew no sin became sin so that we could become the righteousness of God.
[time=1728] God sent forth his son, he was a perfect sacrifice when he died on the cross to pay the penalty for our sin that we could never pay for ourselves.
[time=1735] It's a debt that we could never pay, but Jesus paid at all.
[time=1739] And he didn't stop there because he spent three days in a tomb, it was a borrowed tomb because he wasn't staying there.
[time=1744] He rose from the dead and when he did, he defeated death.
[time=1746] He defeated hell, he defeated your sin, he defeated the grave.
[time=1750] And he made it possible for you to be a son and a daughter of the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.
[time=1755] He made it possible for you to be saved.
[time=1759] And so today, some of you need to start your journey of faith by trusting in Jesus.
[time=1762] Maybe you've been trusting in a grandparent's faith or you've been trusting in your works that maybe you're a little bit better than the next person and maybe just maybe they'll let you into heaven.
[time=1770] That's not eternal life.
[time=1772] You can't do anything to get there on your own.
[time=1776] That's the whole point of the gospel.
[time=1778] That's why Jesus came for we are saved by grace through faith, not of works or then we would boast about it.
[time=1784] We can't boast in what Jesus has done, but we can sure boast about Jesus and the fact that he did it for us.
[time=1790] And so today I'm not gonna lead you in a prayer if you're ready to take that step because the Spirit of God is prompting you.
[time=1794] Words don't save you, but your heart being laid down at the foot of the cross, surrendering your life to him, trusting in Jesus and nothing else to save you.
[time=1804] If you can do that in your heart through prayer to God right now, I ask him to forgive you and save you.
[time=1807] He's gonna do that right now.
[time=1808] So right now in the silence at this moment will you take that next step.
