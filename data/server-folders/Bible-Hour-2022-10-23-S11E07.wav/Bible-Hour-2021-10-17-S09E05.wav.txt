[time=0] Good morning, Black Hawk.
[time=3] It is so good to be with you today, blessed assurance.
[time=8] Are you glad you have some blessed assurance in a world where there's not a lot that's guaranteed these days?
[time=14] I'm glad we have some blessed assurance that Jesus is mine, that we are His, and that we can have eternal life in this earthly world that will often drag us down in big ways.
[time=23] I don't know what you drug in with you today, in the room.
[time=26] We're so glad you're here.
[time=27] It's just such a sweet spirit in the building.
[time=30] We're so glad that our family is so big as well spread out all over the world.
[time=33] We had Pastry Mod from Egypt last week, and he's in my home state of Georgia today, preaching
[time=39] there again as well in the United States.
[time=41] We welcome all of you in Egypt and all around the world.
[time=44] We've got a big family that goes way beyond this room, and it's fun to be a part of.
[time=48] Can I get a name of Him?
[time=49] And hey, before we dig in today, I just want to share from my heart with you just a thank you to each of you.
[time=55] If you were with us last week, we had Pastry Mod share from Egypt.
[time=58] It was your first time having an Arabic sermon that you've listened to before such a sweet time that he had with us, but it was also so meaningful to Jessica, to the Rivers family,
[time=69] to me, just the way you honored us.
[time=71] We celebrated five years that I've been privileged to be in the role of being your pastor here last week, and I want you to know, while I would love to respond to every single note and all of the great voicemails that you guys surprise me with, I want you to know that
[time=86] I listen to every single voicemail.
[time=87] I read every single note many times with tears and with a lot of joy.
[time=92] So from my heart to you, from Jessica and I and our family to all of the rest of you guys, our family, thank you guys.
[time=97] We love you so much.
[time=99] We really are just so, so appreciative of being a part of this amazing family.
[time=104] It's a great family, amen?
[time=106] And I'm glad that we get to study how we can grow in that.
[time=108] That's the series we're in.
[time=109] We're in a series called Maturity University.
[time=112] So Maturity University, and today I want to invite you to open your Bibles to Colossians in your New Testament, the Book of Colossians.
[time=119] And each week I've been bringing in a backpack, and the backpack or the bag has represented a lot of different things.
[time=125] It represents, first of all, for us the fact that we've got to strap on our learning.
[time=129] That's why the image that you see, the graphic that you see shows young and old, together in a learning posture with their backpacks on, because we've never arrived and God always has a next step for us.
[time=141] And today, before I open and show you what I have in my bag, I got to address something from the last bag that I used, the Fanny Pack.
[time=148] I mean, if you're here when I had the Fanny Pack, okay, well, I learned a few things following my use of the Fanny Pack.
[time=155] First of all, I had no idea, I learned that I had no idea how many of us use Fanny Packs today.
[time=162] And I also learned how many of us maybe don't want those who do use Fanny Packs today to use those Fanny Packs.
[time=169] And I also learned how many dinner time, lunch time conversations were sparked, and the takeaway
[time=175] from the sermon is don't wear a Fanny Pack or see I should wear a Fanny Pack and there's a Fanny Pack war going on.
[time=182] And so I want to speak into that war for just a minute before I show you what's in my bag today.
[time=187] And here's what I want you to know, Fanny Pack lovers, Jesus loves you.
[time=193] People who don't love Fanny Packs and wish the Fanny Pack lovers would stop wearing theirs.
[time=197] Jesus loves you too.
[time=199] And we're all one in Jesus name, Fanny Pack or no Fanny Pack.
[time=202] Amen?
[time=203] All right, now that we've got that cleared up, you want to see what's in my bag today, today I have a plant.
[time=209] Today, I want to talk to you about rooted faith, rooted faith.
[time=213] This is a plant that just represents your life.
[time=216] It's got long vines, it's got things that come out of the pot.
[time=220] But I want to talk about roots today, and I've got my tool that helps us cultivate roots.
[time=225] And when you dig up things, when you plant things, it takes some digging.
[time=230] And that's what we're here to do.
[time=231] We're here to dig into the Word of God.
[time=232] But today God is here to dig into the root system of your faith.
[time=236] And so are you ready to be cultivated by our God?
[time=239] He's ready to do some digging, sometimes it's a little painful.
[time=242] He transplants, he moves things around.
[time=244] But today I want to talk to you about rooted faith.
[time=247] Rooted faith.
[time=248] Colossians 2, we're going to look at verses 6 through 15.
[time=251] So meet me there in the Word of God as we let God do a little bit of maybe root surgery.
[time=255] And as we go through this, here's what I want to ask you to do.
[time=258] Consider your roots.
[time=260] And answer this question.
[time=262] Where are you planted today?
[time=264] No really, where are you planted today?
[time=267] If we looked at your priorities in your life, where would those priorities inform us that
[time=274] you're planted?
[time=276] What do your priorities say about what you're digging your roots into, what you're building your life around, and maybe let God do a little bit of root surgery on your heart and your
[time=287] faith today.
[time=288] Rooted faith, we're looking at maturity university, what does it really mean to grow up in Christ?
[time=291] So many misconceptions about that.
[time=293] And today I want to answer three questions.
[time=295] The first of which is this, how can I be rooted in faith?
[time=298] We're going to look at this passage.
[time=299] Paul answers these three questions and I want us to look at them.
[time=302] A lot of sermons end with the how.
[time=304] Today we're starting with the how.
[time=305] Paul answers and gives us several things in verses 6 and 7 for how we can be rooted in faith.
[time=310] We will be, why should I be rooted in faith?
[time=313] And then there's a core question when it comes to the root systems of our life.
[time=317] And that question is, is Jesus enough, and we're going to spend the rest of our time looking at that.
[time=322] So you're ready to dig in to the Word of God.
[time=324] You're ready to dig into your heart today.
[time=326] You're ready for the Word today, Black Hawk.
[time=328] All right, let's talk about how we can be rooted in faith, verses 6 and 7 of Colossians chapter 2.
[time=334] Let's read that together.
[time=335] Paul says, "Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him, rooted
[time=344] and built up in Him, and established in the faith.
[time=348] Just as you were taught, he's talking about a paphorous, the faithful pastor of the church at Colossae.
[time=353] Paul is writing from prison and he's already talked about him.
[time=355] And then he ends by saying, abounding in thanksgiving.
[time=360] And Paul gives us really five things.
[time=362] There's a list of five ways to be rooted in your faith.
[time=365] But before I give you that, I want to talk about the first part of the verse.
[time=368] Paul says, "Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus," and as I read that, I'm reminded of Paul's heart for people to receive Christ Jesus.
[time=376] He's writing to a group of people who have received Jesus.
[time=379] This is the church.
[time=380] He's writing to the church at Colossae.
[time=381] He's writing from prison.
[time=382] He's never met a lot of these people.
[time=385] But I'm reminded of a 17-year-old Kevin that was called to preach.
[time=390] And if you've heard my story, I would say I would never be a pastor like my dad.
[time=393] I was the shy kid in the back of the class.
[time=395] And the one thing I should never do according to my evidenced aptitude test is anything with public speaking.
[time=400] And God said, "Let's make that guy a preacher." And I remember the covenant that the Lord and I made at that time, it was something God put on my heart.
[time=408] And it was this, that anybody who's crazy enough to give this guy a microphone, I commit to the Lord that I will make the gospel clear and that I would give people a chance and a compelling call to respond to that gospel.
[time=418] And you may have noticed I do that every Sunday and I've had people say, "Are you going to do that every week?" And my answer is before the Lord, absolutely.
[time=425] As much as there's breath in my lungs, I believe in that with all my heart.
[time=429] And I always will.
[time=430] That's what Jesus looked to do, it's what Paul talks about.
[time=433] And so I want to ask you today, as Paul assumed that as he's writing to the church at Colossae, I ask you today, "Have you received Jesus?
[time=441] Have you truly received Jesus as your Lord and Savior?
[time=443] Have you given him your trust and your life today?
[time=446] If not, then today you're going to learn not just how you can do that." And listen, it has absolutely nothing to do with me.
[time=452] You don't need me at all.
[time=453] You only need Jesus.
[time=455] He's enough.
[time=456] That's what we'll spend all of our time looking at today.
[time=457] You're going to know why you need to do that, maybe in a new way.
[time=460] The gospel's going to be clear to you through Paul's writing to the church at Colossae today.
[time=463] So know that you know that you've received the gift of salvation.
[time=467] It is by grace through faith, it is not of works.
[time=470] It is a gift of God.
[time=472] Our job is to receive that and to put our faith in our trust in Him.
[time=475] That's the beginning of a root system.
[time=477] And so today I want to give you this list of five things, how I can be rooted in my faith.
[time=481] Number one, let's write these down.
[time=483] Walk in Him.
[time=484] Walk in Him, Paul says.
[time=486] And when I hear walking, one of my favorite things to do with my wife is to just walk together, whether that's at the beach or on a vacation or on our sidewalks.
[time=495] Walk and talk is the word walk and the picture and the posture, the image that we get here
[time=501] is walking in a relational sense.
[time=504] It's a relational kind of language.
[time=506] You walk and talk with those that you love and we're to walk in Him.
[time=510] We're to walk with Him.
[time=513] It's a relational language and we spend a lot of time looking at going from dead to infant to child to young adult to parent in our spiritual maturity as we're looking at maturity university.
[time=525] And I want to remind you today as we look at this walk in Him, this language of friendship, this language of relationship that God is a relational God and that relationships are
[time=535] the key to spiritual maturity.
[time=538] I would submit to you, listen, that if you're not pursuing and walking in a vertical relationship
[time=544] with God through Jesus Christ and that that vertical relationship is not turning into a horizontal one another loving relationship and community between other people that includes
[time=554] both believers and reaching out to people who do not believe, then I would submit to you that you are not maturing in your faith.
[time=561] It absolutely starts and ends with relationship, this concept of spiritual maturity.
[time=567] And walking reminds me when I learned to walk, when my kids have learned to walk, what does it start with?
[time=575] Everybody say one step.
[time=577] One step, you're right, one step.
[time=578] A lot of you think you've got to jump to the end and you've got to arrive today.
[time=582] No, it's one step at a time and at Blackhawk, if you go to blackhawkministries.org, the
[time=589] top of the website will say my discipleship journey.
[time=591] My discipleship journey is just a pathway, a road map, to help you in your journey of faith.
[time=597] Wherever you may be, mature, not mature, unsure, sure, you could be anywhere on the map and it's going to connect you with coaches, look around the room, if you're in the room, you see some yellow lanyards.
[time=606] These are coaches, these are people that are trained up to walk with you in the discipleship journey to help you take your next step.
[time=612] So today, I simply ask you this question, what's your next step?
[time=615] Is it baptism?
[time=616] We've got some little kids that are going to get baptized next week and whoa, I can't wait.
[time=620] It's just one of my favorite moments when they just, yeah, if you see the beautiful picture of baptism that I'll show you and look at in depth as we look at Paul's writing, it may be baptism, it may be a life group, could be to commit to actually attending church, it could be to finding that group, to finding a way to serve.
[time=635] I don't know what your next step is, but God is the God of next steps because God always meets us where we are, but He never leaves us there.
[time=641] He pushes us forward and so we're a church of next steps and we want to help you take yours.
[time=646] This relational language, how do I become rooted in my faith?
[time=649] Walk in Him.
[time=650] Second thing that Paul talks about is being rooted in Him.
[time=652] He says rooted and built up in Him, let's break those two apart, let's talk about roots.
[time=656] I don't know what ecosystem we want to look at today, but in all of them, anything that has roots, if the roots are not there, the thing dies.
[time=666] And the same thing is true of us, where our roots are not in a place that has good nutrients that does not feed us well, that is not rooted in a place that is full of life, we too will
[time=677] die.
[time=678] So I want to remind us of that, eternal life only comes from Jesus, so we must be rooted in Him if we want to have life.
[time=684] Walk in Him, be rooted in Him, three, built up in Him.
[time=687] It's a construction kind of language, how many construction minded people, you're just builders, you build things, whether it's vision or it's construction, there's so many, I can see you in the room right now.
[time=696] This is our kind of language and so the question is, are you building your life, are you building your faith on, with and around and through Jesus Christ?
[time=707] We said we can't build our house, we can't build our faith, we can't build our life on the sand, but on the stone, let's build on the rock.
[time=713] We've got to build our life on Jesus, we've got to build our life with Jesus, we've got to build our life through Jesus, we've got to build our life around Jesus.
[time=721] This is how we are built up and mature and rooted in our faith, walk in Him, be rooted
[time=727] in Him, be built up in Him, be established in the faith is number four, established in
[time=733] the faith.
[time=734] This is kind of a legal language.
[time=736] It talks of a case in a courtroom kind of language that is presented and it's settled and it's stamped, it reminds us that it is finished and reminded of what Jesus said on the cross, the finished work of Jesus, Jesus is not still finishing that work, it's not the finishing work of Jesus, it's the finished work of Jesus.
[time=753] He said it is finished, he had paid the price for the sin of humanity and because of that, we are established in our faith and a lot of times we think that spiritual maturity starts with walking in Him and starts with living out those things but it starts with an establishment of an identity that we are His, we are His children, we are His sons, we are His daughters
[time=773] and because of that identity our activity starts to look different but in church we tend to get it backwards sometimes don't we?
[time=779] We think we're not mature unless we do enough.
[time=781] Well we can't do enough to ever get there anyway, that's why we've got to reverse that order, get it in God's order and say we've got to be established in the faith, established in our identity and from that, from that root system we'll come vines, we'll come fruit, we'll come branches, we'll come the stuff that as we are connected to the true vine who is Jesus Christ, John 15 we will start to look different in our lives, established
[time=803] in the faith.
[time=804] And I love number five, it's a bounding and thanksgiving.
[time=808] Probably the people who are the most thoughtful people in your life that make the biggest difference in your life are the most thankful people in your life because thankfulness always leads to thoughtfulness but the most thoughtless people in your life probably are the most grumbling negative people in your life, can I get a name in?
[time=825] Don't look at them if they're in the room or at home because they probably already know but here's what I want you to realize today as we think about thanksgiving is that if you don't live a thankful life you're going to live a thoughtless life, a life without intention and we live in a world that gives us plenty of reasons to be negative but at the heart of Christian maturity is gratitude.
[time=843] I want to live a grateful life, there are people I did a funeral just this week of one of our own church family members that husband and wife both contracted COVID, we're in the hospital because of COVID, husband got better, life didn't, I did a funeral this week and
[time=859] one of the things that stood out as I talked to their family through the tears and through the pain and through all the reasons to live maybe an ungrateful life and to be just grieving and hurting which we all have plenty of allowances and grace for as we should and as we would need if we were in their shoes I saw gratitude, I saw I'm saying but I'm so thankful we still got our family, I'm so thankful she knew Jesus, I'm so thankful that she went home to be with Jesus, I'm so thankful that Jesus said well done good and faithful servant, I'm so thankful that she left such a legacy that I can now carry forward in my life and I was touched and reminded of areas of my own life where I'm not always so grateful, gratitude, write this down, gratitude is the gateway to growth.
[time=898] If you're not grateful, you're not growing.
[time=903] Lack of gratitude will always stifle your growth and your Christian maturity, may we be grateful for the fact that we serve a risen savior and that he loves us, that we have a church family like we have, that we have a family that we have influences, that we have friends like we have, make that list, I'm a post-it note guy, some of you are journaling people and I try to work on my spiritual discipline of journaling, I'm not as good at it but I get so much fruit from it but I'm a post-it note guy right, post-it notes to remind me of things, post-it notes to my kids and I'm just a post-it note guy, whether you're a post-it note, a journal person, maybe this week just write down 10 reasons to be grateful, they're there, you may say I don't have one, yeah you do, it's there, you've got breath in your lungs today, did a funeral this last week and God's given us new mercies today and we can use the time that God has given us, there's one for you, I gave it to you, you're welcome.
[time=948] So let's make those lists, I'm so thankful for Callie, she is our middle child, in fact she turns nine today, today's her birthday so if you see her, so last week on Saturday was Jessica's birthday my wife, today's Callie's we just got, I've got to treat the ladies in my life really well in October but today's Callie's ninth birthday and I don't even know Jessica when this started but I don't know if we've ever even talked about it but I was just thinking about gratitude this week and we pray and we tried, I don't know if you've seen the ways of praying, there's all kind of models of access, adoration and confession and thanksgiving, supplication, we pray for other people, there's all those models, we try to teach our kids to pray and one of the things that we try to teach and do is to thank God for things and so they've been doing that since they were very, very little and Callie developed this phrase and she says it, I think just about every time she prays and I try not to draw a lot of attention to it because then she might stop or whatever and I don't want her to, it's so beautiful but every time she prays at some point in her prayer she'll just stop and she'll say in her beautiful sweet childlike voice she'll just say we're so blessed, oh I just melt every time into a little puddle and I'm reminded
[time=1016] today that we're so blessed and I want to remind you today that we're so blessed, I
[time=1024] know life doesn't look like it's full of blessings all the time right now to you, there's a lot of reasons to not be thankful but we're so blessed, God loves you, he sent Jesus for
[time=1036] you, he is coming back again and we have the hope of eternal life and an earthly life that
[time=1042] stinks sometimes, can I get an amen, we're so blessed, I'm so glad that we have reasons
[time=1049] to be grateful and that we can walk in him, be rooted in him, built up in him, established in the faith and abounding in thanksgiving, that's a great list of how to be rooted in your faith, let's talk about number two, why, why should I be rooted in my faith, why does that matter?
[time=1064] In verse number eight Paul gives us the reason why and it's so that you don't become captivated
[time=1070] or imprisoned by this list and he gives us four things that I will share with you today, look at verse eight and we will see why we've got to be rooted, see to it Paul says that no one takes you captive or makes you a prisoner consumed by philosophy, empty deceit according
[time=1085] to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world and not according to
[time=1091] Christ, why should you be rooted in your faith, it's because there are wolves everywhere, there are distractions everywhere, there are so many things in this world that will take you captive and hold you in bondage and put you in prison so that your root system is not built up in Jesus Christ, it's built in earthly things and it misses the eternal
[time=1110] things, the world is full of those things, if you noticed, if you haven't watch the news this week, there's plenty of reasons to get distracted, there's plenty of things that want to hold you captive, the enemy is seeking to still kill and to devour you and so why be rooted because those wolves are there and he gives this list but before I give you this list of four things that we can get held captive by reasons we've got to stay rooted in Jesus, I want you to notice that he's very broad, Paul is very broad, next week I'm going to talk to you about counterfeit Christianity, we're going to finish chapter two Lord willing next week and we're going to look at counterfeit Christianity, this is a sneak peek of that because Paul gives us a little glimpse into it right now, he's pretty broad in this list and there's a lot of debate among scholars is what's the purpose and occasion of Paul's writing to the church at Colossae, we know it has something to do with false teaching that pulls people away from Jesus because all Paul talks about is how Jesus is enough, Jesus is preeminent, Jesus is sufficient, Jesus is in him, in him, in him, so we know just like it is today, in Paul's time there were many reasons to get distracted from who Jesus is and miss the true Jesus and have counterfeit Jesus is in life, did you know those exist all around you today just like they did in Paul's day, we know some of those things but it's kind of a broad thing and here's what I want you to know, don't miss this, the same danger applied then as it does now and it's why I believe Paul is pretty broad in this list, this list is very inclusive, very vague if you want to in some ways it
[time=1194] could include so many things and here's what is, here's the reason for it in my estimation that Paul knew that if we would make much of Jesus, that if we would know the real Jesus,
[time=1205] that if we would walk with, be rooted in, be built up in, be established in our faith in abounding in things, giving for the real Jesus, the more we would know the real thing
[time=1216] that we would always be able to spot the fake things, Paul's saying don't get so consumed
[time=1222] and listen today and today's time, did you know there's a new term like every day, people come to him and say pastor what's Black Hawk stance on blah blah blah blah and I'm like I don't even know blah blah blah blah blah, did that come out today and it's like there's a new phrase, there's a new terminology for these philosophies and all of these things every single day, I can hardly keep up with it, can I get a name in?
[time=1241] And every day there's something new and what Paul is reminding us to do and what I want to challenge us as a church to do is make sure we're rooted in Jesus, that we have a rooted faith and the more we know the real Jesus, the quicker we'll spot the counterfeit Jesus,
[time=1256] the quicker we'll spot the things that pull us away from our roots but we have a danger of getting so consumed even with refuting counterfeit gospels, even with getting so studied and
[time=1266] so good at making a rebuttal for all of these things that go against the gospel that we forget to focus just on the gospel, the more we know Jesus, the more we'll be able to spot the things that are counter gospel and so let's know Jesus so that whenever we hold up the real deal, the real counterfeit spotters and when you're looking at money, did you know they'll look, they studied the real thing more than they studied the fake things because if they know the real thing, they don't see it real quick when there's a fake one.
[time=1292] The same thing is true of us, may we be rooted and built up and established in him and we'll always be able to spot the counterfeits that are all around us and we'll look at that as a sneak peek of next week but Paul gives us a list of those things now, number one is philosophy, write these down, philosophy, philosophy by definition is just the pursuit of wisdom.
[time=1311] In and of itself it's not bad, I'm a practical theologian, you've probably noticed that but I'm thankful for the philosophical theologians as well that they help us think more deeply into thoughts and to the mindsets behind things and we've got philosophy majors in our church,
[time=1326] you've probably noticed I'm a rubber meets the road guy, I'm a practical theologian through and through, just who I am is how God has wired me, I'm driven in that sense and philosophy though in and of itself is not bad but Paul is talking about how there are so many philosophies that will become empty for us and we have to consider the origins of philosophy.
[time=1343] In fact, philosophy started with the Hebrew people, people give more modern day people credit for the fathers and the institutions of philosophy but it really goes back to the
[time=1353] Hebrew people and that's a whole other philosophical discussion but it's not bad in and of itself but Paul is saying there's so many philosophies, can you relate, can you identify with today, there's so many philosophies that can pull us away from being rooted in Jesus, we have to consider the origins, did it come from God or did it come from man?
[time=1371] Empty deceit is number two, empty deceit and when you think of empty deceit is things that
[time=1377] really are counterfeit, it looks a lot like Jesus, it smells a little bit like Jesus but it's not the real Jesus, it's deceitful things that disguise themselves to look like Christianity
[time=1387] and faith and in Jesus but ultimately it's empty, it's earthly, it's empty, it's not the eternal Jesus that came and dwelt among us, it's not the real thing.
[time=1398] Human tradition is number three and boy this one eats church's life, you have to consider the origins of philosophy but in churches, listen I've been in churches, God help us, where there's fusses over, well we've always bought this brand of toilet paper, I've been
[time=1414] in a business meeting, I'm not kidding, where there was almost a fist fight between church leaders, deacons over what brand of toilet paper we were going to buy for the bathrooms in the church, Lord Jesus come quickly, God help us right, we get so twisted and so distracted
[time=1433] by so many, and that wasn't a black heart by the way, you're like, oh good, good to know that was a long time ago and I thank God we've never fussed over toilet paper brands, you may not like it but we don't get hung up on those things, can I get an amen?
[time=1444] You've got to consider the origins, did it come from God or did it come from man traditions or not bad, there've been traditions throughout history but listen when we prioritize human tradition above just seeking the heart of God and being rooted in our faith, then the
[time=1458] enemy is winning in our church and we will not allow that to happen on our watch, say amen if you're with me, we will always keep the heart of God above the human traditions that maybe we like, maybe we don't like, it's what the preacher sounds like, it's what the preacher wears, it's the style of preaching, it's the kind of worship, it's what the seats look like, it's what smell we spray in the bathroom, it's the brand of toilet paper, it doesn't matter, those things that are earthly, they can go over here, I mean we don't give attention to them but we're going to focus on the eternal, we don't want what happened in Amos chapter 5 verse 21 where God says I hate strong language, this is from God,
[time=1494] I hate, I despise those feasts and those festivals and the traditions that they had done, why?
[time=1501] Because they were missing the heart of God in them, may that never be so of us, number four is worldly principles, that phrase elemental spirits, it means a lot of things, it goes to
[time=1512] the philosophies by which we have life, it's the philosophies and viewpoints and worldviews
[time=1518] of life that interpreters look at it a lot of different ways but it's a very broad inclusive language that it means it has all of these principles that come from the world and even spiritual, even in a spiritual warfare sense, you could apply that as well but the bottom line is all of these threats to a rooted fate have three problems, they're human in nature, they're not
[time=1537] grounded in truth and it's the end of verse eight, they are not according to Christ, they're not according to Christ, that's the end of verse eight, you could write it down this way, here's the point, Jesus is the standard, Jesus is the standard, we've preached and looked at the fact that Jesus is the
[time=1552] savior of life, the source of life, the sustainer of life, the supremacy over life, the sacrifice
[time=1558] and the substitution by which we can have eternal life and the strength by which we can live life, today Jesus is the standard, Jesus is the source, Jesus is supreme, Jesus is sovereign, Jesus is
[time=1569] on the throne, he is our standard and there are so many threats in the Colossian church just historically there was astrology, eastern mysticism, philosophy, there's legalism but I want to zoom
[time=1580] in on legalism for a minute because legalism when Paul wrote to the church at Galatius, the book of Galatians, this was more what we would call Jewish legalism, this is where you would say that
[time=1591] the whole fulfillment of the law and the requirements of the law would start with circumcision, we had
[time=1598] communion earlier, we're going to talk about baptism, Paul talks about baptism and then there's also circumcision, we don't talk about that in church very much but it's very clear in this passage
[time=1608] and the law and the fulfillment of the law started with circumcision and ended and continued with
[time=1614] obedience to the Jewish law and to the Old Testament law and in the Old Government so that's where it all started, that's the fulfillment of law, now knowing that Paul wrote to the church at Galatia because they were saying that circumcision and obedience to the law were necessary for salvation
[time=1631] and that's pretty clear to refute and Paul had to refute that and don't think for a second it's not something we still have to work to refute in today's churches too but maybe this other brand
[time=1640] of legalism that Paul's really more addressing in this vein that he was dealing with we'll call it Gnostic legalism, the Gnostics, the people who were saying no no no Jesus is prominent he's just not preeminent, they wouldn't deny Jesus and it just is a sneaky way to become a legalist and so it
[time=1655] wasn't saying hey you know all these things are required for salvation it's like no Jesus is enough for salvation but here's what they said they would say that listen Jesus is enough for salvation but circumcision that's the first requirement of the law by the way that's where it all started
[time=1670] if you're going to be obedient to the Jewish law you've got to be circumcised it was a physical operation that had spiritual significance right and so we know that God told his people throughout
[time=1680] history that you need more than just that physical operation you need circumcision of the heart
[time=1686] you need transformation and so it sets up that's why I tell you Jesus is in every book of the Bible that's why Paul talks about circumcision in Christ here but Gnostic legalism says no Jesus
[time=1696] is enough for salvation but when it comes to spiritual maturity behavioral accomplishments that's
[time=1704] legalism coupled with intellectual accomplishments that's Gnosticism leads you to become a different
[time=1712] tier of spiritually elite people and so Jesus is enough for salvation but if you want to be on a
[time=1718] real high tier the highest of high tiers of the spiritually mature then you've got to accomplish
[time=1725] things behaviorally and intellectually and bring those things together and you can supersede and become superior to others that real spiritual maturity starts with you in that sense and I came
[time=1736] to remind us and Paul came to remind us that listen at the foot of the cross the ground is level at the foot of the cross we're all sinners who need a savior we're never superior to anybody else
[time=1747] we are all a dead sinner until Jesus shows up but Jesus meets us where we are but then he takes us
[time=1755] forward into something new he is our standard he is our source he is our sustainer and may we
[time=1761] never be the kind of church that buys into that kind of legalism that says we've got to have this intellectual accomplishment and this behavioral accomplishment to be spiritually mature what
[time=1772] happens is you get rooted in Jesus and that identity that you have in Jesus and then the intellectual understandings the behavioral changes and shifts they flow from who you are
[time=1783] not from what you do we do it backwards I'm not worthy until I look the part act the part change enough to fit into the church standards no God says you're never gonna do that you need me first I'll do the cleaning up I'll do the transformation we can't do that and you can't do that in your own
[time=1799] life either maybe you've been getting it mixed Jesus is the standard and there's so many strong currents just like in the ocean that would pull us left and pull us right and pull us away from Jesus it's what leads us to do things and justify doing things like redefining sexuality
[time=1814] like redefining marriage things that God has made so abundantly clear through scripture that we
[time=1820] stand on that are posted on our website it's hard to do that today because we live in a world here's what happens we'll keep Christ just like these Gnostic legalists that's why I gave you that description if you're like why don't you even tell us that here's why it applies today because we'll keep Christ we'll add a on the surface good cause that fits our comfort I need to say that again this is
[time=1841] what happens in today's world we keep Christ send the name of Christianity to the name of Jesus we add a good cause and we build things around our own comfort and we created false gospel that
[time=1852] we're comfortable with that we say it still builds around Jesus it's got good causes but it's really built around my own comfort I came to remind us today that it is in Christ and Christ alone that
[time=1862] we stand our blessed assurance depends on Jesus and it's not Jesus plus something Jesus plus anything
[time=1868] ruins everything it's Jesus plus nothing that gives us everything Jesus is enough
[time=1874] and we stand on that here at black arm and may we stand on that in our own life and I ask you
[time=1881] today what strong current is pulling you away from what God's wanting to do in your life what strong currents pulling you away maybe it's politics yeah I said it again politics
[time=1891] maybe it's all these terms that come and go and you're just zoomed in on one and you're consumed by it and you're helped captive by it today it's an addiction a social media is I don't know what it is for you what current is pulling you away this is why you need to be rooted in Jesus that's how that's why let's talk for a few minutes and I'll go through verses 9 through 15 answering this question is Jesus enough I'm gonna give you seven reasons why the answer is yes straight from these verses don't worry we'll go fast listen fast we'll go through them number one in Jesus we find the fullness of God this is verse 9 for in him the whole fullness of deity dwells
[time=1923] bodily Jesus is God Jesus is not a little sliver of God Jesus is not just kind of a
[time=1929] sorta maybe kind of picture of God Jesus is God Jesus is God revealed to us Jesus is God made
[time=1935] personal to us Jesus is God being relational for us he is fully God all the fullness of God
[time=1941] dwelt in him bodily and he was fully a man he walked where we walked yet he did it without sin Curtis showed us the requirements of that until our high priest showed up Jesus is God we
[time=1951] could pray and say amen now that's why Jesus is enough he's the fullness of God some of your like
[time=1957] good let's go to lunch but some of you want to dig a little more so I want to give you six more number two is this that in Jesus we found the fullness of life in the beginning of verse 10 and you have been filled in him it's the same word that's used about the fullness of God the same kind of phrase there we've been given everything Peter reminds us that pertains to life and godliness we have everything we need for maturity today for completeness today we've been filled because of
[time=1980] Jesus so in Jesus we found the fullness of God we found the fullness of life number three at the end of verse 10 and Jesus we find the fullness of authority who is the head of all rule
[time=1991] and authority is how verse 10 ends he's in charge he's sovereign he's on his throne and I want to
[time=1997] not just remind you of that but ask you a personal question here's that question where have you refused to submit to what God has spoken in your life in your life where have you refused to submit
[time=2011] to what God has spoken that could be commands in his word commands to love the unlovable perhaps but maybe it's like what Pastry Maude talked about last week and the journey of faith like Abraham's journey didn't know exactly where he was going what risk do you need to take what step has God called you to take that you've just refused to take in what area of your life do you need to submit to the authority of God because in Jesus we found the fullness of authority. Verse 11 in Jesus we find the fullness of completion and so let's spend a minute or two here looking at circumcision because that's where Paul takes us in verse 11 in him you also were circumcised with a circumcision
[time=2046] made without hands I don't know if you notice this phrase in specific nature is only used three times
[time=2052] in scripture twice by Paul one of them is here another time is by Jesus in mark chapter 14 of
[time=2058] these verse 58 where Jesus is talking about the rebuilding of the temple we said I'll tear the temple down and I'll rebuild it in three days they thought it was physical they thought he meant he was literally physically going to tear down the temple of God where the people would go and meet but Jesus was saying about his own body I'm going to tear be torn down I'm going to die and pay a price for the sin of the world and I'll be rebuilt I'll be resurrected in three days and so that's another place this phrase is used it's not made with hands it's not done by us it's done by God so now that you know that let's keep reading we were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands how by putting off the body of flesh by the circumcision of Christ we did communion earlier
[time=2096] we're looking at circumcision that was a physical thing that has spiritual significance this is a full-on spiritually significant change inside of us where our heart is what become circumcised and
[time=2106] transformed by Jesus and so Jesus is the fullness of completion the first requirement of the law
[time=2112] was circumcision it's a sign of the covenant that God had with his people Genesis 17 if you want to read more of that and God frequently in the Old Testament reminded them they needed more than the physical they needed the spiritual they needed a circumcision of the heart and this phrase reminds
[time=2128] us right listen if you're like whoa I didn't get any of that pastor just ready to go to lunch what
[time=2134] do you what's the point there it's really simply this that Jesus accomplished and Jesus completed what
[time=2140] the law could not Jesus accomplished Jesus completed what we could not do in the law that's why when we
[time=2147] read the law so why we should look at the laws it reminds us how much we need Jesus so mirror to show us that we could not do it but that Jesus alone could and Jesus alone did Jesus is the fullness of
[time=2159] completion and because of that we find number five which is then Jesus we find the fullness of resurrection look at verse 12 having been buried with him in baptism oh I love this this is why when
[time=2170] we're buried with Christ in baptism it's pictured in baptism the word literally in scripture means there's a couple of different meanings we take literally it means to dip or to immerse to go under and that's why we baptize that way because it's what the word means it's what Jesus did so being buried with him in baptism and in death we die to ourself our old self is gone we become
[time=2191] new we're a new creation in Christ and then you come out of the water and that's why we say raise to walk with him in a new life we are resurrected having been buried with him in baptism the spiritual
[time=2202] meaning behind that is to be identified with we're identified with Jesus what happened to Jesus happens to us death and burial of the old self just as Jesus died and was buried resurrection and a new life becoming a new creation just like Jesus was raised to life that's why
[time=2217] Paul writes it this way in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working
[time=2223] of God who raised him from the dead what happened to Jesus happens to us amen whoo that should get
[time=2230] you excited and if not let me read verse 13 because it gets even better look at verse 13 that reminds us and you were dead you were dead I just came to remind you of that today you were dead in your
[time=2241] trespasses and if that's where the story ended we'd be in bad shape you were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh but God I'm so glad God showed up God made alive together with
[time=2252] him having forgotten all our trespasses and some of you now that you know this you know Jesus is
[time=2258] the fullness of resurrection some of you been walking around in condemnation and then guilt
[time=2264] and in shame and believing the lies of the enemy that he chirps in your ear that you're never going to be good enough some of you have been walking around in grave clothes but you have been given the fullness of life and today in Jesus name I declare over you it's time to stop walking around
[time=2281] in grave clothes and in death and walk in the freedom of the faith that you have in Jesus Christ
[time=2287] by faith and through his grace we are made alive together with Jesus Christ so stop in Jesus name
[time=2294] walking around in the grave clothes of guilt and shame and condemnation there is therefore now
[time=2300] no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus let's walk together in the life the eternal
[time=2306] and abundant life that God has given us in Jesus name today
[time=2313] and Jesus we've been given the fullness of resurrection I don't deserve that but God accomplished it
[time=2319] and he allowed me to live in it as far as the east is from the west as far as he removed my sins from me he's forgotten of me remembers them no more wow pray we could sit in that this week
[time=2332] in Jesus we have the fullness of resurrection as if that's not enough it leads to freedom number six in Jesus we found the fullness of freedom verse number 14 by canceling the record of death that stood against us with its legal demands and standards this he set aside nailing
[time=2347] it to the cross when people in this time when they were crucified on a cross they would nail
[time=2353] usually above their head to the cross a paper that showed the indictments that they were there to pay a price for so if it was theft if it was murder whatever their crime they would nail that to the cross showing that this is what the thief or this is what the murderer or this is what the
[time=2369] accused this is what the convicted is being killed for this is why they're paying the price and that
[time=2375] that debt is canceled by them paying the penalty of death that's a pretty high penalty they would
[time=2381] nail that to the cross now that you know that this verse kind of jumps out doesn't it because what Jesus did is he never had any of those indictments he never had any of those sins he knew no sin yet
[time=2391] he became sin he took your indictments he took your debts which is a debt of pen a penalty of death
[time=2398] he took it on himself and it was nailed to the cross and he said it is finished and when he said
[time=2404] it is finished he meant it is finished and because it is finished we get to live in the fullness of freedom in Jesus name some of you've been living in a lack of fullness and a lack of
[time=2414] freedom it's been nailed to the cross he set it aside nailed it to the cross is canceled that record
[time=2420] of death that you have that is freedom and because of that we can live in number seven which is victory
[time=2426] and Jesus we find the fullness of victory verse 15 he disarmed the rulers and authorities and
[time=2432] put them to open shame that which God that that Satan in the enemy and the world and maybe yourself you've been using to shame you Jesus put it all to open shame by triumphing over them in him Jesus is sufficient verses 9 through 14 verse 15 here reminds us that Jesus is supreme
[time=2450] Jesus is sovereign is Jesus enough well if you miss the whole sermon I'm going to summarize it
[time=2456] for you here's Paul's point in a nutshell Paul's point is what more could we possibly need than Jesus Jesus is enough that's what we're rooted in it's how we're rooted it's why we got to be
[time=2468] rooted and it's how we can continue walking in a rooted sense in our faith and here's an application
[time=2474] question for you as we close today how can you grow your roots in Jesus this week simple question
[time=2481] big full answer how can you the plant that is your life how can you be more rooted I don't know what digging God's been up to but he's been cultivating he's been getting you ready for something bigger he's been getting you ready to go deeper in your walk with faith and deeper is often way misdefined we've looked at it in so many clear ways from Paul today how can you be more rooted in your faith in Jesus this week I want to ask you just to bow your heads close your eyes what does that mean for you to be more rooted in your faith in Jesus this week believers pray that
[time=2508] prayer ask God that question and he'll show you something but for those of you who are in the room that would say I just don't know that I have a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ you've heard the gospel today Jesus we've looked at the sacraments of baptism and communion and even circumcision we've looked at the old covenant the new covenant you've got a full picture of the council a whole council of God's word today through what Paul has written to the church at Colossae but the takeaway is that you need Jesus it really is that simple we tend to make God's
[time=2537] simple plan of the gospel the good news of Jesus we make it real complicated Jesus died to pay a price for your sin that you couldn't pay died to pay the debt that you owed that you couldn't pay
[time=2548] he rose again and he defeated death and hell in the grave so that you could have eternal life in Jesus and your job is to receive that free gift to trust in Jesus for salvation not your faith
[time=2558] not your grandparents faith not your works not you being good better than the next person but in the
[time=2565] goodness of God in Jesus we're saved by grace through faith in your own words we cry out and ask God to save you in this place today and he will do just that as believers are praised and how can I be rooted in that this week let's take a moment pause and ponder respond and reflect on what God's do
[time=2600] oh I love these moments God loves these moments believers that are in the room how many of you would say and even those who can't let's acknowledge just before God if nothing else just a step of saying yeah he really showed me some stuff today today how many of you that are believers would
[time=2616] say man I got a big step of faith I need to take maybe a risk maybe a relationship I got to dig back into but I got to be more rooted in a specific area that guys revealed to me lift your hand I want to pray for you God bless each of you see you all over the room and God sees those of you who may be watching from elsewhere you can put your hands down how many of you would say today I've nailed down my salvation I've given my heart my life my faith is in Jesus I'm trusting in him and him alone for salvation and I have nailed that down today if that's you I'm just going to pray for you and welcome me to God's family we want to help you with the next steps if that's you lift your hand right now say pray for me pastor my life belongs to Jesus I am his I've given my life to him anybody in the room that I can see I see you sir God bless you who else even if I can't see you
[time=2658] God sees you in the heavens rejoice and we're about to do the same God I thank you for these next steps
[time=2664] especially those who've come to Christ today especially those who have made you their Lord and their Savior God you are on the throne and today we were reminded of that we celebrate with the angels in heaven for each person who has entered from death to life for every sinner who finds repentance God the angels in heaven rejoice so do we and God I pray over every next step over
[time=2684] every new step of being rooted in Jesus today I pray with all my heart that you would equip and empower them to be bold in their faith this week that it would be the Spirit's power the same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead that would go before I said I prayed all in the powerful matchless name of Jesus and all God's people said amen let's celebrate let's welcome people to God's family celebrate next steps this is why we do what we do this is why Jesus came all the world
