[time=0] Maternity, university, we're looking at what does it mean to be mature in Christ?
[time=4] What does it mean to grow up in Christ?
[time=6] We've gotten through the first two chapters.
[time=8] We're now in the last two chapters of the four chapters that we have, the word of God divided into.
[time=14] It's a letter that Paul wrote to the church and Colossae from prison, house arrest in Rome.
[time=19] He'd never met a lot of these people, but he had heard and seen so much that God was doing in them and through them.
[time=24] But he also knew as it is today that there were so many lies that wanted to attract them and to distract them from the truth, just like it is for us.
[time=34] And so Paul has spent two chapters now talking about the doctrinal components, the theological components of who Jesus is.
[time=41] He is preeminent.
[time=43] He's not just a prominent figure in our history.
[time=46] He is the preeminence of God.
[time=48] He is the presence of God, the word that became flesh and dwelt among us.
[time=52] And for these two chapters, we've looked at the character of him.
[time=55] And now Paul is shifting a little bit to what it looks like to build a kingdom culture.
[time=59] That's what I want to preach to you about today, kingdom culture.
[time=63] Colossians 3, verse 11 verses.
[time=65] And Paul is kind of shifting from the doctrinal components so much, there's still plenty of that there.
[time=70] But now to the demonstration components.
[time=73] Because here's the thing, as Paul does this today, I want to remind you this and don't miss this, behavior doesn't change behavior.
[time=82] How many of you have lived the Christian life and you thought, if I just try a little harder, if I just think about it for one more minute in the day, I'll finally kick that habit or that sin or that addiction will finally go away.
[time=92] If you've ever been there, I have, or I did it in my own strength.
[time=95] Behavior doesn't change behavior, but listen, belief always changes behavior.
[time=100] And if your beliefs are in Jesus Christ and his presence is inside of you, it always impacts your behavior.
[time=107] Those beliefs never leave behavior the same.
[time=110] But so many times in our religious world, we get it backwards.
[time=113] And Paul is reminding us of that because notice the order, even of how he wrote to the church at Colossians, who Jesus is.
[time=119] And now because of that, things change.
[time=121] So you could write it down this way.
[time=123] I believe this with all my heart.
[time=124] It does no good to declare and defend truth.
[time=129] Now that's important that we do that, but it does no good if we do those things, if we don't demonstrate it.
[time=133] And that's what Paul is teaching about as we go into chapter three.
[time=137] Sometimes in the Christian faith, we get really good about declaring truth.
[time=141] Blasting it out on Facebook or on the gram or whatever it might be.
[time=145] And even defending it will hop to the defense of it.
[time=148] Those things can be good if done in a truth and love manner of the way that Jesus did.
[time=153] But if we don't demonstrate it, we miss the point.
[time=156] And so today, I'm going to divide what Paul wrote into three actions that we can draw from his writing, straight from these first 11 verses of Colossians chapter three, three actions that will help us build a kingdom culture.
[time=169] Write these down.
[time=170] The first one is to seek the eternal.
[time=173] Seek the eternal.
[time=174] This comes from the first four verses of Colossians chapter one.
[time=178] Let's seek the eternal.
[time=179] You ready to seek the eternal as we read the word of God today, church?
[time=183] Let's dig in.
[time=184] Colossians chapter three, first four verses.
[time=187] Paul says, if then, it's like he did earlier, if then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
[time=198] Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth, for you have died.
[time=206] And your life is hidden with Christ in God.
[time=210] Love this verse, when Christ, who is your life, appears.
[time=215] Then you also will appear with him in glory.
[time=220] May God just bless the reading of his word and may it just multiply in our hearts and come into the demonstrations of how we live it out in our lives this week.
[time=228] Let's seek the eternal together and let's be clear, eternal life, when we seek the eternal, Jesus did not die on the cross and be raised from the dead so that you could have fire insurance, so that you could experience eternal life at the point of death, so that you could
[time=244] miss hell and make heaven.
[time=245] Jesus came that we would have life and have it more abundantly.
[time=249] That applies even now, so our experience and our walk in eternal life begins the moment
[time=256] we surrender our lives to Jesus Christ.
[time=259] Some of you thought it was just a later thing, but it's a now and a later thing.
[time=263] Somebody should make a candy of that or something.
[time=265] It's now and it's later, and some of you have just been looking to a future faith, but your faith impacts everything you do today, and I'm glad that we get to experience that.
[time=275] It's the Lord's Prayer.
[time=276] Jesus taught the disciples how to pray and He said, "Your kingdom come, your will be done." Say it with me if you know it.
[time=282] On earth as it is in heaven, it's a now thing.
[time=286] That's what Jesus taught us, that's what Paul is writing about, and listen, as God's church, we are called, I love this thought, we are called to practice for heaven on earth.
[time=297] We are called, that's why we gather, we're called to practice for heaven now.
[time=303] And I'll write it down this way, we are citizens, write this down.
[time=306] We are citizens of heaven, Philippians 3 and verse 20.
[time=309] We are citizens of heaven, but we're residents of earth.
[time=313] And man, I was reminded of that.
[time=314] This week I stood on this stage just two days ago and I was privileged to speak at the funeral of one of our very own Don Seeley.
[time=323] Don Seeley went home to be with the Lord, and what a man of God.
[time=327] When he walked into the room, you just felt better.
[time=331] And those of you who are here, I see faces that were in the room with me on Friday.
[time=334] That was the theme.
[time=335] And just when Don came in the room, you just felt better.
[time=337] And he had a confidence, it was not a cockiness, not a pride, not an arrogance, it was a confidence that came from Christ.
[time=343] He just exuded eternal life, he exuded joy, he exuded Jesus everywhere, he went, why?
[time=350] Because he knew this truth, that we are citizens of heaven.
[time=353] He knew this earth was not his home, and I sat with him and I washed him, be ready to go be with Jesus.
[time=360] But we live in a tough world because we're residents of this earth, aren't we?
[time=363] And death is still a part of our reality, but I'm thankful that my God hated death enough that he sent forth his Son, so that we could be citizens of heaven.
[time=371] Even while we're residents on earth, we don't even grieve as those who do not have hope.
[time=375] And I thank God for people like Don Seeley, the elder steward team member Deacon, you name it, he probably did it, he kept our finances on track, along with an amazing team of people, so I honor you Don Seeley and Don, it's having a way better day than we are today.
[time=389] Praise God.
[time=391] This is because he knew this very truth.
[time=393] So consider for a moment, just think about this, maybe you've never done this, consider the perfect kingdom finished, glorified you.
[time=404] Because you were justified, justification is justified never sin because of our faith in Jesus, because of his sacrifice for us, that justification leads us to sanctification, maturity, university, we're being grown up to look like Christ, to be conformed to the image of Christ, and then sanctification leads eventually to glorification, so we're done
[time=422] is that right now.
[time=423] One day we will be as well, we'll be absent from this body, we'll be present with the Lord, and whoa, what a day that's going to be.
[time=429] So for just a moment, consider what does it look like today for you to be glorified?
[time=436] Just envision yourself.
[time=437] What do you look like?
[time=438] What do you think like?
[time=441] Looking good, right?
[time=444] Some of you are like, I don't even know, I can't even get there in my mind.
[time=446] That's kind of the point, isn't it so great that we can't even begin to imagine what I have seen.
[time=452] No ear is heard.
[time=453] The mind really can even comprehend what God has prepared for us because we're citizens of heaven.
[time=457] Right now we're residents of this earth, and so as we consider those things, verse one, just going through these together for a moment, Paul says, "If you've been raised with Christ, as we baptize people, we say, buried with Christ in baptism, say it with me, if you know it, buried with Christ in baptism, raise to walk with him in a new life." That's how I say it every single time.
[time=476] This is the language that Paul is using, and he says, "If that's true of you," so I ask you today, "Is it true of you?
[time=481] Have you been raised to walk in a new life with Christ?
[time=485] Today you're going to hear the gospel.
[time=486] Today you've heard the gospel, but you're going to hear even more of the gospel, and God's ready for you to take a step of faith and to respond to the gospel, to trust Jesus
[time=495] as your Savior.
[time=496] But if that is you, then all of these things must be true.
[time=499] And be reminded, verse one, that Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
[time=504] You know what that means?
[time=505] It means that stuff that's surprising you in your life.
[time=507] He's not surprised by it.
[time=509] It means that stuff that you feel is just out of control in this world.
[time=512] It's not out of His control.
[time=513] He's sovereign.
[time=514] He's king.
[time=515] He's Lord.
[time=516] He's on the throne.
[time=517] He's reigning now.
[time=518] He'll be reigning tomorrow, and He'll be reigning for all of eternity.
[time=522] And I want to put my faith in someone that I can trust like that.
[time=525] Can I get an amen?
[time=527] He is in control.
[time=528] Some of you came today just for that.
[time=529] But if that's you, what should we do?
[time=531] Set your mind then on the things that are above, not on the things on the earth?
[time=535] What you've been thinking about lately?
[time=537] Where has your mind been lately?
[time=539] Do an inventory of this week and decide what is it that I've been thinking about?
[time=543] The same Paul who wrote this, and I want to remind you, to seek, we're saying seek the eternal, to seek is also to set.
[time=550] If you're going to seek the eternal, you must set your mind on the things that are above.
[time=556] To seek is to set.
[time=558] They go together.
[time=559] The same Paul who wrote this also wrote Romans, chapter 12 and verses 1 and 2.
[time=563] Let's look at that together.
[time=564] Romans 12, "When I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God to present your bodies as a living sacrifice," that too goes along with what we're about to read and continue in.
[time=573] "Holy and acceptable to God," which is your spiritual worship.
[time=577] This is the demonstration.
[time=578] Verse 2, "Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed." How?
[time=584] Again, to seek is to set.
[time=585] From by the renewal of your mind that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what
[time=591] is good and acceptable and perfect.
[time=596] Verse 3 reminds us that this happens because you have died.
[time=602] Look at your neighbor and say, "You are dead.
[time=607] You're dead.
[time=608] The old you has died." It's gone.
[time=611] The stuff that you keep clinging to and holding on to is dead for you have died and your life is now hidden, hidden with God because of Jesus Christ and our love verse for the old
[time=622] has died.
[time=623] The new has come now.
[time=624] What does that mean?
[time=625] When Christ, who is your life, appears, we get to appear with Him in glory.
[time=630] We get to be with Him forever.
[time=632] You ever heard people say things like, "Man, football is my life."
[time=638] We're in Indiana, we're Hoosiers, basketball is my life.
[time=643] You ever heard people say things like that?
[time=644] Well, I came to tell you today and by the way, big brace fan here, one more.
[time=651] I was a good pastor.
[time=652] I did go to bed, but it was hard last night.
[time=654] Tonight, I will hopefully watch them win the World Series, sorry to all of you who may be Houston fans, but go brace.
[time=660] Now, that's an example.
[time=661] I could say my whole identity is tied to the Atlanta Braves and if so, I would have had a very bad last quarter of the decade.
[time=669] I've been a lifelong Braves fan and I've been waiting 20 plus years for moments like this.
[time=673] It feels really good, right?
[time=675] But the owner, mind you, I don't know what you might say, blank, insert your thing is my life, but I hope the Braves win the World Series, that'd be awesome.
[time=684] I've watched them my whole life, but if they don't, my identity is not tied to a baseball team.
[time=689] All that stuff is earthly.
[time=690] It's just a game.
[time=691] My identity isn't Jesus Christ.
[time=694] In Christ who is my life, if you are a Christian, then Jesus is your life.
[time=701] Jesus is not an element of your life.
[time=703] He is the full embodiment of life.
[time=705] Write that down.
[time=706] Jesus is not an element of life, but the full embodiment of life.
[time=711] When Christ who is your life appears, we get to appear with him in glory.
[time=716] And I want to remind us today, friends, that Jesus is coming again.
[time=721] Because he's coming again, we should have a sense of hope-driven urgency to live out the gospel today, but not fear-driven anxiety about when he comes and are we ready?
[time=731] No, we have everything that we need, but this is what Paul is talking about.
[time=734] Now is the time to live with urgency for the gospel, but we don't do it out of fear.
[time=739] We do it out of hope.
[time=741] We do it out of the life that Jesus gave us in the midst of our death because of sin.
[time=746] So what has been taking God's place, Jesus' place, in the throne of your life lately?
[time=753] What are you seeking?
[time=754] Is it eternal or is it earthly?
[time=758] How do I know that, pastor?
[time=759] How do I gauge that?
[time=760] What have you been setting your mind on?
[time=762] Has it been earthly or is it been eternal?
[time=765] Maybe do an inventory this week, and then I think what will happen is, number two will start to happen in your life, and that is to slaughter the earthly.
[time=775] Yeah, I said slaughter, that'll get your attention.
[time=777] That's really the kind of language when we read in just a minute, these verses are going to go through and unpack it a little piece at a time.
[time=783] The Greek for put to death, it means to make dead.
[time=787] It means to slaughter, to kill, to eradicate, to do away with, to render impotent.
[time=793] It means it has no more power, it has no more life in me.
[time=797] And so in verses 5 through 9, we see this picture of how to slaughter the earthly.
[time=801] As we look at that, I brought me a backpack you thought I forgot, didn't you?
[time=804] I brought a backpack today, and it's a good looking backpack.
[time=808] This really is a backpack.
[time=809] And on this backpack, there's a verse of Scripture, it's Matthew 19, 26 with God, all
[time=815] things are possible.
[time=816] It's a good verse, right?
[time=817] But this is a pretty heavy backpack, too.
[time=820] It's got a lot of weight in it.
[time=824] And this is kind of our church smile backpack.
[time=826] It's got a scripture verse on it.
[time=828] You like my scripture verse backpack.
[time=831] This is your church smile.
[time=833] You put on the scripture verse backpack, could you carry your Bible, maybe hold it up a little extra, right?
[time=837] When you come in church, you put on your church smile, if you had the knockdown, drag out fight.
[time=842] But the reality is, even though sometimes our backpack looks scriptural, it looks pretty, it looks biblical, inside it is a lot of weight.
[time=850] Inside it, it's like carrying around bricks.
[time=854] The earthly and it's all wet and faded and it just weighs us down.
[time=861] Boy, this thing is light now.
[time=864] But in this a picture of our life, we look the part on the outside, but on the inside, there's this brick, there's this weight, there's this earthly weight that just weighs us down.
[time=877] And because Jesus came and because Jesus slaughtered death, because Jesus killed death
[time=883] on the cross, and as He rose from the dead, rendered it impotent, rendered it lifeless.
[time=889] We can put off the earthly.
[time=892] Not because we're good enough to do it on our own, but because He's won that victory and we get to take part in that victory.
[time=897] Hebrews 12-1 says it this way, "Therefore, since we're surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses," this is right after the Hall of Fame of Faith in Hebrews 11, "let us throw off same kind of verbiage and language, let us throw off everything that hinders and
[time=912] the sin that so easily entangles and let us run with perseverance, the race marked out
[time=918] for us." That's my prayer for us today.
[time=921] And Paul then goes into, and we're going to read all of these verses a little chunk at a time, verses five through nine, this list of 12 things that are earthly, 12 things we've got to put off, 12 things that we've got to slaughter.
[time=933] But I want to remind us today, the power to do this is not from my effort, it is from His victory.
[time=939] We put off the earthly because Jesus already defeated all that is earthly.
[time=943] John 1633 said, "In this world you're going to have tribulation, but take heart because I have overcome the world." And Paul gives us this list because we have a new self and it starts with this verse five, put to death.
[time=956] There's that word, put to death.
[time=957] Put to death, put to death, therefore, what is earthly in you?
[time=962] This is the beginning of verse five.
[time=963] This is the phrase that means to slaughter, it means to make dead, it means to kill.
[time=967] It's over, it has no more life, it has no more power, put to death what is earthly in you.
[time=975] And as we look at doing that, I want to remind us that this simple verse reminds me, it reminds you today that Jesus died so that we could be dead to our sins, so that we could crucify
[time=986] the flesh, Galatians chapter five and verse 24.
[time=990] What does that even look like?
[time=991] What does that even mean?
[time=992] Well, that's what Paul is walking us through right now, Jesus died for your sins, so now you can put your sin to death.
[time=997] And how many times, think about this, how many times instead of putting a sin to death, an addiction or a habit, instead of watching it die and be rendered lifeless, this is where it gets real, how many times do we try to put a leash on it?
[time=1010] How many times do we try to just wound our sin and say, well, you know, I'm going to
[time=1016] wound it and kind of keep it back there, it gets worse.
[time=1019] How many times do we try to just cage our sin?
[time=1021] Look, I'm just going to control it.
[time=1023] I can control that habit.
[time=1025] I'm going to stop.
[time=1026] Have you ever been there?
[time=1027] We all have been there.
[time=1028] Even worse, how many times do we try to hide our sin?
[time=1033] Yeah, it got real, didn't it?
[time=1037] That's not what Paul says to do, he says, slaughter it, kill it.
[time=1041] How does we do that?
[time=1042] What does that even look like?
[time=1043] And as we're looking at that today, I'd go to the words of Jesus in Matthew chapter 5, verse 29, Jesus said, if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out.
[time=1052] And as he's saying, go get screwdrivers today after church and no, not quite.
[time=1057] But he is saying, whatever it is, listen, that facilitates those things that maybe you're trying to cage or put a leash on or hide, it's time to kill them.
[time=1065] So that may mean for you, if you have an addiction to pornography, that which is facilitating your pornography, it could be when you're able to access the internet, maybe you need to slaughter that access to the internet at that time.
[time=1076] Maybe you're a loneliness and you're isolation that you don't have anybody that even knows you struggle with it.
[time=1081] It's time to slaughter that which facilitates the earthly, the sin that so eagerly, easily entangles us.
[time=1087] Maybe it's time to slaughter having a smartphone for a while.
[time=1090] For me, I'll tell you, one of the things that I've recently slaughtered and it's not a bad thing and then they're convictions and if you missed last week, convictions and commandments are different and we don't hold people.
[time=1099] We talked about that earlier in the service, even today, we don't hold people to our convictions unless it's a commandment.
[time=1103] The commandments for everybody, convictions are for us personally.
[time=1107] If you're intrigued by that, go back and listen to last week's sermon.
[time=1110] But as we think about these things, one of the things that I've laid down is social media recently.
[time=1114] If you've been missing me, you thought, "Where did it go?" It just fed all the wrong stuff for me and so I just stopped for a while, I'm not saying I won't come back.
[time=1121] It's a good tool, but for me, I just needed to be off of it for a while and so I had put it aside.
[time=1126] It was facilitating all kinds of different things.
[time=1128] It'd take my mind away from where my mind needed to go.
[time=1131] It was watching all the fighting and all the bickering and all the hate and it wasn't fueling that which I am to be a giver-outer of and that is the love of Jesus Christ and so for me, I'm not lobbying that you do that, I'm telling you an example of what I've done.
[time=1144] So what is it that you need to slaughter that is facilitating a problem in your life even yet today?
[time=1151] What is it that you need to get rid of?
[time=1153] If I have a problem with blank, maybe just maybe it's time to get rid of that which is facilitating that problem.
[time=1160] Now let me give you five categories that this list of 12.
[time=1163] There's a list of like 12 things here that Paul says we've got to put to death.
[time=1166] We've got to put off.
[time=1167] The next week we look at what we put on.
[time=1169] This week is what we put off and so there's 12 things.
[time=1172] I'll give you all 12 but I'm going to put them in five categories.
[time=1175] Write these down.
[time=1176] Number one is sexual.
[time=1177] Sexual.
[time=1178] It's interesting that he starts there in the beginning of verse 5.
[time=1180] He gives the first two of this list of 12 things.
[time=1183] Sexual immorality.
[time=1184] What do we put to death?
[time=1185] What do we put off them?
[time=1186] Sexual immorality and impurity.
[time=1189] Sexual immorality is Pornea in the Greek and as it sounds, it is the word from which we have our English word pornography today.
[time=1197] So it's any form, it's sleeping together outside of marriage.
[time=1201] The confines of God's marriage of a man and a woman and sex happening in that context, the marriage bed is to be honored and respected by all but we live in a world that doesn't do that.
[time=1211] It's any of those kinds of things.
[time=1212] It's any immorality of a sexual nature and again it's even the word we get our word pornography.
[time=1218] Impurity goes along with that.
[time=1220] It's dirty.
[time=1221] It means dirty.
[time=1222] It means gross.
[time=1223] It means filth.
[time=1224] And there's plenty of that in the world, in the earthly in which we live.
[time=1228] And I'll tell you, as a pastor, as a person that's just had experiences in life, walked with many people through many of their experiences, sin has all kinds of consequences doesn't it?
[time=1239] It hurts.
[time=1240] The consequences last.
[time=1241] But it's interesting Paul started with this category of the sexual sin because I have learned and I have walked with so many people and seen that, listen, sexual sin and its consequences is so bonding and it's so binding.
[time=1255] It impacts people at a soul kind of level, at a heart kind of level in ways that you just don't see in a lot of other categories sometimes.
[time=1263] So if you're in that, I pray over you and I pray that God would just bless and empower you and help you take some of the steps that I'm going to help you outline even in just a few minutes to find the help that you need to rely on God but also on others.
[time=1276] So sexual immorality, impurity, sexual sin is the first category, second category, spiritual.
[time=1283] Spiritual sin.
[time=1284] The list continues with several other things.
[time=1286] This is number three, four, five and six is passion, evil desire, covetousness, idolatry,
[time=1292] passion, evil desire, covetousness, which is idolatry.
[time=1295] You see a progression even in these categories on account of these things, the wrath of God
[time=1301] is coming.
[time=1302] I'll get there in just a second but let's talk about this progression of passion.
[time=1306] Passion is not in and of itself a bad thing.
[time=1309] In this context, as Paul is writing it though, he's talking about passion, desires that go in the wrong direction.
[time=1315] You ever seen that happen in your life?
[time=1316] You're passionate about something and passion in and of itself is a good thing but it's going the wrong direction.
[time=1322] The original language, the structure of it's used three times in the Old Testament.
[time=1326] One of those is with and alongside this word for desire, which is the second part of it here.
[time=1331] It's number four on the list, passion, evil desire is number four, which is longings cravings, fantasies and even lustfulness.
[time=1342] That's what he's talking about.
[time=1343] He's evil.
[time=1344] It's the word evil but then it's these desires that go deeper than just a passion directed in the right direction.
[time=1349] It's passion then that gets directed in the wrong direction and then it gets focused in on evil things and it becomes fantasies and cravings that control us, addictions even
[time=1359] and lustfulness and then it can even lead to covetousness, which is number five on that list, which is wanting what is not yours.
[time=1368] That could be someone else's money, it could be someone else's spouse, it could be someone else's body, either for yourself or that you wish you had their body and you covet.
[time=1376] It could be this long list of things that we covet and we wish we had for ourselves that does not belong to us and all of these things, number six, is idolatry.
[time=1386] In the second category we see the rest of that first part of the list there and it's idolatry.
[time=1391] We tend to see idolatry in other people, in other cultures, in other countries and other contexts really quick, don't we?
[time=1398] It's like, "Gosh, I can't believe they would do that," but we never see it in ourselves or in the mirror and how an American culture even being overseas many times, it's like, how do you minister?
[time=1408] I still remember in South Sudan last year.
[time=1412] I was asked one of the pastors asked, "How is it different for you to minister?" His English was broken but I got the question and I haven't forgotten it.
[time=1420] He said, "How do you minister as a pastor in such an idolizing place like America?"
[time=1427] He's never been here but he's seen the stories.
[time=1432] I thought it was interesting.
[time=1433] I asked him what he's seen and I mean he's just seen food and money and even sports and I mean you name it, we idolize so much and we can see it elsewhere but we miss it in our own hearts.
[time=1444] That's why I go back to that question of who is on the throne of your life and when we do these things and when this list becomes our focus and we're setting our mind on these earthly things and missing the eternal things, what we end up doing is we sacrifice our bodies.
[time=1457] Remember a living sacrifice Romans 12?
[time=1460] Well, this is the opposite.
[time=1461] We sacrifice our bodies on the altar of me.
[time=1464] Have you ever done that?
[time=1467] I know I have.
[time=1469] This is what Paul is warning us against.
[time=1470] Why does it matter?
[time=1471] Verse 6, "The wrath of God is coming." On account of these things, the wrath of God is coming.
[time=1478] God is holy.
[time=1480] God is so far above us.
[time=1481] He is perfect.
[time=1482] His holiness is not just an attribute of God, it is who God is.
[time=1487] It's a theme from Genesis to the end of Revelation.
[time=1490] He is so far above us and so there is an incompatibility between the holiness of God and the unholyness of us.
[time=1495] My righteousness, Isaiah reminds us, is as filthy rags, the righteousness of God and my self-righteousness, my unrighteousness.
[time=1502] The holiness of God and my unholyness, they're incompatible but God hated sin so much that
[time=1509] He sent forth Jesus Christ and because He sent forth His Son, He put sin to death.
[time=1514] He put death to death.
[time=1516] This is how we can have the new life today and on account of those things, God's wrath is coming.
[time=1522] There will be no coexistence of sin and God and His holiness in the kingdom of God.
[time=1527] They cannot and will not go together, so that means we're out.
[time=1534] Bad news.
[time=1535] Let's pray.
[time=1536] Just kidding.
[time=1537] That's not the end of the story.
[time=1538] But God, while we were yet sinners, God sent forth His Son.
[time=1542] He demonstrated His love towards us that He sent Jesus so that the earthly could be slaughtered and that we could be in relationship with a God that is so far above and so much more
[time=1553] holy than I could ever be on my own.
[time=1555] He gives to me imputed righteousness.
[time=1558] It means His His righteousness that He puts on me.
[time=1561] He who knew no sin became sin so that I could become the righteousness of God.
[time=1567] He took my place.
[time=1570] He took the wrath of God, the hatred of God towards sin so that I could be His Son and
[time=1576] His daughters could be represented in this room today.
[time=1580] I'm glad of that.
[time=1582] So Psalm 97 and verse 10, this is what it should mean for us as to those who love the
[time=1588] Lord, to hate evil.
[time=1590] I hate what God hates and I love what God loves and my heart breaks for that which breaks
[time=1597] the heart of God.
[time=1598] Third category and some of you came in struggling with this big time is historical.
[time=1603] Sexual, spiritual, verse 7, historical.
[time=1606] Even these you two once as past language, you once walked when you were living in them.
[time=1613] That's the old you.
[time=1614] Some of you are so tied up in what was that you're missing what God wants to do in your
[time=1620] future.
[time=1621] Did you know that that's so possible?
[time=1622] You can miss what could be because you're so tied up in what was or what is.
[time=1627] Write it down this way.
[time=1628] What was or what is can become the greatest barrier to what could be.
[time=1634] This could be your biggest brick in your backpack.
[time=1636] It's weighing you down because you're holding on to the past.
[time=1640] You're holding on to the old you.
[time=1642] You're feeling condemned.
[time=1643] You need to listen to last week's message again on that.
[time=1645] If you're living a condemnation based Christianity, it's a counterfeit to the real thing.
[time=1650] So don't miss what God is doing because you're a stuck in what was or in what is.
[time=1655] God is not done with you.
[time=1657] If there's breath in your lungs, God's ready to do something new in your heart today.
[time=1661] Do you believe it?
[time=1662] I believe it.
[time=1663] It's historical as a category.
[time=1665] Then verses 8 and 9, relational.
[time=1668] Relational is number four.
[time=1669] He continues.
[time=1670] But now you must put them all away.
[time=1673] All of them.
[time=1674] All the earthly.
[time=1675] What?
[time=1676] All the earthly stuff.
[time=1677] All the sin stuff.
[time=1678] All the death stuff.
[time=1679] And then these are relational things.
[time=1680] And you see a progression of anger that I'll walk you through.
[time=1681] This is going to be number 7 through 12 of that list.
[time=1685] So it was sexual immorality and then it was the impurity and then 3 through 6 that we looked
[time=1693] at under the spiritual category and then now 7 through 12.
[time=1696] Is this this?
[time=1697] Anger.
[time=1698] Wrath.
[time=1699] Malice.
[time=1700] Slender.
[time=1701] And obscene talk from your mouth.
[time=1702] Do not lie to one another.
[time=1704] That's the beginning of verse 9.
[time=1705] We'll pick up where we left off in a moment.
[time=1706] So go through this list.
[time=1707] But notice there's a progression of anger here.
[time=1709] Number 7 on this list of 12 things is anger.
[time=1712] This is an inward agitation.
[time=1714] The Bible says be angry and do not sin.
[time=1717] So anger is not bad.
[time=1718] Jesus had righteous anger.
[time=1720] I did a sermon here a while back.
[time=1722] What makes Jesus angry?
[time=1724] There were things that made Jesus angry, righteous anger, be angry and do not sin.
[time=1728] But it's an inward agitation that people can't see.
[time=1731] And then it progresses to wrath.
[time=1733] Number 8, an outward frustration.
[time=1736] Now people can see it.
[time=1738] It's like, I don't know what you're angry about, but we all know you're angry.
[time=1742] This is where it starts to bubble over and show up outside of what was contained to the
[time=1748] inside.
[time=1749] Then is malice.
[time=1751] Violence is doing something with that growing anger.
[time=1753] That inward agitation became an outward frustration.
[time=1757] And then now I'm going to do some intentional things about it.
[time=1760] And this is in an evil form.
[time=1761] Like I'm going to take it in my own hands.
[time=1763] And I'm going to, with an impure motive, do something about that which made me angry.
[time=1767] I'm going to hurt that person.
[time=1769] I'm going to say that thing back to them.
[time=1770] I'm going to write that nasty email.
[time=1772] I'm going to call them and fuss them out.
[time=1774] I'm going to do whatever.
[time=1776] You got the list, right?
[time=1777] You don't need help with that.
[time=1778] Because you've been in this part of the progression before.
[time=1780] And then, malice turns into slander.
[time=1783] Slander is now where you attack their character.
[time=1785] You attack their integrity.
[time=1787] You even lie if necessary.
[time=1788] We'll get there in a minute.
[time=1789] But you slander and you run down.
[time=1791] And now anger that was inward frustration became wrath that was outward agitation that everybody could see.
[time=1798] And then it turned into malice where you have evil intent to do something about it.
[time=1801] And now you are.
[time=1802] You're slandering and you're tearing other people down.
[time=1806] And then slander turns into obscene talk.
[time=1808] This is where bad language.
[time=1810] This is where gossip.
[time=1811] This is where spreading all of the previous stuff starts to happen.
[time=1814] Now it's becoming an obsession in your life.
[time=1817] And then it's lying.
[time=1818] Don't lie to one another out to perpetuate my earthly story, my earthly anger that turned into wrath and malice and slander and obscene talk.
[time=1828] Now I'm going to lie.
[time=1829] I'm going to even make up things that aren't true to further my point, to get my way to
[time=1836] be right.
[time=1837] Quiet.
[time=1842] We're quiet because it's real, isn't it?
[time=1844] This progression has happened to all of us.
[time=1846] And this, does it not describe our world right now politically, morally, socially, spiritually,
[time=1855] relationally, it describes everything I say.
[time=1858] If you don't believe me, go on social media.
[time=1860] You'll see this progression where a little comment turns into this and it grows into that.
[time=1865] So what would it look like for Christians to put off the earthly, to slaughter it, to put it to death.
[time=1872] Last category, number five is practical.
[time=1875] Sexual, spiritual, historical, relational, now practical.
[time=1878] In verse nine he says, seeing that you have put off the old self, that weight that you've
[time=1884] been carrying around with its practices, that means all the practical things that you do with it is now gone.
[time=1889] We go from listen being driven by our emotions.
[time=1892] That's the progression of anger.
[time=1893] This is that list of things that we just went through.
[time=1896] We're not driven by emotions anymore.
[time=1897] We're now driven by a new creation.
[time=1900] We're driven by a new nature.
[time=1901] We're driven by a new will that's not even our own will.
[time=1904] It's the will of God in our life because we're living sacrifices and we look at things differently than we ever have before.
[time=1911] Romans 6, 2, part of the verse says this question that I ask you now.
[time=1915] How can we who died to sin still live in it?
[time=1920] Some of your, if you're honest with yourself, you're going, well, just follow me around later today and you'll probably see the answer, right?
[time=1926] How could we still live in the sin that we've died too well because we're still in the earthly?
[time=1931] Right now, we're still in this flesh suit.
[time=1932] We're not yet glorified.
[time=1934] We're being sanctified, but we're growing.
[time=1936] Jesus meets us where we are, but he never leaves us there.
[time=1939] That means how I think about sin, how I think about the earthly is now forever changed, is now forever different.
[time=1945] I can't stand those things that God can't stand.
[time=1948] I hate the evil that God hates, and I only want to look like an embody the eternal things that God has made me to be because that is now my identity, which is number three.
[time=1958] Write that down.
[time=1959] Rest in your identity.
[time=1963] Versus 10 and 11.
[time=1965] Rest in your identity.
[time=1966] I'm going to read to you verses 10 and 11, give you some applications to take home with you.
[time=1972] This is a, you're ready for this?
[time=1973] This is a heavy sermon today is a heavy sermon because the earthly things we carry around in our good looking scripture filled backpacks are heavy, but I pray you can rest this week.
[time=1984] That's a weird point in the midst of a heavy sermon.
[time=1986] Well, let me show you why, verses 10 and 11, Paul says, after we've put off the old self of this practices, verse 10, and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in
[time=1997] knowledge after the image of its creator, says maturity, sanctification.
[time=2002] Here there is not Greek and Jew.
[time=2005] These are identity markers here, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave,
[time=2011] free, but Christ is all and in all.
[time=2015] He's consuming.
[time=2016] He takes over.
[time=2017] He's in charge.
[time=2018] He's seated at the right hand of God.
[time=2020] And these are identity markers that would be true in Paul's time.
[time=2023] And so we have a lot of those as well.
[time=2024] They may not look quite the same as that list, but there are so many identities that we define ourself by, but we have a new identity in Christ.
[time=2032] This is where Paul is leaving us next week.
[time=2034] We pick up in verse 12 and we talk about what do we add to the backpack.
[time=2037] What do we put on?
[time=2038] Now that we've put all this weight aside, Hebrews 12, and I'm thankful for that.
[time=2043] Our identity, listen, is not defined by our activity.
[time=2046] Do you know that?
[time=2047] Your activity doesn't define your identity.
[time=2050] Your activity comes because of your defining identity.
[time=2053] When you have an identity in Christ, it changes your behavior.
[time=2056] It changes your demonstration.
[time=2058] It changes your activity because you have a new identity.
[time=2061] And some action steps for you this week, three things I'll say to you.
[time=2065] Number one is rest, rest, rest.
[time=2069] Some of you have been striving and trying to make it about you and your own effort.
[time=2074] But because God has given you a new identity, I want you to rest in your identity this week.
[time=2078] God wants you to just rest in who you are to believe, listen, to stop believing the lies of the enemy that you're not good enough.
[time=2085] That's already been established.
[time=2087] You remind him of that.
[time=2088] I know, but that's why Jesus came, and because he came, I'm resting in his goodness, in his
[time=2094] righteousness.
[time=2095] I'm not good enough, but I am now, not because of me, but because of him, rest in your identity
[time=2101] this week.
[time=2102] The second one is rely.
[time=2103] Write that down.
[time=2104] Rely.
[time=2105] 2 things.
[time=2106] Rely on God.
[time=2107] Rely on that identity.
[time=2108] Rely on his strength.
[time=2109] It's not your activity that makes you holy as God's identity in you that changes your activity, it transforms you, you seek the eternal because you set your minds on the things that are above.
[time=2120] Rely on God and his strength.
[time=2121] Rely on the power of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2123] But here's a step that gets even harder than that.
[time=2125] That's all internal.
[time=2126] Nobody can see it.
[time=2127] Rely also on others.
[time=2131] Rely on God, but rely on others.
[time=2134] Maybe you've got an addiction, and nobody knows.
[time=2139] Maybe it's time for you to share your struggles.
[time=2144] That you've just held inside, and caged, and put off to the side, and hidden with a blanket, hidden with a towel, and nobody can see it, I'm going to keep it hidden.
[time=2153] We want you to find a life group.
[time=2155] Why do we talk about life groups all the time?
[time=2157] This is why.
[time=2158] Because we're created for community, we're wired for relationship, and we need each other.
[time=2163] Rest, rely on God, and on others.
[time=2166] Number three is relinquish, relinquish control.
[time=2169] The hardest part about unloading our backpack of the earthly is that it says, "God, you're in control, and I'm not." The earthly stuff are things that we typically can control.
[time=2179] We think we can, and then they end up controlling us, don't they?
[time=2183] They're deceptive.
[time=2184] But one of the hardest things you're going to find is you unload the backpack of the earthly things, and you set your mind on the things that are above, is that it requires me to say, "Jesus, you're on the throne, and I'm not." I relinquish control, all of them are control of my life to you.
[time=2200] Rest, rely, relinquish.
[time=2203] Maybe there's something you could take home from that in your life this week.
[time=2207] Don't ask me to buy your heads, and close your eyes, and just ponder, what does it mean to rest?
[time=2211] What does it mean to rely?
[time=2214] Today I want to give you a moment to just respond.
[time=2216] If you're a believer, what step can you take to rest, rely, and relinquish control in your life?
[time=2221] You're here today, and you're watching right now, and you would say, "Today I just don't know that I've trusted Jesus as my Savior." This is a beautiful progression for you as well.
[time=2230] Rest in the fact that Jesus came.
[time=2232] He died.
[time=2233] He lived a sinless life you couldn't live, because He lives.
[time=2236] You can now have eternal life.
[time=2238] You can rest in that fact today.
[time=2239] You're not good enough, but He was good enough on your behalf.
[time=2243] You can rely on Him for salvation, not your goodness, not your works, not your grandparents' faith, or not your knowledge of the Word of God, no, rely on Jesus and His sacrifice, and that's it for salvation.
[time=2254] And now relinquish control, and say, "Jesus, I give you me.
[time=2258] I give you my life.
[time=2259] I trust in you and you alone for salvation." If that's you right now, in this moment, we take a moment and just pray, ask God to forgive you and say, "He'll do just that." As believers are praying, let's respond.
[time=2277] [BLANK_AUDIO]
