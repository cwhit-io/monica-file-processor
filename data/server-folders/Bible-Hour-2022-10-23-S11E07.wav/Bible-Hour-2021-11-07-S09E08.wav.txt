[time=0] are currently in week 8. We're in week 8 of 12 of maturity university. And just a reminder
[time=8] that when we get to week 12, you don't graduate. You're not done. You will continue. And that's
[time=15] what we're going to focus on today is the reality that he's still working on me. And
[time=22] he's still working on you. Last week at the beginning of Colossians 3, Kevin, we reminded
[time=29] us to fix our minds on the things above, on the eternal. If we were to summarize last week's message in a single sentence, it could be something like this. In eternal, heavenly
[time=43] kingdom focused perspective is my foundation, is my foundation for putting to death. And
[time=51] that's the right phrase. If you remember, if you were here last week with us, Kevin used to phrase slaughter, right? That's the right phrase. Slaughter, put to death. It's my foundation
[time=65] for putting to death my old sinful and selfish ways. We were introduced at the end of last
[time=72] week's message to the next step from the putting off and the slaughtering and the killing
[time=78] of our old self to the putting on. And that's what we're going to talk about this tension
[time=84] today, as we are called to put on new things. And just putting off of the old and putting
[time=92] on the new is exactly where we're going to dig in today. But before we dig in, if you would join me in a word of prayer, a spirit of God, we sang some powerful lyrics this morning.
[time=107] I pray that as we sang, you can have my heart and I surrender all and the other lyrics that
[time=116] we did that they weren't lip service. God, even as we talk today, I pray that you spirit
[time=127] would stir and drive us to places that we can't go on our own. May you be glorified. Help
[time=137] me to be out of the way today, Father. And your word to come through my mouth. In Jesus' name, amen. So I've been blessed to call Black Hawk home for over three decades. And one
[time=148] of the things that I love about this place is that people show up with these, right?
[time=156] We show up with these. And I know I even saw somebody just leaning over to their friend and say, oh, mine's in my phone now. So that's the reality. That's okay. The fact that you
[time=165] show up and that we step in and Pastor Kevin says a phrase like, are you ready for the
[time=171] word today or we say open our Bibles, that we take that seriously. Because we believe that this is living in powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword, able to divide joints
[time=182] and moral. And we're going to talk about it today and judge the thoughts and intentions of your heart. That's why we believe this is important. So if you have, if you don't have a Bible of your own today and you're here with us, please go right straight out there to that information desk and we will get you one. We will give it to you. We believe
[time=202] in it so much that way. So as is our regular habit, please grab your Bible, your phone,
[time=208] your iPad, whatever you got. And join me in Colossians chapter three verse nine. Colossians
[time=217] chapter three verse nine is our bridge to this concept of maturing relationships and
[time=226] our relationship between God and our relationship with others. This vertical relationship that
[time=232] we have with God absolutely influences our relationship with others. So if you look at Colossians three, the end of verse nine, it says, seeing that you have put off the old
[time=243] self with its practices and have put on the new self, which here, I want you to catch this.
[time=250] If you underline anything ever in your Bible, please do this. This phrase right here is
[time=256] being renewed. It's very, very important. Is being renewed in knowledge after, after the
[time=266] image of its creator. Notice these are two halves. You have put off and you have put
[time=278] on. That is a transition that is something that is occurs when you say, I'm going to
[time=288] be a Christ follower. I'm in. You put off the old, you put on the new and that transition
[time=295] happens. If you haven't made that decision yet, you'll have that chance today. You'll
[time=302] have the chance today to stop and say, wait, that's not me. I don't understand this putting
[time=310] off. I don't get this putting on. Before we're done today, you'll have an opportunity to do that. Our first note in the outline is the core thought of what we're talking
[time=322] about today. As I put off, as I put off earthly, sinful things and put on the things of God,
[time=335] my new self is being renewed. And that's an ongoing process. It's an ongoing process.
[time=344] I love 2 Corinthians 5, 17 says, he that is in Christ. If you're not in Christ, doesn't
[time=351] apply. But he that is in Christ is a new creation. The oldest passed away. Behold, the new self
[time=358] has come. The new has come. That's what it means. We are being renewed. Last week at
[time=365] a very, very similar passage, Kevin took us to Romans 12 verses 1 and 2. So we're going
[time=373] to be jumping around a little bit today. So flipping those Bibles on your phone and get to Romans 12 verse 1 and 2. And we're going to read through that. It reads, "I appeal
[time=384] to you, therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God to present your bodies as living sacrifices,
[time=392] holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to
[time=399] this world." That's that old self stuff. It's the stuff that you have going on with
[time=406] inside of you. That it's just the world's trying to make you be more like the world than it
[time=413] is like Jesus. But here's another phrase that you need to underline. It says, "Be transformed
[time=422] by the renewal of your mind." That by testing, you may discern what is the will of God,
[time=429] what is good and acceptable and perfect. Again, as in chapter 3 of Colossians, here is the
[time=436] thought of not conforming or aligning to the sinful flesh garbage of this world, but being
[time=442] renewed and putting on a new mind. The word "transformed" here, I love it. I love how
[time=448] Paul says it. The word "transformed" here is a word that we would be familiar with.
[time=453] Even some of the youngers in the room would be familiar with the word "transformed" meaning metamorphosis. So when you think from creation of an example of metamorphosis, what do you
[time=467] think of? Let me hear you. Butterfly caterpillar frogs. Well, amazing. You guys are good. Somebody
[time=478] showed you my sermon notes. Look at that. The process of a butterfly. Metamorphosis. Miriam
[time=488] Webster defines these in formal terms, but catch this. It's a major change in the appearance
[time=495] or character. A major change in the appearance or character of someone or something. A secondary
[time=502] definition is a major change. Catch that. That's common across both in the form or structure
[time=508] of something that happens as it becomes an adult. It happens as it becomes an adult.
[time=520] The definition is beautiful, though, because transformed equals metamorphosis, but it's
[time=528] really the process of becoming what you already are. It's the process of becoming what you
[time=535] already are. I love 1 John 3. It says, "Behold, what manner of love the Father has." And
[time=542] I love the version that says, "Lavished on us." That we should be called. Say it loud.
[time=552] Children of God. That we should be called children of God. And behold, he says it with an exclamation point. Behold, that is what we are. We are. We are children of God. The
[time=565] reason that the world does not know us is that it did not know him. Behold, beloved,
[time=571] we are now children of God. Most people think of frogs and butterflies when they think of
[time=577] this metamorphosis and stuff, but it's extremely important to remember that a chrysalis becomes
[time=584] a form, become from a... excuse me, that a chrysalis doesn't become a tadpole or a frog,
[time=591] it becomes a butterfly. And a tadpole doesn't become a butterfly. It's the process of who
[time=599] you are. I learned this week actually in my study, the DNA of a butterfly never changes
[time=607] from the egg to the mature adult. The DNA stays the same. God's creation reflects the exact
[time=615] same thing that this is a whole cycle. I love the fact that Paul uses this imagery to portray
[time=624] the thought of transformation in the life of a Christ-following disciple, that you start somewhere and you continue and he does that. When we become the new creation, we are children
[time=636] of God, but we're not as much like Jesus as we will be. I think that's true for everybody
[time=643] in the room. You're not as much as you will be, but you are more than you were. That's
[time=653] the dynamic that he's calling us to, that we're being conformed to that image. We believe
[time=661] that our becoming is very much a process of becoming more like Jesus, that transformation.
[time=669] We have a thought process here that we define as the stages of spiritual growth. And some
[time=675] of you may recognize this from Kevin's series earlier in our time, it's several weeks ago.
[time=683] He used this in our thoughts about maturity. They are the five stages of spiritual growth,
[time=690] physical growth. It's similar, but it's not. It's spiritual growth. And I want to remind you, everybody here, that there is a spot and there's a reason that it's a headstone,
[time=702] a gravestone, because Ephesians says, Ephesians 2 says, "For you were once dead in your transgressions
[time=710] and sins, but you were made alive in Christ. Until you choose and make the choice to follow
[time=719] Jesus Christ, you are dead in your transgressions and sins." We believe that here. There's plenty
[time=725] of grace to get you moving, but the reality is, is there's a very clear line between moving
[time=733] from death to a newborn infant in Christ. Dead means dead, not aware of Christ in his
[time=741] mission. Having put off the old self, the old dead, and put in in your transgressions
[time=747] are gone, infancy happens, and we get this a great, great concept that we move from child
[time=754] to young adult to parenthood. But see, this is where one of these things kind of come
[time=760] into play. While this is an incredibly powerful illustration, we've gotten it from Kevin and
[time=766] I, and several of our team have been to be trained and focus on this biblical concept
[time=774] at a location out in Post Falls, Idaho, called real life ministries in Jim Putman and his
[time=781] ministry out there. But this illustration, the illustration of the butterfly is from
[time=788] the physical realm. And if you read at the bottom of this, this is where all illustrations break down, but this is the stages of spiritual growth, not physical growth, okay? It is reasonable
[time=802] that when my three-month-old new grandson, Cooper, gets to be three, he's going to be
[time=810] moving around different and more like his older brother than he does today. As a three-month old, three-month-old is you don't have much expectation of, but yet as an infant turns
[time=822] into a child, more expectation, responsibility, and obviously as we move up. Here's the thing.
[time=830] We have to understand that we're expected to continue to grow. And this is where the
[time=842] tension comes in. This is where the tension comes in. Real tension. When I made the choice
[time=851] to put off my old self, I don't perfectly do that. While I'm a child of God, I don't
[time=858] put on everything, every day, and throughout my life perfectly. Those that have been around
[time=864] here very long have heard me say often, I'm a blessed mess. I don't get life perfectly,
[time=872] but I'm blessed. I love what Paul says in Romans chapter 7, flip with me there, back
[time=880] to Romans 7. Paul, the guy that wrote two-thirds of the New Testament says in chapter 7, the
[time=889] good that I want to do, I don't. The bad that I don't want to do, I do. And he goes
[time=896] on to say that there is a war waging in my members. There's a war waging in my members
[time=904] between my thoughts and my flesh. He literally says it's a war. He goes on to refer to himself
[time=913] because of the war as a wretched man. He even says, "Who will rescue me from this body
[time=919] of death thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord." And he goes on in verse 1 of chapter
[time=926] 3, "There is now, therefore what?" Yeah, no condemnation for those of those that are
[time=932] in Christ. For the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set us free from the law
[time=939] of sin and death. The bottom line is that sinless perfection was not achieved when I
[time=948] decided to follow Jesus. It wasn't for Paul, it's not for me, and neither is it for you.
[time=956] Here's another way that I like to look at this, and it's really good. Jesus said in
[time=964] a simple one verse, Matthew 4, 19, "Follow me, come follow me, and I will make you." What?
[time=975] Man, you guys are good, fishers of men. I will make you fishers of men. We follow him,
[time=984] but he's the one that does the making. I will make you fishers of men. Choose consciously
[time=995] to follow Jesus, and the miracle of your new life begins to change you. It will change
[time=1001] your heart, and then we are going to change to do that. We believe this. We believe that
[time=1007] Jesus changes us. He aligns our head so that we can follow. He aligns our heart so that
[time=1015] we can be made new and changed, and then he aligns us with our tangible doing to go be
[time=1021] missionaries on mission, on mission. This is why we've made it our mission, you've
[time=1027] heard Kevin say it, to send 1,500 to train and send 1,500 ambassadors, disciples that
[time=1036] are committed to build relationships with people that are close to you but far from God. People
[time=1045] that are close to you but far from God. And guess what? Everybody in the room has that.
[time=1052] Everybody in the room has that. My son, Zach, has a platform with some construction guys
[time=1063] local 166 as a plumber and pipe fitter. Sometimes those guys are hard to be with. But he reaches
[time=1073] people and has conversations that his dad will never have and Kevin Rivers will never have. Mr. Evan Wood gets the privilege to go talk to people about HR and do things and
[time=1086] he'll touch people and engage people and tell a life story that Rick Raber, that Chris Bader
[time=1095] will never talk to. You have a sphere of influence where you have people in your life that are
[time=1104] close to you but far from their Heavenly Father, from their Creator. See, here's the thing.
[time=1113] This is a progressive spot of spiritual growth. And where it breaks down is, like my grandson,
[time=1120] God willing will continue to grow in that nurture and stature and size and grow up to
[time=1127] be an adult. The problem is in the church, we have way too many people that assume that
[time=1134] this just naturally happens. Parenthood, by definition, means that you have reproduced.
[time=1141] Yet over 90% of the people that have attended church or attend church will never make another
[time=1150] disciple. They'll never lead another person to Christ. They will never intentionally build
[time=1157] a relationship with somebody for the explicit purpose of moving them through this process
[time=1165] so that they move from death to life. See, that's the difference between the physical
[time=1172] realm and the spiritual realm. You can get stuck. You can get stuck in the infancy stage
[time=1180] and in the same way that it's ridiculous that if I would stand up here and rather than have a bottle like this that I can drink out of, that I would have my grandsons sucking on
[time=1194] a bottle. It's absurd. It should be the same way in our life. We have to wage the war.
[time=1208] If you don't wage the war, you will become a casualty. You have to fight. But your ability
[time=1216] to even fight is a gift from God. I love 1 Corinthians 3, 6, and 7. It says, "I planted
[time=1223] a potless water, but God gives the growth." He goes on to say, "So neither he who plants,
[time=1230] nor he who waters is anything, but only God gives growth." Another spot in the outline
[time=1238] is any ability to change, any ability to change has its roots in my identity in Christ, not
[time=1247] my own strength. I can tell you, I know what the fruit of Rick looks like produced in my
[time=1255] own strength. And so do you. It's not pretty. The butterfly doesn't have to stress or strain
[time=1265] to make it through the cycle. It happens. He does it. At the same time we are becoming,
[time=1274] we are called to put into practice the things in this passage. Follow me, then I will make
[time=1280] you, and the change is a supernaturally powered thing. Philippians 1, 6, Philippians 1, 6 says,
[time=1292] "He who began a good work in me will be faithful, faithful to complete it in the end." Next
[time=1306] point there is we choose to follow Christ, and God does the convicting and changing.
[time=1313] Again, the putting off and the putting on, these are reserved for those that are even
[time=1319] aware, that are even aware that there is something to be put off, just even that awareness, that
[time=1328] awareness, to know that there is something that needs to be put off in your life is a gift from God in a conviction and the Holy Spirit. I want to remind you of this. There
[time=1342] are those in your life that are far from God, and they don't know what they don't know.
[time=1351] I'll give you this. Don't expect redeemed behavior from unredeemed people. You have
[time=1359] people in your life that don't know Jesus. Don't expect them to act like they do. Live
[time=1366] a grace-filled life that's intentional in building a relationship in a way that moves
[time=1372] them from death to life. The problem is, is we all too often are stuck, and we think.
[time=1384] Can I just, I just want to remind you of something. If you have the Spirit of God today, you know
[time=1390] how hard it is. You know how hard it is yourself with the Spirit of God in your life to put
[time=1398] off and put on. It's absolutely ridiculous to think that somebody that doesn't have the Spirit of God is going to do that. Ridiculous. So don't expect them to lead them to a place
[time=1411] that then, hey, while it's not, it's not realistic. Don't expect redeemed behavior from unredeemed
[time=1419] people. It's absolutely reasonable to think that those that name the name of Christ will
[time=1427] act like they do. That's the putting on. If you say you love Jesus, act like it. So
[time=1437] as we move back to chapter 3 in Colossians, I believe Paul's done a great job of these
[time=1445] two things, giving us a perfect example, a very realistic example of real life discipleship,
[time=1453] of real life being conformed to the image yourself and being conformed new in the new
[time=1461] self. Our new self is being renewed in the knowledge after the image of its creator.
[time=1470] It's already happened but it's also continuing to happen.
[time=1476] Let's look at verses 12 and 13 of chapter 3 of Colossians. We're going to read those.
[time=1482] Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, compassionate
[time=1490] hearts, kindness, humility, meet this in patience. If anyone has a complaint, bearing with one
[time=1498] another and if anyone has a complaint against another, forgiving each other as the Lord has forgiven you, so also must you forgive. Catch the qualifier. The qualifier and foundation
[time=1512] for putting on is as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved.
[time=1522] We are, as we said from 1 John, children of God, it's the basis. Being chosen, holy
[time=1532] and loved is the foundation that drives us towards putting on. It is not the other way
[time=1538] around. You don't go through putting on kindness and compassion and all those kinds of things and by doing them all of a sudden become holy. That's called work salvation. We don't believe that. You don't have the ability to do that if you don't know that. The spirit God does
[time=1555] that. We are, we are chosen. We are God's chosen, excuse me, next bullet point. We are
[time=1563] God's chosen, holy and beloved, because we have identified with Christ. We have chosen to follow Him. Therefore, we are commanded to put on these things. It's a command. In
[time=1575] God's creation, there is a paradigm, a model, going all the way back to the book of Genesis.
[time=1582] And it's called reproduced according to its kind. Okay? You can't even, there's certain
[time=1590] spots where you even try to crossbreed and the ability to reproduce stops. It's really
[time=1598] important for us to understand tadpoles become frogs, cocoons become butterflies. Those that
[time=1607] are in Christ become mature Christ followers. I love from back when we went through the
[time=1614] study of 1 John. We memorized as a church, 1 John 2 6. 1 John 2 6, I see a bunch of
[time=1620] people going, hmm, hmm. Let's see if we can try to, I'll help jog your memory. Those who
[time=1629] say they live in God should live their lives as Jesus did. Kevin, remind us a few weeks
[time=1640] ago, as part of this series, that fruit matches the root system. Fruit matches the root system.
[time=1650] Being rooted in God produces fruit that is evident and impacts my relationship with other people.
[time=1656] And yes, if you were wondering, I do have a backpack and I'm going to pull out a few
[time=1662] things that help us represent what this is about and what we're dealing with. The first
[time=1669] is a workbook and yes, it has a little dirt on it on purpose because you know why? Sometimes
[time=1680] you have to get dirty. Sometimes you got to get down and get dirty and get at it. I bring
[time=1688] a couple other things here. I'll do this a little better, get it back here like this,
[time=1697] keep my apple, right? Banana. You can't get this off of this tree, right? We laugh.
[time=1720] You can't get fruit of the spirit without being connected to the Jesus tree. You can't even
[time=1729] go get this. Well, you can in some parts of the country, but you certainly can't get this here in Indiana. You don't get them off the same tree. The fruit matches the root.
[time=1745] But you can't read this passage that we're in and thinking it's only about you. I want
[time=1751] you to just quick glance down through verses 13 through 16 and look at the number of times
[time=1757] the word other or one another is used. Multiple. This isn't about you. This putting off is
[time=1767] about you and God, but the putting on and the way that you move is about you and your relationship with others. There are actual traits and virtues that are listed. Look at
[time=1778] them. Compassionate hearts. Compassionate hearts. Kindness. Compassion. I love how the
[time=1786] Old King James even says that you were moved in your bowels of compassion. Compassion has
[time=1796] it's core. Feeling for other people. Feeling for other people. Being moved within your
[time=1805] gut for the way that somebody else's situation is. I'm sorry. God just made this really real
[time=1819] this week. Of what it means to have compassion in your heart for where a person's at. Even
[time=1840] doing their choices are wrong. What that looks like. Kindness. Kindness. All of these, this
[time=1850] whole list is other centered. Absolutely other centered. Kindness. Humility. God says he opposes
[time=1858] the proud, but give grace to the humble. Meekness. Meekness does not mean doormat. It does
[time=1870] not mean doormat. Often that concept is actually the picture of a bridle on a steed or a horse.
[time=1881] Or under control. That's meekness. You're choosing to put yourself in that spot. Patience. Patience.
[time=1892] For years I've asked people so what's God trying to teach you? Years. Overwhelmingly. Well
[time=1899] over 90 percent of the time. The answer is patience. We stink at patience. We want God to move faster. We want him to give things that we want. We want him to change people.
[time=1909] We want patience. It's important with others. Bearing with one another. And if anyone has
[time=1920] a complaint against another person. Interesting. This is not the picture of bearing. Where
[time=1930] I go pick up something because somebody can't. This is a picture of bearing with somebody
[time=1936] where they're at. And having that concept of being able to prefer them. To be able to
[time=1946] give preference to them. To bear with where they're at. I will tell you those in the room
[time=1955] that have been married very long. Understand what it means to bear with your spouse and need to be bear with. My wife does it regularly on my behalf. While everybody would say there's
[time=1970] no way after 31 years that there would be any surprises. That Diane is never surprised at Rick. There's nothing new. She still has to bear with the chucklehead that I am sometimes.
[time=1984] I know by the way, I need to. Yeah, it's a great thing. But here's the thing. It says
[time=1996] if anyone has a complaint against another, whether it's a complaint, a fault or even blaming another person, the result is the same. The court goes to. It goes immediately
[time=2006] to forgiveness. Forgiveness and it's a qualified forgiveness. As the Lord has forgiven you.
[time=2019] Just remind yourself. Remind yourself of how the Lord's forgiven you. Actually, I'd love
[time=2026] to hear a couple words. What are a couple of the words that the way that God's forgiven us? Completely. What else? Unapologetically, unconditionally. Loving. New you right where
[time=2046] you're at. Romans 5, 8, while we were yet sinners. Christ died for us. Very seldom do
[time=2055] what people die for the godly, but for the ungodly. What? But here's the thing. We get
[time=2063] to these spots where we get stuck. We get stuck on something like forgiveness. And you've
[time=2072] been hurt. Somebody's been mean. Somebody's had a complaint or blamed you. And you called
[time=2081] to forgive. And all of a sudden, instead of slaughtering, putting off killing, thinking
[time=2092] or whatever you want to do, we kind of just give it a hard left and maybe give it a punch
[time=2099] that knocks it down. And we forget it. We kind of leave it over there. But then all of a sudden, life comes and stuff happens. And you end up with a spot that that thing
[time=2111] hasn't been put to death and you haven't dealt with it. And now all of a sudden, that
[time=2117] which Christ has put to death, you walk over and you start doing CPR and resuscitating that
[time=2125] which God has put to death. That's not how it's supposed to work. When we fail to deal
[time=2132] with the things of our past, when we fail to deal with the change that God has called
[time=2138] us to put on, we get stuck. You get stuck. I get stuck. When we don't respond to the
[time=2149] spirit's presence in our life saying, Rick, don't go there. Rick, don't do that. Sometimes
[time=2159] you have to get out the two by four and say, Rick, don't do that. Some of you are laughing.
[time=2166] You've had that two by four. I have one more to pull out. I'm a grandpa. I'm a grandpa
[time=2176] of two and a half. That means two are here and a halfway more than half doing January
[time=2184] on grandpa's birthday clothes. What is this? A onesie. A onesie. I don't know when the
[time=2193] last time you changed a one year old, a nine month old, but as soon as you get that thing
[time=2202] off of them, whoa, they're all free and they want to do that they could care less to have
[time=2209] that thing put back on, right? See, I would submit to you, we got to make sure that we're
[time=2220] not stuck in an infant stage that's pushing back, that's trying as much to undress and
[time=2228] keep it off as the spirit is trying to put it on. That's why we, in the come following
[time=2235] phrases, that's why it's so important that you use and you understand that you participate
[time=2241] in the process. You participate in the process. Verse 14, verse 14, above all these put on
[time=2252] love, put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony, unconditional
[time=2259] love. We're told to put it on. Surround these with agape, unconditional love. Outline,
[time=2270] love is the bonding agent that produces balance in all these traits. You may be doing well
[time=2277] in kindness and humility, but when the spirit of God says, "Rick, what about compassion?"
[time=2288] All of a sudden, I have something to deal with. If I continually ignore the spirit's prompting
[time=2294] for the change and action that He's convicted me towards, I get stuck.
[time=2302] Proverbs 28, 13, we even said this. We sang this this morning, this principle. Whoever
[time=2308] conceals His sin, helped me to, God revealed to me the things that are hidden. Whoever conceals
[time=2317] His sin will not prosper, but He who confesses and forsakes will find mercy. We're being
[time=2329] renewed. You are being renewed. After the image of the Creator, He wants to produce
[time=2336] Jesus' fruit in you. Is there not a harmony in any of your relationships? It's interesting
[time=2347] that agape love is produced by peace in the next verse. Verse 15, "Let the peace of Christ
[time=2355] rule in your hearts." It says, "Let." Catch that? Let. You have to let the proverbial
[time=2365] peace be put on. Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts to which indeed you were called.
[time=2371] Please note that the word lets us in our English way understand that we have to participate
[time=2377] and allow peace to take that place. Two inner peace is from God. If there's not a connection
[time=2384] to God, there will not be sustained peace in your life. Some of you have seen this next thing that comes up on this screen. If you have no God in your life, you will have no peace in long term. You will have no peace. If you know God, then you can no peace. They're
[time=2403] very, very much tied to each other. So this week, Kevin eluded to it last week, but his
[time=2410] Atlanta Braves won the World Series. And so we're going to talk briefly about this concept
[time=2417] of what the word rule really means. The word rule in that verse actually means umpire,
[time=2424] literally. Let the peace of Christ be the umpire in your life. If what comes through
[time=2434] your strike zone doesn't produce peace, run the other way. Let me say it a different way.
[time=2441] If what's going on in your life produces more fear and anxiety, then it does produce peace.
[time=2449] Be looking for why. What does that mean? Love produces unity, peace. In verse 15, provides
[time=2459] parameters and guidance. Guidance. Outline, the body of Christ is called to be unified
[time=2467] and ruled by peace. Verse, end of verse 15 and verse 16. And be thankful. And be thankful.
[time=2476] Let the word, again, there's that let, there's that let, let the word of Christ dwell in you richly teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing songs, hymns and spiritual
[time=2487] songs with thankfulness. It's nested with two reminders. End of verse 15, end of verse
[time=2495] 16. Thankfulness. I want to give you a challenge here. Peace and the word of Christ. It might
[time=2507] be a different way for us to emphasize it, but I believe it's very appropriate for our world today. Don't let all the media-driven messages be your source of interaction with
[time=2517] others. The word of Christ should reside deep within you. Remind each other with wisdom
[time=2524] that the things of this world don't hold a candle to the worship and truth to be completed
[time=2530] together. When we do that, follow the thankfulness thread. It's nested right in there in the
[time=2544] middle of all of it. Thankfulness, gratitude. We are ridiculously blessed culture people,
[time=2551] ridiculously blessed. Thankfulness is intentional, but it starts with letting the word of Christ
[time=2562] reside. Let the word of Christ reside. Take place, resident, dwell. It goes on to say,
[time=2570] teaching and admonishing and singing hymns, spiritual songs with thankfulness. That admonishing,
[time=2577] it's a Greek word, new thought. It means sometimes it's the path, admonishing, but there's a component
[time=2585] of it that says, get going. It doesn't always mean chastising correction, but it's both.
[time=2593] We all love the path on the back. Let's go. Let's do them. Often we don't like the call up that says, hey, let's keep moving. I learned some great things this week about Psalms,
[time=2604] and spiritual songs. It's literally, Psalm is literally, it's a striking of strings. Striking
[time=2612] of strings usually thought to mean music put to scripture. Hymns used, it's only used twice.
[time=2622] This word's only used twice and once in this section. Praising the Trium God manifested
[time=2628] in the flesh of Jesus Christ, the God man. It is the reminder of who God is. Spiritual
[time=2637] songs. These are the ones that I typically go towards. Spontaneous impromptu melodies
[time=2644] of praise, not merely sung about God, but to God from a spirit filled heart. That usually
[time=2653] happens for me in the car, out of tune, not like the bunch that we have up here. In verse
[time=2661] 17, whatever you do in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks
[time=2669] to God the Father through Him. That's the nesting of the whole chapter. The first couple
[time=2675] verses set your mind on things above, eternity, where Christ is seated at the right hand.
[time=2686] This section ends like the chapter started. Everything, everything is for Jesus Christ
[time=2694] and for the kingdom. So as we wrap up, I would ask you to consider whether or not you're
[time=2701] even aware of the war. Are you participating? Are you fighting? Are you aware of that which
[time=2709] you need to put off? I'd like to go back to the graphic of spiritual growth. See, we believe
[time=2725] and teach that everybody in this room is on that chart. You have to ask yourself if
[time=2736] I'm not a spiritual parent that is actively intentionally pouring into the disciple-producing
[time=2742] process, well then what stage am I at? There. And if that's the case, what would keep me
[time=2751] moving? Bow your heads with me, please.
[time=2759] For those of you that are in the room and have said I've moved from death to life, I've
[time=2767] chosen Jesus and I want to follow Him and I've tried to do that, but Rick, I'm not. I'm
[time=2776] not where God has prompted me to be today. If the Spirit of God is saying that to you today, believers, challenged to keep moving and growing that He's not done with you yet,
[time=2789] would you raise your hand? Just show me what that looks like. Thank you. Thank you.
[time=2798] Some of you have never made the choice to follow Jesus so that you can begin this changing
[time=2804] and putting off and have Him make you into the person that you call to be. God is working
[time=2817] in your life right now to make you aware of that and it's a gift from Him. Just take
[time=2824] a minute and say, "God, please help me move into a new life in you, Jesus. Help me become
[time=2833] something that you can make me." If that's you that today you've chosen to say, "God,
[time=2846] I'm in. I want to move. I want to become something that I'm not." Would you just slip your hand in the air and show me? Let me know that you've made the chosen to do that.
[time=2856] Put your hand up high. Praise God that we have a living and active Heavenly Father that
[time=2865] convicts us towards righteousness and judgment. God, we thank you for the privilege that we
[time=2873] have that the Word of God is alive and powerful. Please help us all to keep moving and God,
[time=2882] please help us to be disciples who make disciples. Meet us where we're at but don't leave us
[time=2888] there. We ask this in the powerful name of Jesus Christ.
