[time=0] We're making all the rest of us guys look bad who can't sing to our wives like that.
[time=7] But why a song like that on a day like today came to church and some of you are married,
[time=13] some of you are not.
[time=14] Don't worry, I'm going to speak to everybody here today.
[time=15] But if you are, God sent you here for a specific reason to hear a song about love and a lot
[time=21] of times in today's culture we sexualize and make out of marriage something that is totally
[time=27] different than what God intended so today we're going to get to the roots of what God has for marriage.
[time=32] We're in a series of messages called maturity university and we're looking at what it means to be mature in Christ and we're talking about bringing our backpack with us every week because we all have something to learn so I got some goodies in mind here today and I don't know where you're at but I believe God's got a very special word for you and listen if you're not married obviously if you're married today get ready steal toe boots, some toe stepping from the Lord, no it's going to be something that God's going to encourage your heart and help you in your life but if you're not maybe you're divorced, you're single, you've lost a spouse, there are a long list, there's a long list of differences that we bring to
[time=70] this discussion but there's something that we all have in common and I want us to start with that today and that's something that we have in common is that as the church if you call yourself a believer, a follower of Jesus Christ then we are the bride of Christ
[time=84] and marriage is God's institution that is pictured in our relationships here on earth but it points us to this eternal relationship that we have with God because of Jesus Christ,
[time=95] we are the bride of Christ, he is the bridegroom and this picture of marriage is ultimately going to be seen when we get to be together with him forever in all of eternity and not only is that going to be helpful to you, it'll number two help you no matter where you're at just with relationship principles because raise your hand if you have a relationship, anybody have one of those, okay, just check it, that means we all have common ground, you're going to be helped in that today but even bigger than that, we live in a world today that is taking what God designed to be one of the most beautiful pictures of our relationship with him and is deconstructing and tearing it apart and so us collectively as the bride of Christ representing, knowing and living out in our relationships, whatever
[time=134] that may mean, this picture of marriage between us and him that then spreads out into all of our relationships is one of the greatest witnesses for the gospel of Jesus Christ that we could have today, with that said, we're all in this together, let's strap our backpacks on and today I want to talk to you about mature marriage Colossians chapter 3, we are going to be in verses 18 and 19 just two verses today because marriage, well we need to slow down a little bit and we need to focus on it just a little bit and so today as we do that I'm going to start with something that represents, well I've held onto this for years, I can't even remember where I read it but it's just an amazing picture, a kind of funny picture of how communication, relationships, much like a plant, how many of you have a green thumb,
[time=178] anybody got a green thumb and you just like, yeah you'd like plants, how many of you are the opposite, everything that you touch dies right, when it comes to plants and the thing is with plants, if you don't nurture and love and water and tend to and care for them they naturally die and decline, communication and relationships are the same way, did you know that and I want to give you as an illustration of that, the five stages of a married cold,
[time=202] when someone gets a cold and gets ill in a marriage, it usually starts something like this, the first year it goes something like, oh baby I'm so worried about that little sniffle so I'm taking you to the hospital, in fact I'm going to get somebody to drive you to the hospital and you know you hate hospital food so I'm getting your favorite food brought in as we get you there to get cared for and everybody said, oh and then the next year, second year it maybe goes something like this, sweetheart I really don't like the sound of that cough so I've arranged for the doctor to make a house call, let me tuck you in, we're still doing good, third year though we say something like, hmm you look
[time=237] like you got a fever, so here's what we're going to do, you drive yourself to the CVS,
[time=245] get yourself some medicine and I'll watch the kids while you do that, fourth year, hey look let's be sensible, after you've gotten the kids all taken care of and put to bed, you look rough, you really need to go to bed, y'all, something y'all that aren't laughing is because you said that last night, right, fifth year for Pete's sake, do you have to
[time=264] cough so loud, I can't even hear my television show, you sound like a barking dog wouldn't
[time=270] you go in the next room, one guy said, you know in the first year of marriage my wife would bring me my slippers and the dog would come barking, now my dog brings me my slippers
[time=281] and the rest of you will get the end of that later, and it's not good, don't use it at
[time=288] lunch, but you get the point, without some loving care and nurturing and kindness, communication and relationships go downhill, say them in if you agree, and so we want to be mature, we're in maturity university, we're going to class to learn how we can take steps to further our marriages and our relationships, here's the bottom line of what this illustration points to, and it's simply this, write this down, that God's plan for maturity is all about progression, not perfection, one day we'll have perfection, it's called glorification,
[time=319] it's when we graduate, it was so right, we don't graduate here, some of us think we've arrived, that's why we've done this series, let's strap on our backpack and realize we got something still yet to learn, one day we'll graduate and that an only win we're with Jesus in perfection, but he's planned for sanctification, that happens because of justification and he's like we're all these Asians, justification is Jesus came and we're justified, it's justified never sin because Jesus became my sacrifice and I've been given his righteousness and because
[time=348] of that relationship, now I'm being sanctified, I'm being made into the image of God, I'm being matured into his image, that's a progression, that is a process and so God's plan for maturity
[time=359] and certainly for marriage is all about progression, not perfection, and in culture I think we can probably agree, if you watch the news, look at social media or if you just are breathing and can hear or see or anything of the light, you realize that the progression of culture is not going so well, not if you agree, and so I want to challenge this and God's word
[time=380] is going to challenge us today is to have a progression that's going the right way but that starts with a few foundations for marriage that you maybe you would think back in the day you don't have to define these but I do, I want to define these very clearly because everything Paul is writing about his own these foundations, write these down, three foundations of marriage, number one is define marriage God's way, we live in an age that's not just
[time=403] redefining marriage but it's demeaning marriage and making light of marriage and the word of God is very clear that marriage is God's institution and it is between a one man and
[time=415] one woman and so we've got to define marriage God's way, we believe that, we hold to that
[time=421] because it was God's idea, it'd be like us saying well hey I know you created that but I'm going to make it my own and change everything about it and you know what, you may think you have a better way but this is universe and it's God's way, sometimes J. Vernon McGee will always say you may think you have a better way but you don't have a universe, God's universe is
[time=440] among us, he is sovereign, he is on the throne, it's his way that we want to do things and so I thank God for what marriage looks like as a picture of our relationship with him, so define marriage God's way, number two structure marriage God's way and I love talking about this and here's why because many of you are listening are here right now and the submit verse, yes I'm talking about submit, what does that mean? Some of you said that's why I don't go to church or that's why I'm not doing faith because you've seen people mystifying, misrepresent this and so I'm looking forward to talking about so don't tune out just yeah you might be surprised but number two structure marriage God's way, here's how I would tell you as a biblical way of structuring marriage is plural leadership with singular headship, plural leadership with singular headship,
[time=485] let me illustrate that, the Trinity, we believe that God has made himself known and revealed himself to us in the form of three persons, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, this is plural leadership is plurality, everybody say that five times, plurality in how God has revealed
[time=502] himself to us but the Father is the head, he's the only one who knows the time he's sending the Son, that's clear all the way from creation all the way to now there's plural leadership but singular headship, the same is true in church governance, there is plurality of elders and pastors
[time=517] but there is a singular headship and it ain't me as a senior pastor, it's Jesus Christ, Jesus said I will build my church and the gates of hell won't prevail against it, it's plural leadership
[time=528] with singular headship, Jesus is the head of his church and in marriage the prescription that we're going to define before you fill in your blanks of how maybe you've seen it define is plural leadership between a husband and a wife but singular headship, God has called you men to be the head of your household but that doesn't mean maybe what you were taught it means so we're going to define that clearly today so that is number two, number three, write this down is view marriage as a covenant before God not a contract with a person because when we bring
[time=561] contractual views to a covenantal relationship it only breeds problems when you do that it ends
[time=568] up looking something like this you become simply parenting partners or you become business partners
[time=574] or transportation specialists you become roommates or you become sexual satisfiers but not the true
[time=582] relationship the true marriage that God has intended for you so here's my goal today is that we go
[time=589] beyond that and in my backpack I've got a picture of that because the truth is if we're honest marriage often becomes a boxing match some of you that didn't laugh or like yeah we had those on
[time=604] on the way to church this morning and then we put on our church smile right when we walked in so nobody'd know we were having the fight why is it so quiet this is often what marriage turns into
[time=618] just a boxing match hit after hit you just take it you just take it and you finally have enough and then you put your glove on and you throw a punch back and some my goal I'm gonna put these right here because this is you and they're gonna be facing each other you're on the table this is
[time=634] you you're on the table today God's ready to do something to you my goal is to get us from boxing gloves to the heart emoji yeah there you go there you go that's my goal today is to get us from the
[time=649] boxing gloves to the heart emoji today so if you're ready for that let's dig into God's word you're
[time=655] ready for God's word today church Colossians chapter 3 I'm gonna reverse 17 then we'll hop to verse 18
[time=661] Rick did an awesome job with this verse but this verse applies to marriage verse 17 where we left off is whatever you do in word or D do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God
[time=672] the Father through him that's a great marriage verse it's a good verse for life it's a good verse for relationships so let's apply it now is what Paul is doing is he writes to the church at Colossi to marriage to that institution of marriage to the household next week we're gonna look at parenting
[time=686] and influence both in authority and under authority and parenting and in work relationships we'll do that next week but for now let's reverse is 18 and 19 verse 18 wives submit to your husbands as is
[time=697] fitting to the Lord husbands love your wives and do not be harsh with them may God just bless the
[time=705] reading of his word may we live it out in our lives and marriages and relationships and so let's break that apart and before we do it's interesting because our culture today reads the first verse wives submit to your husbands as is fitting to the Lord we often in our culture we see that that's the tension verse for us that's the one that that causes problems that's the one that is so offensive in today's culture but it's interesting in Paul's culture when Paul wrote this from house arrest in Rome to the church at Colossi the second verse was actually the one that would have been offensive the first verse they would have said well of course wives submit to your husbands you don't have another choice because he can divorce you by just saying it three times if she looks at him the wrong way women had no legal rights i mean they were like property of the husband so the first verse it was totally not offensive it was kind of like duh yeah we get that it was the second verse that men would have taken huge offense to because they would say oh so now
[time=758] your god this Jesus that you're talking about is now telling me what to do with my property and we all squirm at that and it's interesting and i'm glad that we do and Jesus is glad that we do
[time=769] because listen think about this it is the word of god that has over centuries changed this posture
[time=776] it is the word of god it's the influence of the gospel that changed the position of women even
[time=782] in the Roman world that is led to where we are today and then of course we take what Jesus changed and what Jesus built and we mess it all up again can i get an amen because that's what we do that's history you're like no i ain't amen and i did it right they're the ones that did it wrong right and that's what we do over and over is to cycle throughout history but man i did some more study on households back in this time period women had no legal rights and men would often even live in the upper quarters in the on the roof this may be what David in such trouble the rooftop gazing that he was doing whatever there but they would live men would have an upper quarters room upstairs and the women and children would often live downstairs so literally physically they would be beneath their feet they had no legal rights they were much like property during this era and
[time=827] that's why that second verse would be so offensive but ladies aren't you glad you know Jesus
[time=833] women that are in the room and listening today and those who are marginalized listen no one has done more for women or from people who are marginalized in Jesus Christ i just love that about Jesus
[time=845] because he comes and he says hey there's no male and female no Greek and Jew we're all one in Jesus
[time=852] we'll have equal value in Jesus Jesus is the one who made that possible i'm so thankful that Jesus
[time=859] instituted things that we could not so let's go to those verses now as as we just read them and break them apart let's look at the first verse again Colossians 3 18 wives submit to your husbands as is fitting to in the lord i'm going to do two things with each verse and here's those two things
[time=875] first i'm going to tell you what the verse does not mean because a lot of times we got to unlearn if we're going to go to maturity university we got to unlearn more than we got to learn so i'm going to share with you what it does not mean then i'm going to share with you what it does mean first of all what does this verse not mean uh to ladies and to both of us there's plenty of applications here then i'm going to give you some application answers to a pertinent question that we all need to answer it does not mean first of all that men are superior to or better than women i've often even counseled with couples and they're almost can get to this relationship where
[time=907] there is the husband that's almost viewed as the mediator between the wife and god and i want you to know that the ground is very level at the foot of the cross and i don't care who you are what your background is what your gender is today listen you have as a child of god if you've
[time=923] trusted in jesus is your savior you have a direct line of communication with god god has a personal relationship with us aren't you glad of that i'm so glad that we serve that kind of a god it also
[time=934] does not mean that the wife is less valuable competent or integral in a marriage than the husband and
[time=941] so a lot of times it gets misapplied in that way it does not mean that wives are to obey the husband
[time=947] the next couple of verses it says children obey your parents it's a different word so that begs the question then what does it mean to submit submit means to arrange under under a plan that
[time=957] was predetermined in this case god had the plan marriage was his institution and to arrange under and so it is an order it is a plural leadership singular headship and that's what i want us to
[time=968] define and you say well how do we define it i'm glad you asked we're going to be digging to that just a second a couple more things it's not it does not mean that women in general submit to men in general i have two daughters and there are men in this world i would there's no way i would say you just be submissive to those men over there can i get an amen dad's out there it's this is the context of biblical godly marriage now the bible speaks very directly and clearly to things like
[time=993] church governance it speaks very clearly to things like workplace relationships in fact some of that we're even going to hit next week but this is about biblical marriage that is mutually
[time=1004] entered into as a covenant before god to be done and to be defined god's way structured god's way
[time=1010] viewed as a covenant before god and not just a contract with another person so with that said last thing it's not something that's forced it is a mutually agreed upon entered into as a covenant
[time=1021] before god kind of relationship and a lot of times husbands we use it to our advantage and i'm just going to tell you if you have to quote this verse to your wife or you think you're supposed to quote this verse to your wife you're doing it wrong i'm just going to go on and tell you that i was playing that in a minute don't worry i am a husband so i'm going to hit us pretty hard guys so get ready uh but it's time it's time so let's dig into what it does mean now that's what it does not mean this verse does mean that ladies how you treat your husband how you respect your
[time=1049] husband sets a precedent if you have kids for how your kids or for those that you influence how they're going to treat both you uh and other people who are in authority and other people in general and so you're a model you're an example of that as our husbands this goes both ways many of these principles but when it comes to submission arranging yourself under we'll define that more deeply as we look at Ephesians 5 here in just a second it's in the lord as it's fitting say it with me three words in the lord i've often had times with counseling where someone would say hey my husband i'm he's saying i need to submit and this is the decision and it's obviously blatantly a
[time=1085] sinful ungodly decision or something that is being asked of the wife and i want you to know in any
[time=1091] and every relationship this does apply to all of them that god is always the highest and greatest
[time=1097] authority in every relationship and so if every you're asked and even quoted scripture because people do misuse and misquote and tweak and turn scripture to be used for their own advantage
[time=1108] if ever you're asked to go against the principles of god god is always your highest authority we submit to god first we'll see that even in just a moment even further and so in no way are we ever to take a sinful step in order to submit to a person does that make sense and so let me just be
[time=1124] clear on that you would think maybe that seems clear but sometimes it's not we are pretty messy messed up people sometimes can i get an amen i know you're talking about them but i'm talking about you too because we're all in that but we all end up putting on our boxing gloves sometimes it's in the lord uh last thing it does mean before we go move forward here is foster
[time=1146] respect it does mean that there is a respect for god's authority or respect for god and therefore
[time=1152] respect for your husband Ephesians five is another passage where the same word who pitaso is the Greek word for submit that is the same word that paul uses in colossians three this is i've used this in marriage many times but the end of that that verse or that chapter Ephesians five says
[time=1170] let us see to it women that you love and you respect your husband and husband see to it that you
[time=1176] love your wife as yourself paul says to sum up this is what i'm saying love and respect in fact that's one of the titles of one of the greatest marriage books that my wife and i have ever gone through is called love and respect you can google it it's by dr emerson egrix and i won't try to spell it because i'll butcher it but you google love and respect you will find that it's an amazing book it talks about the cycles of communication a crazy cycle is where there's a lack of respect that motivates a lack of love and a lack of love motivates a lack of respect and you get the point because you've lived that and it's a crazy cycle and it keeps going until somebody reverses the cycle and says you know what despite the lack of respect i'm gonna show love despite the lack of love i'm gonna show respect and the circle the cycle gets reversed if you could use some of that that's a great book that you could possibly get your hands on in Ephesians five though the word submit who pitasso it's interesting it is used not in verse 21 of Ephesians five where it says
[time=1231] it's translated wives submit to your husbands as to the lord the verb is not there it's actually
[time=1238] inferred this is common in the greek language it's actually inferred from the previous verse it's literally translated wives to your husbands and paul makes it real clear wives submit to your husbands in colossians chapter three so what does it mean it means to arrange under and a good context
[time=1253] for that you should ask well what did the previous verse say Ephesians five twenty then if five twenty one and first the verb from five twenty what is five twenty seven glad you asked it says submit to pitasso same word as colossians three submit to one another out of reverence for christ
[time=1269] and so it's a submission and a reverence and at all of god where we submit to his authority that then leads us to be mutually submissive to each other love one another to have a gape
[time=1280] love self sacrificial unconditional love to one another and then that gets inferred now into marriage because i'm submitted to god because i have this mindset that christ showed us as one in authority who came as one under authority taking on fallipians to the form of a slave in authority and under authority because i'm submitted to him because he modeled that and i'm going to model that in my own life now now we see a picture of submission this plural
[time=1305] leadership but a singular headship and man that means there's a big responsibility for us in this
[time=1311] equation and so does that make sense you guys with me y'all right hang in there with me today i'm so glad that jesus is that model for us and it's interesting following the resurrection if you do a study of imperatives like wives submit to your husband's husbands love your wives things that we have to do they ultimately are always in some way or another in the context and the passage in the chapter they're connected back to christ as paul says as is fitting in the lord love each other as christ as god and christ loved you it's not our strength that we do this
[time=1341] from that should be a little relieving how many of you tried marriage in your own strength before i'm raising my hand because i have and you failed and you're failing but god in christ has given us
[time=1351] all we need to go from the boxing gloves to the heart emoji and i pray that this week you're
[time=1357] going to see a fruit from that and so there's a picture of the end of effigens five the word
[time=1363] hupataso submit what it means in chapter five but at the beginning of chapter five this is the segue into what i want to talk about next the next verse effigens five the first couple of verses look like this therefore be imitators of god as beloved children and walk in love as christ there
[time=1379] it is again there's an imperative well how as christ loved us and gave himself up for us
[time=1385] and that leads us back to colossians three and verse 19 let's look at that next verse at what it doesn't mean and what it does husbands love your wives do not be harsh with them this verse
[time=1396] does not mean man that this is an avenue for you to get your way to manipulate to lord or to boss
[time=1403] in your home it means that you're called to be a servant leader that sacrificially loves within agape kind of unconditional self-sacrificing love the way that jesus loves his church that's
[time=1414] what it means and in effigens five i'll often use that when i'm doing a wedding and i a joke but
[time=1420] it's not a joke because it's true that in effigens five paul writes three what we have is three verses to the wife but then there are six verses to the husbands it's almost like he knew we needed
[time=1432] a little extra help guys can i get an amen i know i do and so i want to give you some of that from the word of god today it doesn't mean also that the husband makes every decision means that husbands listen you engage in decision making and you do it together as a partnership but ultimately you are called as the head of the house to take responsibility for the decisions made in your house not to be dis how many of you have seen don't say yes or raise your hand because they might be in the room or watching you but you've watched a model of marriage where maybe it's just the disengaged rooftop husband man that just sits over there and is like y'all do your thing and i'll speak up when i disagree with it that no that's not real man manhood that's not real biblical manhood we're engaged and we work together we're partners as we lead our home the way that god would have us to lead our home and listen i believe with all of my heart men get ready get your toes on got your still towed boots i believe that so many of our social ills today so many of the problems that
[time=1487] we see in our world today could be solved if we would have fathers husbands and men act like godly
[time=1495] fathers husbands and men and so guys let's step up it's not an avenue to get your way
[time=1503] manipulate and be the boss and run the show it's an avenue to be the greatest servant jesus said
[time=1509] who's going to be the greatest of all is the greatest servant of all you go last but you step out first in what it looks like to be last what it looks like to have a servant leadership mindset
[time=1520] in your home it's also not an avenue for domineering or controlling because listen if you use this
[time=1526] verse to get your way and to be dominating domineering controlling in your home those are the kind of
[time=1532] things that lead to sexual physical verbal emotional abuse and that is never ever the plan of god
[time=1539] for biblical marriage last thing is it's not an avenue for public humiliation and us guys i think
[time=1545] this applies to anybody and everybody but us guys 10 i've been in the guy circles and we tend to make
[time=1551] jokes and sometimes we'll cut down our spouse to contribute to the joking and i just want you to
[time=1557] know it drives me crazy and i believe it drives god crazy we should honor marriage everywhere we're
[time=1563] at lift your spouse up i don't if you try to joke about your spouse with me i just want you to know i might have a joke i might have an opportunity to add to the joke about something with Jessica but here's what i also know she's got a way longer list to add to the joke about me than i've got about her and so i won't participate i work really hard to always lift my spouse up and if i don't like something we'll talk about that but it's never something for public consumption social media has made this 10 times worse and we'll cut down our spouse but my friends please lift up this institution
[time=1592] of marriage by lifting up your spouse not tearing them down and i'm going to give you an amazing formula that'll help you you ready for it write this down say only true things but don't say every
[time=1603] true thing you're welcome only say true things i'm not telling you to lie but listen there's all
[time=1613] kind of true things that my wife could say about me that she just kind of says you know what i'll just let him have it right and so we need to remember that same thing just because it's true don't mean you use it to cut others down i think you get the point let's go back to the verse and talk about what it does mean it does mean men that we treat our spouses as god's daughter thanks so
[time=1634] much would change if we looked at our wives as the daughter of god and maybe you know mentally that
[time=1640] that's the case but does that come out in your words or does it look more like this i remember
[time=1646] kenny johnson kenny may watch this watches us a lot of times and i remember asking him for his
[time=1652] daughter's hand in marriage this is my father-in-law and i remember him saying to me son that's my little girl i've never forgotten i was shaking in my skin over here scared to death of kenny johnson he's loved
[time=1668] me so well but i've watched that man i've watched him love his daughter and i've watched him love his wife as daughters of god i've watched my father i've had so many great examples that have shown
[time=1680] what it looks like to do that imperfectly absolutely but may we treat our wives as daughters of god
[time=1686] it does mean that the context is always love in a relationship the moment listen the moment you remove friendship partnership relationship from this equation of headship and structure in a
[time=1697] marriage is the moment it looks nothing like what god intended the godman institute did a some research on couples and ask men and women what's the most important thing in a marriage and it was all over the place except for one big thing over seventy percent of both men and women both said both said that the most important thing in a marriage is friendship and the song of solomon
[time=1719] that relationship the husband is described as lover and friend and maybe you just need to rekindle
[time=1726] some friendship in your relationship maybe you need to have a little fun ecclesiastes nine nine says enjoy life with the wife whom you love maybe it's time to rekindle some of that maybe this has just
[time=1739] been you and slightly and then it just the cycle they punch and then they punch back and this has just been you maybe it's time to say let's let's rekindle some things life has taken you down all kind of roads perhaps and let's talk about making this super practical we've gone through both verses what they don't mean what they do mean hope and if you're like well you said too much in this area not enough in that area you may be right keep studying keep researching but it doesn't matter where we land on those theologically if we don't practically do something with them so I want to help us answer a question now for the remainder of our time here's what I know about you a few things you say you don't know me I do know this I do know you've all experienced marriage even if you've never been married even if you grew up in a single parent household even if your
[time=1782] grandparents raised you even no matter what your upbringing looked like you have seen marriage on display in the world not if you agree we all agree that we've seen that but also know that what
[time=1793] you have experienced growing up has led you to do one of two things when you experience marriage when you've seen it you will number one either say I want to recreate what I saw it's like hey my parents my grandparents the neighbor down the street man I want to recreate that like can you take us some things that are on your list of expectations for marriage like yeah I want to do some more of that I want my marriage to look that way hopefully you've seen some good things you want to recreate and then you've also seen bad things that you want to renovate there's things you want to recreate but there's just as much that you want to renovate that's the stuff that's like that'll never be in my house I'm renovating that I'm tearing that down and I'm building something new but I know that your experience has always lead you to expectations what do I mean you have a book of expectations you didn't know
[time=1841] Matt maybe I'm going to show you right now this is your book of expectations you thought it was a one-pager list didn't you the things you expect from your spouse and you expected it from marriage and the things you wanted to recreate the things you wanted to renovate you thought it was a list no it's a book and here's your big book we're going to put it right here because those expectations kind of what started here it went something like this and by the way guys I don't care what you follow this little sentence with it's always wrong if you say in expectations well my mom always
[time=1871] can I get an amen if those of you who tried it and failed yeah that I don't care what you
[time=1879] follow it up with it's not going to work so don't do it but I expected I expected this and I experienced that and then you get back well I expected this and not only did you fail
[time=1891] miserably there but now you're not getting the experience you're hoping for because you expected that and oh yeah well I'm going to take this away and I'm going to you see what I'm saying and you're quiet because it's like man I've lived that and we have our expectations but I want to give you some so what do you do here's the question I want to spend some time answering what do I do when what I expect is not what I experienced I don't get much more practical than
[time=1914] that what I do when what I expect is not what I experience do I quit do I leave do I compromise
[time=1923] do I fight to win the argument what do I do and so let's spend a few minutes I'm gonna give you
[time=1929] four things number one trade your expectations for God's revelations I want to explain this
[time=1935] statement here's what I'm saying to you you have expectations and I'm not saying that you don't have expectations but I'm saying I want you to trade them in the word of God shows us how we can trade them in for an upgrade you still have expectations but even when they're not met God's revelations and I'm not suggesting that the word of God is not complete I'm actually doing the opposite I'm telling you we have the complete inerrant inspired authoritative word of God it is
[time=1957] God's revelation it is complete complete and it is finished and we have it but because we have it this is God's moral will we're looking for God's personal will and God continues to through his
[time=1968] revelation through the word of God to reveal himself to us in his personal will for our life so here's what I'm saying trade in upgrade your expectations your book of expectations and put
[time=1979] them under and subject to the revelations of God God's revelation through his word and the way he
[time=1985] constantly reveals himself to you and you have expectations but you make sure that God's word goes first you make sure that you lay them down the way that Jesus laid them down as we learn to do
[time=1996] throughout scripture as we learn to do as we look at Jesus I'm saying that you put your book
[time=2002] under his book number two commit in the pit I heard this statement in a sermon on Joseph
[time=2009] Joseph was thrown into a pit ended up the prime minister in a palace and so commit in the pit so what do you do and look at me for a minute come here y'all come here I want to give you a secret to marriage you're not going to like it but it's true if you're married if you get
[time=2023] listen if you get in a relationship at all dating fiance friends if you get in a relationship
[time=2030] there will be a pit and you may have caused it probably you did there will be problems so what
[time=2039] do I do do I quit in the pit commit in the pit because I believe some of you came and you brought
[time=2045] those in here with you've lost spouses maybe and it doesn't get much worse than that I see people I know who have done that maybe you're divorced or whatever that looks like to you but God wants to use the pits of our relationship to become a platform for his purposes and God will use those
[time=2060] times in your life as you commit to him and to each other through them to help other people so
[time=2066] commit in the pit I hear phrases like I just don't feel in love anymore or I'm just that's just not the same person that I'm married you ever heard those I've heard those so many times over and over but may I submit to us today that I believe true agape love begins where feelings end I'm not saying you don't have them I'm saying they don't drive the way they're subject to the facts of God's word that I choose true love is a choice that we make because God chose to love me
[time=2091] I choose to love even when I don't feel like it so some of you're about to quit and God says
[time=2097] commit in this pit that you're in the middle of right now number three make the relationship bigger
[time=2104] than the issue some of you've been making an issue bigger than the relationship and I'm not saying you don't have issues and I'm not saying you don't have to deal with those issues with your spouse or in your relationship but I am saying sometimes we take an issue and we harp on the issue non-stop and we don't build it off of the foundation of a friendship and a
[time=2124] relationship and a partnership when you affirm the person and you show the love and the commitment and the dedication to the person even if that issue has caused a pit and a problem in your relationship if you don't start there you're not going to get very far in dealing with the issue
[time=2140] maybe you've been getting it backwards make the relationship bigger than the issue and through the lens of relationship you get to maybe deal with the issue let me give you the greatest illustration of all time about that your sin is your greatest issue and God made the relationship so big that
[time=2155] he sent forth his son Jesus Christ and that while that we were yet sinners with all of our issues Christ died for us why because the relationship was there God dealt with the issue that was the lens through which he came to this earth number four and lastly posture to celebrate not to criticize the last stat I read says that on average we in our communication towards a spouse
[time=2178] or a significant other or even just someone in our relationship with we give out six criticisms for every one encouragement I would challenge you this week maybe flip the script reverse the ratio posture not to look at what you can tear down and what is wrong with your spouse but
[time=2194] instead look to find things to celebrate and I've given you for five years now over and over what I believe at least in my life is the greatest relationship principle I've ever discovered and it's simply this what you magnify will multiply it's true at church it's true in
[time=2211] your relationships it's true in your marriages if you look for the negative guess what it's there and it'll grow if you look for the positive it's there and you can build on that and God will use that to foster more of it in your relationship so make more deposits than withdrawals this week
[time=2227] put the boxing gloves away and let's go for the hard emoji this week I believe God's got something
[time=2233] special for you and I'm going to do something that I rarely ever do as I close today sermon as you get ready to think of what response has God would have you to take actions he would have you take
[time=2243] rarely am I ever going to say to you don't discuss this sermon on the way home but today I say to you married couples don't discuss this sermon on the way home
[time=2254] here's what I mean don't take the long way home don't say hey we've never go to lunch on Sundays
[time=2260] let's go to lunch today what do you say right no don't share your expectations with them
[time=2267] no I want to challenge you spend some time and focus on the me part of the equation first
[time=2273] and then instead of going to them and saying hey here's here's what I think we need to do go to them and say hey I want to hear about expectations what do you want to recreate
[time=2283] what do you want to renovate and instead of going and dumping out what you wish they would hear
[time=2292] and going do you hear that part I highlighted it and circled it four times you say let me tell
[time=2299] you what God showed me about myself and I want to hear more about you and I believe this week can be one of the better weeks with hard emojis that you've ever seen let me give you three questions for everybody and then for husbands and wives specifically for everybody what can I do to be the better half in my relationships two halves in every relationship we did a series on this a while by how do I make mind the better half wives ask how can I be more respectful and less harsh
[time=2322] with my husband husbands how can I be more loving less harsh with my wife and I believe this week
[time=2330] listen can be one of the greatest steps forward in your relationships as you build it on the word of God your book of expectations it's under the foot of Jesus and he's got big plans for your
[time=2341] relationships for your marriage by your hands with me if you will close your eyes what does it mean for you this week believers to take those steps what does it mean for those of you as believers
[time=2350] are praying for that next step in their relationship what does it mean for me to be a part of the greatest marriage in all of the universe and that's the marriage between God and his people
[time=2360] to become the bride of Christ maybe today you would say I just don't know that I'm a part of that
[time=2368] family but I sure would like to be what God made away and his name is Jesus he's the way the truth in the life he died on the cross for your sin after living a sinless life you could never live
[time=2379] and he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing but he knew what he was doing and he thought of you he thought of moments like this and he rose from the dead to defeat death hell and the grave and to defeat your sin those are victories you could not win and could never win on your own but he's already won them and instead of trusting in your good works or trusting in your grandparents faith or this or that trust in Jesus for salvation ask him to forgive you and save you he'll do just that right now where you sit in this moment of response believers
[time=2410] unbelievers all of us together taking our next step together may it be a sweet fragrance to our God as you take your next step in this moment of reflection and response do there right now
