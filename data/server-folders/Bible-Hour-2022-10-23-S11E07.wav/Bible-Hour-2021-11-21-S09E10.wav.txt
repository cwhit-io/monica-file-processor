[time=0] Friends, can I get an amen?
[time=3] Yeah, you've been blessed today.
[time=4] Well, let's give it up for Jesus and thank Him for this great time of worship.
[time=7] You know what we've sung about?
[time=12] I'm so thankful that throughout history, all of the pages of history, all of the pages of scripture, from Genesis to Revelation, from this year to that year, our God is faithful.
[time=23] He's never failed and He never will.
[time=28] And He loves us just the same.
[time=29] That's the message we want to proclaim.
[time=32] That's the story we want to tell.
[time=34] And as we've had communion today, as we've had all of these different elements looking towards us being a giving group of people, like God has given to us, being sacrificial in that regard and remembering the sacrifice of Jesus, you'll notice that the thread is always gonna be Jesus.
[time=50] And I pray that the same is true in your life.
[time=51] And I pray you're encouraged today as we dig into what it means to know that God is up to something in us.
[time=57] And I don't know where you're coming from if you're with us for the first time today, or it's been a while, whatever that looks like for you, God has a word for you, God cares about you where you are, and God is ready to help you grow up so that He does things in you that then turns into Him doing things through you.
[time=74] And that my friends is actually the series that we're in, we've called it Maturity University.
[time=79] Maturity University is a look at the book of Colossians.
[time=82] So you can grab your Bibles if you have them.
[time=84] I hope you do.
[time=85] Let's go to Colossians, we'll be in chapter three.
[time=87] We'll also be in Philippians, which is the book right before Colossians in just a minute.
[time=92] But we're looking at what does it mean to grow in Christ?
[time=94] What does it mean to be mature in Christ?
[time=97] Because God's doing something in you today so that He can do something through you with your life.
[time=102] And today I wanna talk to you about mature influence.
[time=104] Last week we talked about mature marriage.
[time=107] And if you missed that, we talked about some of your life.
[time=110] It's that those passages on marriage where it uses the S word of marriage, submit.
[time=114] And we talked about what does that actually mean?
[time=116] What does that look like?
[time=117] Last week we looked at that mature marriage.
[time=120] This week Paul's continuing.
[time=121] He's writing from prison, a letter to the church at Colossi.
[time=125] And he's seen a lot of great things in them that they are growing in their walk with Jesus.
[time=130] And he is encouraging and exhorting them to continue in that.
[time=133] But through that we get a beautiful glimpse at what it means to truly be spiritually mature and take our next step.
[time=139] And I hope you've been blessed as I have through this series.
[time=142] Many of you have come and shared with me that, hey, as you've talked about what it means to be spiritually either dead, but go from spiritual death to life and go into spiritual infancy, to spiritual childhood, to spiritual young adulthood, to spiritual parenthood.
[time=155] Many of us, and I say us because I am one of you, at many times we look and we say, well, I thought I was here spiritually, but as I've really let God do a work in me, I start to realize that maybe I have some childhood spots in my life or maybe I've got some areas to grow.
[time=170] And that is also why we have our backpack.
[time=173] And each week I've had a backpack and it's looked different.
[time=175] I brought my backpack with us.
[time=177] This represents our willingness to learn, to strap on our backpack, to realize we've not arrived.
[time=182] We have not arrived.
[time=183] We all have a long way to go.
[time=184] And that's what we've been looking at.
[time=185] So in my backpack today, I brought something that I'll share with you here in just a moment.
[time=190] But as we're looking at this idea of maturing, I want us to talk about influence.
[time=194] Today we're gonna look at, we're going from marriage to now in the home, parenting.
[time=199] Paul talks about parenting.
[time=200] He talks about what we could apply easily as our workplaces, our employers, employees.
[time=205] Slavery is mentioned here.
[time=207] And it's one of the passages that people will use to try to discredit the scriptures.
[time=211] And so we're gonna look at that in a moment.
[time=212] And then also, just everything else.
[time=215] And so let me ask you, how many of you are parents in the room?
[time=218] Okay, good.
[time=219] You need to be here.
[time=220] Look at your neighbor, parent, and say you need this.
[time=222] Tell him, you need this.
[time=225] And how many of you are grandparents?
[time=227] How many of you have any sort of influence at all on the younger generation in your life?
[time=233] All right, now everybody raise your hand.
[time=235] 'Cause that's who the sermon applies to today.
[time=236] There's some specific focuses, but we are all on common ground because listen, you have influence.
[time=242] And we wanna use our influence.
[time=243] Listen, both in authority and under authority, the way that God showed us how to do.
[time=248] You have areas of your life where maybe you're in authority.
[time=252] But the whole point of maturity is we realize we're under the authority of Jesus.
[time=256] And I'm so glad he's on the throne today, are you?
[time=258] I am so glad that we serve a God who is always in control.
[time=261] But the same God Jesus is the perfect embodiment.
[time=264] Think about this, the perfect embodiment, the perfect example of influence, both when in authority, which by the way, he's Jesus, he created the universe, that's all the time.
[time=274] He's always in authority, but at the same time, Jesus, the master became Jesus the servant.
[time=280] And Jesus is the full embodiment of what it looks like to have influence in authority, but also in submission and obedience under authority of his father.
[time=289] Jesus showed us what that looks like.
[time=290] I'm gonna read to you from Philippians.
[time=292] Paul wrote the church to the church in Colossae, the book of Colossians, the same thing happened as he wrote to the church at Philippites.
[time=298] The book before for me is two pages back from Colossians three, just a couple of pages.
[time=303] Let's read Philippians two, verses five through 11.
[time=305] And as we do look for how Jesus leads and influences why he's in authority, but also how he does so under authority.
[time=313] You ready for the word today, black car?
[time=315] Let's dig in chapter two of Philippians verse five.
[time=318] Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus.
[time=322] Who, though he was in the form of God, authority, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men and being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
[time=344] There's the under authority.
[time=345] And then what does God do with that verse nine?
[time=347] Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name.
[time=353] So that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth.
[time=358] And every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God, the Father.
[time=364] And I read that passage to you today because number one, two reasons, number one, if you can't get fired up about Jesus after reading that, then you need to meet Jesus today.
[time=373] And if you haven't met Jesus today, I'm gonna introduce you to Jesus today.
[time=376] And so I want us to start on that note, but number two, that passage shows us how Jesus is the master.
[time=381] He is in authority, but at the same time, he took on the form of a bond servant.
[time=386] It's also translated as slave.
[time=388] Same word we're gonna look at here in Colossians three in just a moment.
[time=391] Jesus took on that role in human form under the authority of God in submission to his will and in obedience to that plan of redemption for you and me.
[time=403] He's the perfect embodiment of influence, in authority in the same way, the embodiment of it, under authority as well.
[time=410] I'm glad we have such a God.
[time=411] He showed us ultimately how to worship, worship.
[time=415] A lot of us think that worship is a song that we sing, but really worship is a life that we live.
[time=419] Worship, the word actually comes from several different things, but I'll give you a couple of other words, W words that you could write down to define worship.
[time=427] Number one is weight.
[time=429] It's where you put your weight.
[time=431] It's what you lean on.
[time=432] It's what you depend on like a chair that you sit in.
[time=435] It's what you value the most.
[time=437] So your worship is where your weightiness lies in your life.
[time=441] It's where you lean into it.
[time=442] It's also worth.
[time=443] You could define worship as worth, ship.
[time=447] It's what you value the most.
[time=450] It's what you ascribe the most worth to.
[time=453] And that's why we say, God, you alone are worthy of our worship.
[time=459] And Jesus showed us and taught us how to worship.
[time=462] And I would say to you that I believe with all my heart as we talk about influence today that this is a core, this is a foundation for where Paul is going to lead us through his writing to the church at Colossae.
[time=472] And it's this statement that your worship directs your influence.
[time=478] Where you put your weight, what you see as having most worth, what becomes priority to you that has the greatest value in your life.
[time=487] And a lot of us who say, well, I don't really worship, to which I would respectfully disagree and say, yes, you do, we all worship.
[time=494] It's where your passions go.
[time=495] It's where your time, your energy, your resources go.
[time=498] We all worship something.
[time=499] We all ascribe worth and value and put our weight and our life and our energy and our focus into certain things.
[time=507] Some of us, it might be a football game that you're hoping I get you out and time to grab lunch and time to make it to a little later.
[time=512] I don't know what it is.
[time=513] You could worship, listen, you could worship your spouse.
[time=518] You could worship a career, could worship money.
[time=521] You could even worship your children.
[time=524] And what I would say to you is that where you put your weight and what you ascribe worth to your worship, that's gonna direct the areas where you have influence.
[time=533] To help us visualize this today, and I pray you can see my face every day this week along with this picture frame.
[time=540] Hopefully more of the picture frame than this face, but they kinda go together for the moment.
[time=544] Here you go, this is a frame.
[time=545] In the frame is a big question mark.
[time=547] And today as we go through the study of our worship and what it looks like with our influence, in frames we put things like family photos.
[time=555] Think of the frames in your world.
[time=558] It's the things that you ascribe a lot of worth to and a lot of value to, right?
[time=561] You frame those things.
[time=562] You box those things in and you display those things in front and center where people will see the pictures of your family and the people that you value the most.
[time=569] Maybe it's a diploma, maybe it's a certificate.
[time=571] I don't know what it is that maybe you have frame, but today I want us to look at the frame of our worship.
[time=577] This backpack and this frame represents realizing that maybe I frame things in ways I don't maybe even realize that I do.
[time=585] What you frame reveals your priorities.
[time=588] What you display reveals where your worship lies and therefore where your influence will go.
[time=594] So let's look at this tie between worship and influence today.
[time=597] And I would like to start by telling you that we are called by God to worship God.
[time=601] Number one, write this down.
[time=602] Worship God through your family, through your family.
[time=604] This comes from the first two verses and we'll look at picking up right where we've left off.
[time=608] Colossians three and verse 20.
[time=610] But look at me, come here for a minute.
[time=611] Let me tell you a secret.
[time=612] This is a secret.
[time=613] If you want to have a witness and an impact in your life, I believe that we so often underestimate the impact of what it means to worship Jesus through our family.
[time=624] We so miss the opportunity for influence for Jesus Christ that can come through how we lead and how we love those that are in our closest circles.
[time=637] Why is that the case?
[time=640] Glad you asked.
[time=641] Because people are watching you.
[time=643] They're watching how you love your spouse.
[time=646] They're watching how you love that knucklehead uncle.
[time=649] It's family gathering time, by the way.
[time=650] Happy Thanksgiving, by the way.
[time=651] I'm thankful for you guys.
[time=652] And I'm thankful for my family, but some of you, let's be honest, you're like, I'm not real thankful for mine at the moment.
[time=658] I'm not real sure.
[time=659] I feel real thankful going to that gathering because so and so is gonna be there and they have all these problems.
[time=663] But people are watching how we love each other in our family circles.
[time=667] People are watching how we parent.
[time=668] And I'm not sure, listen, I think it's Andy Stanley that originally said that your greatest accomplishment, I'm paraphrasing, your greatest accomplishment in life may not even be something that you do.
[time=678] It may be someone you raise.
[time=681] It's a powerful statement.
[time=683] And I would dare say that you'll never have a greater influence in all of your life than raising another human being.
[time=691] As a human, raising another human, they depend on you and people are watching and it's a huge influence not just in the life of your children, but in the lives of those who are watching.
[time=701] And so let's read verse 20 of Colossians 3.
[time=703] There's two things that will happen in these next two points.
[time=705] There's a picture of what it means to be under authority and then a picture of what it means to be in authority.
[time=711] Verse 20, we see a picture of being under authority's children.
[time=714] This verse is to children, I'm a child and at heart, I've grown up though, I was a child.
[time=720] This is addressed to children, minors.
[time=723] Now children grow up, but the thing is, let's read it.
[time=726] Children obey your parents.
[time=729] Parents are like, yes, I brought my kid into service at the perfect time.
[time=732] Are you watching this?
[time=733] Children obey your parents in, kids read it with me, in everything, big kids can too.
[time=739] For this pleases the Lord.
[time=741] Now, I'm not a minor anymore, so I don't really obey my parents.
[time=745] They don't give me directives like they used to.
[time=747] I lead a different household now, now I've got children, but I always honor my parents.
[time=751] Now obey in scripture turns into 10 commandments in this idea of honoring your father and your mother.
[time=757] And so big kids in the room, take note of that.
[time=759] But this is addressed specifically to kids.
[time=762] And I don't know about you, but my kids kind of depend on me.
[time=765] They eat because I give them food, they, I'm their chauffeur, I'm their transportation, I'm their sustenance.
[time=770] They kind of have to want to be with me now, but I hope one day when they don't have to be with me, when they get their own car, which I hope they pay for maybe, one day, when they can buy their own food, that they still want to be with me.
[time=785] They still want to come around mom and dad.
[time=787] I hope so.
[time=788] And I say all this in parenting with the most humility because my oldest is 11.
[time=793] And so I learn from you guys all the time that have been where I have not yet been.
[time=798] And in fact, just this week I'll brag on my wife.
[time=799] She just sat with at least a couple of ladies just to talk about parenting.
[time=803] Just 'cause raise your hand if you agree with this statement, if you've been a parent or if you've even influenced minors in any way, parenting is hard.
[time=810] It's difficult and we need each other.
[time=815] We do need a village.
[time=817] But my hope is that through this village and through doing things in a godly way that my kids will want to be with us as I've instilled truth in them and that they'll be our friend.
[time=826] That they will go from obeying 'cause they kind of have to honoring and wanting to have that relationship.
[time=833] And so that's some of the goal when Paul is walking us through some of that.
[time=835] Now Jesus displayed for us what it looks like to be under authority.
[time=839] Let me give you a couple of verses.
[time=840] I've mentioned that to you already.
[time=841] John 638, Jesus said, for I've come down from heaven not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.
[time=848] That's his father.
[time=849] Notice what he said in the Garden of Gethsemane.
[time=851] This is before he would be delivered and crucified.
[time=854] He said in Luke 22, verse 42, "Father, if you're willing, remove this cup from me, knew what he was gonna have to do." But he didn't stop there.
[time=863] He said, "Nevertheless, not my will, but yours be done." He showed us what it looks like to have all authority.
[time=872] The earth was under his feet.
[time=873] He could have called down legions of angels at any moment during these processes, but he submitted an obedience to his father's will.
[time=880] It's a good picture for us as kids, but also for us as big kids as we submit to our heavenly father and try to foster an environment of this, these verses in our own lives.
[time=891] And so Jesus embodied this statement that I've used to you many times.
[time=894] It was a big part of our journey even coming to Indiana.
[time=896] Those of you who've been on this journey with us, these past five years or so.
[time=899] And the statement is this, the answer is yes, Lord.
[time=903] Now what's the question?
[time=904] Many times we say, God, I'll give you my yes after you give me the question and I have 48 hours to process what my answer will be.
[time=914] Then I plan to give you my yes, pending this litany of items.
[time=918] Can I give an amen?
[time=920] That's kind of the truth if we're honest about that, but Jesus showed us what it looks like to just put the yes on the table.
[time=927] And as we model obedience under God, while we're in authority, then we will see respect fostered.
[time=934] We'll see parenting look different even with those who are under our own authority.
[time=938] And as we display our authority to others, it really turns into influence the more we live under the authority of the God who gave us that opportunity to begin with.
[time=948] Did you know your kids are not your kids?
[time=950] They're his kids, my kids are not my kids.
[time=952] We say my kids a lot, but they're really his kids.
[time=955] I'm a steward.
[time=957] They belong to him, he created them, but he gave me and Jessica the opportunity to love them to be a picture of him in their lives.
[time=966] That's a big responsibility.
[time=968] I pray we can do it really well.
[time=970] That's under authority.
[time=971] Now let's talk about in authority.
[time=973] This is where we get real practical.
[time=974] Everybody do this with me for a minute.
[time=976] Again, not COVID friendly, but then that help.
[time=980] And now you're braced because if you're parents and if you influence minors in any way, and I think that covers every single one of us, we need this.
[time=987] Look at your neighbor and tell them, you're gonna need this one, go on and tell them.
[time=991] Some of you are like, I ain't doin' that, I'm scared of them.
[time=993] Verse 21, Colossians 3, fathers.
[time=997] And by the way, this word fathers in its original language is often translated fathers, but in as a guy, well Hebrews 11, I think it's verse 23, it's translated as parents.
[time=1006] So ladies aren't off the hook and there's plenty of parenting verses and this one applies, but it's interesting, it's often translated as fathers because I think us dads, let's be honest guys, look at yourself and go, it's for me.
[time=1016] I need that, we need this.
[time=1017] So fathers, fathers, do not provoke your children.
[time=1021] Why?
[time=1022] Less they become discouraged.
[time=1025] Fathers, so provoke means to stir, to anger, means to incite, it means to irritate.
[time=1031] The Kevin version and definition would be something like this.
[time=1033] It means to, when they irritate you, you know what buttons to push and you push their buttons.
[time=1040] You guys laugh 'cause you know what that looks like, right?
[time=1042] It's like they're irritating me, so I know how to get them and you poke and you prod, or sometimes you may even manipulate them to try to modify behavior to fit what it needs to look like.
[time=1051] And this is the kind of stuff that Paul's talking about and this gets really real because it's hard.
[time=1056] Parenting is very difficult, so don't provoke your kids.
[time=1059] Why?
[time=1060] Less they become discouraged.
[time=1061] That literally means without heart or without spirit.
[time=1063] And I would tell you, I believe with all of my heart that the hearts of the children that live in my house are my greatest responsibility as a parent.
[time=1072] That's your primary responsibility.
[time=1074] If you're a parent in the room, a grandparent, a single parent, I know there are so many different layers and make-ups of what parenting and what influence looks like.
[time=1082] That's why I use the word influence and how we worship will determine how we influence no matter what the seat may look like, what the title may look like.
[time=1089] We all have influence and may we do it well.
[time=1091] And here's why I say to you that we've got to underscore, don't let them get discouraged.
[time=1095] This is why Paul writes this.
[time=1097] I believe that discouraged children are ready prey for an enemy who wants nothing more than to take them down.
[time=1106] Why would I ever desire?
[time=1109] I don't think any of us want this, but so many times we fall prey to provocation, to provoking, to not leading well, to not parenting well, to not influencing with a mature influence that Paul is talking about.
[time=1121] And what we end up doing, we don't mean to, but we end up building this discouragement in their life and saying, here you go, Satan.
[time=1130] And we serve up a discouraged child to an enemy who wants nothing more than to rip them to shreds.
[time=1138] And they go out into a world and listen, today's world is full of darts coming at your kids.
[time=1142] And so I don't know about you, but I don't want that.
[time=1145] I want none of that.
[time=1146] I want to build my kids up in their identity.
[time=1148] I want them to know who's they are and they don't belong to me.
[time=1152] They don't belong to their mom.
[time=1154] They belong to their creator.
[time=1155] And as they give their precious little lives to Jesus, he is the author and finisher of their faith.
[time=1161] And I want them to go out into this world where darts are gonna be flying in ways we never had to face as kids.
[time=1167] And I want them to be able to stand on the truth of God's word and I want them to be able to withstand all the attacks on their identity.
[time=1174] And I want to be a safe space where they can come to me and know that I'm always gonna point them to their heavenly Father and that the eternal things that they often can't see in this earthly life are hope-filled things they can hold on to even when the world feels hopeless.
[time=1191] It's our call, it's parents, but it's difficult.
[time=1195] It's challenging because kids are kids.
[time=1197] How many of you were a kid one time back in the day?
[time=1199] Yeah, exactly.
[time=1200] We were all been there doing that.
[time=1202] I want to give you two statements and I've talked to you last week about experiences.
[time=1205] You remember that?
[time=1206] Your experiences with parenting, with marriage, no matter what that makeup looked like, single parent home, grandparents home, you kinda had to fend for yourself.
[time=1214] You experienced some kind of parenting, some kind of influence in that way.
[time=1218] And your experience is, how many of you I'm gonna quiz you?
[time=1221] You didn't think you came to church for a quiz.
[time=1222] Those of you who weren't here last week, you're off the hook.
[time=1224] Everybody else, you're on the hook.
[time=1226] I want you to remember the two words, two R words that we all do.
[time=1230] Your experiences lead you to expectations and what you experience and what you expect are often very different, but no doubt, your past experiences have led you to expectations.
[time=1240] And it's led you to do one of two things in your marriage and your relationships and your home and certainly even with your parents.
[time=1245] And the first one was, what was it?
[time=1250] I heard it, recreate.
[time=1252] We wanna recreate some things.
[time=1254] These are the things, it's like I wanna see that in my home.
[time=1256] The way my dad did that, the way my grandmother did that, I wanna do that too.
[time=1260] I wanna recreate that experience in my own home that I experienced previously.
[time=1263] The second one was, renovate.
[time=1266] There you go, I jogged your memory.
[time=1267] We wanna recreate and there are things we wanna renovate where it's like, I don't want none of that.
[time=1271] We're gonna tear that one down and we gonna rebuild that from the ground up.
[time=1274] Can I get an amen?
[time=1276] You're doing one of those two things in all of these areas of your life.
[time=1279] And so as you think of what you wanna recreate and renovate, I wanna remind you of something that's very sobering, and write this down.
[time=1284] It is your actions, not your aims that will determine whether your children want to recreate or renovate what they experience in your home.
[time=1297] Good intentions are not going to be what have your kids wanna come back when they don't depend on you for the ride and the money and the food.
[time=1306] It's your actions.
[time=1308] It's those things, maybe, and we're so bad about this.
[time=1310] Why intended to have that talk with them?
[time=1312] I intended to show up for that passion of theirs.
[time=1315] I intended to sit down and tell them this story from my past.
[time=1318] Well, I intended, but it's not until intentions become intentionality, actions that they will make the decisions that they will make, like it or not.
[time=1328] It's gonna happen about whether or not they're going to recreate what they experienced in your home and under your influence, or maybe they wanna renovate that.
[time=1337] And I figured it would be silent because that is home, doesn't it?
[time=1340] Now we're all thinking of what do I need to do?
[time=1342] And this is good.
[time=1343] This is what God wants us to do.
[time=1344] This is mature influence.
[time=1345] So I ask you today, what will your kids decide to recreate or renovate based on their experiences?
[time=1350] And I wanna pick on dads for a moment.
[time=1351] This applies to moms, dads, grandparents, influencers, alike, but specifically dads.
[time=1356] I noticed this happened a lot just in talking, counseling with people as a pastor that us dads, a lot of times there's a tendency to get really aggressive, really intentional, really engaged, and really focus in our career paths.
[time=1372] It supplies to everybody, but I'm gonna pick on men for a minute.
[time=1376] Sometimes we do that.
[time=1377] But just as aggressive and intentional and engaged as we maybe are in our career path at the job, at the office, wherever you may be, we're equally as passive, disengaged, and unintentional in parenting.
[time=1392] Maybe in relationships in general, but we're talking about parenting right now.
[time=1395] And so my challenge is this.
[time=1397] My challenge is, we talked about last week, what does it mean to be ahead?
[time=1401] There's a plural leadership in your home, but there's that singular headship.
[time=1404] There's a structure that God has designed.
[time=1406] Because of that structure, man, God has called and challenged you to lead the way in being a servant leader.
[time=1412] So my challenge is go from areas of passivity in parenting to areas of proactivity in parenting.
[time=1419] I wanna be a church that's full of families that have proactive parenting.
[time=1425] I wanna be full of a church that is full of people who move from being passive.
[time=1429] And we're taking ground for the kingdom as we raise up little warriors for Jesus Christ.
[time=1434] So men, ladies, all of us influencers alike, may we move from areas of passivity in parenting and be proactive, be ahead of the game, be engaged and be intentional.
[time=1446] May we move from intentions to intentionalities and how we parent our kids.
[time=1451] You'll never have a greater opportunity to have an influence than raising up those little world changers for Jesus.
[time=1457] And I pray that we can do it his way as we go through this.
[time=1460] So second thing is I wanna give you this statement.
[time=1464] Parent to build their identity, not your reputation.
[time=1471] Here's what I mean by that.
[time=1473] For honest, can we get vulnerable for just a minute?
[time=1477] For honest, we often parent towards behavior modification.
[time=1482] I'm gonna be personal.
[time=1483] I'll take the hit for us.
[time=1484] I'll take it on the cheek for everybody in the room.
[time=1487] But you can probably identify it.
[time=1488] Many times I parent towards behavior modification so that in moments where your kids might not act right, might act just a little bit better.
[time=1500] Y'all say amen, come on, don't leave me up here by myself.
[time=1502] I'm taking it for the team.
[time=1503] You know you do it too.
[time=1505] We parent towards, I want my kids to behave well so that they don't make me look really bad.
[time=1510] Can I get an amen?
[time=1511] We do that so many times, but listen, I'm gonna go back to the frame.
[time=1514] What's in the frame of our parenting so many times?
[time=1517] If we're honest, we parent towards protecting our reputation more than we parent towards building their identity and letting them know who they are and letting them know how much God loves them.
[time=1528] Now we don't want that, but we're human.
[time=1530] And as human parents, parent little flawed humans, and how many of you had to teach your kids to sin?
[time=1534] Anybody, exactly.
[time=1536] Nobody had to teach your kids to sin.
[time=1537] They're little sinners.
[time=1538] And you're big sinners and you're raising little sinners, but because we're big sinners, raising little sinners, we end up so many times in the frame of parenting for honest putting ourselves there more than saying Jesus is here at the top and my kids are right here below.
[time=1554] That's the frame of parenting.
[time=1556] That's where we put our weight.
[time=1557] That's what has the value.
[time=1559] Jesus is at the top of that.
[time=1560] But so many times we parent in a way that just kind of puts us front and center.
[time=1565] So I challenge you this week.
[time=1567] What does it look like to build their identity and put aside what other people think?
[time=1571] Jesus did that.
[time=1573] Philippians two that I read to you earlier, wouldn't be really good for the reputation of God to become a slave, a bond servant, but would it?
[time=1582] But that's what he did.
[time=1584] He put all that aside.
[time=1586] Why? So that we could be in his frame.
[time=1588] It could be his mission.
[time=1590] Number two, write this down, worship God, not just through your family, but worship God through your work, through your work.
[time=1596] Verse 22 and then chapter four verse one shows us this.
[time=1599] Let's look at verse 22 and this is where we see the slave bond servant come in.
[time=1604] Verse 22 says bond service, obey in everything those who are your earthly masters, not by way of eye service as people pleasers, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.
[time=1615] So as we read this, let's first of all talk about slavery because so many times, this is the under authority part.
[time=1620] Chapter four verse one is the in authority part, just like we did with parenting a moment ago.
[time=1624] We see the same thing here.
[time=1625] Critics of the Bible often cite verses like this in trying to disregard and discredit because of the topic of slavery, the Bible has this bigoted, outdated, irrelevant book.
[time=1640] But I want us to look at the context and consider what's going on.
[time=1642] But first of all, there's two big things you need to know, number one is the Bible and God and this church and the church of God is completely anti-slavery.
[time=1653] The Bible condemns slavery.
[time=1655] And if you've noticed, slavery has had all kinds of different forms throughout history.
[time=1659] In fact, in this context, I'll walk you through some of that history, but today, slavery still exists.
[time=1664] It just looks different and it's changed and it's morphed.
[time=1666] But the Bible stance and God's stance on slavery has always been the same.
[time=1670] I'll give you one verse so you can look it up.
[time=1671] There are many.
[time=1672] The first Timothy chapter number one, I think it's verses nine and 10 is a big list of all these things that are so displeasing to God that are sinful and in that is slavery mentioned.
[time=1683] And so the Bible is purely against slavery.
[time=1687] The second thing that you should know is the context and what Paul is writing about in that context.
[time=1692] This is so fascinating to think of bond service.
[time=1695] So during Paul's time of writing the church at Colossae, it's estimated there would be a third to a half of all the people in his writing influence that would be in some form of a bondservant role.
[time=1707] In fact, a lot of scholars would estimate it that in the Roman Empire at the time of Paul's writing, some 60 million people would have fit that category.
[time=1715] And it wasn't just this oppressive slavery.
[time=1718] There was plenty of that, but there was also financial arrangements where there was a debt that would be owed as an example.
[time=1724] And because a debt was owed, a family would say, hey, we'll move our family on to your property and work for you for five years to pay off that debt.
[time=1731] There were so many different versions of that.
[time=1733] And that's what I want to remind us of today.
[time=1735] And yet the Bible has never changed.
[time=1739] It's always been anti-slavery.
[time=1741] And so somebody should say, well, if the Bible's anti-slavery, then why did Paul talk about it?
[time=1744] Somebody asked me that.
[time=1745] I'm glad you asked.
[time=1749] You should ask that question.
[time=1750] And I want to talk about, well, why did Paul talk about it?
[time=1753] If the Bible's against it, why did he tell bond service how they should behave?
[time=1757] And here's the answer to that question that Paul is writing to help people listen both in his context and in our context, the universal Bible that we have, the scriptures are so universal and timeless that in the midst of a sin-filled world, even with things like slavery, and do we still have slavery today in different ways?
[time=1776] Absolutely.
[time=1777] It looks different through different centuries, different time periods, but in a sin-filled world, how do we as mature believers embody the godly living that would make us the light in the darkness?
[time=1788] That's what Paul is writing about.
[time=1790] So he knew it was a reality.
[time=1791] It would be very negligible for Paul to not speak about this reality that is, although sinful, a true reality that was all around during this time, and today it still is different.
[time=1802] And I can't go past this without saying, listen, people come up to me and I tell you this all the time.
[time=1806] They'll say, "Pastor, what's Black Hawk's stance on filling the blank?" And it's some new ism.
[time=1811] I'm just want to be honest with you guys.
[time=1813] I can't keep up with all the isms today.
[time=1815] Man, there's a new ism every single day, and I'm not making a lie to us.
[time=1818] We do.
[time=1819] We write policies, procedures and talking points and stances for church and school and all of these different things that are all swirling around today.
[time=1826] We're going to keep doing that.
[time=1827] That's part of our stewardship responsibility.
[time=1829] But what I want to point us to in those situations, just like it is with slavery, it looks different today than it looked back then, but the word of God is universal and it is timeless.
[time=1839] And that is why the isms come and go.
[time=1841] Listen, it's political ideologies and structures and governments and countries come and go.
[time=1847] We need to realize that every single one of these isms, every country, every government structure, all of the isms that come in and out of our life, they will all come and go.
[time=1858] They will all perish, but the word of God will remain the same.
[time=1863] The God of the word will remain the same and only the kingdom of God will be standing when we enter into eternity.
[time=1871] So we as a church want to be a church that keeps the kingdom of God, the word of God at the forefront as all of these other ideologies and isms and structures come and go, we'll address them as they come, but we will remain standing firm on the word of God and more than that, on the God who wrote the word to begin with.
[time=1888] So don't get consumed by the isms.
[time=1895] Don't get consumed by the nuances and the comings and goings of all these sinful things.
[time=1899] And that's what Paul writes to help us with.
[time=1901] Write it down this way.
[time=1902] Let's apply it to employers and employees.
[time=1903] Your work is one of your greatest avenues of worship and witness.
[time=1910] Your workplace right now is an excellent avenue for you to be a witness for Jesus.
[time=1915] Your workplace right now is one of the greatest avenues God has given you to work for him.
[time=1920] And we're to do it at the end of verse 22 with sincerity of heart, with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord, doing it for him, not for other people as we'll see in the next coming verses.
[time=1931] And so today, I would ask you, maybe you said, well, my heart's just not at it anymore.
[time=1936] You ever said that?
[time=1937] I have.
[time=1939] We have those moments, feelings come and go.
[time=1940] So I would tell you, maybe one of two things need to happen.
[time=1942] It may be that you need to change a job.
[time=1944] It may be possible.
[time=1945] I'm not saying it can't be.
[time=1946] The Holy Spirit will guide you in that.
[time=1948] But maybe before you look to do that, maybe look to bloom where you're planted because number two, here's the other option.
[time=1954] Maybe more than a change of job, you might need a change of heart.
[time=1959] Might need a change of perspective.
[time=1963] You might frame it a little differently and see it as an avenue for worship, and see it as an avenue for witnessing.
[time=1968] And you might find that the fulfillment follows in ways you never thought it would.
[time=1972] Colossians 4-1, this is the in-authority part of the equation, says, masters treat your bond service justly and fairly, knowing that you also have a master in heaven.
[time=1982] So if you're in authority in any way, if you're an employer, you have people that report to you.
[time=1986] If you've got kids, if you have influence, which really, that's all of us, and it looks different in all the different ways, wherever you're in authority, remember my friends, you're still under his authority.
[time=1996] That's what this verse reminds us of.
[time=1998] Write it down this way that your influence, in authority is built by your obedience under authority.
[time=2005] And so may the title and the prestige and the authority and the power, it's not gonna last.
[time=2013] What you wanna do is turn that title, that authority, your in-authority, that to go away and influence to come in, where they see that like this guy, this gal, they're the real deal.
[time=2024] They treat me justly and fairly.
[time=2026] They never exploit me.
[time=2028] There's something different about them.
[time=2030] And then it becomes an avenue for witness and for worship in your life.
[time=2034] Last thing, we talked about worship God through your family, worship God through your work.
[time=2037] And this ties it all together.
[time=2038] Number three, worship God through whatever you do.
[time=2042] Look at your neighbor and say, whatever, whatever.
[time=2044] That means everything, whatever you do, verses 23 through 25, let's read those verses together.
[time=2050] Colossians 3, 23 through 25.
[time=2053] And we will officially be in the last chapter of Colossians that we'll wrap up Lord willing next week.
[time=2058] So let's go to verse 23.
[time=2060] Whatever you do, work heartily, ask the Lord, not for men.
[time=2066] Knowing that from the Lord, you will receive an inheritance as your reward, you are serving the Lord Christ.
[time=2073] For the wrong doer will be paid back for the wrong, and he is done, and there is no partiality.
[time=2078] Verse 25, let me start there and back up.
[time=2080] How many of you have ever had anybody do something wrong to you before?
[time=2084] Been wrong, okay.
[time=2084] How many of you have ever wanted to make right that wrong on your terms before?
[time=2089] Yeah, well, this verse says, listen, and I want to remind you of this.
[time=2093] God will take care of it all.
[time=2095] There's no partiality.
[time=2096] He'll make right everything that is wrong.
[time=2099] Our job is to be faithful and to worship him in whatever it is that we are doing, wherever God has planted us.
[time=2106] And then verses 23 and 24, notice this, whatever you do, do it as for the Lord.
[time=2110] And then he says simply to us from the Lord, as to the Lord, so that from the Lord you will receive.
[time=2117] This is the lifestyle of worship that we are talking about.
[time=2120] This is our walk, our words.
[time=2122] This is our whatever, whatever we do.
[time=2124] Somebody says, well, what do you do for the Lord?
[time=2126] You should say, whatever, not like whatever.
[time=2129] Now, what do you do for the Lord?
[time=2132] Whatever I do, it's for the Lord.
[time=2135] People often ask me, what is God's will?
[time=2137] You ever ask that?
[time=2138] What's God's will in my life, for my job, for my kids?
[time=2140] If you have kids, if you're a parent, you have definitely asked God this question, can I get a name, man?
[time=2145] What is God's will?
[time=2146] I want to give you an answer based on these verses here today.
[time=2148] The answer to that is worship in the whatever.
[time=2153] That's God's will.
[time=2154] And I know you got specifics within that, but I want to remind you of a very powerful truth that if you want to know the unknown will of God.
[time=2162] The best thing for you to do is to do the known will of God.
[time=2167] The more you bloom where God has planted you and whatever, and it may be something like, do I go there?
[time=2172] Do I take that job?
[time=2172] Do I do this?
[time=2173] Do I say that?
[time=2174] Do I go influenced in this area?
[time=2176] Do I share what all these different things that you may be asking?
[time=2178] If you'll just serve God in the opportunities he's given you, do the known will of God where you know he's planted you at least for now, the more you do the known will of God, the more God will reveal to you his unknown will, for your life.
[time=2190] So what is God's will?
[time=2191] To worship in the whatever, whatever you do.
[time=2195] May we worship, may we live that out.
[time=2197] And what if God is less concerned about the wind, the where in the what, but more about the how?
[time=2202] Less concerned about where you work or where you choose to go to college, but more concerned about how you're gonna act on that college campus and represent him as a light in a dark world.
[time=2210] I think God is bigger and he cares about the details.
[time=2212] Don't hear me wrong.
[time=2213] He'll guide you in the details, but as he guides you in the details, may we be more concerned with worshiping in the whatever.
[time=2220] Whatever it is that we're doing at the time, may we give it our all just like unto Jesus.
[time=2225] And first Peter chapter two verse 23, this is what reminds us of what we're reminded of in verse 25, Jesus is spoken of by Peter and he says, when he was reviled, he didn't revile in return, when he suffered, he didn't threaten, but he continued in trusting himself to the one who judges justly.
[time=2242] Verse 25 reminds us that he will do just that.
[time=2245] In the meantime, may we worship in the whatever.
[time=2247] So here's my closing question to you today.
[time=2249] And the question is simply, how will you frame your influence?
[time=2253] I wanna ask you just to bow your heads.
[time=2258] And as you do, honor this time for a moment.
[time=2260] Be still before the Lord for this moment.
[time=2264] Don't miss the most eternal thing that's gonna happen to you all week in this moment.
[time=2268] Let's reflect and let's respond.
[time=2269] Let's ask ourselves this question.
[time=2270] Believers, what can you be doing during this time to respond to the answer to that question?
[time=2275] How can you reframe some things in your life through your worship and your influence this week?
[time=2280] And if you're here today, as believers are praying and you would say, I just don't know that I know Jesus is my personal Lord and savior.
[time=2285] The gospel is good news.
[time=2286] The news is that it already happened.
[time=2288] Jesus already came that Christmas morning, the first Christmas morning, why did he come?
[time=2292] He came so that we could have a savior who took our place.
[time=2297] The wages of sin is death.
[time=2298] Jesus lived the sinless life.
[time=2300] We could never live on our own.
[time=2303] And after he lived that life, he became our perfect substitute and sacrifice.
[time=2308] He died a brutal death on that cross so that the wages of our sin, being death, could be paid.
[time=2317] He was that spotless, perfect sacrifice and he rose from the dead and he defeated death.
[time=2322] He defeated hell.
[time=2323] He defeated your sin.
[time=2325] He won a victory you could never win.
[time=2328] That's why Ephesians 2 tells us we're saved by grace through faith, it's not of works.
[time=2334] Some of you thought, well, I'll just be good enough and I'll do those other people and I'll make the cut.
[time=2339] No, there is no making the cut.
[time=2341] None of us could make the cut apart from Jesus.
[time=2344] We're saved by grace through faith, not of work.
[time=2346] So then we'd go around boasting about it like we had something to do with it.
[time=2348] This is God's work.
[time=2350] Our part in this equation is to be a receiver of the greatest gift that we could ever begin to hope to receive.
[time=2357] Today, will you receive him?
[time=2359] Pray from your heart to his.
[time=2361] Prayer is just the means of communication.
[time=2362] Telling Jesus, you believe he's who he said he has.
[time=2364] That he died, you believe he's alive.
[time=2366] Ask him to forgive you.
[time=2367] Ask him to save you.
[time=2369] And whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
[time=2372] Will you take that moment right now from your heart to his, his believers pray?
[time=2376] Those who need to take that step, will you ask Jesus to be your Lord, your master and your Savior right now.
[time=2391] (gentle music) - Give you a chance to acknowledge what God's doing.
[time=2403] This is really not for me.
[time=2404] It's for the Lord and it's for you.
[time=2406] There's power and acknowledgement.
[time=2407] If you're a believer in men, you just gotta step.
[time=2409] You need to reframe some things, some priority.
[time=2411] Your worship needs to shift so that you're influenced.
[time=2413] It looks a little more like Jesus.
[time=2414] And you've got some specific areas.
[time=2416] Would you lift your hand right now?
[time=2417] If I can't see you, God does.
[time=2418] Lift your hand all over the room.
[time=2419] I see you all over the room.
[time=2421] Thank you for your honesty.
[time=2423] May God go before you and every step that you're gonna take this week.
[time=2426] You can put your hands down.
[time=2427] Who would say today?
[time=2428] I've decided to give my heart to Jesus.
[time=2430] My life is his.
[time=2431] I've surrendered it all to him.
[time=2433] I've nailed down my salvation today.
[time=2435] I took that step.
[time=2436] If that is you right now, would you lift your hand so I can pray for you?
[time=2439] Those I can see.
[time=2440] I wanna pray for you specifically.
[time=2441] And those I can't see, God sees you.
[time=2443] Anybody say today is that day for me.
[time=2446] I see you.
[time=2447] God bless you.
[time=2448] Who else?
[time=2449] God, I thank you today.
[time=2452] Thank you for lives changing.
[time=2454] I thank you for transformation that only you bring about Lord.
[time=2456] The heavens rejoice over all these things.
[time=2458] And we're gonna join them in just a moment.
[time=2460] Thank you for letting us be a part of your family.
[time=2461] We love you.
[time=2462] We praise you.
[time=2463] We thank you for maturity university that we would just be able to grow up.
[time=2467] Look a little more like Jesus in our homes, our workplaces and our world.
[time=2471] This week we're paired on the powerful name of Jesus and all God's people send.
[time=2474] Amen, let's give it up for Jesus.
[time=2476] Let's celebrate transformation.
[time=2477] Let's celebrate what God is up to here today.
[time=2481] Listen, you don't wanna miss a couple of quick announcements I wanna share with you, but the most important one is this.
[time=2486] If you said yes to Jesus, if you're ready to be baptized to take your next step today, you can go to blackhawkministries.org/nextsteps in the room, if you're watching us on a screen, you can do that.
[time=2496] You can also fill out this card and drop it in one of the black boxes here.
[time=2500] We also give that way as well.
[time=2502] And so if you're prepared to give today online or in the room, you can go to blackhawkministries.org.
[time=2507] or you can drop off your gifts in those black boxes.
[time=2511] Before I dismiss you, I got a few quick announcements.
[time=2513] You don't wanna miss these three things.
[time=2515] They're big shifts for our church, big things that are going on.
[time=2519] And so I wanna share them with you.
[time=2520] Number one, I think I saw, there he is.
[time=2522] Steve Webster, raise your hand real quick.
[time=2523] Most of you all know Steve Webster, one of our teaching pastors, been our Bible department chair, part of our school so long, our adult and care ministries pastor.
[time=2531] I love me some Steve Webster.
[time=2532] If you do too, let's give it up and thank God for Steve Webster.
[time=2535] (congregation applauding) But today, I get the, just really honor.
[time=2542] It's a bittersweet one in some ways, Steve, but I'm so proud of Steve.
[time=2545] Steve let me in on something God was doing in him for the last few months.
[time=2550] And he's been in conversations with Woodburn Missionary here in our same area about stepping into the senior pastor role over there with them.
[time=2558] And we're so proud of the way Steve has invited me in, invited us in, walked on that journey.
[time=2563] So he's been along that path with them for several months.
[time=2566] Now we've waited to share anything with you publicly until they did their part in that.
[time=2570] And so we honor that process and it became final last week.
[time=2575] And so he will be stepping into that role as of the first of December.
[time=2578] And so we are ascending church, my friends, more than a seating church.
[time=2583] We're not about filling up the seats.
[time=2584] We're about sending ambassadors.
[time=2586] And Steve is one of those 1500 we're gonna send out.
[time=2589] And though there are bitter parts to that, we rejoice over what God's doing.
[time=2592] Can we thank God for that?
[time=2594] Yeah, and then I'll tell you what that's gonna look like.
[time=2596] (audience applauding) And so here's what we're gonna do over the next couple of weeks.
[time=2602] Okay, you guys have a seat real quick.
[time=2604] Yeah, thank you.
[time=2606] Here's what we're gonna do over the next couple of weeks.
[time=2608] Next week, we are going to do a big commissioning for Steve.
[time=2612] And it's gonna be awesome.
[time=2613] We've got some family coming up.
[time=2615] I believe Steve next week's gonna be with us.
[time=2617] And his whole family will be on stage.
[time=2620] And we're gonna commission them and send them out because that's what we do.
[time=2623] That's who we are.
[time=2624] We're gonna send them out next week.
[time=2625] And then you'll be hearing both through email, through some videos.
[time=2628] You're going to be able to hear from Pastor Steve.
[time=2631] And on December the 5th, you'll get to hear from him the week before our give light offering.
[time=2635] He's a gro- I told him.
[time=2636] I said, well, you're living out the sermon illustration of the week for me.
[time=2639] He is that ambassador.
[time=2640] That's what our give light offering is all about.
[time=2642] So that'll be on December the 5th.
[time=2644] You don't wanna miss these next two weeks as we honor and give tribute and send them out really well.
[time=2648] Steve, we love you.
[time=2649] We sure do.
[time=2650] We're gonna be with you these next couple weeks.
[time=2652] And you'll start on December the 6th.
[time=2654] All right, two more quick things that I'll get you out of here.
[time=2656] Number one is starting January the 2nd.
[time=2659] We're changing our service times.
[time=2661] It's really not new.
[time=2662] It's the old service times.
[time=2664] For those of you who've been with us a long time, it is 9 and 10.45.
[time=2667] We're gonna go back.
[time=2668] That's not yet what time is next Sunday's second service?
[time=2672] 11 o'clock, but starting January.
[time=2674] You know what I shouldn't have done that.
[time=2675] And then you just be early.
[time=2676] Some of you are really late anyway and you'd be on time.
[time=2680] I missed that chance.
[time=2680] Starting January the 2nd, 9 and 10.45.
[time=2683] This does several things.
[time=2684] I wanna give you a few of them.
[time=2685] Number one, kids check in right now because of COVID was when we shifted those times, it was to clean.
[time=2690] And I want you to know, we're still gonna have very strong hefty cleaning protocols.
[time=2694] Really not a lot is changing, but we were able to figure out ways to clean so that people who check their kids in and still serve and wanna go to church and they're here, both services.
[time=2702] Now won't have to check their kids in for first service, check their kids out and back in for the second service.
[time=2708] I don't even have to ask for an amen.
[time=2710] All the parents in the room are already amen in me in their head so that they can stay checked in, even though we'll still have good cleaning protocols.
[time=2717] This will allow us to have some crossover between first and second service.
[time=2720] Some of you are not getting to see each other, hopefully build, keep building the relationships.
[time=2723] Among many other things, this will help us be able to do that.
[time=2727] Starting January the 2nd.
[time=2729] And the other thing it helps with is there's something about noon in the church world.
[time=2733] And we have an hour and 15 minute service every week, but we tend, sometimes at noon, we get a little squirmy.
[time=2738] Right?
[time=2740] No, you're like, not me, not me.
[time=2741] I didn't do that pastor.
[time=2742] But this will have us out at about noon, which I'm sure you'll be glad to be able to get to lunch a little sooner.
[time=2747] Can I get an amen?
[time=2748] All right, January 2nd, last thing.
[time=2750] January the 19th, we've got Wednesday nights at Black Hawk coming back.
[time=2754] They're gonna look a little different.
[time=2755] It'll be 5.30 to 8 p.m.
[time=2757] At 5.30, there'll be an opportunity for a meal to happen.
[time=2760] We already have some meals and activities for DS3, which is our fifth through eighth grade middle school ministry and our movement high school ministry ninth through twelfth grade.
[time=2768] They're already having all of their stuff on Wednesday nights.
[time=2770] And so now it can be a family affair.
[time=2772] There'll be a meal starting at five.
[time=2773] We'll have a time of quick prayer and maybe a quick worship time before we disperse and go into classes.
[time=2779] I know you're wondering, what are those?
[time=2780] Tune in to blackhawk.fyi because you're ready to go to lunch today.
[time=2784] And I can give you all that info.
[time=2786] This next week or so will have all that.
[time=2788] We will ask for pre-registration so that kids can be cared for well during that time as well.
[time=2792] But it'll be 5.30 to 8 starting January the 19th.
[time=2796] There's a ton more, but I think you're ready to go to lunch and ready to go worship and frame your influence.
[time=2800] So if you are, well, you stand to your feet.
[time=2802] And as you stand your feet, go to blackhawk.fyi and you'll find all of this info in the next week or so and all the great stuff coming up for Christmas.
[time=2811] Our give light offering, listen, giving, give light.
[time=2814] If you're new with us, this is just something we do.
[time=2816] We invite you in, we don't expect you in, but we give big at Christmas because our God has given to us.
[time=2821] Join me in praying what that looks like.
[time=2823] And be sure to be here next week as we commission Steve and we'll finish out maturity, university.
[time=2827] And listen, look at me for a minute before you leave.
[time=2830] The God of the universe has called you and equipped you.
[time=2833] The King of Kings and the Lord of Lords goes before you.
[time=2839] Let's go live a life of worship towards him.
[time=2841] Let's frame our worship in a way that changes our influence and you, yes, you, stop hiding behind inadequacy.
[time=2848] You have the Holy Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead inside of you.
[time=2853] Let's go live out that light this week and I'll see you next week.
[time=2856] God bless you guys.
[time=2857] You're dismissed.
[time=2858] (upbeat music)
