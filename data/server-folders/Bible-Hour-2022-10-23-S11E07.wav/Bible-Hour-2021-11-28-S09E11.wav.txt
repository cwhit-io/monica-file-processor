[time=0] The practical people priority.
[time=4] That's our title today.
[time=5] The practical people priority.
[time=7] We'll be in Colossians 4, verses 2, all the way through the end of the book that we've been reading about today.
[time=12] And for over three months, we've been studying Colossians.
[time=15] And I want to personally thank you for allowing me just to be a bit of a guide, as well as Rick Raber and our teaching team and our leaders.
[time=23] Thanks for letting me lead us through, teach us through, pastor us through a study of this amazing book of God's Word.
[time=30] I pray that you've grown, like I have grown.
[time=32] And as we've gone through this, there's a quote I've shared with you before that I think captures discipleship and spiritual maturity super well.
[time=39] And it comes from John Wemberne in his writing on utter obedience.
[time=43] He says, "The disciple is always ready to take the next step." If there's anything that characterizes Christian maturity, it is the willingness to become a beginner again for Jesus Christ.
[time=56] It is the willingness to put our hand in his hand and say, "I'm scared after death, but I'll go with you Lord.
[time=63] I'll risk everything to go with you." Love that quote.
[time=67] And in fact, we've had a backpack every single week in this series, and in that backpack came something that fit the topic, but the backpack represented young and old, all of us together realizing that growing in Christ takes trapping on the backpack, realizing I have not arrived, and I've still got growth to take, growth steps to take.
[time=86] How many of you are here and remember the first week of our series in the backpack that I had that week?
[time=92] It was my little girl, Kiah's backpack, and I thought how fitting to end where we began.
[time=98] To become a beginner again for Christ sometimes means looking a little silly.
[time=102] You ever look silly in your faith?
[time=105] Yeah, I do too.
[time=106] And this borrowed backpack that has to go back to her a little later, our backpack reminds us that we're strapping on an obedience, an awareness, an openness, and a teachability, and a humility to let God do a new work in us.
[time=122] I pray that's what you've come with today, so strap on your frozen backpacks.
[time=125] And I was instructed to not sing, let it go, because I typically do that when I talk about frozen, 'cause we sing it in our house all the time.
[time=131] So instead of singing it for you, I wanna remind you of the song.
[time=135] And see now you're singing it in your head, and those of you who know the song will sing it all the rest of the week.
[time=142] To that I say, you're welcome.
[time=144] So grab your Bibles, Colossians chapter four, and before we dig in, I wanna show you what we've hoped for.
[time=148] This is a picture of the stages of growth, the stages of spiritual maturity, the stages of growth that's a part of the series, but it's a part of our discipleship process that it's not our discipleship process to begin with, it belongs to Jesus.
[time=161] We wanna be a church that doesn't just talk about what Jesus said, but actually does what Jesus did.
[time=166] And we start out spiritually dead and our trespasses and sins.
[time=170] Our sin, the wages of sin is death, and we don't just have an earthly death, we have an eternal death.
[time=176] But Jesus came into the world, and because he came into the world, he died for our sin, he rose from the dead, and because of him, we can have eternal life.
[time=183] And just like in a physical growth process, there is a spiritual growth process, and we go from death, and we have life, and we're in spiritual infancy, all the way to spiritual childhood, where we've become a little more independent, and then spiritual young adulthood, which is where we realize there's more to life than just me and serving myself to spiritual parenthood, where we reproduce, and we make disciples of others, and we pour into others, and we give up our lives, parents in the room, I know we'll say, Amen, you sacrifice all that you are so that you can pour into your kids, and you put them first, and that's what we do as we mature.
[time=218] We hope that on that growth journey, you have watched God help you realize you thought maybe you were on this end of the scale.
[time=226] But then some areas of your life, maybe you're more over here, and God's been stretching, and God's been growing you as I know he has in my life.
[time=234] And the outline of Colossians gives us a picture of how to go about this.
[time=238] The first two chapters of Colossians out of the four are very theological.
[time=243] They're very Christiological.
[time=244] They're very much about the preeminence of Jesus.
[time=247] Who is Jesus?
[time=248] What does that even mean for my life?
[time=249] We really looked at the doctrinal components of how a lot of times we think Jesus is prominent, but he's not preeminent.
[time=256] He's actually the son of God.
[time=257] He's the word that became flesh and dwelt among us.
[time=260] He is the living word.
[time=262] He is the living son of God, and he takes away the sin of the world.
[time=266] He defeated death.
[time=267] He defeated hell and the doctrinal theological components of that Paul starts with.
[time=272] And then the second two chapters where we've been the last several weeks are very much relational.
[time=277] We've talked about marriage.
[time=279] We've talked about parenting.
[time=280] We've talked about relationships, and they're very much practical.
[time=283] So he moves from theological doctrinal to very practical and relational.
[time=289] And I've come to realize that spiritual maturity requires both.
[time=293] It requires both.
[time=294] I know people and have been on both sides of this equation, I believe as well, that just value so much the theological, doctrinal, philosophical thinking of knowing the word of God.
[time=304] And that is exactly what we should do.
[time=305] But sometimes to the effect that we don't really focus on being practical.
[time=310] We don't really focus on being relational.
[time=312] We focus on being intellectual.
[time=313] The same thing can be true on the other end where we're all relational, we're all practical, we're all about helping others.
[time=319] But we don't really know why we believe what we believe.
[time=322] We don't really know the word of God.
[time=323] Spiritual maturity says it takes both.
[time=326] Jesus is the full embodiment of both.
[time=328] He is everything theological.
[time=329] Theological means a study of God.
[time=331] It's knowing who God is.
[time=332] Jesus is God and he walked among us.
[time=335] So he is theological doctrinal.
[time=337] All of our doctrine comes from him.
[time=340] He is the word, so he embodied that, but he also elevated relationships in a way that we've never seen and never will see again in all of human history.
[time=350] The best verse I can think of to show you that is John chapter 13, it's 34 and 35 where he says, I'm gonna give you a new command to which the people listening to him would have said, well, what is it?
[time=361] And he said, I want you to love one another.
[time=364] And they would have said something like that's not new.
[time=366] That's the oldest one in the book, Jesus.
[time=368] And he said, well, I'm not done.
[time=370] And he said, I want you to love one another the way that I have loved you.
[time=376] And everything changed.
[time=378] Everything about what it means to love, what it means to take the theological and build it into relational things and practical faith started to look different.
[time=387] Jesus showed us the way.
[time=388] And so we wanna follow his plan.
[time=390] And really, here's how we said it before, write this down, true spiritual maturity.
[time=394] True spiritual maturity is transformational, not just intellectual.
[time=400] Jesus showed us what it looks like to have a spiritual maturity that goes from the head to the heart, to the hands, that transforms us from the inside out.
[time=409] True spiritual maturity, it changes us in all of the spheres of our relationship.
[time=414] Let me show you this picture again.
[time=415] I've shown you many times before.
[time=416] Here's the spheres of your relationship.
[time=418] Here's your relationship with Jesus.
[time=420] And it touches all of these other areas, your relationships at home, your relationships with God's family, the church in the world.
[time=427] And then your relationships in the world, your workplace, the grocery store, all of those places where God has called you to be.
[time=433] It touches everything.
[time=435] And so with this in mind, this recap in mind, which sphere is God highlighting for you today?
[time=441] Because true spiritual maturity, it transforms the spheres of relationship.
[time=447] It's not just knowing who Jesus is.
[time=449] It's letting Jesus show up because you have a personal relationship with him.
[time=452] It shows up in all of those areas.
[time=455] That is what God has for us.
[time=457] And we start to live out the great commission.
[time=459] Jesus died, was buried, and rose again.
[time=462] And he appeared to hundreds of people, hundreds of people that have eyewitness accounts of seeing Jesus post-resurrection.
[time=469] And before he ascended to be with God in heaven, he gave us what we call the great commission.
[time=473] It's the marching orders for the church, Matthew 28, 19, and 20.
[time=477] And he said, at the beginning of that, he said, "Go, make disciples." Pretty simple, but the translation, the literal translation of that is as you are going, make disciples.
[time=488] As you have relationships in the world, make disciples.
[time=496] As you have relationships in your life groups, and in God's church, make disciples.
[time=501] And Paul, to close out his letter does two key things, to help us do just that.
[time=505] He gives us this practical priority.
[time=508] He makes a priority out of practical faith where the rubber meets the road.
[time=511] So this is gonna be a very practical sermon.
[time=513] I'm a practical theologian.
[time=515] That's how I try to operate and lead, because if it doesn't meet the road, then we don't look much like Jesus then do it.
[time=521] And so he gives a practical formula, and then he gives this list of people.
[time=524] Therefore, the practical people priority.
[time=527] Paul made a big priority out of those two things.
[time=530] Let's start with the first, and to do that, let's read verses two through six of Colossians chapter four.
[time=535] You ready for the word church?
[time=537] Chapter four, verse two.
[time=539] Paul writes, "Continue steadfastly in prayer, be watchful in it with thanksgiving.
[time=544] The same time, pray also for us that God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ on account of which I'm in prison." He's writing from prison house arrest in Rome to the church at Colossae.
[time=557] Verse four, that I may make it clear, which is how I ought to speak.
[time=561] Walk in wisdom toward outsiders, making the best use of the time, let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt so that you may know how you ought to answer each person.
[time=574] There's some practical faith.
[time=575] So let's talk now for a few moments about this five-fold formula for practical faith.
[time=580] Let me give that to you.
[time=581] Five-fold formula for practical faith.
[time=583] The first of these number one is prayerful.
[time=586] Write that down, prayerful.
[time=588] I'm gonna package it as five things you can do to really let the rubber meet the road.
[time=592] Let's talk about your prayer life for a moment.
[time=594] He says to steadfastly pray.
[time=596] Pray steadfastly, when I think of that word steadfast, it reminds me that I need to do it even when I don't feel like it.
[time=603] Some of you haven't prayed in a long time.
[time=606] So you feel like, well, what's the point?
[time=607] God never hears.
[time=609] I don't even really think he cares.
[time=611] I wanna challenge you.
[time=612] Pick back up this practical practice, this formula for a practical faith that Paul is giving us and pray even when you don't feel like it because you have a father who wants to listen.
[time=622] What is prayer?
[time=623] A lot of times we think it's the bowing our heads, folding our hands, getting on our knees.
[time=627] Those are great postures.
[time=628] They remind us that he's in control and that we're not.
[time=631] They're humbling, they're reverence, all giving things that we do physically.
[time=636] But really prayer is just a constant communication with your father.
[time=640] Paul writes to the church at Thessalonica.
[time=642] He says, "Pray without ceasing." It means it's a constant communication.
[time=646] Even when I'm driving, and so yes, that means you should be in constant state of prayer and communication with your father even when those words come to mind on the road.
[time=654] How many road ragers in the room, huh?
[time=656] Yeah, he's still listening.
[time=658] You didn't know, did you?
[time=659] You did know.
[time=660] It's constant communication where we stay in communication with him through all the ups, through all the downs of life.
[time=666] And how many of you've ever said a phrase, something like this?
[time=668] Well, I guess all I can do now is pray.
[time=670] I'm gonna raise my hand because I've said that before.
[time=673] It's not a trick question, but I am gonna correct it for a minute because I wanna remind you, listen, if all you can do is pray, then you have all you need.
[time=683] If all you have is prayer, you have all you need.
[time=687] We believe in prayer here at Black Hawk because we have a father who listens to us and gives us this opportunity and privilege to boldly approach his throne.
[time=695] And he cares for us.
[time=698] If prayer's all you've got, prayer is all you need.
[time=701] God doesn't need prayer.
[time=702] As you know that, he's already in your head.
[time=704] He knows your heart and he knows everything about you, but we sure do, don't we?
[time=708] And I wanna remind you that you need that.
[time=710] That's where a rubber meets the road in a practical faith.
[time=712] So be prayerful.
[time=713] Number two, write this down, be mindful.
[time=715] He says in verse two, continue steadfastly in prayer.
[time=717] Then he says, being watchful.
[time=719] That word watchful literally, it means awake.
[time=722] Think of the disciples at the Garden of Gethsemane.
[time=724] He said, keep watch, stay awake and they nod it off.
[time=727] Like some of you do during the sermon.
[time=729] Speaking of it, somebody's nodding off, just give them a nice little nudge, right?
[time=733] And that's what Paul is doing.
[time=734] He's saying, stay awake, stay vigilant, stay mindful.
[time=737] We need to be mindful of the schemes of the enemy.
[time=739] Did you know in those spheres of your relationships, there is a real enemy who wants to still kill and devour your family, your relationships in the world, the relationships you have in your workplace.
[time=750] He wants to tear down every single thing that God is doing in you and through you.
[time=756] So we need to be mindful.
[time=757] We need to be watchful of his schemes.
[time=760] But more than that, my friends, listen to this.
[time=762] I want you to be reminded today and Paul is reminding us we must be mindful of the power that works in us because greater is he who is in me than he who is in the world.
[time=774] The same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead lives in me.
[time=779] So my brothers and sisters, be mindful of the schemes of the enemy, but be more mindful of the power that works in us.
[time=788] The Holy Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead is working in you and be mindful.
[time=792] One of the prayers that I pray with our kids, so far from a perfect parent, but I hope this is one of the things they remember, well, a dad got this right.
[time=799] And my wife and I will often pray with our kids and we will pray for many things, but on the way to school, especially as we start our day, we'll always pray something like God, give us an opportunity to make a difference in somebody's life today.
[time=809] Over our staff, always pray God, interrupt our schedules so that we can see what you're doing around us.
[time=816] Be mindful of the opportunities to change somebody's life, to make an impact in somebody's life, to seize the moment, to make the best use of the time that God has given you.
[time=826] To be mindful, be prayerful, be mindful.
[time=829] Number three, be thankful.
[time=831] How many of you ate some good turkey this weekend because you're thankful?
[time=834] It's Thanksgiving weekend and we're called to be thankful.
[time=838] And so he says to continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful, still verse two, with what?
[time=842] With Thanksgiving, with Thanksgiving.
[time=845] And I wanna give you two action steps.
[time=846] Here's the first one this week.
[time=848] I've given it to you before, here it is.
[time=849] I wanna challenge you this week to write down and look at them on a sheet of paper or computer screen or something where you can literally see them with your eyes and the time of devotion.
[time=857] Write down 10 things you're thankful for.
[time=860] Well, that's an elementary homework assignment pastor.
[time=863] But when's the last time you really just stopped and paused and said thank you to God and really looked at why you can be thankful?
[time=868] So here's what I want you to do.
[time=869] Write it down and just simply share your list with a family member or friend.
[time=874] Just try it this week.
[time=875] And I believe as you go into the Christmas season you'll see your spirits lifted and you'll see, here's my challenge to you.
[time=880] Don't just let Thanksgiving be a holiday, let Thanksgiving be a habit.
[time=885] I don't know about you, but I don't want Thanksgiving to be a holiday in my life that comes around once a year.
[time=889] I want it to be a habit.
[time=889] I want it to be who I am.
[time=892] So that's my challenge to you.
[time=893] Be thankful, he says.
[time=894] Do it with Thanksgiving.
[time=895] Number four, evangelical.
[time=897] Be evangelical.
[time=898] That means we're focused on the gospel.
[time=900] We're focused on evangelizing.
[time=902] We're focused on sharing our faith through our stories and through sharing the word of God, helping other people to come to know Jesus.
[time=908] So number four versus three and four is evangelical.
[time=911] Paul says pray for me too, that God may open to us the door for the word, verse three, to declare the mystery of Christ.
[time=917] That's the gospel on account of which I'm in prison.
[time=920] So that verse four that I could make it clear, which is how I ought to speak.
[time=924] We're called to have an outward focus.
[time=927] We are called to reach the loss.
[time=928] We are called to prioritize what Jesus and Paul prioritize and Paul is saying, this is what I prioritize and for it, I'm in prison.
[time=937] Let's do the same thing.
[time=939] We are called to be evangelical.
[time=941] We're called to be outward focus.
[time=943] We're called to win the world for Jesus.
[time=944] Just one simple relationship at a time.
[time=947] Don't let this world distract you and get you focused on other things.
[time=951] This is why we say light the one five.
[time=952] That's our vision here at black called light the one five and it starts in our four, six, eight, one, five zip code across our streets, goes to the 15 surrounding zip codes, across our city, across our state, our nation and all the way around the world to 15 regions we've identified around the world where we just want to be light.
[time=968] Because listen as a church, we're not called to have the light of the world and to hide it under a bushel.
[time=973] No, those of you, the rest of you will catch it up if you were in Sunday school, you know the song.
[time=979] Hide it under a bushel?
[time=980] No, I'm gonna let it shine.
[time=985] We're not called to have the light of the world and to lock it behind our church building doors.
[time=990] Light is only good if it can illuminate darkness and we live in a dark world and we're called to go beyond our walls.
[time=996] The church is not the buildings of black called ministries.
[time=999] You and me, the believers, the body of Christ, we are God's church and we're called to take the light beyond our walls into the world so that it shines bright and stands out in the darkness.
[time=1012] And Paul's reminding us of that priority, that practical faith component that we must hold onto.
[time=1018] And if you saw our 10 before today, there's so many ways you guys are doing that.
[time=1021] You are an amazing church.
[time=1022] God is using you.
[time=1024] And a few of the ways right across our streets, Black Hawk Middle School is right beside us and we were able to provide 30 turkeys to some families there that would have need of that.
[time=1032] This is just some recent things, some local things.
[time=1034] I could go through a massive list 'cause you guys are so generous and God is using you in so many great ways.
[time=1039] Haley Elementary School right down the road from us.
[time=1042] Not only are we doing the winter warmth drive which is the hats, the coats, the gloves, you see the bends out in our foyer.
[time=1047] You can still donate to that by the way all the way through next Sunday, I believe it is.
[time=1051] So you can still do that.
[time=1052] That's going to people that have need of that at Haley Elementary.
[time=1056] But we're also going to be able to give some Christmas gifts, some apparel and some activity bags and things that we're able to do with them because of your generosity.
[time=1064] So some of these kids that may not only not have gifts but may not be able to have some of that apparel for their school time.
[time=1070] And so we're going to be able to be a part of doing that as a church.
[time=1073] You gave the Operation Christmas Child Boxes over 500 of those babies came in.
[time=1079] Can I get an amen?
[time=1080] Let's celebrate some of the stuff that God's doing because it's awesome.
[time=1083] We're called to be light.
[time=1084] This is why we say we light the one five.
[time=1087] So I ask you to be outward focused.
[time=1090] Focused on the lost.
[time=1091] Who's far from God but close to you?
[time=1094] Who's God called you to be a light and maybe the darkness of their life right now?
[time=1100] Paul, Jesus, they constantly made this a priority above everything else.
[time=1105] And I believe we should too.
[time=1106] Number five is relational.
[time=1108] Prayerful, mindful, thankful, evangelical, relational.
[time=1113] Verses five and six.
[time=1114] Paul says walking wisdom toward outsiders.
[time=1116] These are relationships here.
[time=1117] Making the best use of the time.
[time=1118] Let your speech always be gracious.
[time=1120] Season was sought so that you may know how you ought to answer each person.
[time=1125] If you ever wonder why a lot of your New Testament is in the form of letters that people wrote to churches, you ever wondered that?
[time=1133] Some of you're like, well, I do now.
[time=1134] Let's talk about it.
[time=1135] Let's ponder together for just a minute.
[time=1137] One of the reasons is very practical because that was the form of communication and Paul was in prison.
[time=1142] It couldn't go show up at this time at the church at Colossae.
[time=1144] So it just made sense.
[time=1145] They could send letters, they would be read between the churches as we'll see in just a few minutes.
[time=1149] So it was practical, but I also think it's relational.
[time=1152] God, listen, everything God does is intentional.
[time=1154] Everything God does is intentional.
[time=1157] And everything God does is relational because God is all about relationships.
[time=1162] And what I believe is a part of why letters are such a prominent part of the structure of the Word of God, the scriptures that we read from and know as God's inspired, authoritative words in our life is that letters are very relational.
[time=1178] They're personal, as we're gonna see, there's a priority of people.
[time=1182] Paul's gonna list out all these people.
[time=1184] It's gonna be so personal.
[time=1185] And the same is true for us.
[time=1187] It's God's love letter to us.
[time=1189] I love that God is a personal relational God.
[time=1193] And that's exactly what Paul is highlighting there in verses five and six.
[time=1197] And I'm gonna give you another action step.
[time=1198] The first one was your list of 10 things that you're thankful for.
[time=1201] You're all like, man, I didn't get this much homework in school, but it's gonna help you this week.
[time=1205] It's gonna make your Christmas way more thankful, way more practical.
[time=1209] Here's the second action step.
[time=1211] As the Word of God is full of letters, I wanna challenge you to write it, maybe for some of you who are afraid of a letter, maybe write a note.
[time=1217] Now for some of you write a letter to someone.
[time=1219] Who should I write a letter to, pastor?
[time=1221] Don't know, ask the Spirit to guide you and he'll prompt someone in one of those spheres of your relationship.
[time=1225] It might be somebody far from God, but they're close to you.
[time=1228] Write a letter to them and it could be to encourage them to share what God's teaching you through the Maturity University series and Colossians.
[time=1236] It could be an apology.
[time=1238] It could just be and I love you.
[time=1240] It could be three sentences, two sentences for those of you who are small on words.
[time=1245] But write a note.
[time=1246] I challenge you just one and send it out to them.
[time=1248] Mail it to them if they don't live close by or maybe deliver it to them.
[time=1251] But write a note and let your speech be gracious, not just in your letter, but also at those family gatherings because they are gonna be at the family gathering.
[time=1260] Who is they?
[time=1261] You already know.
[time=1262] And if you don't know, here's a little practical.
[time=1265] I'm gonna make it real practical for us.
[time=1266] If you don't know who they is that'll be at the family gathering, it's probably you.
[time=1270] That person is gonna be there.
[time=1275] Let your speech be gracious, season with salt.
[time=1277] And now let's go to verses seven through 17 where the people priority shows up because these are the people that have done this.
[time=1283] Let's read verses seven through 17 and you'll see this long list of names and then I'll give you a list of people that God uses that I think you can identify with and we can get practical together.
[time=1293] Verse seven, "Tikka kus will say that five times fast, will tell you all about my activities.
[time=1299] He is a beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord.
[time=1303] I have sent him to you for this very purpose that you may know how we are and that he may encourage your hearts.
[time=1310] And with him, Onesimus, our faithful and beloved brother who is one of you, he was a part of the church.
[time=1315] He was one of the slaves as we'll look at in just a moment who became a part of the church at Colossae.
[time=1320] They will tell you of everything that is taken place here.
[time=1323] Arastarchus, my fellow prisoner greets you and mark the cousin of Barnabas concerning whom you have received instructions.
[time=1330] If he comes to you, welcome him.
[time=1333] And Jesus, not that one.
[time=1334] And Jesus who is called justice.
[time=1337] These are the only man of the circumcision which means the Jews, only Jews among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God.
[time=1343] And they have been a comfort to me.
[time=1345] The pathris, he's the pastor, one of the pastors at the church at Colossae as we've looked at, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, greets you always struggling on your behalf in his prayers that you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God.
[time=1361] For I bear him witness that he has worked hard for you and for those in Laodicea and in Heropolis.
[time=1368] Luke, the beloved physician greets you as does Demus.
[time=1371] Give my greetings to the brothers at Laodicea and to Nympha and the church in her house.
[time=1378] And when this letter has been read among you, have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans and see that you also read the letter from Laodicea.
[time=1387] And verse 17 and say to archapace, see that you fulfill the ministry that you have received in the Lord.
[time=1395] And from that we see this list of what I'll call 11 types of people God uses.
[time=1399] Here's the first one, dependable people, write that down.
[time=1402] 11 types of people and I'll give you a name and the verses that go along with each one of them.
[time=1406] 11 types of people, yes, 11 points, but they're gonna go fast, come on, it's just a list.
[time=1411] 11 types of people God uses.
[time=1413] First of all, dependable people.
[time=1415] Take a kiss, he said, I know he'll get word to you.
[time=1417] He's dependable.
[time=1418] I know he's full of integrity, he's committed.
[time=1420] And as you go through this list, maybe just maybe you feel inadequate in how you are able to serve the Lord.
[time=1427] Maybe you feel like I just don't have what it takes.
[time=1430] I can't be like the people in scripture.
[time=1432] I can't be like the life group leaders or the pastors or these people or that people like my grandfather or my grandmother or my mom or my dad.
[time=1438] I can't measure up to all of them.
[time=1440] Notice that the list of people God uses might just surprise you.
[time=1444] I bet you can identify with at least a few of them.
[time=1447] First of all, being dependable.
[time=1448] Can people count on you?
[time=1450] He's a faithful person and Paul knew he could count on him.
[time=1453] Number one, dependable people.
[time=1455] God uses them.
[time=1456] Number two, transform people.
[time=1458] Onesimus is the one mentioned there.
[time=1460] He is a slave.
[time=1460] He talked about slavery and bond service and how many people during this time would have been in such a role.
[time=1466] But it's also important to know that Paul and the Bible and Jesus and Christianity very clearly condemned slavery.
[time=1471] I talked a bunch about that in just the last couple of weeks.
[time=1475] But this guy was transformed.
[time=1476] He was a slave.
[time=1477] We come to find out in the letter to Philemon, which is also a book of your Bible, that Paul wrote to Philemon, who would have been this fellow's owner and saying don't look at him any longer.
[time=1487] Receiving back, he had escaped, gotten away perhaps.
[time=1490] Don't look at him as a slave.
[time=1491] Look at him as a brother in Christ.
[time=1494] And Christianity comes along and masters, bosses, slave owners, and the slaves, like Onesimus, would end up going to church together.
[time=1504] And Onesimus became a leader in the church at Colossae.
[time=1507] Can you imagine that set up?
[time=1509] He's totally transformed, not just in his role from slave to church leader and the things that God's doing in his life, but from the inside out, he is transformed.
[time=1518] God uses transformed people.
[time=1522] And God is in the transformation business.
[time=1526] And he can even transform, yep, even you.
[time=1530] Number three is committed people.
[time=1532] Verse 10, Aristarchus.
[time=1534] We can read some about him in Acts chapter 20.
[time=1536] He's from Thessalonica.
[time=1538] He ministered with Paul in Ephesus.
[time=1540] And so you see implications of his ministry, even in Paul's letter to the Ephesians, the book of Ephesians in your Bible.
[time=1547] But then he goes with Paul to Rome, where now they're both in prison.
[time=1550] And scholars talk about, well, is he in prison in the same place and house arrest with Paul?
[time=1554] Is he in prison by the gospel?
[time=1555] People talk about different things, but the bottom line is he's in prison with Paul.
[time=1559] And let me just say, why do I say committed?
[time=1561] Why did I choose this word to describe Aristarchus?
[time=1564] Because if somebody follows you and goes with you even to prison, they're pretty committed.
[time=1569] Can I get a name in?
[time=1571] And some of you have people go to prison with you, maybe for the wrong reasons.
[time=1574] He went with Paul for the right reasons, one of the reasons of the gospel.
[time=1577] God uses committed people.
[time=1579] Number four is Mark.
[time=1581] Reconcile people.
[time=1582] Verse 10, Mark.
[time=1583] This is the Mark that wrote the gospel of Mark.
[time=1586] This is the Mark that you read his writing, his accounts of Jesus and his ministry in the second book of your New Testament.
[time=1593] But he's the cousin of Barnabas we learn as we read Paul's writing in verse 10.
[time=1597] But we also know that he and Paul parted ways.
[time=1600] People debate over why, why did they part ways?
[time=1603] Why did Paul and Barnabas therefore mark?
[time=1605] Why did they all part ways?
[time=1606] A lot of people think this has something to do with Mark.
[time=1608] Something Mark did, something Mark didn't want to do.
[time=1610] We don't know, they parted ways.
[time=1611] But what we see here is that Paul is mentioning him.
[time=1615] He's a reconciled person.
[time=1616] I think of 2 Corinthians chapter five, which is all about us being reconciled with God.
[time=1620] That's what that passage is about.
[time=1622] But from that, this is our vision of ambassadors.
[time=1624] 1500 ambassadors by our 60th anniversary that we develop and send as light giving people out in the world.
[time=1630] That's our vision, that's our hope.
[time=1632] So what happened here?
[time=1633] They reconciled in some way, at least they're reunited in Rome.
[time=1638] Mark is reconciled people as we're reconciled to God.
[time=1641] We reconcile with each other.
[time=1642] We reunite with other people.
[time=1645] And maybe God wants to do some reconciling, some reuniting through family members or with people this Christmas season.
[time=1652] And so God uses reconciled people.
[time=1654] Number five is present people, present people.
[time=1658] This is Jesus who is called justice.
[time=1660] Can you imagine being Jesus' justice in a time where now he's following Jesus?
[time=1665] I would imagine he probably says something like, look, just call me justice.
[time=1669] Not that Jesus, I'm just justice.
[time=1672] And you know, we don't see much about justice in verse 11, do we?
[time=1676] It just says, there he is, he's present.
[time=1680] But listen, some of you have been not following Jesus, not thinking God could do anything with you, feeling so inadequate for so long because you just feel like you bring nothing to the table.
[time=1691] This guy, we don't know much about him.
[time=1692] He might be a super skill guy.
[time=1694] He may not be a skill guy.
[time=1695] We don't know a lot about him, but what we know is listen, he's in the Bible.
[time=1698] It doesn't get much more impactful than that.
[time=1702] Why? He was present.
[time=1704] He was there.
[time=1705] You can just be present and show up to serve in kids' ministry.
[time=1709] You can just be present in those times where a family member, a friend is really struggling and you don't know what the words are that you should say, let your presence be the greatest gift that you give this Christmas season to them.
[time=1719] Be there, be present.
[time=1721] God uses present people.
[time=1724] Be present in the moments, just like justice.
[time=1727] I thank God for justice.
[time=1728] We've got some justices in the room and not just the one that plays the piano up there behind us, but we're all can relate with being present.
[time=1735] Number six is dedicated people.
[time=1737] This is a paphras, verses 12 and 13.
[time=1740] This is the pastor or one of the pastors at the church at Colossae.
[time=1743] We've learned a lot about him in the previous weeks.
[time=1745] He's a pastor, he's a servant leader and it says he's always working hard, praying for their maturity.
[time=1750] But I wanted you to note something.
[time=1752] Do you notice that he's not with them at the church?
[time=1755] They sent him out.
[time=1756] He's with Paul and Rome.
[time=1758] As he's talking about, he's here, he's doing all these things.
[time=1760] They sent him out.
[time=1761] And Steve, I thought about you.
[time=1764] And here's what we see with the paphras.
[time=1766] They're not, he's not even with them at the church at Colossae, but he's still of them.
[time=1771] He's still their family.
[time=1773] And that's why we value way above seating capacity.
[time=1776] We've got a beautiful facility and we want the seats filled so that people can come to Christ and be equipped and grow up in him for sure.
[time=1782] But more than that seating capacity, we're about to be in a sending capacity kind of church.
[time=1787] The church at Colossae even did that with their pastor.
[time=1789] Steve, Webster family, that's what we do.
[time=1792] We love you.
[time=1792] And even though our setup looks different as how we minister and partner together and co-labor for the gospel, we do it in some different settings in some different ways these days, we are family.
[time=1802] And that's the power of the word of God and the family of God.
[time=1806] That's the power of the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=1809] He makes us family.
[time=1811] I'm thankful for dedicated people like a paphras like Steve Webster and others in this room who fit that bill.
[time=1818] Skilled people's number seven.
[time=1821] Skilled people.
[time=1821] Luke was a doctor.
[time=1822] This is the Luke that wrote the book of Acts.
[time=1824] He wrote the gospel of Luke.
[time=1826] And he's a skilled person.
[time=1827] He has a skill, but probably at times thought, well, what can I do with that skill for the gospel?
[time=1832] Well, get this, between Luke and Paul and Mark.
[time=1837] The three mentioned here were written two of the gospels, the book of Acts, 13 letters of your New Testament, which equates to about 60% of your New Testament.
[time=1846] And Luke was probably someone that's like, he's maybe skilled at something.
[time=1849] And some of you have a skill, but you're like, well, I don't know how that skill could really be used for the kingdom.
[time=1853] Well, he wrote a lot of the Bible.
[time=1855] God used him to give to us his word.
[time=1857] God takes skilled people that are willing and he uses them for his glory.
[time=1861] And Luke is a reminder of that.
[time=1863] God uses skilled people.
[time=1865] I love number eight and it's redeemed people.
[time=1868] Redeemed people.
[time=1870] Demas, we know about Demas.
[time=1871] He's mentioned in verse 14, nothing else has said.
[time=1873] But in 2 Timothy 4, 10, we learned that Demas deserted Paul and their co-laborers.
[time=1879] Why?
[time=1880] Because of his love for the world.
[time=1882] We don't know what he did, but we know that he left them for the wrong reasons.
[time=1885] He didn't minister for the gospel because he ended up loving the earthly more than the eternal.
[time=1890] And that's all the Bible ever says about him.
[time=1892] And he's just dead to everyone that followed Jesus.
[time=1895] And all God's people said, amen.
[time=1896] No, not at all.
[time=1897] Paul writes about him.
[time=1899] Again, why?
[time=1900] Because evidently, there's redemption.
[time=1902] And I want to remind you that there's redemption for you too.
[time=1905] Some of you have turned your back on God.
[time=1907] Some of you in your relationship have said God is never there for me.
[time=1911] I'm not pursuing him anymore.
[time=1913] I'm stepping away from faith.
[time=1914] I hear these things often.
[time=1916] But I want to remind you, if that is you, you can relate with the redeemed person that is Demas, that God has never given up on you.
[time=1926] The redemption of Jesus Christ transcends all sin, transcends all of our blunders, all of our mistakes, all of us who think we are too far gone.
[time=1935] Jesus doesn't give up on us.
[time=1939] And Demas is listed here as a reminder for us that redeemed people are people that God uses.
[time=1945] And I thank God for that.
[time=1947] Number nine is hospitable people.
[time=1949] How many of you have the gift of hospitality?
[time=1950] You love to host.
[time=1952] Some of you may feel like, well, I can't really do anything for the kingdom of God.
[time=1955] Well, your gift of hospitality got Nympha into this list of the people priority.
[time=1960] She hosted a church.
[time=1962] He says, hey, give of greetings to Nympha and the church that's in her house.
[time=1966] She was a hospitable person that opened her home to a church.
[time=1970] And so some of you like, well, I could never lead a life group.
[time=1972] Well, could you host one?
[time=1974] We need hosts and we want life groups to expand all over the place.
[time=1977] So maybe you could be a hospitable person that God uses.
[time=1981] Number 10 is unified people.
[time=1983] Unified people.
[time=1984] He talks of the church at Laodicea and he says, hey, read their letter and make sure you read your letter to them.
[time=1990] They're unified.
[time=1991] Why did they read each other's letter?
[time=1992] They were different places.
[time=1995] And in today's world, listen, kingdom diversity.
[time=1999] Kingdom unity is powerful because we live in a world that is so divided.
[time=2004] And so what would it look like for God's church to be so united that it becomes the light, it becomes the venue, the crack through which light shines through the brightest if we're unified.
[time=2014] And the church at Laodicea, the church at Thessalonica, the church at Colossae, the church at Ephesus, the church at Black Hawk, the church of Fort Wayne, we're all so different, but unity is not uniformity.
[time=2025] Oneness is not sameness.
[time=2027] That's the beauty of the kingdom of God is that we are unified by one name as a diverse group of people with all kinds of differences, all kinds of backgrounds, but we come together as family in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2042] God uses unified people.
[time=2045] Let's be a unified church.
[time=2046] Who's with me?
[time=2047] Let's be a unified church.
[time=2049] Number 11, you made it all the way to the end, is called people, archapace.
[time=2055] He says to archapace, look at verse 17.
[time=2057] He says, see, tell archapace now, see that you fulfill the ministry that you've received from the Lord.
[time=2063] That would be like saying, Joe, this is a letter to the church that would get read in front of the whole church.
[time=2069] It'd be like saying, I'm a messenger here from the person that planted all these churches.
[time=2074] Joe, you better finish what God started in you.
[time=2077] You'd be like, yes, sir, right?
[time=2080] Can you imagine poor archapace?
[time=2081] I mean, he gets called out, but what I want you to see is that he was called.
[time=2085] He had a calling on his life.
[time=2086] Keep going with what God has done, and you don't feel called.
[time=2089] And listen, God didn't call you 'cause you're so equipped.
[time=2091] God equips you because he's called you, and God has a calling on your life.
[time=2095] And he's just getting started.
[time=2097] Some of you are ready to close the door on your calling, and God looks at you right now and says, I use called people.
[time=2104] Don't quit on your calling.
[time=2106] Don't give up.
[time=2107] Keep moving forward.
[time=2110] God uses call people.
[time=2111] Let's celebrate that.
[time=2112] If you believe it, celebrate that.
[time=2113] As God used, call people.
[time=2115] God's ready to use you.
[time=2119] And with that, we go to verse 18.
[time=2122] The last verse, thank you for letting me teach you all the way through the book of Colossians.
[time=2125] And in verse 18, Paul says, I Paul write this greeting with my own hand.
[time=2129] Remember my chains.
[time=2131] Grace, be with you.
[time=2132] He reminds us, remember the turmoil.
[time=2135] Remember the chains.
[time=2137] Grace is gonna go with you.
[time=2138] God goes before you.
[time=2139] Let me be an example for you and your own walk of faith.
[time=2142] Let me be an example for you.
[time=2145] And with that, I wanna point you back to a couple of key questions.
[time=2148] Who's far from God but close to you?
[time=2149] And as we ponder that question, look again at these spheres of relationships.
[time=2155] Which one has God highlighted for you this Christmas season?
[time=2160] Relationships at home, with your church family, the world, how can your relationship with Jesus change those?
[time=2166] That's the final question I wanna ask you is, how can you demonstrate maturity through engaging your circles of relationship?
[time=2172] Which one has God highlighted?
[time=2175] Let's become a beginner again.
[time=2176] Strap on our frozen backpack this week and go back to start, get back to the basics, make a practical faith that is people focus the same way that Jesus has called us to be with.
[time=2187] You buy your head, just ponder, what does that mean for you?
[time=2190] What relationship has God called you to step into this week?
[time=2194] Some of you are here in your believers and God showing you right now a certain circle, sphere of relationships that he's wanting to do something new.
[time=2201] And who's far from God but close to you?
[time=2203] How can you focus on that people priority, the practical faith priority this week?
[time=2209] Some of you don't know Jesus.
[time=2210] And God's brought you here today and you don't even know how you got here or why you're watching, but you know in this moment the spirit of God is drawing you and showing you that your sin separates you from God and it's true.
[time=2220] The wages of sin is death and it's an eternal death, but Jesus lived the sinless life you couldn't live, he died to pay a price for your sin, you could not pay.
[time=2229] And he rose from the dead, he's alive my friends.
[time=2233] And because he lives, as the song says, you can't just face tomorrow, you can face tomorrow, but because he lives you can have eternal life right now.
[time=2241] And I wanna challenge you to just receive the gift of salvation today.
[time=2245] Trust in Jesus, we're saved by grace through faith.
[time=2248] Not of works, we can't be good enough to do it on our own, but Jesus already paid it all.
[time=2254] In your own words, will you just ask him to save you and forgive you, trusting in him today?
[time=2258] And God will meet you right where you are as we reflect and respond.
[time=2261] Take a moment and do just that.
