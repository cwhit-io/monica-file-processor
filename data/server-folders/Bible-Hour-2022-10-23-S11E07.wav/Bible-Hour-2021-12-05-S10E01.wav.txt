[time=0] Well, good morning church. I am so glad to see all of you. What a sweet time of worship we have
[time=7] already had and aren't you glad? Aren't you glad that that song can be true of even someone like me
[time=14] and even someone like you because the spirit where he leads, he goes with us, he goes before us, he empowers us, but he takes us beyond our bubbles. We've said our vision is to go beyond
[time=25] the black hawk bubble. And that means we all have to go beyond our comfort zone. And speaking of that, there's a gentleman standing right here. You may know him. His name is Pastor Steve Webster and his family has been on that journey. That's right. Give it up for Steve. Let's welcome into the stage. Steve, for a little while now we've talked about kind of tag team preaching. And so we are
[time=45] going to get to that in just a minute. We're going to kick off the sermon together today. But a few things I want to share with you about Steve. If you weren't with us, we commissioned, which simply means we prayed over Steve's family, the Webster family and agreed with God on the call
[time=61] that he has placed on his life. Steve, thank you for allowing me to walk on that journey with you for many months now. And I just am so proud of you. I'm proud to call you my brother. I'm proud to call you a co-laborer here. But now as that looks a little different, we get to pastor, we get to
[time=77] lead in the name of Jesus still together just as much family and even more so. And so I'm thankful
[time=83] for you. I'm thankful for the investment. Steve's been a part of our school and our church as a pastor for many years now. And so we send him, he is going to be the lead pastor at Woodburn Missionary
[time=94] Church. And to our Woodburn family, we're all on the same team. And we send Steve saying to you, what a blessing you are in for. Can I get an amen church? Yeah, yeah.
[time=103] Well, Steve, our vision over this next seven or eight years as we go to our 60th anniversary is,
[time=112] we want to develop and send through our discipleship journey ambassadors. Second Corinthians 5, we are reconciled with God. And because of that, we become ministers of reconciliation. And we are
[time=123] now ambassadors of Christ. So we represent a kingdom that's not of this world. And that's why we're all on the same team. Wherever we go, that is true of us. And you are the greatest sermon illustration I could think of today. You have been living that out. And even our give light offering as we're talking about it coming up next week, it's all about sending and developing and equipping ambassadors locally and globally all over the world. You've been living that. So I wanted to give you a chance to share with the church in a couple of ways. So I asked you, would you share it with through video, just a heartfelt message of your heart, what God's done in you. And if you
[time=157] didn't get that through email, you can go to blackhawk.fii. And it's kind of a parting words, a closing challenge, even though it's still just to see you later, you're right down the road. We're still going to be partnering in tons of ways. So you need to check that out 12 minute video from Pastor Steve. But also wanted us to be able to get up on stage together today. And I wanted to hear from you, Steve. I've been watching some of this. So proud of you. Love you dearly. Would you share with your church family just a little bit about what God's done in you, in your family, as you stretched, as you've grown, as you've waited, as you discern God's will, as now you step outside
[time=190] of a comfort zone. This has been a comfortable place for you for a lot of years. And so tell us a little bit about what God did in that. And anything else you'd like to share?
[time=198] Sure. Please watch that video. It represents really my heart for you for this place.
[time=204] I crammed a five minute video into 12. So there's that. So grateful for the chance,
[time=212] Kevin. I've never had a brother, but I really do view Kevin as a younger brother, much younger
[time=218] brother. And I'm proud of you too. Don't you forget it either.
[time=221] I'm proud of you too. That's right. I won't. I won't. Thank you, man.
[time=224] It has been a very comfortable place. Woodburn Missionary Church recognized early in this process
[time=231] how much I love this place. And we're frankly a little nervous about it. How much I love Blackhawk and how I'm not moving in from Iowa or someplace. I'm just down the road.
[time=239] So that's been something that we've been. I'm not coming back next week, friends. This is the long goodbye is over for Steve today. So I'm not coming back next week. But thank you for being so
[time=250] gracious, Kevin, with my family. And really, this very much is ascending.
[time=254] It very much is a commissioning from the very first moment's friends.
[time=257] Linda and Kevin and the church leadership has been blessing all along the way and praying
[time=264] along how can we support you and enable it. So that means a lot to me, Kevin. So thank you.
[time=268] Doesn't always go that way. And it has here. I'm so, so grateful. Walk in the building this morning. I love this place. Everything I learned about being a pastor, I learned in this place.
[time=278] And so I'm just so grateful. My heart's very full this morning.
[time=280] [AMEN] Yes, we always say we are more about sending than seeding. And this is our chance to live that out in a lot of ways. And so we're really excited to see what guys got in store for you. But own your way because you start officially tomorrow.
[time=294] Correct.
[time=294] Yes.
[time=295] So own your way to be able to do that. We get to preach for a few minutes together.
[time=299] Yes.
[time=300] And today we are going to be in Luke chapter one. Luke chapter one, we're kicking off kind of a Christmas focus. This will segue into our give light offering next week, but also a focus that
[time=310] Steve that we're going to go into for several weeks. But today's passage, Luke chapter one, verses 67 through 79 is where we're going to be focusing.
[time=318] This is a prophecy often called even a songs of Zachariah. And this just so happens to be,
[time=325] I found out through this process is Steve and I particularly were talking about how we wanted to go about today and kicking off the message. I think the first sermon that you preach, as far as you can remember, way back when, right? Way back when, when Steve started preaching, was this passage. And so Steve.
[time=342] Before Blackhawk.
[time=343] So there you go.
[time=344] Yeah.
[time=344] So Steve, I think it's fitting. Would you kick us off?
[time=346] So this is Zachariah. He is the father of John the Baptist as we know him. And so tell us a little bit about the history, what's going on in the coming of Christ, the first Christmas, but specifically about Zachariah. What's happening in this time of this passage?
[time=359] There's a lot going on, Kevin. So in the first part of Luke's gospel, an angel comes to visit Zachariah and Elizabeth who are not young folks.
[time=368] And the angel tells them you're going to have a baby. And they say, I'm sorry, what?
[time=372] Excuse me. And because of that, because of Zachariah's legitimate question, he doesn't speak for nine months. His speech is removed for nine months.
[time=382] The first thing he says after nine months is what we see in the past, Kevin's going to walk you through this morning. And it is Kevin a favorite. It has been a favorite of mine for a long time.
[time=392] The angel tells Zachariah and Elizabeth, his mother, that he'll be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb. It's just remarkable. The Holy Spirit, friends, is all over the first
[time=402] two chapters of Luke. Read it with those lenses and it will really jump out at you. The Holy Spirit fills Zachariah's before he gives his prophecy. The Holy Spirit is filled. John Baptist is filled
[time=413] with him from his mother's womb. Zachariah's, his wife Elizabeth, goes to visit Mary, the mother of Jesus. And when Mary walks in the room to greet Elizabeth, the baby within Elizabeth, John the Baptist,
[time=427] leaps for joy. There's a lot to be said there about the unborn to be sure, Kevin, and it's been said before it should be said again. But the fact that this unborn child is capable of joy and responds to Jesus in that way, the Holy Spirit, responding to the Holy Spirit,
[time=442] the Holy Spirit over shadows Mary, causing her to become pregnant with the Son of God. So all throughout this passage, the Holy Spirit is everywhere present, enabling, empowering,
[time=452] going before. And Zachariah, the first thing he says after nine months is this is him of praise.
[time=458] I think my first word may have been a little different. It may have been like, finally.
[time=461] I'm going to ask you, what would you say if you could, we like to talk, Steve, you and I?
[time=464] We do like to talk. What would be the first thing you would say? Yeah, I don't know.
[time=467] What would you say, right? Maybe him a praise. I don't know. But yes, that's what's going on before this prophecy is that the angels have been visiting. This whole thing is supernatural from beginning to end. Zachariah's, his wife, Elizabeth, has gone to visit Mary and now the times come for John to be born. And I think you make a very important point for us as we go
[time=486] into the Christmas season, not just our study of the Christmas story for the next several weeks, but Steve, you talked about how the Holy Spirit is all over this passage, but he's all over every passage, as you pointed out, of Christmas. Every single story that we look at in the coming days, every person, the Holy Spirit's presence is there. And I think it's interesting because Emmanuel, this is what Christmas is all about. The world will often take Christ out of Christmas, but it is all about Christ. It's the coming of God. The word may flesh dwelt among us. Jesus is Emmanuel. It means God with us. That's what Christmas is about.
[time=518] And I love that the Holy Spirit is such an emphasis, Steve, in the Christmas story as it's recounted in Scripture, because that's what the Holy Spirit is. The Holy Spirit is the presence of God, the same power that raised Jesus from the dead, dwells in us. And to think of that, this Christmas season,
[time=533] as we look, as Steve said, through that lens, at the presence of God, both in the Holy Spirit, as the presence of God in us and through us, we see it also in this passage. We see it in the workings of Christmas. What a beautiful thing, right? There's so much going on even before the very familiar Luke 2 passage. Luke 1 is just, and this is of course a great example, but at the end of it, remarkably full part of Scripture. Absolutely. Steve, I happen to know
[time=558] you have a favorite part of this passage. I do. As I would love for you to share with us, we're going to read it in just a minute, but we have lots of favorites to you and I, lots of favorites. I know, yeah. And if you haven't been with us very long, I think we've kind of all adopted my mentality as well. I say, oh, this is my favorite or one of my favorite. I've finally got to where the whole thing's that, right? All 66 books. Yeah. They're all my favorite.
[time=577] But I know one stands out. Would you share with us? What is it before we read that passage?
[time=581] Yes. What stands out to you? This may be your favorite. I think my parents are watching online.
[time=585] My mom's dad, Kevin, used to make plaques for suttons in his church up in Detroit, Michigan.
[time=591] And there's one hanging in my classroom right up there. And it says, "The hinge of history is on the door of a Bethlehem stable." And Luke 1.78 says, Chip read it earlier,
[time=602] "The sunrise from on high has visited us or will visit us." All our translations give that as day spring. He is the day spring from, that's probably my
[time=613] favorite of the names for Jesus or one of them, at least. I love the fact that everything before,
[time=619] it's as though everything before Christ came was the night and everything after him is the day.
[time=624] I think about the hymn, "O Holy Night," the thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices. For Yonder breaks a new and glorious morn. The sunrise is in Indiana.
[time=636] Watch the video. I'll talk more about it. But I did prepare the way a little bit for that.
[time=640] The sunrise is a beautiful example of hope. And Christ's appearing in the world, the weary world.
[time=645] It's rejoicing at his appearing. But I love that image, Kevin, of everything before Christ.
[time=650] It's as though it was night. Everything after him is as though it's the day.
[time=654] And it's right for us to make much of Christmas. It's right for us to make much of Jesus, because he is the hinge of history. Everything hinges on him and his appearing. As you mentioned,
[time=664] Emmanuel got with us. I think that that's part of why I've long been captivated by this particular
[time=670] section of Scripture. And Zacharias' song. Wow. That'll preach to you. It will indeed.
[time=674] Indeed. That'll preach church. That's some good stuff. And it just so happens, I was informed.
[time=679] I was here before the sun came up, just praying and preparing for today. But I heard that there was a beautiful sunrise today. You're at the maybe the later service. So maybe some of you didn't know. But those of you who did, beautiful sunrise. And I love that it represents the newness of a day that I think of the passage. God's mercies are new. Every morning. Yes.
[time=698] And also think of your new season as you step out in comfort zone. You're living out the song, we just sang. And so Steve, we affirmed and just agreed with God and commissioned you and prayed
[time=709] over you last week in your family in that regard. And so we send you with all the love. But I would love to ask you, and I know you would love the opportunity to, as we prayed for you last week,
[time=719] as you began a new journey, would you pray for our give light offering specifically? But would you just pray over your church family as we send you with all the love and the continued partnership that we got in the day? I won't stop praying. I won't stop praying for you all. And that is what I'd love to do this morning. Please do. Okay. Oh, Heavenly Father, thank you
[time=738] for Black Hawk Ministries. Thank you for my brother Kevin and for his family. God, I just pray that you would go before this body of believers, this church in this season of its life.
[time=750] Father, this church has a long history of generosity this time of year. And I pray,
[time=756] God, that would be the case again in the coming days. I pray, God, that as Zacharias said, that the appearance of Christ would give light to those who live in darkness and shadows,
[time=767] that this offering God would also give light. God, there is no separation between that living
[time=773] water that Jesus represents and that physical water that our dear brothers and sisters in South Sudan need so desperately. The physical needs, the spiritual needs coming together. God, this is a time for that. And so I pray that this season would be a blessed one for this particular body of believers. God, go before them. Give them your grace. I pray, God, that this offering would be, again, light, that we would light the one-five God, which is not only our local
[time=798] communities, but all across our world. God, may it be so. Go before my brothers and sisters here at
[time=805] Black Hawk. Be with them. God, bless them. Draw them close together. I pray this would be a season of time, God, for all hands on deck of service, of connection, of community, of giving. God,
[time=817] all of it, may it be so. I commit my dear church family here, God, to you, and to your very capable
[time=823] hands, knowing that you will go before them, that you have in this long history of this church
[time=829] guide, you're going to go before them even so. May it be so. I proud those things in the name of Jesus, the day spring, the sunrise from on high. Amen. Amen. Can we thank Steve for his service and
[time=840] yeah, love your brother. Amen. Amen. I always wanted to get to preach where you, Steve. This will,
[time=849] let's say we make a habit of this. Let's do it again sometime. For sure. Hey, church, let's look at that passage, shall we? I want to talk to you today about what Steve just prayed over, giving light and darkness. That's what I want to talk to you about today. Giving light and darkness, and we're going to take that passage now and just really look at one verse together. It's actually verse 79. Steve referenced verse 78 about the sunrise. And so let's read that passage together
[time=873] today. Giving light and darkness. Again, this is Zachariah, father of John the Baptist. And Gabriel
[time=879] came to him and told him about them having a son and was made because of his unbelief,
[time=885] mute for this nine months. And this is the first thing that he had to say. So I say, let's hear him. You ready for the word today? Let's dig in. Luke chapter one starting in verse 67 says, "And his father Zachariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied saying, 'Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he has visited and redeemed his people. He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David. As he spoke by the mouth of his
[time=911] holy prophets from old, that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate
[time=917] us to show the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant, the oath that he swore
[time=924] to our father Abraham to grant us that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies,
[time=930] might serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all our days." And you
[time=938] child, now speaking specifically of John the Baptist, and you child will be called the prophet of the most high, for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways, to give knowledge of salvation
[time=949] to his people and in the forgiveness of their sins. And then he shifts a focus to who he's
[time=955] preparing the way for, verse 78, "Because of the tender mercy of our God whereby the sunrise shall
[time=961] visit us from on high, to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,
[time=970] to guide our feet into the way of peace." And may God just bless the reading of his word and those
[time=976] first words that Zachariah spoke, may they actually show up in our lives this week. I want to give
[time=982] you, as we looked at verse 78, "The sunrise has come from on high." This is Christmas. That is the Christmas message. It is that God came to dwell with us. He sent forth his son, and aren't you glad
[time=993] he did, that we have a reason to celebrate this Christmas more than just the presence that we will receive. But I want to focus on verse 79, verse 79, to give light. This is one of the only
[time=1004] places you'll see this phrase, and it's where we get an idea of what we do when we give light at our year-end offering every single year, to give light to those who sit in darkness in the shadow of death, for what reason, to guide our feet into the way of peace. I want to break this verse into three parts and give you three shifts that I think are represented, not only in Zachariah's words, but also could be represented, should be represented in our own lives as we follow Jesus. Here's the first one. Write this down. "The shift from get to give, to give light." That's the first part of verse 79,
[time=1037] "from get to give." How many of you have noticed that we live in a consumer culture,
[time=1043] especially this time of year? What are we going to get for Christmas? What are we going to receive?
[time=1047] What are we going to get? It's all about consumerism. We live in a culture that is very
[time=1053] consumeristic, yet the call of Christianity is contribution. In a consumer culture,
[time=1060] the call of Christianity is contribution. We're not called to consume. We're not called to just be a
[time=1067] consumer-minded group of people. We're called to be the most giving, the most generous, the most contributing group of people on the planet. And so we see this shift even as this song, this hymn of
[time=1079] Zachariah, the first words that he spoke after these nine months, you see that shift. And I've said this to you many times before, but I want you to write it down in ponder at this Christmas, I believe we're never more like God than when we give. I believe that with all my heart.
[time=1093] Some of somebody should say, "Prove it, pastor." Okay, I will. I want to show you a verse you might
[time=1099] be familiar with. This is John chapter 3 and verse 16. And it says, "For God so loved the world that he gave." What did he give? He gave his only son. Why? "That whoever believes in him should not perish
[time=1113] but have everlasting eternal life." Aren't you glad God gave? There would be no celebration this
[time=1120] Christmas if God didn't give. There would be no hope for eternity if God didn't give. And I would
[time=1126] say that that's exactly why I believe with all my heart that we're never more like God than when we are generous. Yet we live in a culture that tells us to hoard and to hold and to have closed
[time=1139] fist. God says in that culture, open your hands. Be generous and trust God. I'm glad that he did
[time=1147] that with us. And I know what some of you might be thinking. It's like, man, I finally come to church or maybe you got drug to church. How many of you have the drug problem I had growing up?
[time=1155] It was I got drug to church Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, whenever the doors were open. I was drug. There are any other people with that drug problem. Maybe you got drug here today and you're like, see, this is why I don't go to church. They just want my money. They're just talking about an offering. And so you may ask and fairly so why the give light offering? Why do we make such a big deal of that and talk about it for all of these weeks? Why are we so much about generosity here? And I'm glad you asked. If you feel that way, I think it's an excellent question. And I would tell you this, that I believe that because God is so generous, he doesn't need our money. He doesn't
[time=1187] want something from us. He wants something for us. God nor this church wants to get your money.
[time=1194] He wants to make sure that your money and your resources though don't get you. And we live in a culture that will lead you down that path so quickly. I want with all of my heart for you,
[time=1206] as God does, for you to be able to live in the joy of generosity. There is no greater joy than
[time=1214] looking like God through being a generous person. I believe that totally. In Acts chapter 20,
[time=1220] Jesus is quoting, if you don't believe me, let's go to Acts chapter 20 verse 35. And this is a great give light verse about what we should be doing, but it ends with a quote from what Jesus said.
[time=1229] In all things, I have shown you that by working hard in this way, we must help the week, great give light verse. And remember the words of the Lord Jesus Christ, how he himself said, it is more blessed to give than to receive. And I don't know about you, but I have found that to be
[time=1245] so true in my life. I'm thankful for generous people, thankful for generous parents who taught
[time=1251] me to tie. They bought me a bank that had all these categories. It was spending and I wouldn't add for fun, but the right in the middle was the church because God wants us to give to the Lord.
[time=1261] He wants us to give to him. When you give it Black Hawk, you don't give to Black Hawk. You give to the Lord through Black Hawk. And that was God's plan that we bring our first fruits. And we'll talk about that the first of the year, like we do every year. Why? Because God wants something for us, not something from us. God just doesn't want to get our money. He owns the catalog on a thousand hills. He owns the universe. He created the world. He holds the universe in his hands. He doesn't need us, but he wants to invite us to look like and to be like him in giving light. This is why we bring
[time=1291] our first fruits and we do it through the church. This is why we have an offering every single year. And I'm thankful to be a part of a church that has that kind of a culture. And I'm glad that I've had examples that showed me to give, even if I didn't have money to give. Some of you have
[time=1306] those stories and I've learned my experience. My wife and I made that commitment and I can say honestly we have upheld that commitment since we got married at our young ages. And it's one of the greatest joys of my life. And there were times we didn't have anything to give, but we would give out of nothing. And just today I had some people that came, one particular person
[time=1326] that came and they didn't have anything, but they put it in a give light envelope, just a couple of bucks. And it reminded me of the widow's mind, where Jesus said, "I want to tell you, all these people are dumping big amounts, but this widow who put in less than a penny, she's given more than all of them." And I want to remind us of that. Not just for our give light offering next week, but as a mindset for us. But next week specifically Curtis walked you through a few things about the well. And I want you to hear a little bit more about that. This is one of the pictures we showed you. This is Pastor Wool. And I want you to hear from him actually now. I've got a video that he took. And so we'll let you see that. This is Basim. We call him our modern-day Paul. He pretty much, wherever we go, we won't Basim there. The Lord's hand is on this guy's life. Basim, you watch. I know sometimes we love you. We love you, Pastor Wool. But Basim just is an incredible
[time=1373] man of God as is Wool. And as is are so many of these people we get to minister with. This is in a wheel in South Sudan. And you say, "Well, why are they already doing the well?" We haven't done the give light offering yet. Because we lead by faith around here. And we know God's going to provide them. Because of generous people who've gone before us, we knew that we could pull this off.
[time=1391] And we took a step by faith so that when I and the team of about eight people get there and at the end of January, this could be launched. And what I'll get to do is I'll get to represent you. And whoa, I can't wait. It's going to be fun. I'm going to get to represent you as we unveil and kind of launch this in this community right around the corner from Pastor Wool's church that he started.
[time=1411] He grew up here. His home is close to there. And it will change lives. It will change generations
[time=1417] with physical water. But I get the privilege to represent you and preach about living water.
[time=1422] Praise God for that. And I want you to absolutely go ahead and celebrate them.
[time=1427] But I want you to hear directly from Pastor Wool as they were drilling the well at night. And the people you'll see are not workers. They're just so excited. They're gathering around watching this process unfold as they drill the well. Check out this video. They're drilling. Machine is working at night. They are now drilling as you see the light and the hoister. They are working.
[time=1448] All the inhabitants of this area, they are very happy because they will have clean water as soon
[time=1457] as they see the machine are already and everybody's working. The technicians are here.
[time=1463] This is the wonderful work we are celebrating today. Though the water farm is not here ready.
[time=1470] But people now have a hope that they will have the clean water for drinking. So God bless you,
[time=1477] dear brothers and sisters. Black Hawk Ministry Church. We are so grateful and thankful to
[time=1484] you a great support that you have did to the people of our wing especially around our church where
[time=1490] we are witnessing and telling the people of our the love of Jesus Christ. So this is a great
[time=1496] manifestation for the love of our Lord Jesus Christ to all the people all over the world.
[time=1503] You have really shown the practical love to these people. And you will soon hear the testimonies
[time=1511] of people occurring to Christ and knowing the Lord through what you have did.
[time=1518] This is not in vain but the Lord will rewatch you and will fill your hearts with peace in the name of Jesus Christ. Thank you once again. Thank you everybody contributed.
[time=1531] Everybody is in support praying for us. We appreciate everything you have did
[time=1537] in the name of the love this day. Thank you.
[time=1541] Amen. Let's celebrate that. Yeah.
[time=1545] To see the heart of those people I was there just this last year and to know what's going to happen
[time=1553] is a perfect example of what Jesus meant when he said it's better to give than receive.
[time=1559] I'm glad to be a part of a generous church and I pray that that shift can continue to happen in you and I challenge you to do three things as we go into next week. Church Acts chapter four is what we'll read next week and they took everything they had. All of the people all of the people there
[time=1573] of God's church in the book of Acts chapter four brought all that they had. This is 100% participation. The match that we've talked about that's what we want to drive. The amounts take care of themselves because at the end of that passage it says there were no needs among them.
[time=1587] God's going to meet our needs as we just all participate. We all give sacrificially to Jesus.
[time=1591] It's his birthday and we want to challenge you. Give your most sacrificial gift of the season to Jesus. Whatever that looks like. Three things I'd ask of you. Pray. Pray and ask God this week.
[time=1600] What do you have you to give? Number two, prepare. Prepare. Pre-decide what you're going to give.
[time=1605] Don't just come on that morning and say I don't know we'll write a check for this. You can do that and certainly people will but what a blessing it is to prepare and pre-decide based on your prayer
[time=1615] what God has asked you to do and come and bring that as an offering of worship to our God.
[time=1619] Number three is participate. We're going to get up. It's going to be a different kind of a day.
[time=1623] If you can join us and you watch us online and it's safe and you're in the area and you're able to do so come join us. It's just a sweet spirit in the room next week. Pray. Prepare. Participate.
[time=1632] That's my request of us. My challenge to us. The first shift is from get to give. The second one, write this down, is from to in. From to in. Second part of that verse is to give light but to those
[time=1645] who sit in. Somebody say in. Sit in darkness and in the shadow of death. No doubt this passage is
[time=1654] talking about how Jesus has come to do that but it's a picture of what we're called to do as a church and I also happen to know that many of us are going through a shadow of death. Many of us
[time=1666] feel like we sit in darkness in your heart and nod the head of your heart if you agree with that.
[time=1672] Some of you came today because you sit in darkness and so you can not only participate in being a
[time=1678] part of a church that's doing this but you can also relate with who benefits from this shift. And let me talk about what the shift is. We tend towards wanting deliverance from our situations. Can I get an amen? And it's not wrong to pray those prayers and we all do. We say, God get me out of this problem, right? Get me out of this mess. And we often won't God to deliver us from problems but God oftentimes most wants to meet us in the problems. And sometimes
[time=1706] the best thing we can do is we go through things in our life as we go through times of darkness and seasons as such is to maybe not focus so much on what we can do to get delivered from the problem
[time=1718] but maybe see what God wants to do in the problem, in the season of darkness that we are in because
[time=1725] I've learned this. If my hope is in a situation then another situation that may give me more hope
[time=1732] will also come along and take me away the same hope. If your hope is in a situation you're going to lose hope because of another situation. How many of you ever lived life that way and you hop from situation to situation. Today I want to tell you this though that if my hope is in the Savior no situation can take it away. This is the difference of living the mentality of
[time=1754] being delivered from a situation to letting God work in a situation. There's a big difference.
[time=1761] Zechariah talks about light being given to those in darkness and you notice the first part of that passage was all about deliverance from, right? Again it's not bad and no doubt they saw the Messiah,
[time=1772] the coming king as one who had come with all these military honors and he would overthrow Rome and the people of God would be elevated because he comes and he takes charge. So they're like
[time=1783] where's this this huge warrior king? And then the Messiah comes as a little baby
[time=1789] born in a stinky stable, a helpless, innocent, able to do nothing little child. Because God
[time=1800] often does things in the most unique, the most unexpected of ways and the same thing is true in
[time=1806] your situation. You may be looking to get delivered from the situation but God wants to enter in
[time=1812] the situation maybe in ways that are unexpected. Sometimes this deliverance comes in the darkness and light shines best, light shines best in dark places. If you held a flashlight up to the sun
[time=1824] you're not going to see much of a contrast but we live in a world that has a dark backdrop and because of that dark backdrop, listen the good news is Christmas means that Jesus came once but
[time=1835] it reminds us that Jesus is coming again. We sang about that earlier and when he comes again darkness will be no more. Death will be no more but in the middle of the dark season that we live,
[time=1847] we have a dark backdrop that will never give us a better opportunity to shine the light of the
[time=1853] gospel, to shine the light of Jesus. While we are in this season with the hope of knowing Jesus is
[time=1859] going to make everything right and fix everything. Some of you came today and you just need to hear that. Can I get a name in? I needed to hear that and you know that and because you know that whatever you're in today can be a backdrop for the light of the gospel to shine in you and through
[time=1874] you. But the truth is we often think of God's presence, the presence of God coming to earth in Christmas time. We think of God's presence in terms of convenience or comfort. We don't often think of God's presence as something that brings chaos and conflict but in fact Christmas the coming of God to earth was a clash of kingdoms. It was the kingdom of God coming down to the kingdom
[time=1896] of earth and the two were not very congruent and the whole point of Christmas is that the kingdoms clashed and people got confused and there was conflict and we still live in the midst of
[time=1907] that conflict and Jesus has already won the battle over that conflict. But a lot of times we get it mixed up and we think the presence of God is just going to bring convenience and comfort. When in fact it brings some conflict and some inconvenience and some beyond the bubble opportunities to go
[time=1924] beyond our comfort zone. The shepherd's response, do you remember it? When the angel of the Lord, the presence of the Lord came and said the baby was going to come. It says that they were very afraid. They were very afraid. Mary was afraid. Joseph was confused. Zachariah didn't believe
[time=1937] when Gabriel came to him and his mouth was closed. His voice was gone and after nine months this is
[time=1944] what he had to say and he believed. But that conflict that is Christmas, the coming of the presence of God, leads us to really recognize that shift from the from to the end. And then lastly
[time=1956] to to through, to through. The last part of the verse says to guide our feet, to give light to
[time=1962] those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, the valley of death. Why? To guide our feet
[time=1969] in the way of peace. Circle that word way. It's a big difference than maybe what you've possibly viewed peace as. And this is where I would point you to the shift from to to through.
[time=1980] A lot of times we think of peace as something that we get to. And in our world we tend to view peace as getting to a destination where God wants to be our peace to get us through this season
[time=1991] to the end goal, to the destination that is eternity. Big difference. Maybe you've been
[time=1997] misdiagnosing and misdefining peace in your life. Light shines bright as God does just that.
[time=2004] So I want to challenge you today. Here's how I think we should view our valleys.
[time=2008] Here's how we should view them. View your valleys. You must view your valleys as transportation,
[time=2014] not destination. A lot of you thought peace. Let me give you an example. 2022 is on the way.
[time=2020] And you think if I could just get past 2021 and I could get to 2022, the flip of that number,
[time=2026] peace, a destination, a place I can get to, the flip of a number, I know it's going to be a better
[time=2033] year. So if I could just get to this destination of peace, then all is going to be okay.
[time=2038] Here's the problem with that. You will still be there in 2022. You're your biggest problem.
[time=2045] Did you know that? I'm the hardest person I've ever led. You're the hardest person you'll ever lead. We'll still be there. Most of our settings and circumstances and problems, they'll probably still be there too. They don't just go, oh, there's a two instead of a one.
[time=2058] Let's just relent and give them a break. Life still happens. People are still going to be people in 2022. And because of that, I think the whole point of peace, he said, it's the way of peace,
[time=2069] not the way to peace did Zachariah. It's the way of peace. We don't view it as a destination.
[time=2076] It's transportation. It's God's means of carrying us through something to get to what ultimately
[time=2082] will be our destination, which is eternal life. Peace is way bigger than maybe what we think it
[time=2088] is. And I'll give you a verse Psalm 23, the 23rd Psalm. This is my favorite verse in that Psalm because it says, "Even though I walk," you all got to say that with a lot of conviction if you want me to wrap up this sermon. You ready? "Even though I walk," that may be the loudest y'all have ever been, right? They're ready for lunch today. "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for you or with me, your rod and your staff, they comfort me." It
[time=2114] doesn't say even though I walk to the valley. We don't pitch a tent in our valleys. We go through our valleys. And it's peace that becomes the transportation, the peace of God that passes understanding that goes with us through the valleys that we go through. And as we look at that,
[time=2130] I don't know about you, but the whole point of this verse was to guide my feet in the way of peace.
[time=2135] God has to guide me in a lot of different ways at a lot of different times, but so many times, Him guiding me looks a lot like this viral video. I think I've shown before, but let's check it out.
[time=2144] Maybe you can relate. That is a sheep and it is stuck in the ditch. See him peeking up.
[time=2149] And here comes the Savior of the day, sometimes getting out of the ditch hurts a little bit,
[time=2158] and his legs going to be a little uncomfortable here. Some of y'all came to church and this is
[time=2167] what you're doing right now, wiggling around in the ditch. And we get free and we say, "Whoo-hoo,
[time=2175] I'm free." Yeah. Oh, that is so me sometimes. That is how God has to guide my feet in the way
[time=2190] of peace. Can I get a name in? Can you relate? Yeah, you can, because some of you just hopped right back in the ditch this last week and God's working with you and walking with you to guide your feet in the way of peace once again. Oh, man, I'm so glad God loves us. I'm so glad
[time=2207] God's a generous God because that is so me, so many times in my life. And Zachariah, notice he
[time=2214] didn't say the way to peace is the way of peace. Write this down. Peace is not a place.
[time=2219] Peace is a person. This is why peace is not something we get to. Peace is what gets us
[time=2226] through because peace is a person and his name is Jesus Christ. If you know Jesus, you know peace.
[time=2234] Where there is no Jesus, there is no peace. Peace is not a place. It is not a destination.
[time=2241] It is our transportation because as we know Jesus, the peace who is a person, the prince, a peace. Notice it didn't say Jesus is the prince of preferences that you get your way.
[time=2250] Jesus is the prince of peace that gets us through and ultimately will get us to our ultimate destination
[time=2256] which is to be in the presence of God forever. That's why peace is not a win then kind of peace.
[time=2262] Peace is a here now kind of peace. So I would tell you today my friends, I'm not waiting for hope.
[time=2270] I'm not, I'm not waiting for peace. I get to walk in it. I get to walk in hope. I get to walk
[time=2279] in peace even when it looks like getting pulled out of a ditch in my life. I want to ask you to
[time=2285] bow your heads. Ponder what does it mean to walk in the peace of God, to live a life of peace not trying to strive and find your way to peace, to let these shifts of get to give of from to end.
[time=2299] God meeting us in something that maybe we'd rather him deliver us from and to to through.
[time=2304] Looking at peace is something that carries us through whatever it is we're facing.
[time=2308] Believers what is it that God would have you do this week to view Christmas and to view life in that kind of way. This is the most important stillness moment you're going to have all week.
[time=2317] So ask everybody please just honor that before the Lord where ever you're at even if you're watching right now. Believers praying some of you though right now the most eternal thing any of us will witness this week is this moment where people can come to Christ. I can't get you there. I can point you to Jesus though and he will lead you to eternal life. The gospel as has been presented today it's very simple is that the wages of sin is death our sin separates us from God. Jesus came
[time=2341] and he lived the sinless life we could never live so that he could be the sacrifice to pay the debt that we could never pay. He did that when he died on the cross and he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing and he thought of moments just like this one or you would be able
[time=2356] to pause and reflect and respond to the call of the gospel because Jesus didn't just die he rose again.
[time=2362] He is alive and because he lives I can have eternal life this Christmas this can be the most amazing
[time=2368] Christmas you've ever had because you've accepted Christ as your Savior. You said I will follow Jesus
[time=2374] in your own words ask Jesus to save you and forgive you trusting in him and not in your good works or in the faith of anybody else but that you could be saved by grace through faith. If that's you right now will you pause as believers are praying for their next steps and ask God to save and he'll do just that anyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved let's respond together this morning.
