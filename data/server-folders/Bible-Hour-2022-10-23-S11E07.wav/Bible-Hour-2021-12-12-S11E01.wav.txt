[time=0] The new series that we're kicking off going through these next few weeks, we're going to be looking
[time=7] that were there for that very first Christmas. Today starting with Joseph, the father of Jesus.
[time=15] By the way, we have two of those. They are 3 p.m. and 5 p.m.
[time=24] The day after Christmas on the 26th, we'll look at the wise men seeking, searching.
[time=29] And a lot of us at that point are going to be searching for how we go into a new year.
[time=33] And a lot of times the flip of that year brings on maybe newness and new beginnings and those kinds of things.
[time=38] But it all is built on this premise that there is hope.
[time=42] And some of you may have come today searching for hope.
[time=45] Some of you may be questioning whether there is some hope.
[time=48] Today I want you to know that hope has arrived over 2,000 years ago and his name is Jesus.
[time=55] So we've been giving gifts and back here I've got a gift box and in that box I just want you to remember that out of the box that is what God gives to us, there will always be hope.
[time=66] Hope is here. Not because I'm here, not because Blackhawk is here, not because you're here,
[time=73] not because you're going to get your favorite gift this Christmas, but because Jesus is risen.
[time=77] Because he came that first Christmas morning, hope has arrived.
[time=82] That's the main point of the Christmas season.
[time=85] It's the main thing and we really work hard at Blackhawk to keep the main thing the main thing at Christmas.
[time=89] We keep the Christ in Christmas because without Christ there is no Christmas worth celebrating.
[time=95] But today I want to talk to you about hope when I'm confused.
[time=98] Any of you confused?
[time=100] Some of you look a little confused today.
[time=103] Don't point them out, no they already know.
[time=106] Hope when I'm confused. We're going to be Matthew chapter 1.
[time=109] This is Joseph's story, Joseph's account and his experience of confusion but of the coming of Christ.
[time=117] Matthew chapter 1 verses 18 through 25.
[time=120] So in Matthew chapter 1, Matthew was a disciple of Jesus and he wrote down his walk with Jesus.
[time=125] And what's happening here in the story and the timeline of Scripture is that there has been a 400 or so
[time=132] year period of silence as it has been called where people were very frustrated where between the prophet Malachi and then the coming of Christ and those that walked with Christ and wrote down the accounts, the eyewitness accounts, the experiences they had of walking with Jesus.
[time=148] There was this period of seeming silence from heaven.
[time=152] They were anticipating a coming Messiah and they anticipated how that Messiah would come but it was silent.
[time=160] And at the beginning of Matthew's gospel, the first 17 verses, there's a list of names.
[time=165] Look there, you see those names there and I always try to remind you that anywhere in the Bible where you see a list of names
[time=171] it should always serve as a reminder that every person matters to God.
[time=176] We are those people.
[time=178] We are those names and you matter to God and that list of names certainly reminds us of that.
[time=183] But that list is actually the genealogy of Jesus and it represents some 42 generations of frustrations
[time=189] they were wondering waiting for the coming Messiah.
[time=193] But then comes hope, then comes Jesus onto the scene.
[time=197] And Jesus because he comes onto the scene turns this season of frustrations into a season of fulfillments.
[time=204] He fulfilled prophecies and as we learn how Jesus fulfilled prophecies we can learn and hang our hats on
[time=211] and know that not only is the Word of God true but that God's Word is true to us.
[time=217] Every word he speaks is trustworthy and true and we can hang our hats on that eternal hope.
[time=223] And that's our hope as we go through this season of Christmas right now.
[time=227] And here's what I know about confusion.
[time=229] When it comes to God, God is not the author of confusion.
[time=232] Scripture tells us that God is not confused.
[time=235] Aren't you glad of that?
[time=237] I don't want to serve a confused God.
[time=239] If he was confused and then you add in my confusion to the mix, we're just in big trouble.
[time=244] But God's not the author of confusion. God is never confused.
[time=247] God is never surprised but also know this about you and me.
[time=250] We often get confused.
[time=253] Can I give you a amen?
[time=255] Some of us came today very confused.
[time=257] You're bewildered by maybe circumstances in your life.
[time=260] You're wondering why God is not answering your prayers.
[time=263] You're wondering if God really does care.
[time=265] You know the pastor says people matter to God but I don't really know that I do.
[time=269] Because in my life, I feel confused. There's some confusing God's will discernment process maybe that you're going through right now.
[time=276] You're trying to discern how to lead in your businesses and your companies that you lead to lead the employees that you lead.
[time=281] You're determining how to lead your kids and your grandkids and your families.
[time=284] You're determining how it is to navigate seasons that are filled with so much uncertainty and confusion.
[time=291] And you just need a little bit of something that is certain that you can hang your hat on.
[time=295] Christmas reminds us that Jesus is everything you've been looking for.
[time=299] And that's what we're going to dig into in this series.
[time=301] And the truth is the Christmas story itself is pretty confusing.
[time=305] It has a lot of confusing elements because you've got to understand the Jews were anticipating the coming Messiah and they knew he would come.
[time=313] They were looking for this great mighty warrior who would come and lead an army to overthrow the evil, oppressive, amazingly massive world-dominating empire of Rome.
[time=324] And they thought that this Savior, this Messiah was going to come and he would come in grand fashion.
[time=330] But God's ways are often not our ways.
[time=333] And God's ways are often confusing because instead of the Messiah coming in that grandiose fashion, he came as a little tiny baby in the most humble of ways
[time=343] behind the scenes where nobody would even maybe know to look for him.
[time=347] Because God's ways, they are often a little bit confusing.
[time=351] Do you believe that?
[time=352] You've experienced that, if you're honest.
[time=354] And Isaiah, it was one of the prophets that over 700 years before the birth of Christ prophesied about the coming of Jesus.
[time=361] One of the reasons you can know that Jesus is who he says he is.
[time=363] It's 700 plus years.
[time=365] So much was written about him and he fulfilled every bit of it.
[time=368] Isaiah chapter 55 verses 8 and 9 tells us this about God's ways.
[time=372] Isaiah 55 verse 8, "For my thoughts are not your thoughts.
[time=376] Neither are your ways, my ways," declares the Lord.
[time=380] "For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways." And my thoughts, then, your thoughts.
[time=387] Christmas is certainly a picture of that fact.
[time=390] He didn't do things the way the world thought he would do things.
[time=393] The Jews thought he would do things.
[time=395] And I'm guessing he doesn't do things even yet today the way that you thought he would do things, or maybe even the way you think he should do things.
[time=403] Because his ways are not our ways.
[time=405] And sometimes his ways are very confusing.
[time=408] And they certainly were for that first Christmas morning.
[time=412] And the most unlikely of circumstances, through the most unlikely of people,
[time=419] God sent forth his son to change the course of history.
[time=424] And in fact, our history is defined by this moment even today.
[time=427] Even in a secularized world, this moment is still defined.
[time=431] It defines benchmarks in our history even yet today.
[time=435] And what we see is that the Messiah came as a baby.
[time=438] And let's read about it in Matthew chapter 1.
[time=440] You ready for the word today?
[time=441] Starting in verse 18, we'll look at Joseph's lens today.
[time=444] Matthew 1 verse 18 says, "Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way." When his mother Mary had been betrothed, this is legally decided that they would be married together.
[time=455] To Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit.
[time=461] And her husband, Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly.
[time=467] But as he considered, if you got your Bibles underlined that word considered, we're going to talk about that in just a few minutes, as he considered these things.
[time=475] "Behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
[time=486] She will bear a son, you shall call his name Jesus, and he will save his people." His people from their sins.
[time=492] All, somebody say, all, all, all this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken
[time=499] by the prophet.
[time=500] And this is from Isaiah 7, 14, if you want to jot it down.
[time=503] 700 years before the coming of Christ, he prophesied this.
[time=506] Verse 23, "Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, as shall call his name Immanuel, which means God with us." Verse 24, "When Joseph woke from sleep, he did, as the angel of the Lord commanded him.
[time=519] He took his wife, but knew her not until she had given birth to a son, and he called his name Jesus.
[time=525] And may God take the reading of his word and make it the application of his ways into our lives, being seeds that just burst forth fruit, hope, peace,
[time=536] contentment, joy in all of our lives." That's our hope for this series.
[time=540] And so let's talk about those verses instead of giving an outline today.
[time=543] We're just going to walk one verse at a time through this.
[time=545] I'm going to give you some statements that I believe can give you some hope into maybe what is some confusing circumstances for you.
[time=550] Starting in verse 18, we learned that Christmas started with this.
[time=555] The birth of Christ came about this way, that Mary became pregnant.
[time=559] And here's the thing, that's not real confusing.
[time=561] Maybe you know how this works, like a woman gets pregnant.
[time=564] That part's not confusing, but the next part is what changes the course of confusing history here, because she's pregnant.
[time=571] She did not know the man she was betrothed to Mary, legally decided upon, that she would marry.
[time=579] And she's pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
[time=582] And she's going to carry the son of the living God.
[time=585] It just got a little bit confusing.
[time=588] And maybe that's kind of the story of your life.
[time=590] Things made sense, things were going along according to plan.
[time=594] But then God shows up on the scene and things just kind of got confusing.
[time=597] Or maybe it's not even God, maybe life happened.
[time=599] And it just got confusing.
[time=601] No doubt Mary's life got confusing.
[time=603] And we're going to talk about hope when I'm unable.
[time=605] Do you think Mary, who would have been probably about 15 years old, would have been a teenager at this time.
[time=611] Do you think she felt unable to carry the son of the living God?
[time=614] I would think so.
[time=615] And if you feel that way, if you feel inadequate, come next week.
[time=618] We're going to talk about Mary.
[time=619] But this story just got really confusing as Joseph finds out that his wife, or his soon to be wife, is pregnant.
[time=627] It's not by him.
[time=628] And oh yeah, it's by the Holy Spirit and it's the son of the living God.
[time=633] What a confusing beginning to Christmas.
[time=635] Verse 19, what does Joseph do?
[time=637] It says that Joseph resolved.
[time=639] And so there were legal requirements of what would happen to someone betrothed to be married who gets pregnant out of wedlock.
[time=646] There were laws about that and some of them were very harsh.
[time=648] I mean, not only would she be humiliated, but Mary, as a teenage pregnant girl,
[time=654] if she lost her parents, really would have no one to take care of her.
[time=658] She would have no means of providing for herself.
[time=660] She'd probably be destined for a life of homelessness and be destitute for all of her life if she could even live through those circumstances.
[time=667] And in some cases, I mean, she could even be killed.
[time=670] And Joseph knew these things.
[time=671] And that's why verse 19, he's a just man.
[time=673] He's a good man.
[time=674] And he knew, though, that he was in a pickle.
[time=677] Joseph knew that he had nowhere to turn.
[time=680] Joseph knew that he was out of options because he was bound to put her away, to divorce her.
[time=686] He needed, he had to do that by law.
[time=688] But he wanted to do it in a way that would not humiliate her.
[time=690] He wanted to do that in a way because he's a just man.
[time=693] He resolved.
[time=694] Now, that word "resolved" means he considered them and he landed the plane.
[time=698] He made a decision.
[time=700] He got to a conclusion and his conclusion was blank.
[time=703] He resolved.
[time=704] He made that decision.
[time=705] That's important because then what happens is that decision kind of gets undone.
[time=709] In a confusing time, he did the best he could to resolve the best possible outcome
[time=715] for a really weird and confusing scenario.
[time=717] Can you relate with Joseph's predicament?
[time=719] Weird, really weird, confusing scenario.
[time=722] You resolve.
[time=723] This is the best I can do in this equation.
[time=725] You do all the math.
[time=726] And here's how it adds up as best as I can tell.
[time=729] But then, you know, what Joseph resolved kind of shifted.
[time=732] And as we're looking at this, I know Joseph's saying I'm confused.
[time=735] I know Joseph's saying I don't see a way out of this one.
[time=738] Maybe you can relate.
[time=740] He's out of options.
[time=741] And I think of Joseph's time.
[time=743] He was kind of at a dead end season of his life.
[time=745] Can you imagine the weight of what he felt, how confusing things felt?
[time=749] Humanity, those waiting on the coming Messiah.
[time=751] They kind of felt like they're at a dead end too.
[time=754] Some 400 years where heaven had been seemingly silent.
[time=757] And I wonder maybe are you in a season of kind of dead end as well?
[time=762] Maybe you came today.
[time=763] Maybe you're watching us today.
[time=765] And you're in a season right now where you realize, man, I don't really have any options.
[time=769] I'm confused.
[time=770] I'm doing the best I can do.
[time=772] And I just showed up maybe even to church or I just logged in.
[time=774] Maybe out of desperation or the drug problem often described that I had a drug problem growing.
[time=779] What they drug me to church every Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
[time=782] The doors are open.
[time=783] They drug me there.
[time=784] Maybe somebody drug you here.
[time=785] I don't know why you're here, but I would guess there's something in your life that feels a little bit confusing.
[time=789] Something you could use a little bit of hope in.
[time=791] And Joseph was in that exact same kind of spot.
[time=794] Christmas reminds us, listen to this, that those times where we are out of options.
[time=800] Those times that are the most confusing Christmas reminds us that God is the God of new beginnings.
[time=806] Because hope entered a world that was confusing through confusing circumstances through unlikely people and changed the course of history.
[time=814] And that's a great reminder for us that God still is in that same business.
[time=818] But here's what I know about us and about our journeys of faith.
[time=821] Write this down.
[time=822] What we resolve, Joseph resolved to put her away quietly.
[time=825] You decided this.
[time=826] What we resolve will probably evolve as soon as God gets involved.
[time=832] And you know what I'm saying, because this is where you decide something.
[time=836] You map it all out.
[time=837] You've got all your plans just like Joseph and Mary.
[time=839] That's what being betrothed is all about.
[time=841] They had made all their plans.
[time=843] They figured it all out.
[time=844] They resolved something.
[time=845] You've resolved things in your life as well.
[time=847] But they evolved.
[time=848] They changed circumstances.
[time=850] Maybe it's not even from God.
[time=851] Maybe problems.
[time=852] Maybe people.
[time=853] Maybe you showed up.
[time=854] I'm the hardest person I lead every single day.
[time=857] But God through all of my mess leads me.
[time=859] But when God shows up, when people, when life happens, things evolve.
[time=863] Things change.
[time=864] Circumstances look different than what we resolve.
[time=866] What we plan.
[time=867] What we built our lives around.
[time=868] But it's certainly going to happen.
[time=870] Listen, it's certainly going to happen that life and things will change as soon as God gets involved.
[time=876] God's in the transformation business.
[time=878] Sometimes we don't like it.
[time=879] Sometimes that change is painful.
[time=882] But he's in the transformation business.
[time=884] Without that fact, we wouldn't have anything to celebrate this Christmas.
[time=887] There would be no hope.
[time=888] And I'm glad that God is in that business.
[time=890] Sometimes what we have in our minds is not what God has in his plans.
[time=896] Can I get it, amen?
[time=897] You already know that part.
[time=898] You're like, okay, yeah, I get that pastor.
[time=900] But what do we do about that?
[time=901] I'm glad you asked.
[time=902] Let's keep going.
[time=903] Verse 20, Joseph considered.
[time=904] That's the word I told you to write down.
[time=906] In verse 20, it says that Joseph considered.
[time=909] He considered.
[time=910] I love that word.
[time=911] It says things.
[time=912] And what happened?
[time=913] The Lord appeared to him in a dream.
[time=914] Through this angel saying, Joseph, son of David, don't fear to take Mary as your wife.
[time=917] For that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
[time=921] And he considered those things.
[time=923] That word, consider, it means what you think it means in a large part.
[time=926] It means he thought about it.
[time=927] It means he processed it.
[time=928] It means he pondered it.
[time=931] But it's a combination of words in the original language.
[time=934] And one of those words really is a word that points to anger.
[time=937] And one of the best, clearest definitions of that.
[time=940] You could define this word this way, that he was agitated in spirit.
[time=946] Some of you are agitated in spirit today.
[time=948] Some of your church smiles are really good.
[time=950] And I can't detect my agitation radar doesn't go off.
[time=954] But some of you, I'm going to be honest.
[time=955] Some of you, I know you can tell up here.
[time=957] You're agitated.
[time=958] You came in.
[time=959] You can laugh.
[time=960] It's okay.
[time=961] Just don't point at him.
[time=962] You're agitated because you're confused and life is hard.
[time=965] And we just get agitated.
[time=966] Joseph, can you blame the girl that he is betrothed to be married to is with child, not by him.
[time=973] And she's telling me now it's the son of God and it's from the Holy Spirit.
[time=979] Would you be a little agitated too?
[time=980] You'd be a little confused.
[time=981] You'd be agitated.
[time=982] And then God shows up and speaks to you and he's considering these things.
[time=987] Through an agitated spirit, he's pondering what he's supposed to do.
[time=991] Because everything that he resolved has now evolved because God got involved.
[time=997] This is where Joseph finds himself.
[time=998] Maybe you can relate.
[time=1001] And here's the thing.
[time=1002] When it doesn't add up, when it comes to finding hope in our situation and the math
[time=1009] isn't there, maybe we're looking at math the wrong way.
[time=1013] God has his own ways.
[time=1016] How many of you have heard of this whole mathematics controversy?
[time=1018] I've got kids in younger grades right now and there's all kind of different math approaches now.
[time=1024] What do they call that stuff now?
[time=1025] Say it.
[time=1026] Y'all know?
[time=1028] Common core.
[time=1030] But what we found, there's times, I did okay at math at school.
[time=1033] So there's times, Jessica, my wife, she'll say, "Dad, Caleb needs help with his math.
[time=1039] You're good at math.
[time=1040] You do it." And he's in fifth grade here at BCS and I've sat down and I'm like, "It's fifth grade.
[time=1046] I mean, it's fifth grade." And I sit down and I go, "And I feel confused.
[time=1054] I need some hope when I'm confused in those moments." But here's what I've learned about these different approaches to math is that there's a lot of different ways mathematically to get to the same result, to the same outcome.
[time=1066] I'm not advocating for any of that.
[time=1067] So you guys don't send me mean emails like I'm advocating for that math that you're mad at the teachers about.
[time=1071] And don't be mad at the teachers.
[time=1072] They're trying their best.
[time=1073] But don't send me those emails.
[time=1074] I'm not advocating for math.
[time=1075] I am advocating for one kind of math, though, is God's math.
[time=1079] When things don't add up for us, God's ways are higher than our ways.
[time=1084] And he is the Lord over the math that we try to do in our head.
[time=1089] And when he gets involved, everything that we've resolved is probably going to evolve.
[time=1094] It's going to change and it's going to fit according to his plans and his purposes.
[time=1098] I'm glad God has his own math because sometimes mine doesn't add up.
[time=1103] I am so glad my God is bigger than my mathematic methodologies.
[time=1109] He's bigger than yours, too.
[time=1110] If it's not adding up, you can trust him today.
[time=1112] Why?
[time=1113] Well, I'm glad you asked.
[time=1114] The angel said it this way.
[time=1115] He said to Joseph, "That which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
[time=1121] And I'm so glad of that truth that Jesus came.
[time=1124] But I want to speak to something, maybe you're in.
[time=1126] Maybe not something that's in you, but something you're in the middle of.
[time=1130] And I want you to know that because of our God, because of his math, even when it doesn't add up, even when it makes no sense today, what you are in the middle of, you can know and trust and believe that there is hope and that our God will do something through you that will come from his Holy Spirit, the same Holy Spirit that brought about the birth of
[time=1153] a Savior who's fully God and fully human through a virgin, teenage girl named Mary,
[time=1160] who is ready to do something in you and gives something to you from the living God in the
[time=1166] situation you find yourself in today.
[time=1169] I need to know that today.
[time=1170] Can I get an amen?
[time=1171] Do you need to know that today?
[time=1172] God's ready to do something in you this week.
[time=1175] So here's what I would tell you about this.
[time=1177] When you're considering gets confusing, some of you guys have been agitated for a while now, and it gets confusing, trust in the only source of certainty.
[time=1186] I want to tell you, for the rest of our time, some ways maybe that will help you map out how to do that.
[time=1191] As we go to verse 21, we see Joseph kind of on that journey as well.
[time=1195] The angel says to Joseph, "She will bear a son and you shall call his name Jesus for you.
[time=1199] Save his people from their sins." This is the message of Christmas.
[time=1202] This is why Jesus came to save his people from their sins.
[time=1205] I'm glad I get to be a part of that family of God.
[time=1209] But here's the thing.
[time=1210] This is what the angel said to Joseph, and we'll read the end of what he did with it, and he will help.
[time=1220] There might be a page missing in my Bible.
[time=1225] Maybe yours.
[time=1226] One of you guys, you got a Bible over here?
[time=1228] Who's got a Bible?
[time=1229] One of you all got a Bible?
[time=1232] My Bible's missing the part where the angel gave Joseph the proof and the evidence.
[time=1235] All right?
[time=1236] You could keep it.
[time=1237] Let's look at your arms Bible.
[time=1238] Hold on, come here.
[time=1239] Let's see.
[time=1240] Here's the same as mine.
[time=1243] There you go.
[time=1244] You can take it back.
[time=1245] You all need to get you an orange Bible like that one right there.
[time=1249] But even the orange Bible, it didn't have it.
[time=1251] I'm missing the part where the angel gave him all the evidence, where the angel brought forth and said, "Here's the contract Mary signed, and this is God's signature showing that God sent forth his Son, and here's all the reasons and all the pieces of evidence you can trust that this is the Lord and is doing." Does your Bible have that?
[time=1268] You all tell me, mine just ends there, and then it just goes right to the next verse.
[time=1274] And then it says, "All this took place to fulfill what the Lord has spoken." There's evidence.
[time=1279] I mean, he sent an angel.
[time=1280] He had already said these things.
[time=1282] But can you imagine how confused you would feel?
[time=1287] And not only that, but he comes in a dream.
[time=1288] How many of y'all have some weird dreams?
[time=1290] I mean, in my house, I hardly ever dream.
[time=1293] I don't know what that means with me.
[time=1294] Maybe I don't know.
[time=1295] Probably something wrong with me.
[time=1296] But when we talk about dreams in our house, there's some weird stuff happening in those dreams.
[time=1301] So a lot of times they're confusing, and so the Lord visited him in a dream, and then there's this angel.
[time=1305] How confused is Joseph?
[time=1308] And the angel just says all this, and no proof, no contracts, no evidence.
[time=1314] Yet Joseph finds himself there.
[time=1315] Maybe you're in the same kind of place, and you're like, "God, answer that prayer.
[time=1318] Give me some proof.
[time=1319] God, I'll give you my yes after you give me the detailed outline of what I can expect over the next six months, and seven days, and 18 hours, right?
[time=1328] And I want it mapped out, and I'll process it for three weeks, and then I'll get back to you with my answer." This is kind of how we operate a lot of times, but that's not the story that we see here with Joseph.
[time=1337] And here's what I want to tell you, faith is not the absence of confusion.
[time=1343] A lot of times you guys may look and be like, "Man, I just, I hear this.
[time=1346] You feel so inadequate." It's like, "Man, I don't have faith like you do, pastor, you know.
[time=1350] I mean, I'm glad you don't.
[time=1351] I'm glad you, you're never confused.
[time=1354] You seem really certain and confident about your faith.
[time=1356] The man, those elders, man, they know the word of God.
[time=1358] They've got it figured out.
[time=1359] They're so confident.
[time=1360] The pastors and the staff, man, I'm just not at y'all's level because you, listen, I won't
[time=1366] speak for everybody on our leadership team.
[time=1368] And if you won't admit this, you're no longer on our leadership team.
[time=1373] Here's the truth.
[time=1374] We all have confusion.
[time=1376] We all doubt.
[time=1377] We all get confused in our faith.
[time=1380] We all scratch our heads and wonder, "What in the world God is up to?" And so I came to set somebody free today to tell you that faith is not the absence of confusion.
[time=1389] It's the ability to trust God confidently through confusing times.
[time=1394] I know it's confusing.
[time=1396] And the essence of faith is that it's the substance of the things that we hope for.
[time=1401] It's the things that we can't yet see, but we believe in because we know that our God is the God of hope and through our doubts and through our confusion and through all of these times that are so complicated and so challenging, all faith does for us is all
[time=1416] we need it to do, and that is give us a confident hope.
[time=1420] We have this hope as an anchor for our souls.
[time=1424] He is with us, and that is the message of Christmas.
[time=1427] Faith is not the absence of confusion, if that's the case, Joseph didn't have any faith.
[time=1431] But we know Joseph had faith, and we're going to see that as we go through the rest of the story, faith is instead just the ability to trust God.
[time=1438] And guess what?
[time=1439] That ability, it sounds like we'll try a little harder.
[time=1441] You don't even have that ability.
[time=1443] You know who does?
[time=1444] The Holy Spirit of God, the same one who brought forth this virgin birth, the same one who raised Jesus from the dead, he's the source of the ability.
[time=1451] Not only do you not have the ability, you're going to be given even the ability that it's not about the absence of all these problems.
[time=1458] It's about the ability, and the ability doesn't even come from you.
[time=1460] God does all the work, doesn't mean you're lazy, means you get on board and trust Him even when it's hard to do so.
[time=1467] I thank God for that.
[time=1468] Verse 22, I love the word all.
[time=1470] Look there, all this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet.
[time=1476] That prophet was Isaiah.
[time=1477] We'll look at his verse in a second, but this word all, and it's really complicated.
[time=1482] You know what it means?
[time=1484] Get your pens ready.
[time=1485] It means all.
[time=1487] Every bit of it.
[time=1488] All in our English Bibles and Romans 828, and I want to point it out, Romans 828, and we know that for those who love God, all things, we're together for good, for those
[time=1499] who are called according to His purpose.
[time=1504] All of these confusing things happened in the Christmas story so that what the Lord had spoken, and in this case, over 700 years before the coming of Christ.
[time=1513] All of those things took place, all of the confusion, all of the chaos, all of the clash of the kingdoms, the kingdom of God coming down to the kingdom of man.
[time=1521] All of the confusing clash and chaos took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken
[time=1528] because our God keeps His promises.
[time=1531] And in the same way, all of the junk that you're dealing with is making life feel so confusing this Christmas season.
[time=1538] All of it.
[time=1539] God can redeem it.
[time=1541] And God is trying to work it together for good because He is for you, and He's for your good, for all of us who are called according to His purpose, as I'm glad He's got a purpose because sometimes I feel purposeless that God gives us that purpose.
[time=1555] And then, and so here's what I'd ask you.
[time=1557] Do you believe that Jesus is Lord over everything?
[time=1560] And if you do, I want to ask you this follow-up question and it's this, will you trust what God has spoken even when circumstances are confusing?
[time=1567] It's hard to do.
[time=1571] Easy to read, easy to take down in the notes, hard to live out when life gets confusing.
[time=1577] So I would challenge you, let your agitation, remember that agitation, as He considered those things, He was agitated in spirit, maybe you are as well, let your agitation lead you to action.
[time=1586] What action?
[time=1587] The action of trusting God, having a confident hope in God, even when life feels hopeless.
[time=1593] Fix your eyes on Him and not on the waves that are around you.
[time=1597] That is a good action step for us to try to apply, and in verse 23, God takes these confusing circumstances and uses them as a catalyst to bring about what is certain.
[time=1605] It's what the Lord had spoken, this is Isaiah's prophecy, again, over 700 years before the coming of Christ, Isaiah 7, 14, He says this, He says, "Behold the virgin, Chuck and see,
[time=1616] and bear son, and they shall call His name Immanuel, which means God with us."
[time=1622] This prophecy was fulfilled in Jesus, and when prophecies are fulfilled, you can know that God keeps His promises.
[time=1627] Aren't you glad to know we serve a trustworthy God?
[time=1630] He keeps His promises.
[time=1631] He is faithful.
[time=1632] So I want to ask you a tough question, do you trust God when, will you trust, listen, will
[time=1638] you trust what God says, even when you don't like what God does?
[time=1643] Will you trust what God says, even when you don't like the way God does, what you didn't like, that He does?
[time=1650] It's tough, isn't it?
[time=1652] That's what Joseph has happened to navigate.
[time=1654] You are too, and I'm so thankful God gives us the strength to walk through that, and the same prophet Isaiah that is quoted in verse 23 said this in Isaiah, chapter 9, I'm going to read it to you from the new international version, Isaiah 9, verses 1 and 2, the same Isaiah that prophesied said this, "Nevertheless there will be no more gloom for those who are in distress.
[time=1673] In the past, he humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Neftely, but in the future he will honor Galilee of the nations, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, so much even prophecy and foreshadowing, even in that.
[time=1685] But here's the part I want you to catch, the people walking in darkness have seen a great light on those living in the land of deep darkness, a light has dawned.
[time=1697] That is the message of Christmas, that is why we have hope, that is why we have a give light.
[time=1703] Sunday I love this passage, even for give light.
[time=1705] This is why we want to give beyond ourselves, because that is the hope of Christmas, that is the light of Christmas, is that there's more to life than consuming.
[time=1714] I want to be about contributing, I want to go beyond myself, I want to see wells, and if you've missed some of the stuff that we've highlighted, one of them is I'm going to get the opportunity to go with a team at the end of January, to South Sudan and to Kenya, and there's a well already dug that we just by faith stepped out and knew that you all were going to give, and that we've already done today, and that happened even before today, because that's how my God does, when you follow his ways, he just provides.
[time=1738] God guides us, and then he provides in all the ways to get us there, but there's a well that is already dug in South Sudan, where there's no well in miles and miles and miles.
[time=1748] That's going to physically change generations in a physical sense, praise God for that.
[time=1753] But I get the amazing privilege to go and preach there at this well where physical water is going to change generations.
[time=1760] I get to preach about the living water, that if you receive it, and his name is Jesus,
[time=1766] you'll never thirst again, it doesn't mean in the physical earthly life, but in eternity, you will have eternal life because of this living water.
[time=1775] This is why we can know the light has dawn in those who live in deep darkness, and maybe
[time=1781] you're one of those, and you're in a deeply dark season and circumstance, and you're confused.
[time=1788] Today I came to tell you that because hope has arrived, a light, a bright light at that has dawned, and his name is Jesus, and this offering is going to spread that light everywhere, but God has called you to be that light, not just to give and to be a part of letting that light spread and shine, but to be that light in all of your confusing circumstances today.
[time=1809] And God, and it's so interesting in Isaiah's prophecy, he uses what scholars often call this prophetic perfect tense, and here's what he's doing.
[time=1818] He's talking about something, again, 700 years before the coming of Christ, he's talking about something that had not yet happened, but talking about it in the way that it had
[time=1828] already been done, and it's finished, and it had already happened, and that's really the posture that we live with as Christians, because how many of you have read the end?
[time=1836] You read the end?
[time=1839] Give me a summary.
[time=1841] Yeah, I would summarize it two words.
[time=1844] Jesus wins, Jesus wins, and because we know then, listen, we operate today as though that
[time=1851] has already happened because it has, even though we live in the tension of the not yet, because
[time=1857] how many of you feel like you live in that victory every moment of every single day, no matter what happens, all your feelings, all your emotions, every circumstance, looks like feels like and acts like and smells like God has already won.
[time=1871] Absolutely not.
[time=1872] We live in this already, not yet tension.
[time=1874] We're still in the not yet, but we know it's already done, and so we live in light of the
[time=1880] end, and Christmas is a reminder that we know the end of the story, and it is for that end of that story that Jesus first came.
[time=1888] It's why we have hope this Christmas, and I'm so thankful for that hope, and that's the posture, that's the tense that not only is Isaiah prophesying in, that's the posture and the tense we live our lives in, church, and I pray that we can do that well.
[time=1903] God wants, here's what God wants.
[time=1904] God wants your confusion to become a catalyst for trust.
[time=1915] We often wait for confusion to get clarified, don't we?
[time=1917] We're like, God, I mean, I kind of got this problem and it's confusing, and if you just
[time=1924] kind of sort of fix it and give me the answer, some of you're wondering about this call of
[time=1930] God on your life, a big new step that God has called you to take, some of you are trying to figure out how to navigate the uncertainty of the world, some of you are trying to raise kids or grandkids, and Lord knows that'll humble you in just a second, if you need to be humble, just have kids, they'll take care of all that, little sinners, glad I never was one, oh yeah I was, right?
[time=1949] No matter where you're at, no matter what's confusing, God wants that area of confusing, confusion to become a catalyst for trusting in Him.
[time=1958] But a lot of times we want Him just to clarify the confusion.
[time=1961] God, give me the answer, give me the clarification, you know, if you would just kind of come through here, all my problems will be gone.
[time=1969] And I just showed some of you how you pray, and you're like, I don't sound like that.
[time=1974] You may not sound like that, but sometimes our hearts about like that.
[time=1977] Can I get an amen?
[time=1978] Mine is.
[time=1980] But God wants these things that are causing confusion to become a conduit, an avenue for
[time=1986] us to grow, for us to trust, for us to find hope and have faith in ways that we haven't maybe done before, and here's the ultimate prophecy, the certainty that came from the
[time=1997] confusion of the Christmas story was this, Emmanuel, you know what it means?
[time=2003] God with, say that with me, this is the message of Christmas, the greatest ultimate prophecy ever fulfilled is that God with, so you know what that means?
[time=2013] That means that God loves us so much, that He wants us to be with Him forever.
[time=2027] I don't know about you, but I know me, and I've let God down so many times, but He's
[time=2037] always been so faithful to me, and Christmas reminds me that He never gives up on me, that
[time=2049] He's with me, that Emmanuel has come, that God is with us, because God wants us to be
[time=2057] with Him for all eternity.
[time=2062] That's hope.
[time=2063] If you needed hope, hope has arrived.
[time=2068] His name is Jesus.
[time=2069] I don't deserve that.
[time=2071] We don't deserve that, but God loved us so much that He sent forth His Son.
[time=2076] The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, knowing the end result was going to simply be that He would be brutally killed on a cross, that those He came to save would crucify Him,
[time=2087] so that He could be raised from the dead, the power of the Holy Spirit, so that our sin,
[time=2093] the sin that put Him on that cross to begin with, could be defeated and eradicated, hence forth forevermore.
[time=2099] That's the message of Christmas.
[time=2101] That's why Jesus came.
[time=2102] That's why we have hope.
[time=2103] So what did Joseph do about all of this hope, with all of this confusion?
[time=2108] In verses 24 and 25, here's what he did, Joseph, when he woke from sleep, he did, as the angel of the Lord commanded him.
[time=2114] He took his wife, but he knew her not, until she had given birth to a son, and he called his name Jesus.
[time=2119] What did Joseph do?
[time=2120] He displayed unconditional obedience.
[time=2123] He wasn't predicated on understanding.
[time=2126] I call it the blank check mentality.
[time=2127] You've heard me describe it here before, if you've been around very long.
[time=2130] The answer is yes, Lord.
[time=2132] Now what is the question?
[time=2134] Say it with me.
[time=2135] The answer is yes, Lord.
[time=2136] Now what is the question?
[time=2138] You've heard me talk about that, perhaps.
[time=2140] That's the mentality Joseph operated with, but a lot of times we're like, "God, give me the question.
[time=2144] I'll get back to you in a couple of weeks." I'm planning on it being yes, but there are a few outstanding, extenuating circumstances that I kind of need to think through, and I got to make sure I got the right budget, and I got it, you know what I'm talking about, and then I'll give you my yes.
[time=2155] Joseph said, "I don't totally get what's going on, I'm confused, but my answer is yes." It's a blank check mentality, and I'm glad Joseph displayed that for us.
[time=2166] I don't know what's confusing you these days, but I do know one thing for certain.
[time=2170] I know that Christmas is a reminder of the certainty of what it means to have hope and trust and have faith in God.
[time=2178] I do know that God wants to remind you of that today, Jesus came that first Christmas
[time=2184] to give a certainty of eternal life.
[time=2186] So I want to challenge you, obey Him, trust Him, following, be bold in how you do so.
[time=2193] The Apostle Paul wrote this in 2 Corinthians 3, verse 12, he said, "Because we have such
[time=2199] a hope, a hope, we are very bold.
[time=2204] I want to ask you to just bow your heads and ponder in the stillness of this moment.
[time=2210] Be physically still, be spiritually still, be mentally still before the Lord.
[time=2215] Let God work in you in this moment." What does it mean to say, since I have such a hope, I'm going to be very bold.
[time=2222] Believers in the room, what is it that God has called you to do this week?
[time=2225] What has God called you to do as far as a faith step?
[time=2228] What does it look like to trust Him in Christmas gatherings?
[time=2230] What does it look like to be light in all the places God is sending you these days?
[time=2236] What step has God led you to take because of the hope that you have?
[time=2239] How will you be very bold?
[time=2241] But some of you are here today, some of you are watching you tuned in, and the hope of the gospel is just flashing like a light bulb for you today.
[time=2248] You realize I'm a sinner and man, I need salvation.
[time=2251] And I get why Christmas matters so much to all these Christian people, it's because this is why you came.
[time=2257] You came for me.
[time=2259] I am a sinner and the wages of sin is death, but Jesus came and He paid that price after living the sinless life.
[time=2264] I could never live.
[time=2265] He died on the cross from me and He rose from the dead to conquer, to defeat my sin,
[time=2271] to defeat death for me.
[time=2274] Salvation comes from, as the Holy Spirit is drawing in you right now and you know He's there and you're holding on, you're clenching right now as to release and say, "God, I want to give you me.
[time=2284] Anyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
[time=2287] Anyone who just simply believes that Jesus was risen from the dead, by God, that He's who He says He is, calling on Him, today you will be saved." It is that simple.
[time=2299] Will you trust in Him with your own words, will you just cry out to Him, ask Him to forgive you and say, "He'll do that right now." And the stillness of this moment, don't miss what God's doing, will you reflect and respond
