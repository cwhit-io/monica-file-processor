[time=0] Amen. Hey, grab your Bibles. Let's go to Luke chapter one. We are in a series called hope has arrived
[time=6] And I want to tell you today hope is here and his name is Jesus And so over the Christmas season we're looking at different people who experienced the first Christmas last week
[time=17] We looked at Joseph and we looked at hope when I'm confused If you missed last week and you feel confused maybe last week's messages for you can find it at blackhawk.fi
[time=27] And today we're gonna look at Mary's story in this hope has arrived series and today I want to talk to you about hope when I'm unable
[time=34] Hope when I am unable Mary was a teenager Most likely around the age of 15 years old when the Holy Spirit came upon her and the angel came and shared with her
[time=44] What was gonna happen in her life? Do you think she felt inadequate and unable?
[time=48] I would imagine so we'll be in Luke chapter 1 verses 26 through 38. So join me there today hope when I'm
[time=57] unable and I want to start with the same verse that I finished with last week as we talk about what hope does in our lives
[time=65] I bet you probably need some today. I don't know what you brought in with you or what you're facing right now But God's got some hope that he wants to pour into your heart today Hope is here. Hope is arrived. His name is Jesus And I want to start with this verse that the apostle Paul wrote to the church at Corinth and 2 Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 12
[time=83] He says since we have such a hope we are very say this with me We are very bold But I'm guessing for most of us if not all of us there are things in our lives that Baffled there's things that make us feel baffled and we're so baffled and confused and feel so inadequate
[time=99] That we don't feel like we have what it takes to be very bold There are probably many who your mistakes the skeletons in your closet the blunders of your life make you feel like I could never do
[time=109] Anything bold for Jesus. There's probably a lot of people here that would say you know what?
[time=114] I'm in such a battle right now Pastor, it's just such a fight Just to be here this morning. Just to tune in this morning was just such a fight I'm in such a battle I can't even begin to think about doing something bold for Jesus much less think that God could do something bold through person like me
[time=131] Some of you just for whatever reason you just don't believe that God could do something And so today I don't know where you find yourself, but wherever you're at
[time=141] I want to give you some factors four factors four things to consider if and you feel Unable if and when you feel unable here's four factors. You ready to write them down. Let's come together Let's go on a journey number one write down favor favor number one is favor Some things you could consider when you feel unable this comes from the first set of verses that will read Luke chapter 1
[time=162] Versus 26 through 30 and when it comes with this word favor, I Believe that a lot of times we miss define the favor of God You don't hear it talked about an awful lot But about Mary is said twice in this passage that we're about to read that she's favored by God
[time=179] And a lot of times what we think is favor is actually not the favor of God at all
[time=185] So with that in mind, I want to define it, but let's first read about how Mary is favored. You ready for the word today church Luke chapter 1 starting in verse 26 I'll read through verse 30 in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Azareth to a
[time=200] Virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David and the virgin's name was Mary
[time=207] And he came to her and said greetings. Oh favored one the Lord is with you But she was greatly troubled at the saying and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be and the angel said to her
[time=221] Do not be afraid Mary for you have found favor with God
[time=227] Let's talk about what the favor of the Lord is and let's start by kind of going through these verses first of all verse 26
[time=233] It says In the sixth month and it's not talking about of the year is talking about of Elizabeth's Pregnancy Elizabeth as we'll see in a minute chapter 1 verse 36 if you look a little later We'll read it in a moment verse 36 says that Elizabeth a relative of Mary's was pregnant
[time=250] and she was barren and she was old and that wasn't supposed to happen and She was going to give birth to John the Baptist who would be a forerunner someone preparing the way for Jesus a cousin
[time=261] Relative of Jesus and so it's the sixth month of her pregnancy But Mary is betrothed that means she's legally arranged listen what that means is they made plans you ever made plans
[time=271] How many of you saw your Christmas plans blown up last year?
[time=280] Plans change they made plans. There's two phases to this betrothal and engagement. There's the engagement and the marriage
[time=287] They're in the engagement part They had made a lot of plans for that and everything changed and everything that changed made Joseph confused and no doubt made Mary feel very
[time=296] Unable so that's where things stand there in verse 27, but what does the angels say verse 28 favored one hello favored one of God
[time=305] You're favored by God So what does that even mean to be favored that that word and will build on the definition with the second use of it in just a moment
[time=313] But it means to grace it means to highly honor it means a sense of divine favor and even approval
[time=320] It's like a stamp of approval from God and so as we look at that Let's talk about what is the favor of God and I want to start by telling you what it is not Because a lot of times when you hear favor like I'm highly favored by God when you hear phrases like that This is how you'll hear it defined a lot of times that it's like oh favor equals fame Or if I'm favored by God, I'm gonna become famous and I'm gonna be blessed in that way And it's how we define blessings or I'm gonna have a fortune favor does not equal fortune And we'll use Mary as a case study to prove that point in just a minute. I'll tell you what it does mean It means faithfulness favor is not fame and fortune is it's faithfulness. It's a foundation of faithfulness from God
[time=360] Fame or favor rather is not perfection It's not even prefer preferred desired outcomes either. It's not preferences
[time=370] It's not perfection It's not things going as you would prescribe them to go favor is though the presence of God
[time=377] It is the person of God it is the promises of God and ultimately it is the point of Christmas
[time=384] It is Christ Favor favor is not fame. It's not fortune. It's not preferred circumstances But it's God's presence. It's God's faithfulness. It's God's promises. It ultimately is Jesus
[time=396] So let me use Mary as a case study when you read this passage um Did she and you know her story does she sound really favored to you By our normal kind of worldly definition doesn't sound like favor a bowl Circumstances. I mean think about it. She made her plans. She's engaged That's gone because now her husband as far as she knows has to divorce her Their laws about that and not only would she be shamed if her parents died She likely would have no one to take care of her the cultural construct of the day means that she would be shunned
[time=428] It means that she would probably have nowhere to turn She would be on her own. In fact, she would be probably afraid for her life At this point like we don't think about these things and to think that she's doing all of that She's not 25. She's not 45. She's probably something like 15 She's a teenager no doubt about it And that's what she's feeling. Hope when i'm unable is certainly a part of her story So she had all of these problems and listen then she's gonna go to have and birth and so she She's pregnant and she kind of knows how pregnancy works And she knows that she hasn't dishonored her betrothed soon to be husband And so now she's told by an angel sent from god that doesn't happen every day either
[time=470] You're pregnant and you're pregnant through the holy spirit You be a little confused too You feel a little unable and then she's gonna go try to give birth To what she's believing as best as she can to be the son of god and there's no room for her
[time=485] And she's rejected and she ends up in a barn Does that sound favorable to you?
[time=490] Yet What we learned through mary's story today as we look at the favor of god It's not favorable circumstances, but it's the presence of god that becomes a foundation
[time=502] That guides us and that we can build on to walk through seasons of pain and fear and failure and frustration
[time=509] Mary was favored by god yet she had all of the fear all of the unfavorable circumstances
[time=516] all of the frustrations In her life But the foundation of that was the presence of god and that is what mary teaches us So I want to give you a picture of that where the word favors use even in luke the next chapter
[time=530] In the next chapter luke chapter two, we're going to look at this Next week or this week christmas eve's coming up. We need to change mics. Let's do it We got a bunch of these so satan wants to tear them all down. I'll just go through all of them We got mics all over this place All right, check check there we go. Can you guys hear me? Okay. Yeah, so here's the deal next week is christmas
[time=552] Did you know that isn't it exciting christmas eve we got two services 3 pm and 5 pm 3 pm and 5 pm and we're going to be looking at hope when i'm afraid if any of you are afraid you need to be here christmas eve
[time=562] 3 pm 5 pm family services next sunday we're going to have Family services as well with kids ministry just through up through fourth Four years old not fourth grade up through four years old and we're going to be looking at hope when i'm searching And you're no matter what you're searching for in the new year But next week we're going to look at luke 2 and here's luke 2 in the niv verse 14 This is what the angels said to the shepherds who are also afraid they said glory to god in the highest Heaven and on earth peace to those on whom his favor Rest his favor rest now why was favor resting on them because the spirit of the lord because the presence of god
[time=598] Was coming from heaven down to earth the presence of god was there therefore the favor of god was there in the old testament
[time=605] You see the favor of god moses found favor with god no one found favor with god why because god was with them
[time=611] God's presence was among them. This is the hope of christmas in luke chapter four Jesus himself gave a picture Of god's presence a picture of his favor luke chapter four versus 18 and 19
[time=623] This is the words of jesus and it says this the spirit of the lord is upon me Because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty those who are oppressed
[time=639] And get the verse 19 to proclaim the year of the lord's favor Why was it the year of the lord's favor they thought this grandiose military leader was going to come and overthrow Rome that was the year of god's favor so they would have thought but Jesus had come and he said this after he was born obviously in his time of ministry was recorded in the gospels
[time=661] And the year of the lord's favor was there because jesus was there because the son of god had come To be that spotless lamb to take away the sin of the world So god's favor is there because jesus is there you could write it down this way. What's the favor of god?
[time=674] Let me give you a simple definition write this down jesus is the fullness of the favor of god Jesus is the fullness of the favor of god we if we're god's children
[time=686] We have the favor of god because we have the presence of god in our lives and jesus name I declare that over you because some of you feel like well I'm sure not favored to which I say if you know jesus, yes You are just like mary was favored and all guys people said Amen, we believe that around here and I believe that in your life Some of you are yet to be convinced and that's part of my job for the rest of the day Is to hopefully convince you but here's the thing let's get real verse 29 gets real
[time=714] The angel said to mary you're highly favored But verse 29 says mary even though the angel says your highly favored was highly troubled Some of you you may know some of the stuff I just said you might even cognitively agree with me
[time=727] But you don't feel very favored and in fact you feel highly troubled You feel really highly troubled some of you are High forms of trouble walking forms of trouble. Can I get an amen?
[time=738] And you're going to run into more of those that your family gatherings here and just a little while too We're just we're a mess sometimes mary was highly troubled She knew those things she had heard those things from an angel from the lord But can you blame her? She's highly troubled and what I see in this story is that god had interrupted her plans
[time=756] And I pray over our staff almost every week god Interrupt our plans and our schedules to do innocent through us what you want to do Because i've learned his plans are way better than mine and his greatest invitations into his plans into his purposes
[time=771] Get this his greatest invitations often come from his greatest interruptions God interrupted every plan that mary had that joseph had maybe he's interrupting a lot of plans that you have but so many times
[time=783] His greatest invitations into the greatest things he's doing come through the greatest interruptions christmas is the greatest interruption in all of history
[time=790] Jesus interrupted history and now we define history by his name
[time=796] This is what christmas is this is why there is hope and the angel verse 30 said don't be afraid
[time=802] Why because she had found favor with god and so building on that definition i gave you earlier favored Mentioned a moment ago. Here's what the word favor means verse 30. It's grace an expounded definition here in in the same form
[time=815] Is grace particularly that which brings joy gratification and acceptance
[time=821] I love that god wants to give you a stamp of approval. He graces personified through jesus Grace became a person through jesus. Jesus is the fullness Of the favor of god. So what does that mean for me write it down this way favor means that i can proclaim
[time=836] Something that i cannot yet perceive The bible says that fate is the evidence of the things that we hope for the substance the substance of the stuff that we can't yet see
[time=848] Maybe there's something god's doing in you right now that you can't see yet I can't see why god's allowing these terrible things to happen in my life I can't understand why i'm not at this place professionally or relationally or why i haven't found a spouse or why my christmas gatherings look like this
[time=863] Or why god would have taken this person and now i'm grieving this christmas and christmas is supposed to be a time of joy
[time=870] But instead it feels like an elevated time of grief for me and pain for me I can't perceive what god is doing, but what hope does and when we are unable the hope of christmas is that we can
[time=882] Proclaim because god's presence its favor is with us. We can believe proclaim Speak over our lives and walk in our lives in something we can't even yet perceive
[time=893] I don't know about you, but i needed that this week I don't understand everything god's doing all the time, but i can proclaim it i can live in it and i can walk in and i know you
[time=904] Probably have something in your life right now. You can't really perceive You don't understand it You don't see what the end result even could be much less what it will be But today i want to challenge you to walk in it because i believe this Consuming and adequacy and insecurity that some of us carry around You just always feel enable you always believe the lies of the enemy that you're never good enough. You're never worthy
[time=928] It's led you to a place where there's a consuming and adequacy and insecurity And i believe those things can often be the greatest enemies that the of the favor of god that the enemy will use against us
[time=939] As he speaks lies into our lives. So today god sent me to be a messenger and say favor means if you're a child of god
[time=945] You've got the stamp of approval. You've got the personified grace of god The presence of god the spirit of god in your life the same spirit that raised jesus from the dead lives in me
[time=957] He lives in you if you call jesus lord, that's favor Maybe now we can define it a little better than we could before favors the first thing And it comes from the second thing and that's facts right that down facts versus 31 through 33 There are some facts that i want to go over with you and these facts are things that mary experienced
[time=976] But i think there's so much we can learn as well. Let's read some of those facts together versus 31 Through 33 says this the angel said to her And behold you will notice the imperatives notice the clarity Notice the proclamations the wills and the certainty in this Passage and behold you will conceive in your womb and bear a son and you shall call his name jesus He will be great and will be called the son of the most high and the lord god will give to him the throne of his father
[time=1006] David and he will reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there will be no end
[time=1014] Those are some great facts. Let's talk through them for a minute Here's some facts for mary and then i'll apply them to you versus 28 and 30 The fact is that mary is favored by god The fact is that she was going to have a son verse 31 verse 31 The fact is that his name is going to be jesus verse 32. The fact is that he's going to be great He's the son of the living god verse 32. The fact is he's going to be the king and he's going to take over
[time=1038] We often try to put jesus. I think it's tony evans that says jesus didn't come to take sides He came to take over in jesus name. I'm glad that's true. He is in charge He is the ruling king of kings and the lord of lords That's who this baby would be that is the fact verse 33 The fact is that his kingdom will never ever ever end Those are some good facts and you're like well good for mary and good for jesus, but what about me?
[time=1064] So i've prepared just a few thoughts Based on those thoughts those facts from the word of god that I just want to proclaim over your life for just a moment
[time=1074] Because these facts also apply to you and some of you listen some of you right now You're letting the enemy whisper in your ear over and over again And he's whispering and that's all you hear is the whisper of the enemy telling you everything You can't do everything that you are not everything that you used to do everything that you did this morning And he's trying to define your identity by your actions But today the favor of god leads you to be able to proclaim The facts of his word that what you did is not who you are Who you are depends on who's you are and the favor of god means that the lord God of the universe that created all of us came and dwelt among us the word became flesh and dwelt among us and the presence of god
[time=1115] Came down so that we could be in his presence and his presence could indwell us and be a part of who we are
[time=1123] His whose are we we are his and his favor his presence is within us
[time=1129] So let me share a few of those I kind of got ahead of myself But the fact is that you just like mary are favored by god The fact is that you just like mary are all right. We'll just use this. Let's use this we're good I'm on a roll. Let's keep on rolling. The fact is give it up for matt. Let's thank matt for all he does Yeah The fact is that you're favored by god just like mary The fact is today. It doesn't matter what you've done It doesn't matter where you've been that the presence of god is a part of your life If you are a child of god today, I want you to ask what lies are you believe him?
[time=1160] And we say at our house where we're afraid of the dark or whatever it is We say tell the lies the truth And so today i'm going to tell the lies the truth in your life You are favored by god. The fact is that there is hope for you this christmas Yes, even you the fact is that you have become the righteousness of god Because he who knew no sin became sin taking on your sin so that you could become favored
[time=1185] You could become a part of the family of god The fact is that jesus rose from the dead and defeated death defeated sin defeated Hell defeated all the lies that maybe you've been buying into the fact is that god's hope means he has plans for you
[time=1200] And your life plans that are for good and not for evil But he'll even use the evil and the bad things that have been done to you or even buy you He'll even use the bad circumstances to bring about his plans Write it down this way the fact is that you are able because his ability resides within you in jesus name
[time=1220] Some of you came today just to hear those facts maybe you've known them cognitively
[time=1228] But the fact is you've been believing a lot of lies Uncle rick that was up here a minute ago. That's one of his questions to ask you I love that about rick. He'll say hey, what lies you've been believing lately So I want to ask you today What lies have you been believing lately?
[time=1243] And I came to share the facts of the word of god because religion teaches us that it's hard to come to god How many of you ever tried that to be good enough to make it to god? Yeah, I have But christmas faith jesus christianity tells us that god came to us
[time=1256] And I praise god for that today those are the facts jack And I pray that you can live in the truth this week favor facts
[time=1267] But even though We know the facts number three happens fear write that down fear Mary still had fear you do too. Can I get an amen?
[time=1275] I don't know what you're afraid of but here's what mary asked. This is how she dealt with her fear verse 34 After the angel had said all of these things here's what mary said and mary said to the angel how somebody say how
[time=1286] how How will this be since I am a virgin fair question right how like I know how this works
[time=1294] How is this going to be very fair question?
[time=1296] I'm confused. I feel unable to even do any of this stuff and I know some of you right now Just like the angel told mary. Hey, don't be afraid. Why did you do that? Well because god knew she would be
[time=1308] God knows you are too Faith doesn't mean you don't have fear. I mean if you're afraid of something lately. Yeah, me too Me too. We all do and god knew that mary would be She brought the son of god into the world who wouldn't be who wouldn't ask how who wouldn't feel unable So I want to ask you today. What how how am I supposed to pay for this?
[time=1327] How am I supposed to make it through this?
[time=1330] How is god Gonna answer this prayer. How is god going to show me that he still loves me?
[time=1336] How could a good god allow bad things to happen? How how how I hear how's all the time
[time=1343] I think how's all the time so I want to ask you today what how Has been consuming and controlling the course of your life lately
[time=1352] I don't just want to ask you just be honest with yourself for a moment. This is not for me This is not for your neighbor. Don't tell your neighbor and you're writing it down covered up or something This is just for you and jesus for a moment. What how Is consuming and controlling the course of your life lately?
[time=1365] What fear has been driving you And as you're honest with yourself and god, I want to give you a little bit of a remedy to that I'm not going to get rid of all the howls. I can't do that. Only god can do that and in fact They'll still creep back up because we're human and we're flawed just like mary Saw those same things but I want to give you a verse that I think can help you this week Well, we went through the book of Colossians For about three months as a church. We went verse by verse through that book. We called it maturity university and we grew Can you get an amen? That was just a great time. We had a great time going through that But one of the verses in Colossians 3 stands out to me and it just hit me so hard this week And I want to read it to you Colossians 3 and verse 1 if then you've been raised with Christ
[time=1406] Those are the facts. What are we to do when we have fear seek the things that are above where Christ is seated
[time=1412] Somebody say seated seated He's seated at the right hand of God and some of you as you read that you're like, oh, I get it Now that's my problem like if God would just get up and do something Then I wouldn't have all of these issues He's seated like got and but here's here's the good news. Listen, you're afraid of so many things You have so many howls, but the who that created the universe Listen, he is not up pacing the hallways of heaven going man. I don't know what to do about that Kevin whoo, sorry camera people. I know just Like we think God should just be doing this right just pacing the hallways of heaven God is not pacing the hallways of heaven worried about what you're worried about right it down this way my friends
[time=1453] Listen, God is seated. God is seated while you are stressing
[time=1460] You needed to hear that today all the stuff that you're stressing about God's not pacing the hallways of heaven. God is seated while we are stressing He's sitting down Why is he sitting down see I knew it he's sitting down because he doesn't care He cares Why is he sitting down then pastor? I'm glad you asked He's finished Nobody said when he hung on the cross It is finished It is finished He's not seated because he doesn't care He's seated because he finished the work. He won the victory He's seated because he has overcome all of the stuff that makes us stressed He's seated because all the stuff that we get so anxious is so worried about He's not worried about him He is the king of kings and the lord of lords and he's not afraid of what you're fearful of
[time=1515] And he's not stressing over to the things that you are so stressed about this christmas season So in jesus name, I declare it's time for you to kick your feet up and rest In the one who's won the victory he's seated At the right hand of god and while we're stressing God is seated Jesus is sitting at the right hand of god
[time=1542] So I just pray this This over you this christmas Have a seat Because he's seated you can sit down to Stop pacing Start trusting Rest in the favor the presence Of god Those are the facts even when we have fear we can be seated Why? Well because god is Jesus is seated at the right hand of god and I think god that he is There and so I don't know where you're at But when we have a seat and realize where god where jesus is seated fear becomes a foot stool
[time=1577] And it becomes a foundation that god can grow The facts in our hearts and our lives and the favor of his presence in our lives
[time=1587] As a foundation through whatever frustration and fear you're facing right now. So fear. Yeah, it's a part of the faith journey
[time=1594] But god's ready to use it as a foundation to grow you to take you into something new He's seated. I'm glad he's seated favor Facts fear right down number four because this is what it leads into fulfillment fulfillment versus 35 through 38
[time=1609] That's where we'll land the plane for today and I love how the passage continues But we'll stop there today fulfillment when prophecies are fulfilled many of which were written over 700 years before the birth of christ as they have prophesied over 700 years before christ was born
[time=1623] And it reminds us here's what it reminds us of that god's promises were true then And that means they're still true today and that means we serve a trustworthy god Today and so let's read the fulfillment part of this passage verse 35 the angel answered her So she said how and here's what the angel said he gave her a who verse 35 and The angel answered her the holy spirit will come upon you and the power of the most high will overshadow you
[time=1648] Therefore the child to be born will be called holy the son of god and behold your relative
[time=1654] Elizabeth he's saying hey in case you don't believe me about you Let me give you another example here and Elizabeth her relative comes into play Your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son And this is the sixth month with her who was called baron She couldn't have kids and I love verse 37. Don't miss it for nothing Why why are you telling me this for nothing will be impossible with god?
[time=1678] I love how the niv translates that no word from god will ever fail That's how the niv says verse 37. So what does mary do verse 38 and mary said behold I am the servant of the lord let it be to me according to your word and the angel departed from her fulfillment
[time=1696] So how would this be fulfilled christmas reminds us god's promises are true and that's what was about to happen
[time=1702] But here's the formula if you just want a simple formula way to remember this formula for how to bring about
[time=1708] Fulfillment and trust in the fulfillment of god even when I feel fear write this down who is greater than how
[time=1716] Who is greater than how verse 34 mary asked the angel how how will this be verse 35?
[time=1723] The angel gave her the who the holy spirit is going to come upon you i'm going to overshadow you So if you rearrange the letters of the word how you can get who and I know you may not be able to do that overnight
[time=1735] So I want to ask you to do this to get to the who I want to challenge you to ask yourself How how god can I make your presence bigger than my problems this week?
[time=1744] It's a great question for us to ask how can I make your presence bigger than my problems?
[time=1749] How can I decrease so that you increase?
[time=1752] Here's how I would challenge you to write that down when you're faith in the who When your faith in the who exceeds your fear in the how
[time=1762] Fear no longer controls the course of your life I believe that to be true. I really do It doesn't mean you're going to be a light switch moment Doesn't mean that you still won't have fear about the how you will those things will come But my prayer every single day is that my faith in god the who behind it all Would overshadow just like the presence of the holy spirit would overshadow mary
[time=1789] That his presence would become bigger than my fears And I believe at that moment you remember the question I asked you earlier What how is consuming the course of your life at that moment? It doesn't really consume things quite as much anymore
[time=1804] And I pray that over you this week as the fulfillment of god happens. You're still going to have fear, but fear won't have you
[time=1810] I need that I'm still going to have fear, but fear is not going to have me in jesus name because my who is bigger than my how he's seated
[time=1820] He's not stressing I may be stressing but he is not and here's what happened after this passage great devotional material for you and verses 46
[time=1827] I think it's through about 55 is what's known as mary song And so the angel tells her these things. What does angel what does mary do next? Look in your bible. I forget y'all remind me
[time=1836] What does she do next?
[time=1838] after verse 38 Hmm, who's where does she go?
[time=1843] Visible Elizabeth like that makes sense right like so you said all of these things the angel said okay
[time=1850] This is going to happen to me and because nothing's impossible with god No word from the lord is ever going to fail. You remember your relative Elizabeth. You remember she old And she's barren and she can't have kids and she's going to bear son too
[time=1864] It's like Okay, let's go find out and so she goes to visit Elizabeth and and what does she find?
[time=1871] She's pregnant. Elizabeth is pregnant It's just as the angel had told her and she goes and sees the fulfillment of what was spoken to her
[time=1880] Then after that starting in verse 46 is what we see as mary song And it's about 10 verses those 10 verses get this remember She's the one that asked how in verse 34 But now when we get to verses 46 3 45 And you read mary song in 10 verses She uses variations of he him or his some 18 times in 10 verses
[time=1902] She had shifted a teenage girl now. She had shifted from how?
[time=1907] to who What a powerful picture of what making the presence of god bigger than my problems can look like And I thank god for mary's fate Nothing is impossible with god. So what does she do with it verse 38?
[time=1921] Well mary says well, I'm a servant of the lord. Let it be to me as you spoken and the angel departed from her
[time=1928] God uses my friends. God uses people who are willing God uses people who are humble God uses people who are available Write it down this way. I believe this with all my heart. God is way more interested in your availability than your ability
[time=1945] Some of you have been letting your lack of this ability Hold you back from making yourself available and god says do you look?
[time=1953] Look at me. Let me give you let me give you a secret about the presence of god He does not need your ability. He's got plenty of this stuff He is more than able he is more than capable God's far more interested in your availability than he is in your ability So humble yourselves first peter chapter five and verse six says it this way humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god so that at the proper time he may exalt
[time=1979] You that is exactly what he did in mary's life. And that's what god wants to do in your life That's why there is hope even when you feel like you are unable mary sure did too But look what happened through little old teenage mary Into the world came the savior the light of the world the hope of christmas And I pray we can cling to that hope when we're confused when we're unable and even when we're afraid as we're going to look at on christmas eve
[time=2005] In the days ahead. I pray for you that you can walk in that hope this week I'm gonna ask you just to buy your heads and pond or what it means to humble yourself under the mighty hand of god So that he could exalt you in due time Some of you are listening to this and I pray over you believers in the room right now You have the favor of god that means his presence is with you in a moment and just a few we are going to leave this place
[time=2024] But we never leave his presence because he has Induelled us and his spirit lives within us his presence is his favor Jesus is the fullness of the favor of god Those are the facts and we need to hang our hat on those facts even when we have fear We know that when we're stressing god is seated and he will fulfill his plan. He will fulfill his purposes
[time=2046] So what does it look like for you to walk in the who?
[time=2049] This week in a world that has so many house How can you trust in the who of christmas the hope of christmas who is jesus?
[time=2058] What bold step do you need to take in your family gatherings to represent him?
[time=2062] Even with those people that might drive you crazy. What is it that god's lay on your heart believers?
[time=2067] That's god and I believe he'll show you but listen some of you are here Some of you are tuned in or may hear this even far after christmas But the truth is the gospel is going to be the same then as it is now and I want to present it to you real simply Christmas happened because jesus came jesus is the hope of christmas and because he came
[time=2083] We can now know why he came he came to live the sinless life We could never live to die to pay a price for our sin that we could never pay For ourselves. He was the spotless lamb of god He died on that cross Well, he hung there. He said father forgive them. They don't know what they're doing He thought of you he thought of listen. He thought of this moment And what an amazing Christmas it could be To become a part of the family of god because he came that first christmas to die that brutal death But not to stop there he rose from the dead three days later and because he lives he won the victory
[time=2120] Over your sin over hell over the grave a victory We could never win on our own and we've got to stop trusting in anything But jesus if we want to be a part of the family of god, but the beauty is as the spirit draws us in this moment
[time=2132] God's inviting you There is hope for you God just sent me to be a mouthpiece to to tell you how much he loves you He loves you so much. He sent jesus. So will you trust in him to save you today?
[time=2147] And not in your good works or not in someone else's faith So today will you take that step?
[time=2153] Just asking jesus say something like this say jesus. I know you died for me I know i'm a sinner and the price of my sin is death Thank you for dying for me I believe you rose again Today I give you me I surrender my life to you Please save me
[time=2177] It's not about the words. It's about the posture of your heart being given to the lord And if that's you in this moment, pray that prayer Pray from your heart to his ask god to save you. He's going to do just that as believers are praying Let's take a moment in stillness and silence And just reflect and respond and what god is asking us to do. Will you do that right now?
