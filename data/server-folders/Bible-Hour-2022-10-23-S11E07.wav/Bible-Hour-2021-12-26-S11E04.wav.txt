[time=0] We've looked at Joseph's story, his experience of Christmas, and that we have hope when we're
[time=7] her experience with Christmas shows us that we have hope, even when we feel unable.
[time=15] But he does it through us at Christmas Eve, those of you who are here with us.
[time=24] There's shepherds and their experience of Christmas, and it showed us that there's hope when we're afraid.
[time=30] And today to tie that together, I think it's still a little bit of Christmas, but a lot of bit of where we're going for a new year.
[time=36] As we look at the wise men in Matthew chapter 2, I want to talk to you today about hope when I'm searching.
[time=42] Hope when I'm searching.
[time=44] And the wise men were searching for Jesus, and for this coming king, and no doubt it'll help you look ahead,
[time=52] but it's still a big part of the Christmas story. So I want to start with this question. I'll ask you, what are you searching for?
[time=58] Let's be honest with yourself before the Lord for just a moment. What are you searching for right now?
[time=62] Maybe you're searching for a new year, the flip of a one to a two, to bring about some newness, to bring about,
[time=70] hopefully maybe even some change of some of the problems.
[time=74] And I've got a little bit of bad news. I'm going to start with the bad news kind of guy.
[time=80] So here's the bad news. The bad news is, if you didn't make your bed at home when you left, the angels didn't swoop down and make it for you,
[time=86] and it's not going to be made when you get back. And in the same way, when the one flips to a two, you're still going to be there.
[time=92] Your problems will still be there. The problem people in your life are still going to be there.
[time=96] But the good news is that hope is here. The good news is that whatever it is that you're searching for,
[time=102] we're going to go on this journey with the wise men, and I believe they give us some postures we can carry with us into a new year.
[time=110] And I think some of you are searching for hope. And I want you to know, I think you came to the right place.
[time=114] It has nothing to do with me. It has nothing to do with this church. It has everything to do with the reason that hope is here.
[time=120] Hope himself, his name is Jesus Christ. There is hope even for you.
[time=124] And I'm glad that you're on that search, and God wants to meet you in that search.
[time=128] And that's exactly what he did with the wise men. They really became some of the first worshipers of Jesus.
[time=134] As we're waiting, as we're hoping, and I always use this last week of the year as an evaluation week.
[time=140] I've been blessed with a lot of great mentors in my life that from a young age, they taught me to not just live and build a life
[time=148] based off of experience making you better, but evaluate your experience so that you can create better experiences moving forward.
[time=156] So I always look back at the year that I have lived and always strive to look ahead with experiences, but evaluated experiences of what I have learned as we go into the next year.
[time=166] Maybe you do the same thing. It's a great process, a great thing that I would challenge you to do.
[time=172] But as you do that today, I believe there's something that we need to go into the new year with.
[time=176] And that something is worship. I think we are called and we learn from the wise men to worship while we're waiting.
[time=184] To worship while we're hoping. To worship while we're searching.
[time=188] And no doubt the wise men were some of the first recorded worshipers of Jesus as they came to worship the newborn king.
[time=194] The gospel of Matthew is where we'll be, Chapter 2. So grab your Bibles and let's go there together.
[time=200] But it's interesting the end of Matthew ends with Jesus after he's died on the cross, after he has risen from the dead.
[time=206] He appeared to hundreds of people before he ascended to be seated at the right hand of God.
[time=212] I talked to you about how Jesus is seated at the right hand of God recently.
[time=214] If you're here for that, it'll strike a chord, but if not, be rest assured today Jesus is still seated because he's done.
[time=220] He is finished. He has won the victory. He's seated even while we're stressing this season.
[time=226] But before Jesus did that, the end of Matthew, Matthew, Chapter 28, he gave us what we call the Great Commission.
[time=232] It's basically the marching orders that the church, the body of Christ, are called to live out.
[time=236] And he said, "Go into all the world." He said, "Go and make disciples."
[time=242] So at the end of Matthew, Jesus says, "Go into the world." At the beginning of Matthew, Matthew, Chapter 2, the world literally is coming to him.
[time=250] It's an interesting pair of bookends there as we look at this story.
[time=254] The world had come to Jesus to seek him. They were searching for him and they're known as the wise men.
[time=260] So I think, as we learn to worship and have a postures of worship, that it would be wise of us to follow the lead of the wise men as we go into a new year.
[time=268] So you're ready for the word today, Church?
[time=270] Matthew, Chapter 2, let's read the first 12 verses.
[time=274] Matthew 2, Verse 1, "Now after Jesus was born, this is the day after Christmas, fitting passage for us today.
[time=280] Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, and the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying,
[time=288] "Where is he who has been born king of the Jews, for we saw his star when it rose, and have come to worship him?"
[time=296] When Herod the king heard this, this is one of the bad guys of Christmas.
[time=298] If you're with us at Christmas Eve, it's not Marv or Harry, this is an even worse bad guy.
[time=302] Now that Herod the king, he heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
[time=306] And assembly, all the chief priests and scribes of the people he inquired of them, where the Christ was to be born.
[time=312] They told him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet, hundreds of years before the birth of Christ."
[time=318] I might add quoting here, "And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah, for from you shall come a ruler,
[time=326] who will shepherd my people Israel." Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared.
[time=336] And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him,
[time=342] bring me word that I too may come and worship him." And his plans were not to worship, like the wise men's plan.
[time=348] And there's a way we can worship God in spirit and truth, and there's a way we can worship God with a false religion.
[time=354] And that's exactly what Herod's describing, as we'll see as we keep reading.
[time=358] Verse 9, "After listening to the king, they went on their way.
[time=360] And behold, the star they had seen when it rose, went before them, until it came to rest over the place where the child was.
[time=368] When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.
[time=374] And going into the house, they saw the child with Mary, his mother.
[time=378] And they fell down and worshiped him.
[time=380] Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold, frankincense, and mer.
[time=386] Verse 12, "And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way."
[time=394] And from that passage, there are so many things we can learn from these wise men.
[time=400] And I want us to look at some of those things, but to start, let me show you this picture of a nativity scene.
[time=404] How many of you got one of these out? Everybody say, "Oh, ain't that cute." And so you notice in the nativity scene, there's typically the shepherds and a lot of animals.
[time=412] And Jesus is the centerpiece, of course, the baby in a manger and a stable.
[time=416] There's always Joseph and Mary.
[time=418] And typically, in your nativity scene, there are these three guys.
[time=422] Who are they? The wise men, we just read about them.
[time=426] So I got some bad news. Everybody do this saying, "I got grace for the pastor today.
[time=430] I'm about to blow up your nativity scenes for just a minute." But it's okay. Before I do, you can still use them next year.
[time=438] They're still godly. They still lift the name of Jesus up.
[time=440] But what I will tell you about our nativity scene is two key things.
[time=444] First of all, did you know that when this story happened, Jesus would have been more like two years old.
[time=448] I'll explain to you how I know that in just a few minutes, how we know that.
[time=452] Jesus was not a baby. And in fact, they also did not visit Jesus with the shepherds at the manger and a stable, either.
[time=460] It was a house. We just read about it. It's like, "Do you have to show me that in the Bible pastor?" I just did. And I'm going to show you that in a minute. But it's okay.
[time=468] I still have nativity scenes. You can still have your nativity scenes. But from these wise men, we learned several postures of worship.
[time=476] And so here's what I want to talk to you about today. Six hopeful postures for a new year that we can learn from the Christmas story even as we go into a new year. Here's what they are. Let's write them down together. Number one, humble minds.
[time=488] Humble minds. They displayed humble minds. And verse two it simply says, "We have come to worship Him." Let me explain to you why I say humble minds because these people known as the magi, magicians, we get that word from that, they're wise men. We don't know, by the way, even if there were three of them. We know there's three gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrrh. We know that. And so that's where we get three. There might have been more. There might have been less.
[time=512] We don't know how wise these people were. We don't know exactly how it is they heard about the coming king.
[time=518] It's been speculated that because they came from the east, we just read about that.
[time=522] Maybe they came from Persia or somewhere like Babylon and they heard of Daniel.
[time=526] And they're prominent, listen, prominent religious figures, even political figures. Usually would be very well off.
[time=534] And a lot of scholars would believe, you read about Daniel, I think it's chapter four.
[time=538] You see that Daniel had exposure to magi. So did Joseph.
[time=542] And so you see that through history and probably somebody like a Daniel had told them about the coming king. Daniel prophesied about that.
[time=550] I don't know how God spoke to them. We don't know exactly how God gave them all of the insights that led them to go on what is a huge long journey to search for Jesus. But here's what I do know is they were astronomy minded people. They observed things from an astronomy mindset. And astrological, say that five times fast, astrological mindset. Astrology was a big part of what they would do. They would look to the stars for so much of what they studied, so much of how they gave wisdom. Maybe that's what they thought made them wise. Here's what we know though.
[time=586] A star that was new, and they would have known if a star was new, a star that was new though would often be believed to announce the coming, to announce the birth of a very prominent figure.
[time=598] Okay? So in that interesting, and here's why I love that. You're like, okay, what's the big deal?
[time=602] Glad you asked. I love this part of the story because they were pagan people.
[time=606] Very few, if any of them would have been worshiping the God of Israel.
[time=610] They're pagan people, prominent religious figures, political figures.
[time=618] But they didn't believe in the one true God. Most of them, probably. It's the case for these as well.
[time=622] But here's what God does. I'm so glad God did it then, and I'm so glad God does it now.
[time=626] God used their language, their mindsets, their perspectives, and he used a star to reveal himself to them. Even pagan people like them. And even pagan people like you and me, God will use whatever he needs to to get our attention and to speak to us in any way that he can to get our attention. Tell me our God's not good. That's what Christmas is all about.
[time=654] God does that even with this star, but they had to have some humble minds. They had to eat some humble pie. They had to say, you know what?
[time=662] I don't know everything that's about to happen, but I just know there's something to it. And I'm willing to lay down my pride.
[time=670] I'm willing to go on this long journey to take a step of faith to see what God has for me. That's why I believe this statement, that humility is a key to unlocking hope. Hope and humility go hand in hand. If you want to find hope, and you want to have hope in this next season of your life, then the first thing you should do is humble yourself under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time. First Peter 5-6. This is what the Magi, the wise man, had to do.
[time=698] He had to understand that humility was a key to finding the hope that they were searching for.
[time=702] And it's remarkable that they came to worship, becoming some of the first recorded worshipers of King Jesus in all scripture.
[time=710] Pretty neat story. Can you imagine their mindsets though?
[time=714] I mean, it's amazing to think that these people would have come, taken such a journey to do that. But because they did, God opened their eyes. That's the second one. Open eyes.
[time=722] One of the postures is humble minds. Secondly, open eyes.
[time=726] And I want to talk to you about faith. Because there's an element of faith that has to do with seeing things that God puts in front of us, like a star.
[time=734] That's what happened with the Magi. They saw the star, verse 10.
[time=738] We're going to be in verses 10, 11, and 12 for the rest of our time. When they saw the star, verse 10, they saw it. Their eyes were open. So there's an element of faith that is seeing what God puts in front of you. But there's another element of faith that is trusting God with the things you cannot see. Can I get it? You know what I'm talking about. But they saw the star. But let's start with that seeing part of faith. The seeing part of faith. Here's what some of us look like in our faith right now.
[time=766] You've got your eyes closed so tight. And God is sending people.
[time=770] And he's even sending problems. He's even sending using pain. He's sending words from him. He's got his word.
[time=778] The word of God. The Bible is sitting on your shelf and is collected 18 layers of dust.
[time=782] And God is putting all these things right in front of you. But some of us just sit through life like this.
[time=786] And we refuse to see what God's doing.
[time=790] Y'all practice with me because some of you are really good at this. Do it with me. Just like this.
[time=794] But some of you, you know y'all didn't even do it. See my eyes were closed.
[time=798] I'm peeking this time. Y'all do it. Close your practice real quick. All right.
[time=802] See when we do that, sometimes you can open them now. You guys did great. So many times we live life in such a way where God is speaking. And the volume of his voice is not the problem. It's our listening ears. It's our willingness to see what he's putting in front of us that becomes the problem.
[time=818] So I say today, like they did, they opened their eyes. They saw the star.
[time=822] It seems like the most simple part of the passage. But maybe God's been doing something in your life and you've just been refusing to look. You've been refusing to see it.
[time=830] Open your eyes. Let God show you. But now let's talk about the other element of fate.
[time=834] Because that's the real hard one, right? It's like, okay, I'm going to open my eyes past from a look at what God is doing around me. But what about the stuff that I can't see?
[time=840] Be honest with yourself and in your heart, nod, if you agree with this statement about yourself, that,
[time=846] man, I really struggle to trust God with unknowns.
[time=850] I really struggle to trust God with things I can't figure out.
[time=856] I really struggle to trust God when I can't see the end result. The magi could see the star, but they did not know exactly what the star would lead them to.
[time=868] They had an idea. Whatever that idea looked like, it probably got shattered.
[time=872] In fact, we know that because Jesus came in the most humble of forms.
[time=876] They didn't know the end result. So they had, listen, get this. They took a step before they could see.
[time=884] That's a good word for us going into a new year. 2022 is on the way.
[time=888] They took a step before they could see. Before they knew the end result, they took a step. They took what they saw and they trusted God with what they couldn't yet see. That's a good word for us as we go into the new year. And when it comes to having open eyes, it's going to take some humility. And I forgot to give you this really good tool for humility with the first point, but they go together, don't they? So let me give you.
[time=912] I'm going to give you four words. It's going to change your life in 2022. It'll help you have open eyes and help you have humble minds. You're ready for the four words? They're deep. So get your pens out home, put that blanket off and go get up in your PJs and get you a pen.
[time=924] You're ready? Here they are. Four words. It's going to change your life and give you some humility.
[time=928] I might be wrong.
[time=934] Let's practice that together. Shall we? You didn't come to church for this, but God's got a new thing.
[time=938] He's ready to do for you in a new year. Let's practice them. Ready? I might be
[time=944] wrong. Try it sometime.
[time=948] I think it'll help you be able to see more clearly. God will speak and you'll be able to hear him in ways you haven't heard of him. You might even get some wisdom from some otherwise men or women in your life as well as we listen and we humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God. And so Hebrews 11-1, when it comes to open eyes, says this. This is the unseen part. Faith is the assurance of things hoped for. We're talking about hope. The conviction or the substance some versions read.
[time=972] The conviction of things not seen. So faith speaks to that which we can't see. And so here's the question for you and for me.
[time=980] Will you follow God's call? Whatever that looks like in you this new year.
[time=984] Will you follow God's call? Even when you can't see the end result. Well, the magi I had to, they saw a star.
[time=992] They saw some things, but they couldn't see the end result, but they trusted God.
[time=996] Will you do that as we go into a new year? God's got great things in store for you as you do.
[time=1000] And I want to give you what I have found to be, and I believe to be the greatest tool that has helped me trust the faithfulness of God with the things I can't see.
[time=1008] This has helped me trust God with my future. This has helped me trust God with unknowns. And I want to give you that greatest tool. You ready?
[time=1016] Here's what it is. It's really simple, but it has changed my life. I believe the greatest tool to help us have confidence in God's faithfulness for the future is to remember and recall God's faithfulness in the past.
[time=1028] Said to you a different way, the more I remember and recall how good God has been. Recall the faithfulness of God.
[time=1036] The more I gain confidence in His faithfulness for my future.
[time=1040] Seems simple, but this week I would challenge you as you evaluate and reflect on this year, write down a list of ways God has been faithful to you. And what's going to happen? And I got some more bad news.
[time=1052] Next year, not only are you still going to be there, there's going to be new problems this year. I'm sorry. I know you didn't come to church for that, but it's true. There's going to be new problems that are going to come about this year.
[time=1064] But the more you remember how faithful God was in this past year and the years prior to that, the more you'll be able to have faith in the things that you can't yet see. Even more you'll be able to have confidence in a God who is trustworthy and a God who is faithful even when the surprises of life come your way this year.
[time=1080] May we have humble minds, open eyes. Number three, write this down, lift it hands.
[time=1084] In verse 10, when they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. This is a construct in the original language.
[time=1092] Several words, it's almost like there weren't enough adjectives to describe the joy that they had. Do you know they lifted their hands? Well, no. But I'm imagining that this construct, which by the way, the word exceedingly means vehemently, eagerly, greatly. You can almost translate the construct in the original language, something like this big humongous, overarching, overwhelming joy that overflows. I mean, it's just that kind of joy. So I'm just guessing it wasn't one of these. A golf clap. I'm just guessing that they were lifted hands. They were probably shouts. I don't know what they did.
[time=1124] But I use lifted hands because I bet they did. And I think the imagery of lifted hands, if you're like me, you might think of worship songs. Some people lift their hands. Some people sit still.
[time=1132] Some of you move around. Some of you don't move at all. And we welcome that.
[time=1136] We want a free environment where everybody worships during a song the way that they do.
[time=1140] And a lot of times we tie worship to a song. And it's great. I worship every time we sing here.
[time=1144] But really worship is not something that we do. It's not a song that we sing. Worship is a way of life. It applies to everything that you do in the grocery store, in your homes, on Sunday mornings, in the church buildings. And really you could say it really applies even more beyond the church buildings, what we do in these doors.
[time=1160] And you're like, oh, I've been doing it wrong then. And that's why I'm here. I'm here to point you to some ways that you can have these postures moving forward.
[time=1168] And a lot of us at Christmas time, if you're honest, we kind of get interjoyed. They were overjoyed. Some of us get underjoyed. Some of you have really good reasons for that. I mean, grief is elevated during these times. Pain, loss.
[time=1180] I don't ever underestimate those things. And I've walked with many people and walked my own journey of that. And so for you, I tell you, I'm so sorry if this season has just elevated and escalated things that are difficult in your life. But I want to point you to a joy that lasts through it all. To an eternal hope. Hope has arrived today. And as we go into the new year, we can do that. But for some of us, we have joy. And we know we have joy and we've got to have grace for this statement. But sometimes, as Christians, we need to tell our face. We need to tell our actions.
[time=1212] Can I get a name in? You know any Christians like that? Like, I'm not saying do the church smile, but I am saying, I pray that God will help you overflow with a joy that doesn't come from circumstances. A joy that is internal, that comes from the inside out where you lift your hands. Here's a few ways, postures of lifted hands. We lift our hands in victory.
[time=1228] We say, whoa, my team won, right? Our hands are lifted high.
[time=1232] We say, yeah, we cheer. We lift our hands and surrender. Someone points a gun at you.
[time=1236] You say, and you surrender. So lifted hands are a posture of victory. They're a posture of surrender. Lifted hands are simultaneously both as we worship. We proclaim the victory of God.
[time=1248] Yet we surrender to a God who won the victory.
[time=1252] And it also symbolizes an openness. An openness to receive.
[time=1256] And an openness to give. But one of my favorites is as a parent, how many of you remember times when your kids lifted your hands?
[time=1264] In a sign of trust and dependence saying, pick me up, dad, or pick me up.
[time=1268] Mom, this is my little Kaya. You want to see her? Look at that.
[time=1272] She just melts my heart every time I see her. This was, I don't know, a couple years ago, probably and this face would have turned a lot more sad if mom or dad didn't pick her up.
[time=1280] And I didn't take that picture because if she did that to me, I ain't grabbing a camera.
[time=1284] That had to be Jessica to get the camera. I'm just kidding. She's right over there.
[time=1288] I'm in trouble later. Yeah.
[time=1292] If we'd awaited much longer, her trust and dependence would turn into fear because she needed, for whatever reason, she wanted us to pick her up.
[time=1300] And as we lift our hands, this is not just a physical posture. This is a posture of our heart.
[time=1304] As we have humble minds and open eyes to see what we can see and to trust God that we can't see, then we have a posture of lifted hands saying, God, you're sharing me where I can't carry myself. I trust you.
[time=1316] I depend on you. I'm open to receive from you. I'm open to give to you.
[time=1320] And I lift my hands both in victory and in surrender.
[time=1324] It's a great posture for us to have. And worship is not just something that you do.
[time=1328] It's something that we're commanded to in Scripture Psalm 47 and verse 1 says, clap your hands, all peoples. Shout to God with loud songs of joy.
[time=1336] Anybody who thinks the music's too loud, hey, we're just trying to be biblical.
[time=1340] You're welcome. This is the posture, though, that we bring in to not just a Sunday, but into a Monday and every day following.
[time=1348] Let's write down number 4, because here's what happened. They saw the star. They were joy exceedingly. Number 4 is they bowed their knees. Bowed knees is another posture. Verse 11, and going into the house, notice it doesn't say they went to a manger. Remember that in the tivity scene? They went into a house because that's where he was growing up at the time. A couple years later, probably.
[time=1364] Going into the house, they saw the child with Mary, his mother. And they fell down and worshipped him. Bowed knees. And the word for worship in the Bible in the Greek and New Testament and Hebrew and Old Testament is used over 200 times in those variations. And here's what it literally means in both senses. Here's a couple of the literal definitions.
[time=1384] To worship means to bow down low or kneel in worship or even to kiss toward. And so in that time you would bow and you would take the ring or the hand of someone that's above you and you would humble yourself below them and you would kiss their hand as a sign of awe and respect. And so it's that kind of language that they got on their knees. They got down on their knees. And I want to ask you guys a question.
[time=1408] How many of you have or have had or know a two-year-old? Because that's how old Jesus would have been here. This part of the story just blows my mind.
[time=1422] Two-year-olds are nasty.
[time=1426] They throw things. They are really loud. They won't sit still.
[time=1430] Can I get a name in? Like, come on.
[time=1434] Now, Jesus is not the average two-year-old. We didn't have to teach our kids to sin. How many of you taught your kids to sin? Anybody? No. They kind of pick it up on their own.
[time=1442] Jesus never sinned. Can you imagine a perfect two-year-old? I might have fell down and worshipped too if I had seen that. But as they come in they hit their knees to think of who God was in the form of this little child that would cause them to have humble minds to seek Him, open eyes to see what they saw and even what they can see in this humble posture that ultimately led to bended knee. I mean, what a picture in this story. I love this picture of people worshiping this little two-year-old.
[time=1474] And we learned that by the way, verse 7 and then verse 16. We didn't read verse 16 but we see that Herod, he ascertained verse 7, the time of the star. Why do you do that?
[time=1482] Because in verse 16, you can look there and see what he did. He says, then Herod saw that he had been tricked, by the wise men. He became furious and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem. And in all that region who were two years or under. According to the time he ascertained from the wise men. That's how we know that. And Mary Christmas.
[time=1498] That's a great Christmas verse, right? What an evil bad guy that God's word, that the word of God that became flesh had lived through.
[time=1506] They bowed their knees. And so let's look at this picture again.
[time=1510] In most nativity scenes, these guys are a little round, like some of us, but you can't tell maybe with them. But a lot of nativity scenes, you see them bowed, don't you? See them kneeling.
[time=1518] See them kneeling down. And I love that that's the case.
[time=1522] I love that we get to picture them kneeling before this little child who was born king of kings and Lord of lords.
[time=1534] These two verses 8 through 11, you can jot that down. It's a great passage. It talks about the humility of Christ and that we get to have this mind, this ours and Christ Jesus. What a beautiful picture.
[time=1542] And how Jesus humbled himself. But at the end of that passage, verse 11 tells us that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow.
[time=1550] Every tongue will confess that he is Lord to glory of God the Father. So the challenge of Christmas, the challenge of the new year is these bowed knees. Is instead of bowing later, some of you are like, "Who are you to tell me that?" Well, he's saying that to us.
[time=1566] And I know sometimes we don't, our pride doesn't like to hear that, but we will bow before Jesus. And so the challenge of Christmas and the challenge of a new year is just to bow now.
[time=1578] Bow now. May that be our posture. And one of the things that I've adopted a long time ago, and I just want to challenge, I share this not in pride because I'm doing anything right, it's quite the opposite. Every time I get the chance to preach, and I come early in the mornings and get up early in the mornings. And one of the things that I do every single time I get to preach is I just spend some time on my knees.
[time=1598] Every single time. I know some of you can't do that. Maybe physically, but spiritually, we sure can. It's just a beautiful thing for me.
[time=1606] And what it does, it's really not for the Lord. He doesn't need me at all. That's kind of the point.
[time=1610] I do it for me to remind myself of who I was and who I am. I was the shy, backward, awkward kid who would never look in the eye and would be sick on the days that I had to do any kind of public speaking.
[time=1622] And God said, I'm going to make that boy a preacher. And I said, "Haha, you're a crazy God." And he didn't strike me down. And he called me. And you know the phrase that I've used so many times. And that phrase is, God doesn't call the equipped, but he equips the called. He equipped me with stuff that I couldn't do on my own. It's always pray for my knees just to remind myself of who I am, of whose I am, of my dependence on him as I pray for you, as I pray for the words, I pray for the loss to come to know him, as I pray for the save to grow in their faith in him. And so what I want to challenge you to do, if you can this week, just try it. As you evaluate going into a new year, spend a little time on your knees just once. Just give it a shot. And let it be a time of humility and transparency before the Lord.
[time=1666] Bowed knees. I'm so thankful that we can bow now.
[time=1670] I'm thankful that the wise men showed us how. Number five, generous hearts. Generous hearts. Verse 11, then, after they had bowed, then they opened their treasures and they offered him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and mer. And as they opened their treasures, it symbolizes the opening of their hearts.
[time=1690] How do you know that, Pastor? Well, Jesus, later in his life, would have said it this way.
[time=1694] Matthew 6, 21, Jesus said, where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. That means our generosity is the greatest indicator of where our heart is. I mean, that's just a powerful truth.
[time=1710] And I challenge you with this, not listen, not because we want to get your money here. In fact, we say it this way here. When you give it, Black Hawk, you're giving to the Lord through Black Hawk. And the tie, in the tie, isn't that an Old Testament thing? Yeah, well, number one, Jesus affirmed it. We're going to spend the first couple of years looking at this as well. And just counterculture generosity that Jesus has called us into, that the wise men demonstrated. The tie, I always say it this way, the tie, this is the training wheels of trust. If I can trust God with that, then I can do what Jesus asked me to do. And that is trust God with 100%.
[time=1742] And give him my first fruit. And so I've been blessed and had family that have taught me to do that for a long time. And I have found my friends that it is really true what Jesus told us. Jesus said it this way, has recorded an axe. It's more blessed to give than to receive. It's really true. The wise men showed us that even as they gave their gifts. Later in Jesus life, in Matthew 15, this was
[time=1764] what was recorded of some people. These people, he says, honor me with their lips. Matthew 15, 8, and 9. These people honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. In vain do they worship me.
[time=1776] I've been guilty of these things. Teaching is doctrines, the commandments of men, where we kind of make our own rules that make us feel good and forget the true heart of worship, the true humble mind, the true open eyes, the true bended knees that we're talking about, the true generous hearts.
[time=1792] And the wise men, they intentionally plan. It was a, listen, a four to five month journey, probably some 900 miles that they came looking for Jesus. And they brought all of these gifts with such intentionality they brought these gifts. So I want to challenge you this week. Not because I want something from you. Or the church here wants something from you.
[time=1812] Or because God wants something from you. I want you to know God wants something for you. He wants you to live in the joy of being generous. And so step across the line. Maybe you gave to our give light. I was going to tell you at the end, but I'm going to tell you now.
[time=1824] You guys are so generous. And God has used you so much. Our give light offering went over $300,000 this year. And we far exceeded our goals to be able to give local and global missions beyond our year to date requirements. That's right. Let's give it up for Jesus.
[time=1836] And I thank God that we're a part of a generous church. It's important to ask you and challenge you. Because God wants something for you, not something from you.
[time=1844] He doesn't need us. The joy of generosity, having a generous heart, is to step across the line of giving. Maybe you gave at your end. Give with the training wheels of trust we call tithing around here. Start there and see what God will do through you. And also look for ways to be generous in your world.
[time=1860] I'll tell you, I was reluctant to tell you guys this. Should I tell you?
[time=1864] I won't tell you anyway. Then I got to really keep doing it every time. After I tell you guys, then you ask me if I'm still doing it. And then I got to make sure I'm still doing it. But all right, it's probably good for me.
[time=1872] One of the things I did, just to try to be generous, because I would hear over and over as a pastor how people in service industries or business people would find that the the meanest people to do business with sometimes are church people. I'd hear that over and over. Oh, it just drives me crazy.
[time=1888] And I'd hear from waiters and waitress. Any food service people in here, waiters, waitresses, you're going to amend me in just a minute. I promise you can raise your hand. I'm not picking on you. I promise. Those of you who are watching, and how many of you eat?
[time=1900] Anybody eat? Eat a restaurant? Okay. Well, good. That applies to you then. So here's what God put on my heart is no matter what kind of service I get at a restaurant. I will always tip 20% and above. And there have been a bunch of times that I have not wanted to follow through with that conviction where it's like, I would fight with the Lord in my heart. It'd be like, I ain't doing it today.
[time=1924] Do you see what they did? It was like, and it's like if God was like a human father would have looked at me something like this.
[time=1932] So find ways whether it's at a restaurant in your home to be generous. The early church was known to be the most generous group of people in the history of the world. It is our legacy as God's church. And I say we carry it on this year. Can I get an amen?
[time=1948] Let's have generous hearts through God's church and outside of the walls. And then their generosity, the wise man's generosity, was used to spread the gospel.
[time=1956] The gold, frankincense and murray, it represents a lot of things in history and in scripture.
[time=1960] The gold always would represent kingship. And we know Jesus came to be the king of kings and the Lord of lords. Frankincense would always be associated with a priestly, Levitical kind of duty, a priestly role. And we know Jesus is our high priest of high priest. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with us in our weaknesses. He's walked where we've walked, yet he did so without sin. Jesus is the king of kings represented in the gold.
[time=1984] Jesus is the Lord of lords. He is the high priest of all high priests. The book of Hebrews tells us, the frankincense reminds us of that. And then the murh was always used in burial. We know that Jesus came for a reason. And that reason was you and me. He came to die on the cross for our sin and to be buried in a borrowed tomb.
[time=2004] And it was borrowed because he wasn't saying because three days later he rose from the dead. But it's beautiful to see the generosity of the magi and how it painted a picture of the gospel, the king of kings, the high priest who would be buried and who would rise again. Our generosity is one of the greatest witnesses we can have for Jesus, not just at Christmas, but all throughout the year. Last thing, number six, discerning years.
[time=2032] Discerning years. Verse 12, "And being a dream not to return to Herod because he was mean.
[time=2040] They departed to their own country by another way." I bring that up because I want to ask you today, what have you been listening to?
[time=2048] I'm not talking about music or radio, those things matter too, but really what lies, here's what I'd ask you, what lies have you been believing this last year?
[time=2056] What lies has the enemy been whispering about yourself, about your identity, about other people, about how you should behave, about how you should justify your habits or sins or addictions?
[time=2072] What lies? If you're honest with yourself, have you been believing this last year? Second question, to have discerning years. What truth, what truth from the Lord would he have you to speak into the lies that you've been believing? What truth of the Lord would he have you to use to speak into, to combat the lies, the enemies, maybe been convincing you of about who you are, whose you are, how you should treat others, how you should live out your faith, what your priorities should look like. Maybe it's about a call that God's been, he's placed it on your heart, but it's so unknown and you can't see it and so you haven't taken a step. I don't know what it is. But what lies have you been believing and what truth can you speak into those lies as you go into a new year? And hopefully a week of evaluating as you head into a new year. Here's why I think that matters. I believe that your choices about voices will determine your destinations. I really do. I've seen that who you give here to, what you give here to is going to determine so much about where you go and who you become. So I say, let's listen to the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, the great High Priest, the one who came and was buried and rose again, the one who conquered death, the one who made a way for us to become a part of the family of God. I say we listen to him this year. Who's with me?
[time=2152] He's got a plan for you, my friends. Look at me.
[time=2156] He's got a plan for you. Stop believing the lies of the enemy that God couldn't use somebody like you. Stop believing the lies of the enemy that God, His love for you is diminished a little bit because of that thing you did. There's nothing you could do to make God love you more and there's nothing you could do to make God love you less.
[time=2176] Stop believing the lies of the enemy.
[time=2180] I don't know what you're searching for today. Hopefully these postures give you some good ways to go into a new year. But if you fell asleep in the sermon, or if the kids were loud, here's the whole sermon in one statement for you today.
[time=2192] I want you to know today that everything you are searching for can be found in Jesus. And Jesus loves you. I'm going to ask you to bow your heads and ponder that for just a few minutes. God loves you so much.
[time=2208] And I know some of you came searching for something today and believers just want to ask you just to pray and just ask God, what is it that God is speaking about these postures in my life? I believe it gives you some great ways to evaluate and hopefully go into a new year better. But more than that, I want you to go into a new year, newer, fresher in your walk with God as He does these new things that He's stretching you to do. Ask God what step of fate. We've been reading Corinthians 3 12 that says, "Since we have such hope, we are very bold." Ask yourself, how can I be very bold? Believers are praying, but some of you would say, "Today I just don't know that I have a personal relationship with Jesus." The gospel is very simple. You're a sinner. You're separated from God because of your sin. Jesus came that first Christmas morning to die a brutal death, to pay a price for your sin after living the sinless life that you could never have lived on your own. To win a victory you could never win over death, over hell, and over the grave.
[time=2264] He won that victory when he rose from the dead. So if you've never trusted him or if you want to nail that down today, pray something like this in your own words from your heart.
[time=2272] Prayer doesn't save us, but our heart being given to him is what saves us. I thank God that He made that available. Pray something like this. Say, "Jesus, I'm such a sinner.
[time=2280] I need you. Will you save me and forgive me? I know you are. Will you say you are?
[time=2288] I know you died for me on that cross. I know you won the victory. I know you raised from the dead. You're alive. Today I just give you me. As best as I know how, all of me, not some. I don't trust in works. Don't trust in me to save me. I trust in you.
[time=2304] Please save me. In your own heart, in your own words, we cry that out to Jesus as we reflect and respond and get ready to see the new things he'll do in this year. Take a moment and do that right now.
