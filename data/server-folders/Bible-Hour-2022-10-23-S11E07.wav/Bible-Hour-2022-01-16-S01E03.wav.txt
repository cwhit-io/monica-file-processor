[time=0] The larger theme that Pastor Kevin has been working on is called counterculture.
[time=5] A counterculture is a movement within a larger movement. It's a movement that says where we're
[time=12] headed is not necessarily the right way. We think we ought to head things in a different direction.
[time=17] We've been celebrating counterculture this past weekend with Dr. Martin Luther King Day. He was
[time=23] a counterculture leader. He changed the course of our country from the inside with his commitment
[time=29] to nonviolence and Rosa Parks changed literally how Americans live their life today because she wouldn't get off the bus. Isn't it great that there are people like that who counter the culture,
[time=40] but there was no one who countered the culture more than Jesus. Jesus stepped into a world that
[time=46] the culture said, "If you want to please God, you've got to be good enough. You've got to keep the
[time=52] rules and you've got to perform. You've got to be good enough. You've got to keep the rules
[time=58] and you've got to perform." Nobody changed the way we looked at life the way that Jesus has changed
[time=65] the way we looked at life and the way we looked at worship. We are called by Jesus to change the
[time=72] world not to be changed by the world. We were called to change how we think about God and because
[time=80] our own human constructions are inadequate and insufficient. So what Jesus is calling us to do
[time=86] is to be the salt of the earth, the light of the world, in a culture that doesn't represent
[time=92] what God represents to represent him in a way that is so loving and so full of grace the watching world will say, "I need what these people have." There were two guys, Paul and Apostle and a guy
[time=103] by the name of Silas, who went on what we call the second missionary journey. They went through
[time=109] places that we now call Turkey, Greece, Macedonia, and when they came to a city called Thessalonica,
[time=116] the town erupted and the leaders of that town said, "These two men have turned the world upside
[time=124] down." What they meant as a criticism, we went, "Yes, that's what God has called us to do, to turn
[time=130] the world upside down." What we want to do today is talk a little bit about the counterculture of
[time=138] religion. Pastor Kevin taught us last week that there are two things that are distinct about
[time=144] Christianity. One is the resurrection of Jesus Christ, that is pivotal, that is so powerful,
[time=151] that defines who we are and what we believe. Jesus was asked by a hostile crowd, "Why do you say the things you say? Why are you doing the things that you're doing? You're outside
[time=164] our culture, you're outside our structure, you're outside our rules, you're outside what we think is the way you should be performing. What proof do you give us?" Jesus said, "Destroy this temple,
[time=175] meaning his body, and they understood. Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it back up." When Jesus was executed, his body was placed in a tomb and his critics came to the Roman authorities
[time=187] and said, "We remember when that deceiver was alive." He said, "In three days he'll rise again,
[time=193] so guard the tomb so he doesn't have any way out, and his disciples cannot steal the body, and say
[time=200] he's risen." They knew what Jesus meant, and they placed a guard at the tomb, and on Easter Sunday
[time=208] morning he rose again. That's what we believe. That's not only what we believe, that's why we believe,
[time=214] and that is what it means to be a believer in Christ, that you believe that he rose from the dead
[time=220] as he predicted and as he promised he also performed. The second thing that is unique about Christianity
[time=227] from all the religions is the idea of grace. Every other religion says, "You must do to be
[time=235] accepted by God. You must do the sacrifice. You must do the obedience. You must do the religious rites and traditions." Christianity says, "It's not about do. It's about done. It's what Christ has
[time=247] done for us." Christ died on the cross as a substitute. He took my place. There was a cross that had a
[time=254] name on it, Richard Walter Hawks. That's what my parents called me when I was in trouble.
[time=259] And I'm in trouble. I can't save myself. I can't perform well enough, and so there was a cross
[time=267] with my name on it. There was a cross with your name on it, and Jesus took the name off of it, put his name there, and he died for my sins. He died for your sins. He died for the sins of the world.
[time=278] And out of grace, he gives us a home in heaven. What's unique about Christianity,
[time=286] the resurrection of Christ, and that we have a concept of grace that changes everything.
[time=293] Let me tell you a little bit about a couple from Fort Wayne. They went on a missions trip to China.
[time=301] Something happened on that missions trip that almost defies explanation, but that God moved in their heart as a husband and wife to say, "We need to do all we can to help China, and we need to do all that we can to help the orphans who are here." And so they went back at their own expense on 20 different missions trips to China.
[time=321] While they were there, they fell in love with Chinese children, and they adopted three.
[time=328] In addition to that, they continued to go back and led others to adopt children, and their influence on the communist government of China was powerful.
[time=338] So powerful that the communist official in a central Chinese province
[time=344] said the best hope for a Chinese orphan is to be adopted by an American Christian family.
[time=351] Can you imagine that being said in communist China that the best hope for a Chinese orphan
[time=358] is to be adopted by an American Christian family? That's called turning your world upside down.
[time=366] God will give you an opportunity. God will use your life as much as he used that couple's life
[time=373] to become a culture changer, to take a different look at the world and to say what would Jesus see
[time=380] and what would Jesus do? All other beliefs are based upon performance.
[time=390] In the Old Testament, we are presented with the Ten Commandments, but if it was just
[time=397] Ten Commandments, we might do a decent job on one or two of them, but nobody can keep the Ten
[time=404] Commandments, nobody. But there's more than ten. In the Old Testament, there's actually 613
[time=412] Commandments, 613 Commandments, and you were expected to know them, and you were expected to
[time=419] keep them. But beyond the 613, there were many, many pages, if not volumes of books,
[time=426] written on what it meant to keep just one commandment. For example, one of the commandments is, they shall honor the Sabbath. What does that mean? And so there were scholars, there were leaders,
[time=439] there were teachers, there were scribes, there were Pharisees who meticulously kept detailed,
[time=447] what can you do on the Sabbath and what can you not do on the Sabbath? And for us, it almost gets comical at times. If you were to take an Israel trip and if you ever get the chance, do it,
[time=458] you'll never regret it. You'll find that in your hotel, there are elevators that just operate
[time=464] like an elevator anywhere else in the world, except on Sabbath, which they call Shabbat.
[time=469] On Shabbat, things change with the elevators. Most of them will run like a normal elevator,
[time=476] but if you get on the Shabbat elevator, you're in for a very long, very slow ride. The Shabbat
[time=484] elevator stops on every floor. And if you're on floor 17 and you got on a floor 1, you're losing
[time=490] your mind by the time you get to the 17th floor. And you see, why in the world would they make it stop on every floor? Because you must honor the Sabbath, you must honor Shabbat and it's work to
[time=502] push a button. So you can't work on Sunday, so you can't push the button on Sunday, so the elevator has to be self-directed. And so it stops on every floor because you're not allowed to
[time=513] push the button because that's work and you'd be violating the Sabbath. There are rule after rule
[time=519] after rule like that of defining what it meant to keep the Sabbath. Nobody could keep the Sabbath
[time=526] because they had so many rules that defined what the rule meant. And there's a strange verse which
[time=532] repeated three times in the Old Testament like this. You cannot boil the kids' meat in the mother's
[time=540] milk. What in the world does that mean? Well, they think it means you can't double up on your meat.
[time=549] And their law is that you can eat meat at this meal, but only one kind of meat. So if you have beef,
[time=559] you have beef, that's your meat. You can't have beef and chicken. It's not a smorgasbord with multiple meats. There's one meat for this meal. And if you have meat, meat is also not just a food that you eat.
[time=573] Meat means cows, cows mean milk, so milk's part of the meat, and you can't have meat and dairy.
[time=580] Makes sense so far? Now it gets a little bit more complicated than that. You can't have coffee if
[time=589] you have meat because if you have meat you have dairy. If you have dairy you would put milk in your coffee to dilute it with can't have milk, so we just can't have coffee. So we found that out on day
[time=602] one. And I want you to know, you don't necessarily want to be on a bus with 40 Americans deprived of
[time=609] coffee early in the morning. I could care less. I don't like this stuff, but my wife loves her
[time=617] morning cup of coffee. And so on the second day in Israel, having been there 24 hours, I know everything. I know how to get your coffee. Don't worry about it. So I go down the hallway, find a
[time=628] cup, take it to a vending machine that makes coffee, and I come carrying it into the dining
[time=634] commons. You would have thought I was there to assassinate the prime minister. Men came at me
[time=641] from every direction. Stop! I'm thinking, oh my goodness, what's behind me? I thought there was
[time=647] somebody behind me doing bad, bad things. It was me they were after. They said, no,
[time=653] I'm smart. I said, I got it outside. No dairy. Well, the rules are a little tighter than I understood.
[time=663] There were cups that were used for dairy, and there were cups that were used for non-dairy.
[time=669] And you had to have a non-dairy cup, which they weren't using that day because that would be
[time=676] doubling up on the meat. How would you like to try to figure out what you can have for lunch every day with rules like that? And all of this was to say, you've got to keep the rules,
[time=687] you've got to perform in order to please God. And it was the same way, if you weren't Jewish,
[time=697] pagans had the same thing. If you wanted to be pleasing to God, you had to keep whatever God
[time=703] you worshiped rules. Some of the rules may have been good. Some of them may not have been good.
[time=709] But if you wanted something from the gods, healing for a sick child, rain for your crops, deliverance from your enemies, forgiveness for your sins, entrance into an
[time=720] afterlife, all depend on you being good enough. And you weren't, and you knew it. You knew you
[time=729] weren't even close. And in order to make up for your shortcomings, sacrifices were demanded.
[time=735] Sacrifice might be an animal, it might be money, and some horrific religions taught you had to sacrifice your children. That's what the gods wanted. This was the culture of a performance-based
[time=748] religion. It was the dominant culture of Jesus' day, but it was not the dominant culture of Jesus.
[time=756] There's a single word in the New Testament to describe this process of a performance-based
[time=765] religion. It is called works. Good works in particular. And this is a word called grace.
[time=776] Grace is put in just a position of works. You either are trusting in your works,
[time=784] what you do, or you're trusting in Christ what he has done by dying on the cross for our sins.
[time=792] This word grace actually means gift.
[time=801] It is grace. It is a gift that God gives you forgiveness for your sins. It's a gift that God
[time=807] gives you a home in heaven. It's a gift that God fills you with his Holy Spirit. It's a gift that
[time=813] God gives you to be effective in ministry. God gives us all that we have in and through Christ
[time=822] Jesus. The word grace is found in the Old Testament in my English translation that came up about a
[time=829] half a dozen times, but it's mostly a New Testament word where it's used about 180 times. And none by
[time=836] Paul, none of the users of the word grace use it the way Paul does. If you used all of the New
[time=844] Testament, you'd be surprised to find out Matthew and Mark don't use the word grace.
[time=849] Paul uses it more than all the other writers put together. And he's famous for this statement,
[time=856] you are saved by grace and not of works so that no one can boast.
[time=864] Now, we often give the impression that there's something wrong with doing good deeds,
[time=870] not in the least. What's wrong is trusting in those good deeds to warrant you a place in God's
[time=878] heaven. Good deeds are very important to God, but not in a means of counting on them
[time=887] to merit salvation. We often quote Ephesians 2, 8, 9, 4, by grace you have been saved through faith.
[time=896] It is the gift of God, not of works so no one can boast. But the next verse tells us that God
[time=903] has a plan and a purpose for good works, for we are His workmanship created in Christ Jesus
[time=909] to do good works. God has prepared that in advance that you and I would do good works as a result of
[time=917] our salvation, not as the basis of our salvation. Jesus was the best storyteller in the world.
[time=927] And so he told a story to compare the difference between a grace-based faith and a works-based
[time=935] faith. I like to call it the tale of two brothers or the tale of two sons, but we usually call it
[time=943] the story of the prodigal son. Let me read it for you so that I get Jesus' words precisely.
[time=951] There was a man who had two sons. The younger one said to his father, "Father, give me my share
[time=959] of the estate so the father divided up his property between them." Not long after that,
[time=966] the younger son got together all he had set off for a distant country and there squandered his
[time=972] wealth in wild living. And after he had spent everything there was a famine, a severe famine,
[time=980] in that whole country and he began to be in need. So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of
[time=988] that country who sent him to his field to feed pigs. He longed to fill his stomach with the pods
[time=996] that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything. When he came to his senses he said,
[time=1004] "How many of my father's hired men have food to spare, and yet I'm starving to death?" I will set out and go back to my father and say to him, "Father, I've sinned against heaven
[time=1016] and against you. I'm no longer worthy to be called your son, so make me like one of your hired men."
[time=1024] So he got up and he went to his father. While he was still a long way off,
[time=1032] his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him. He ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him. The son said to him, "Father, I've sinned against heaven
[time=1044] and against you. I'm no longer worthy to be called your son." But the father said to his servants,
[time=1050] "Quick, bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.
[time=1057] Bring the fatted calf and kill it. Let's have a feast and celebrate." For this son of mine was
[time=1064] dead and is alive again. He was lost and is found, so they began to celebrate. Meanwhile,
[time=1074] the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard the music and the dancing.
[time=1082] So he called one of the servants and asked him, "What was going on?" "Your brothers come home,"
[time=1088] he replied, "and your father has killed the fatted calf because he has him back safe and sound."
[time=1095] The older brother became angry and refused to go in, so his father went out and pleaded with him.
[time=1105] But he answered his father, "Look, all these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your
[time=1114] orders. Yet you never gave me a young goat, so I could celebrate with my friends. But this son
[time=1120] of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes, he comes home and you kill the fatted
[time=1129] calf for him." My son the father said, "You were always with me and everything I have is yours.
[time=1137] But we had to celebrate and be glad because this brother of yours was dead and he's alive.
[time=1146] He was lost and now he's found. This story of Jesus so clearly portrays the difference between
[time=1157] those who are performance-based and those who are grace-based.
[time=1162] The older brother was performance-based. The younger brother and the father were grace-based.
[time=1172] I'd like to quickly wrap this up with seven lessons that I'm learning. Notice I didn't say I've
[time=1180] learned. Lessons I'm learning about grace. The first is this. When we live by a performance-based
[time=1192] faith, we overstate our virtues. If we think life depends on our proven good deeds,
[time=1201] we tend to emphasize our virtues even to the point of exaggeration. The older brother was in the
[time=1209] field. He was on the job. He was working hard and he never disobeyed his father once or so he says.
[time=1219] He was always the good son. He was Mr. Dependable and he made sure that his virtues were well known
[time=1226] amongst the family. He wanted to make sure they knew he was the good son.
[time=1232] Second, when we live by a performance-based faith, we understate our vices. He had plenty,
[time=1239] the older brother. He didn't know it. He didn't see it. It was a part of his spiritual blind side.
[time=1245] We all have a spiritual blind side. We all have parts of our character and parts of our conduct
[time=1252] that we don't want to see. We block them out rather effectively. He doesn't want to bring up
[time=1262] that he was difficult to work with. He doesn't mention that he's self-centered, angry, self-righteous, critical, judgmental. He doesn't bring up that he was resentful.
[time=1274] He hid. He covered up these undesirable qualities of his life because it's performance-based.
[time=1282] And if you knew his dark side, if you knew my dark side, you might not be so quick to receive
[time=1288] either one of us. Three, when we live by performance-based religion, our instinct is to resent.
[time=1299] There's some phrases he uses that show his resentment. Here's one of them. "I've been
[time=1305] slaving for you. My life's been hard." And it just got harder because this son of yours came home.
[time=1313] That's the second phrase he uses. "This son of yours." Do you ever notice how you get
[time=1319] different names in your family? I went by Rick. I liked Rick. When I was little, I was Ricky.
[time=1326] When I met the middle school, I didn't like the Ricky. I made sure everybody knew I was Rick.
[time=1331] But then my elementary gym teacher moved over to the high school. The first thing he said was,
[time=1337] "Aren't you Ricky Hawks? I got Ricky back." I didn't like being Ricky and 16 years old.
[time=1343] But the name that really was trouble was Richard. If my mother said Richard, Walter Hawks,
[time=1352] no good thing followed. But this was even lower than first name, middle name, last name.
[time=1363] He's not even calling him his brother. He's not calling him by his name. He says, "This son of yours."
[time=1370] He's a screw-up. And it's your problem. You've enabled him. You've given him too much slack.
[time=1379] If you had treated him like you treated me, it's not easy being the firstborn you know.
[time=1384] He's angry. He's frustrated. He's resent-filled.
[time=1393] Number four, when we live by grace and a grace-based faith, our instinct is to rejoice.
[time=1406] The older brother is known for his resentment. The younger brother is known for his rejoicing.
[time=1413] The resentment of the older brother just bleeds through the entire story. He resents his brother
[time=1421] for squandering the money. He resents his father for giving him the money. He resents the servant
[time=1427] for telling him that the brother's back. He resents this whole family business that he's tied up in.
[time=1434] He resents that things have been gone his way. Most of all, he resents that his father's enabling this kid one more time. But the younger brother is rejoicing.
[time=1447] And the younger brother is rejoicing because the father is rejoicing.
[time=1451] You may have made a mess of your life. And you may say there's nothing in my life to rejoice about.
[time=1457] God's rejoicing in you. God's rejoicing in you. And when you find his love and you find his
[time=1466] forgiveness and you find his peace, you'll be able to rejoice in yourself when you've experienced Christ's love. This is actually one of three stories that go together. In Luke 15, it tells us in
[time=1480] introduction that there were two people there, a Pharisee, maybe more than one, and a teacher of
[time=1488] the law, again maybe more than one, but at least two there who were taking note of what Jesus
[time=1494] said and what Jesus did. And they didn't like his grace-based teaching. And they complained.
[time=1502] And so for their benefit, he told three stories. The first is about a shepherd, a shepherd who was watching over his sheep. And one of them got separated from the flock.
[time=1512] There was a lost sheep. And he left the 99 and went out and found the one. Isn't that reckless?
[time=1519] The story found some familiar. The shepherd finds the sheep, comes back. The shepherd's rejoicing
[time=1529] tells his neighbors and the neighbors are rejoicing. Jesus then rolls into the second story, not about a shepherd, but about a woman, presumably an older woman, presumably a widow, who has lost a coin.
[time=1543] To have coins was a rare moment in her life, and to lose one was a tragedy. And she lost a coin,
[time=1551] and she literally tore the house apart until she found the coin. And when she found the coin, she went over to her neighbors and said, "I found it. I found the coin." And they rejoiced.
[time=1561] And the third is a story about a lost son. The lost sheep, the lost coin, the lost son,
[time=1568] have some things in common. One, something that was very valuable was lost. Two, that which was
[time=1576] valuable was found. And three, there was great rejoicing. And Jesus said, "And so it is in heaven,
[time=1584] that when one sinner repents, there is great rejoicing in heaven." Jesus didn't say that for
[time=1592] the benefit of his father, or the benefit of the prodigal son. He said it for the benefit of the sphedducees, the Pharisees, and the teachers of the law, the rule keepers.
[time=1604] Number five, when we live by a grace-based faith, humility leads our way. You may be in the position
[time=1616] where you've separated from your family. You're not talking to your parents. You don't have that bridge of connection to your siblings. You've walked away. They've walked away.
[time=1626] And you don't have any idea how to get back. Humility will lead the way.
[time=1633] The Bible tells us repeatedly that pride goes before the fall, or pride goes before destruction.
[time=1640] But it also tells us that if we humble ourselves, what will God do? He will lift us up.
[time=1648] And the whole turning point in this story is when the says, "And the son came to his senses." The son came to his senses, and he said, "I'm going to go home." The servants at my father's place have it better than I do. I'm going to go home.
[time=1664] I'm going to take a chance that they'll forgive me one more time. I'm going home. I can't stand
[time=1672] these pigs. I'm hungry to eat their slop. The people who work for my dad are far better enough. I'm going to go home. And I'm going to say, and he thought about it. He planned it.
[time=1683] I'm going to say, "Dad, I've sinned." I can't blame it on you. I can't blame it on my brother.
[time=1691] I can't blame it on it. I have sinned against you. It wasn't right what I did to you.
[time=1697] And more than that, I've sinned against God.
[time=1703] And I'll say, "Will you forgive me? Will you just hire me? I'll work for my food." So he heads for home, wrapped up in humility. And his father sees him a long way off, runs to him,
[time=1717] embraces him, hugs him, kisses him, calls for the servant, kill the fatted calf,
[time=1724] give me a ring and a robe. He's home. Our prayers have been answered. He's home.
[time=1731] None of that is possible without humility. If you need a road back in your family,
[time=1738] adopt the robe of humility, nothing less than complete humility is a basis for restoration.
[time=1746] Number six, no one performs good enough.
[time=1756] Not this self-righteous, older brother, not the religious Pharisees that prompted the story,
[time=1762] none of these deserve the grace that was given to them.
[time=1768] No one keeps the rules. No one is good enough. In the Old Testament, it reads, "The soul that
[time=1777] sins shall die." Paul echoed that in Romans 3, 23, and all have sinned and come short of the
[time=1787] glory of God. Romans 3, 10, there's none righteous. No, not one. The wages of sin is death,
[time=1798] but the gift of God is eternal life. No one is good enough.
[time=1804] Number seven, but God's grace is sufficient. God's grace is sufficient.
[time=1812] This younger brother had been hit pretty hard by the older brother. He dialed right in on him.
[time=1819] He squandered your money with prostitutes. Let's not dance around it, Dad. Let's call it what it's
[time=1827] like, and his brother wants to rub his face in it. And this kid knows he's not good enough.
[time=1834] But he has something. He's got a father he trusts to forgive him. And you have a heavenly father
[time=1842] you can trust to forgive you. He will welcome you home because his grace is sufficient.
[time=1851] Grace, grace. God's grace, grace that is greater than all my sin. How shall my tongue describe him?
[time=1863] Where shall my praise begin? That's why they call it amazing grace.
