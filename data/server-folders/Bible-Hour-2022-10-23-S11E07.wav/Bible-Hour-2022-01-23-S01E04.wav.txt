[time=0] Well, we are a part of a series titled "Counterculture," and Jesus was the ultimate at counterculture.
[time=10] There was an interview that Jesus had with a woman who remains unnamed in the pages of
[time=16] Scripture, but they had this conversation at a well, and so we know her name as the woman
[time=22] at the well.
[time=24] And because of the particulars of their conversation, it is completely counterculture.
[time=32] The particulars are that Jesus is obviously a Jewish man.
[time=37] She is a Samaritan woman with a sordid past.
[time=42] And this created immediately attention when Jesus sat down at the well to talk with her,
[time=48] because first of all, men didn't talk to women who weren't their wives in a public setting.
[time=54] This was considered inappropriate contact for him to talk to her.
[time=60] But more problematic than the gender issue was the ethnic issue.
[time=64] Jesus was a Jew, and she was what the Bible called a Samaritan, and Jews and Samaritans
[time=72] went out of their way to avoid each other.
[time=76] In fact, the usual path from the north Galilee to the south Judea was crossing the Jordan
[time=83] River to get out of Samaria, going south and then recrossing the Jordan to get back.
[time=89] So you didn't have to deal with the Samaritans.
[time=92] And Jesus went into Samaria, and he's talking to a woman, but the problem gets worse.
[time=97] Jesus knowing everything diagnosed her spiritual need, and when she was trying to bluff him,
[time=103] he said, "Well, go get your husband." It sounds pretty benign, doesn't it?
[time=109] Until she has to say, "Well, I have no husband," and Jesus said, "You're being honest.
[time=114] You have no husband." The truth of the matter is, you've had five husbands, and you're living with a man now.
[time=123] Instead of being offended, she realizes, "How does he know this?
[time=127] This must be the Messiah that we're looking for." It was a great conversation that was only possible because Jesus was going counter to
[time=137] the culture.
[time=140] There's a list of names of people who went counter to the culture.
[time=144] It's found in the book of Romans and the 16th chapter.
[time=149] So if you have a Bible or smart device, take a moment and find Romans chapter 16.
[time=155] Some of you are already nodding your head like, "I know this isn't going to be good," because Romans 16 is not a passage of the Bible that gets quoted very often.
[time=164] It's a list of names, a list of non-English names.
[time=168] Okay, confession is good for the soul.
[time=172] How many of you, and I'm one of them, when you hit those passages of genealogies, you skip them.
[time=180] There's a reason they're there, but I can't begin to figure out what the reason is.
[time=184] Well, Romans 16 is not a listing of a genealogy, but it's a listing of names, dozens of names,
[time=193] most of which we don't use today and are a little bit of a struggle to pronounce.
[time=197] I'm going to take a step, and it's not courageous.
[time=201] I'm going to take a step and read these verses to you.
[time=205] It's not courageous.
[time=206] I don't know how to pronounce all of them, but I know that you don't.
[time=212] So whatever I say is what it is, did you find Romans 16?
[time=219] I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a deacon of the church in St. Craig.
[time=226] I ask you to receive her in the Lord in a way worthy of her and of his people and give
[time=234] to her any help she may need from you, for she has been the benefactor of many people,
[time=242] including me, greet Priscilla and Aquila.
[time=246] My co-workers in Christ, they risk their lives for me.
[time=251] Not only I, but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them, greet the church that
[time=260] meets in her house, greet our dear friend Eponetus, who was the first convert to Christ
[time=267] in the province of Asia, greet Mary who worked very hard for you, greet Andronicus and Junia,
[time=278] my fellow Jews, who have been in prison with me.
[time=282] They are outstanding among the apostles, and they were in Christ before I was.
[time=289] Greet Empatletus, my dear friend in the Lord, greet Urbannus, our co-worker in Christ, and
[time=297] my dear friend Staccus, greet Apellus, whose fidelity to Christ has stood the test, greet
[time=305] those who belong to the household of Aristotleis, greet Herodian, my fellow Jew, greet those
[time=312] in the household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord, greet Trifemi and Trifosa, those women
[time=320] who worked hard in the Lord, greet my dear friend Purisis, another woman who has worked
[time=326] very hard in the Lord, greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother who has been a
[time=334] mother to me too, greet a syncretist, valet John, Hermes, Petrobus, Hermas, and the other
[time=343] brothers and sisters with them, greet Philo de Vilagas, Julia, Neurosis, and his sister,
[time=351] an Olympus, and all the Lord's people who are with them greet one another with a holy
[time=358] kiss.
[time=360] This is an incredibly counter-cultural list of names.
[time=365] It doesn't leap out to the page if somebody hadn't told me, I would have never known it.
[time=370] But here's what makes this so counter-cultural.
[time=373] First of all, the list is topped by women, the first person mentioned, Phoebe.
[time=382] Next person mentioned is Priscilla, the wife of Aquila, then very quickly we're introduced
[time=388] to some other women, Mary being one of them.
[time=391] And all of this list, there are 10 women in a culture that did not celebrate the accomplishment
[time=398] of women.
[time=399] In a culture that felt that women were to be seen only when their husbands wanted them
[time=405] to be seen, otherwise they were removed from the public square.
[time=410] But here comes the Apostle Paul and elevates women to the top of the list.
[time=416] It's remarkable, it's confusing.
[time=419] And then not only does he move him to the top of the list, he throws out some titles that probably are discomforting to us.
[time=426] Phoebe is described based upon my translation, the NIV, as a deacon or a deaconess.
[time=435] Now to be honest to the text, the text is using a generic word.
[time=441] It's a word that means to serve.
[time=443] So if you are a deacon in this church, or a deaconess in this church, then you are by
[time=449] definition a servant.
[time=451] But we know at some point in early church history, it became more than a term of a servant.
[time=457] It became a specific title.
[time=460] That's now a title that someone is a deacon or someone is an elder.
[time=464] Those became titles within that first generation.
[time=468] And here is Phoebe being described as a deacon, the Greek word that's written there is diocanous,
[time=475] deacon, male, deaconess, female.
[time=479] That's kind of a stretch for most of us to think of women in a place of church leadership.
[time=487] Well that one doesn't rock your boat, this one will.
[time=491] Junia, Junia is described as an apostle.
[time=496] And if you were to read scholars, and I rarely do that, but I did this time, there are many scholars within the last hundred years trying to make Junia a female name masculine.
[time=510] But it doesn't work.
[time=513] Latin is an inflected language, meaning that it has little parts that are added to a word that tell you more about the word than just the word.
[time=521] And so nouns in Latin have genders.
[time=528] And there is a way of saying Julia, and it means feminine.
[time=536] And all of you know how to say Julia and make it masculine.
[time=540] Who's the greatest Caesar you know of?
[time=543] Julius Caesar.
[time=545] U.S. inflex the noun and tells you that it is a male gender.
[time=554] This one is the female gender.
[time=556] So you've got a man and a woman, a husband and a wife, and they're described as outstanding
[time=562] amongst the apostles.
[time=565] Now again to be fair to the words, the words are somewhat generic.
[time=570] The word apostle is not new with the New Testament.
[time=573] The Greeks use that word apostolo for centuries before this time.
[time=579] And it means one who is sent out.
[time=582] But even if it's the most generic used to, but there's this incredible statement that she is outstanding among them.
[time=592] Whether you accept that this generic or a specific title is open to some discussion.
[time=599] And the better scholars who have no gender acts to grind would say that Andronicus is
[time=606] the husband.
[time=608] Julia is the wife and she's being labeled as a leader outstanding among.
[time=614] You see why this is revolutionary?
[time=616] Do you see why this is counterculture?
[time=619] Women top the list.
[time=621] A second reason why this is so countercultural is that Jews and Gentiles ate together.
[time=629] Jews and Gentiles, I've already described the way Jewish people would go out of their way to avoid Samaria.
[time=635] But they felt the same way about all of us Gentiles.
[time=638] There were names that they gave to Gentiles.
[time=642] One of those names was dogs.
[time=644] Now you have a cute little dog and I know you love it just like its family.
[time=648] But that's not how the first century looked at dogs.
[time=650] They were problems.
[time=652] They were unclean.
[time=653] They were dirty.
[time=657] Here we have Jews and Gentiles eating together.
[time=662] And it's not just casual, it's strategic, it is strategic.
[time=669] More than strategic, it's missional.
[time=673] The early church quickly came to realize that their group of believers was very diverse
[time=681] and one of the diversities was rich and poor.
[time=685] And so early on they created what they called a love feast.
[time=689] We would call it a potluck dinner.
[time=692] Those were big here at Blackhawk back in the 80s.
[time=694] We had lots of carry-in dinners.
[time=698] What you did is you went out and you purchased something or you baked something or you cooked something and you brought it to what we called the gym, well it's now the gym.
[time=706] We called it the convocation center.
[time=711] And we had a carry-in dinner and you just put food out on the serving tables and everybody came and ate and we had a good time.
[time=718] That's what started off as the love feast.
[time=721] People brought food to share the food, not just to have a time of fellowship around the food but to say we've got brothers and sisters in Christ that don't get three meals a day.
[time=731] They may only get one meal a day.
[time=733] They may miss that meal because they don't have enough.
[time=736] We've got to find a way of sharing our food together.
[time=740] And this became a wonderful way that the haves and the have-nots were brought together
[time=746] around one table and everybody contributed and nobody checked to see who brought what.
[time=754] At first.
[time=756] And then there became a problem.
[time=759] And it's spelled out in great detail in 1 Corinthians chapter 11.
[time=763] What was happening is as you arrived they're like, oh, look at all you brought.
[time=768] Look how wonderful it is.
[time=769] Look how delightful it is.
[time=771] Please sit it at this table and you will be served from this table.
[time=775] Oh, we're glad you're here.
[time=777] Take your little bowl right over here.
[time=779] Set it down and you'll be served on that side.
[time=783] And they came in and they forgot the counterculture of Jesus that he loved everybody, Jew, and
[time=793] Gentile, clean and unclean.
[time=797] So he had to dedicate a chapter of 1 Corinthians to this problem and he basically said, some
[time=804] of you are sick and some of you have died.
[time=810] God said, I can't use you on earth anymore because you are so committed to your group
[time=820] of haves and prosperous and successful that you've turned your back on the very purpose
[time=827] of the love feeds was to be inclusive of all people and particularly those who Jesus described
[time=834] as the least of all these my people.
[time=839] There was something new that God was doing, something absolutely counterculture that included
[time=845] everyone.
[time=847] That's what was so revolutionary about these words.
[time=851] The third thing that was revolutionary about these words is there were slave owners and
[time=858] slaves in the same church service, worshiping together on the basis of equality.
[time=868] You may be the boss Monday through Friday, but when you walk through these doors, we're all even here.
[time=873] We're all equal here.
[time=875] Those of us who have, those of us who need more, we're all equals here.
[time=881] All of us here who have great Bible background, good.
[time=887] Use it for the Lord.
[time=888] And those of you who are going, I don't have a Bible.
[time=891] We are so glad you're here.
[time=894] This church was designed for people just like you.
[time=898] The person who doesn't yet know what they believe, the person who hasn't yet received Christ.
[time=903] It's our heart's desire.
[time=904] It's the things that we dream about, is how do we tell you about Christ in a loving way that you'll believe in Him?
[time=913] Slaves and masters came to this group on equal ground.
[time=919] This is absolutely counterculture.
[time=923] This is absolutely revolutionary.
[time=926] This is what God was doing in their world and what God wants to do in our world.
[time=931] He wants to have a countercultural movement.
[time=937] What kind of community do they create?
[time=939] Well, we're not going to go outside of this list.
[time=942] We're just going to use some of the descriptions that Paul uses.
[time=947] And it's amazing how much Paul knows about these people.
[time=952] These are people in the city of Rome.
[time=954] And at this point, he's never been to Rome.
[time=958] But he knows dozens of people by name.
[time=962] Isn't that remarkable?
[time=965] God knows every one of them by name.
[time=969] So he creates a community.
[time=971] And the first thing that we note is they greeted each other, they greeted each other.
[time=977] Can you imagine somebody walking in and seeing their slave master and feeling good about
[time=984] what we're in this together, walking up to them and looking them in the eye as an equal
[time=991] for the first time in the first place?
[time=996] I can't imagine what that would be like.
[time=998] It was absolutely revolutionary, but it gets bigger than just greet.
[time=1003] Not only did they greet each other, did you see how they greeted?
[time=1007] They greeted each other with a holy kiss.
[time=1015] Our church, the chapel, and you partnered with us, did a lot of trips to help repair
[time=1022] and rebuild Katrina victims' homes.
[time=1026] And we were there for three years, and at the end of the three years, we had developed a close relationship with the pastor down there, and he was the right kind of pastor.
[time=1035] He believed that leaders eat at last.
[time=1038] Leaders eat last.
[time=1040] And so while other homes were being fixed, his was being neglected, and he didn't care.
[time=1044] He wanted other people to go first, and we just admired this so greatly, and as we were having a church service together and it would be our last time together, one of our pastors was there, and he said nobody had had a shower for several days, including the pastor of
[time=1060] the church we were working with, everyone was dirty and sweaty, it was about 100 degrees,
[time=1066] the humidity was just the same, and he was saying goodbye, and he came over and he reached out with arms that were dripping with sweat.
[time=1074] My friend said he gave me the biggest hug, and he planted a kiss on my cheek.
[time=1082] My instinct was to try to wipe all this off, but he was smart, and he just hugged him back
[time=1088] and planted a big kiss on his cheek, and nobody was rubbing it off.
[time=1096] We were just so, so grateful that pastors like those two men who modeled acceptance at
[time=1105] deep personal cost.
[time=1109] How did they treat each other?
[time=1110] What kind of community?
[time=1111] They greeted each other with a holy kiss.
[time=1115] Just with junior high boys heard about this for the first time and said I hope I'm sitting next to Susie when we do that.
[time=1125] Church just took on a whole new dimension for him.
[time=1129] Number two, they worked hard for each other.
[time=1135] Repeatedly Paul said they worked hard for each other.
[time=1143] They had needs, and in meeting their needs, they thought about each other.
[time=1153] Some of these people were rich, they were slave owners.
[time=1157] Some of these people may have royal connections.
[time=1160] Do you know the name Aristotleis is the name of Herod the Great's grandson, who spent most
[time=1167] of his life in Rome.
[time=1169] Would likely be that he would name some of his children Aristotleis.
[time=1175] There's one whose name is Herodian.
[time=1177] We know he's of the organization of the family of Herod for sure.
[time=1184] These were some people of means who were generous with each other, who served each other, who
[time=1193] took the initiative to build a community for each other.
[time=1198] Herod, they were generous with each other.
[time=1202] They generously supported each other.
[time=1206] The first person we met in this list was Phoebe, and Phoebe is described as the benefactor
[time=1212] of many of you, and of me, said Paul.
[time=1216] Let's take that a phrase at a time.
[time=1218] She was the benefactor.
[time=1220] Here's a woman who's a woman of unusual means that she is able to support other people, and it's not just one or two, it's plural.
[time=1228] She has supplied financial needs to many, and then Paul says, "And to me, I've never
[time=1235] thought of Paul as raising funds, yet Phoebe contributed to his ministry and made it possible
[time=1244] because of her generosity.
[time=1247] They were generous with each other." Would you raise your hand if you've been here 35 years or more?
[time=1257] Wow, more than I realized.
[time=1259] You may remember this.
[time=1260] We had services.
[time=1262] Sometimes they were on Sunday night, sometimes they were on Wednesday night.
[time=1265] We called them caring and sharing.
[time=1267] Does that sound familiar?
[time=1270] Today if we did it, we'd call it open mic night.
[time=1274] We had open microphones, and you walked up and you could tell a story and share that
[time=1280] story with the rest of the body as a way of praise.
[time=1283] We might call that a testimonial.
[time=1286] Or you might make a prayer request and ask for prayer and people would pray for you.
[time=1291] Nobody asked for money, but somebody, and it had to be a real insider, and I have no idea who it was, knew most everybody in the church, and when he heard somebody had a need, he sent them $50.
[time=1303] It didn't matter what the prayer request was, he sent them, and he became known that, well, maybe I should say she.
[time=1308] I don't know who it was.
[time=1310] He or she became known as the $50 phantom of the chapel.
[time=1317] Because when somebody got up and said, "I don't know how this happened, but I had a need," and $50 showed up in the mail, all of a sudden there was a line, "Me too.
[time=1326] Me too.
[time=1327] I got 50 bucks." That's unbridled generosity.
[time=1335] Phoebe, a woman of means, is supporting many of them, including the Apostle Paul.
[time=1344] Number four, they were family to each other.
[time=1350] They were family to each other.
[time=1352] And one in particular is a lady who we don't know her name.
[time=1358] She's described as the mother of Rufus, the mother of Rufus.
[time=1367] She was a mother, to me, also writes the Apostle Paul.
[time=1375] When these people gathered together, they weren't a crowd of strangers.
[time=1380] They were people who knew each other by name and by need and cared for each other.
[time=1387] And the church decides a black hawk with multiple services on the weekend.
[time=1392] Nobody can know everybody's name.
[time=1395] Certainly nobody can know everybody's need.
[time=1399] Certainly nobody can answer every person's request for help.
[time=1403] So what are we going to do to fulfill the God's calling on our life?
[time=1408] We're going to break our churches down into what we call life groups, where we do know each other by name and we do know each other by need.
[time=1420] And your church is a part of a movement of creating communities within the community
[time=1426] so that there's somebody who knows you by name and who knows you by need.
[time=1431] I have the joy of being a part of a life group and the life group texts each other.
[time=1437] That's a challenge for me, texting, I'd much rather talk on the phone.
[time=1444] But it's fun to watch how they text each other and I'm included and we're back and
[time=1451] forth with each other.
[time=1453] We're doing life together.
[time=1454] We have a Bible study together once a week.
[time=1456] It's every week except for the weekends we don't.
[time=1462] But we go out to eat together every week or we eat in together at somebody's house and
[time=1470] we call each other on the weekends and we do stuff on the weekends and they're the first people we text, the first people we call when we need prayer or we have an issue or some point of rejoicing.
[time=1483] We're doing life together.
[time=1486] Who are you doing life with?
[time=1489] We, as a culture, celebrate the lone wolf, the guy who doesn't need anybody else, the
[time=1498] guy who's one liner's make us all go, "Ooh, he's bad.
[time=1502] He can do it all." Lines like this one, "Go ahead.
[time=1507] Make my day." Oster Levista, "I'll be back."
[time=1516] We love these guys.
[time=1518] Let me point out something, the lone ranger needed Tonto.
[time=1523] None of us are made to go alone.
[time=1526] We need each other.
[time=1528] We need to be a part of a community.
[time=1531] A guy who I'm very appreciative of is the name of Henry Cloud.
[time=1535] I know him extremely well.
[time=1536] He doesn't know me at all, but I know Henry.
[time=1540] If you haven't read his books on boundaries, it'll help you.
[time=1544] He tells this story, and I'm going to do my best to tell it the way Dr. Cloud would if he was here.
[time=1549] Years ago, we ran test on monkeys, and we don't test things on monkeys anymore.
[time=1557] Psychologists put a monkey in the cage and then subjected it to stress, banging on the
[time=1563] cage, flashing lights, loud noises, and then they brought the monkey out of the cage with through blood and measured the amount of cortisol in his system.
[time=1573] Cortisol is a hormone that is produced by stress, and it's our hormone of stress protection.
[time=1581] Then they took the same monkey, put him back in the cage, but put another monkey, friend of his, in the cage with him, gave him the exact same stress test, took blood, and there
[time=1592] was a reduction of 50% of the cortisol in his body.
[time=1598] Why?
[time=1599] Because he had a monkey with him.
[time=1602] Henry would say, "So who's your monkey?
[time=1608] Who's doing life with you?
[time=1612] Who knows that they can call you?
[time=1614] Who do you know that you can call them when you need help the most?
[time=1620] This is what this church was like.
[time=1623] They worked hard for each other.
[time=1625] They helped each other.
[time=1626] They supported each other.
[time=1627] They were family to each other.
[time=1631] Fifth, they put their necks on the line for each other.
[time=1637] I want to back you up to verse four where we first meet Priscilla and Aquila.
[time=1641] It says they risked, they took a risk, and that's a good translation, but the literal
[time=1648] language of the Greek New Testament says, "They, their necks, put on line."
[time=1656] They, their necks, put on line for you.
[time=1662] They put their neck on the line for each other.
[time=1664] They were willing to die for each other.
[time=1668] It would only be a generation before that would be required of them.
[time=1674] Let me close with five lessons for us.
[time=1680] The first one is this, it's really good news.
[time=1684] I matter to God, you matter to God.
[time=1687] He knows you by name.
[time=1692] That's what this passage is telling us.
[time=1694] These two, maybe three dozen names tell us that names are important to God, and he knows
[time=1703] you by name.
[time=1705] He knows you by need.
[time=1708] No matter who you are, what you're facing, God knows and he deeply cares and God will
[time=1715] intervene and he usually does it through his people.
[time=1722] How does God answer most prayers through other people?
[time=1726] Sometimes he acts directly, but usually it's other people.
[time=1730] He knows about your marriage, he knows about your job, he knows about your addictions and
[time=1736] frustrations, he knows about your victories and your chip night celebrations.
[time=1740] He knows about your fear and your finances, he knows about your faithlessness, he knows about your faithfulness.
[time=1747] God knows you by name and by need.
[time=1751] Number two, God knows what you have done for the gospel.
[time=1758] God knows that you have given up a week's vacation to go to Africa.
[time=1762] God knows that you've given up a Wednesday night for a Bible study.
[time=1767] God knows that you came to this service because you worked in the nursery in the last service.
[time=1774] It's really important that we come to weekend services because they're the most worship-driven part of our organizations, but it's also important because this is where mission is usually cast
[time=1785] and caught.
[time=1786] Worrying services are critical.
[time=1789] But it's just as important that you're working in the church somewhere.
[time=1796] Work wherever you're gifted, you're calling, but work where the need is the greatest.
[time=1801] Work in the nursery.
[time=1802] Someone told me one time, "Well, the nurseries never mentioned the Bible." And I said, "Sure it is." It's in 1 Corinthians 15.
[time=1808] They said, "The nursery?" I said, "Yes." Read it carefully.
[time=1811] It says, "We shall not all sleep, but we will all be changed." I learned that joke from David Jeremiah 40 years ago.
[time=1825] Find a ministry that builds others up and be passionately, faithfully devoted to it.
[time=1834] God knows what you're doing.
[time=1838] This is just a little sidebar and there's very few scholars who doubt what I'm about
[time=1845] to tell you.
[time=1847] We met this guy named Rufus and we find his name mentioned in another book of the Bible,
[time=1857] Mark.
[time=1860] Because Mark is from Rome, he's got roots in Rome, I should say, not from Rome, but he's
[time=1868] got roots in Rome.
[time=1872] And Mark includes in his gospel something that nobody else includes.
[time=1877] That when Jesus fell, a man was told to pick up his cross.
[time=1881] Does anybody remember what that man's name was?
[time=1885] Simon.
[time=1886] The Bible tells us he had two sons, Alexander and Rufus, probably the same guy.
[time=1896] You want to talk some bragging rights?
[time=1899] My dad carried Jesus cross.
[time=1903] Wow.
[time=1906] Would you carry Jesus cross?
[time=1908] Of course you would.
[time=1912] Sometimes Jesus crosses in the choir loft.
[time=1915] Sometimes it's in the nursery, sometimes it's on the narration field.
[time=1918] But if you've picked up the cross, Jesus knows that.
[time=1927] Number three, this is tough, this is tough.
[time=1934] There's great diversity in Romans, slave-free male, female, African, Asian, European.
[time=1946] There was great diversity in Romans, and there should be great diversity among us.
[time=1952] Heaven is going to be the most diverse place in the universe.
[time=1957] Here's how it's described in Revelation chapter 7 verse 9, John said, "After this I looked
[time=1964] and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count.
[time=1969] Every nation, tribe, people, and language standing before the throne and in front of
[time=1975] the lamb, and they're wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands,
[time=1981] and they cried out in a loud voice.
[time=1986] Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne and to the lamb.
[time=1991] Heaven is going to be the most diverse place in the universe.
[time=1994] Let's get started now.
[time=1996] Let's be intentional about diversity.
[time=1998] Number four, God has my name in his book of life.
[time=2003] God has your name in the book of life.
[time=2012] There's a story that I tell fighting back deep emotion.
[time=2024] Sorry.
[time=2027] I knew I should have skipped this one.
[time=2031] There was a movement that's still lingers called promise keepers.
[time=2036] Any of you guys go to promise keepers?
[time=2039] I went in Indianapolis and with me was my brother-in-law Richard and a number of other men.
[time=2048] Richard was my wife's brother and he came to promise keepers, we got to sit together,
[time=2054] we got to talk about it.
[time=2056] What he didn't tell anybody is that he had self-diagnosed exactly right.
[time=2063] The headaches were becoming more frequent, more severe.
[time=2066] They were stronger when he sat up and when he laid down and he went to the internet and self-diagnosed brain tumor and he was exactly right.
[time=2080] There is a book out there titled who are the promise keepers.
[time=2086] Richard's name is in that book.
[time=2091] These people had their name in this book that we call Romans.
[time=2100] Your name is going to be written in a book.
[time=2104] It's titled the Lamb's Book of Life.
[time=2114] Jesus has a book with your name in it.
[time=2123] If you by faith would turn your life over to the care and control of Christ.
[time=2134] Let's move on.
[time=2136] Number five, we need to create communities like Rome, where people know your name, people
[time=2148] meet each other's needs, people carry about each other deeply.
[time=2154] There is from about the 1400 BC called the allegory of the spoons, the allegory of the
[time=2163] spoons, that heaven and hell are exactly the same place.
[time=2171] In heaven there is food, a beauty and delight beyond your imagination.
[time=2181] And in hell there is the exact same table, same food.
[time=2189] But in hell you have a spoon that is four feet long tied to your wrist.
[time=2197] So you can scoop, but you can't eat, you can pull, but you can't ever taste it.
[time=2203] For all eternity you have all this food and you can't have any of it, because of the spoons.
[time=2211] And in heaven the picture is exactly the same, there is no difference.
[time=2216] Same food, same table, same delightful taste, same spoons tied to their wrist and so they
[time=2225] feed each other.
[time=2231] He's needing you and you need somebody to connect with.
[time=2238] That's why Romans 14 ends with this long list of names that we can't pronounce, because
[time=2244] you matter to God.
[time=2246] He knows your name, he knows your need.
