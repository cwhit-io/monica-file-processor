[time=0] Today, in this counterculture series, we're looking at going against the grain that we are called to be in this world, and in case you haven't noticed, you are, here we sit, but we're not of this world.
[time=10] And so what does it look like for us to be the kind of church, to be the kind of people that others would look at and say, this is different, something's different about them, this church that proclaims that they follow Jesus.
[time=24] There really is something different there.
[time=26] I think I want some of it.
[time=27] God's church becomes appealing.
[time=28] God's church becomes counterculture in all kinds of glorious ways as we look more and more like our Jesus.
[time=36] If we say we are in him, we should walk as he has walked.
[time=39] John writes that, and that is what we hope we can learn in this series.
[time=43] Today, specifically, I want to talk to you about counterculture success.
[time=47] Psalm 90, the 90th Psalm.
[time=49] If you turn in your Bibles about the middle of your Bible, you'll probably run into the book of Psalms.
[time=53] There are 150 of them.
[time=55] We're gonna be in Psalm 90.
[time=57] So when you hear success, no doubt, there are many definitions of success in today's world.
[time=62] How many of you would be honest and say, man, it's just a success that I and my family are here or have been able to mark out the time and tune in today?
[time=70] Raise your hand if that's you.
[time=71] It's just a success.
[time=73] That alone is a success in and of itself.
[time=75] But the truth is, we all want to be successful.
[time=78] You want to be successful.
[time=80] You don't want to waste your life.
[time=81] That's why you're here today.
[time=82] That's why you're investing time and digging into God's word, and you knew you were gonna do that today or maybe somebody drug you here today or forced you to log in, whatever that looks like.
[time=90] You want to be successful.
[time=92] But I think so many times when we talk about counterculture, culture's definitions and flow of success often go completely contrary to what eternal-minded Christians, what God's definitions of success would look like.
[time=107] And nobody knows that better than Moses.
[time=109] Moses, you may not have even realized that Moses actually wrote a Psalm or that Moses was an author.
[time=116] This is a prayer of Moses.
[time=117] Psalm 90 is a prayer of Moses.
[time=119] So it is by default, and Moses wrote a lot of your Old Testament.
[time=124] It is by default, it's the oldest of all the Psalms.
[time=127] It's the first of the fourth book of the Psalms.
[time=130] There are 150 of them.
[time=131] They're divided up into five books.
[time=133] And this is the oldest of all 150.
[time=135] It's a prayer that Moses prayed.
[time=138] And no doubt Moses had to learn to talk and walk with God frequently.
[time=142] I think of being a pastor.
[time=144] I'm one of many pastors, elders, leaders around here.
[time=147] And we get the privilege and honor as an under shepherd, under God for his church to lead and to love hundreds of people.
[time=154] Moses was a pastor to literally millions of people.
[time=157] So I bet he did do a lot of praying.
[time=160] And you say, are you saying that we're difficult?
[time=161] I am saying that you and me and we, well, yes, we're difficult.
[time=165] Can I get a name in?
[time=166] And so Moses prayed.
[time=168] And Moses prayed in some specific moments.
[time=170] Scholars have looked at when is this prayer of Moses?
[time=173] When would it have fallen in the timeline of his life?
[time=176] And you can jot down if you want to read about that this week.
[time=178] Good devotion material.
[time=179] Numbers, chapters 13 through 20.
[time=182] Numbers 13 through 20.
[time=184] Some scholars pinpoint this to be likely around numbers 13.
[time=188] Around numbers 13 is where Moses sent forth into the promised land and to the land that God had said, I will give to my people.
[time=195] He sent 12 spies to scope it out.
[time=197] And many of you know the story.
[time=199] It's the story of Caleb.
[time=200] It's why my son is named Caleb.
[time=203] It was he and Joshua came back.
[time=205] They were the only two who had faith.
[time=208] And following that became this long period of wonderings.
[time=211] Long period of being in the wilderness.
[time=213] So maybe you feel like you're in a wilderness.
[time=215] So this was a challenging time in the season of Moses' life.
[time=219] Or perhaps it is around numbers chapter 20.
[time=223] In numbers chapter 20, we know that Moses had great loss that he had experienced.
[time=226] He lost siblings.
[time=227] He lost Miriam.
[time=228] He lost Aaron.
[time=230] And this is the time when it was about the time to go into the promised land.
[time=233] The land that God had promised his children.
[time=236] But Moses, you know, we think of, if you're like me, I think of Moses, I think success.
[time=241] Do you think success?
[time=241] I do, that's what I mean.
[time=242] He's in the Bible, wrote part of the Bible.
[time=244] He's probably a little ahead of me.
[time=246] Well, this was one of Moses' many failures.
[time=249] Around numbers 20, Moses, as God gave him specific instructions as to what to do.
[time=253] Moses, out of his anger, struck a rock.
[time=256] Some of you have been striking at stuff with your words or whatever, so don't be judging Moses.
[time=261] But because of that, the Lord said, "You will not enter the promised land." So Moses did not get to go into the promised land.
[time=266] So a pretty low moment, pretty big failure.
[time=268] It turned into a pretty low spot in his life.
[time=270] Wherever you would place this prayer, this psalm on the timeline of Moses' life, you can be certain that Moses has gone through a lot of successes, a lot of failures that he's done a lot of, seen a lot of, and probably done a lot of funerals.
[time=284] He said goodbye to a lot of people.
[time=285] He's had a lot of highs and a lot of lows.
[time=288] He's tasted success.
[time=290] The godly kind, maybe the worldly kind.
[time=292] And he certainly tasted failure.
[time=294] And it's in the middle of all those challenges that we have this prayer.
[time=298] What a blessing that is to us.
[time=300] Am I right about that?
[time=301] I mean, that we get to hear from the heart of Moses in this kind of season.
[time=305] But it's a beautiful picture.
[time=307] This prayer is of success and of a look into time and a perspective that maybe we often miss.
[time=313] Moses would have been probably around 100 years old.
[time=316] You can divide his life into three 40-year segments.
[time=319] Ish is a good way to look at that.
[time=321] He's Prince of Egypt for 40 years.
[time=323] And after being the Prince of Egypt, he is a shepherd for 40 years in preparation for the next 40 years of leading God's people and wondering in the wilderness and dealing with all kind of knuckleheads just like himself and the millions of people that he would have been around.
[time=337] And so I say we can learn a little bit from Moses about success.
[time=340] Do you agree?
[time=341] Let's do that.
[time=342] And as we do this today, I wanna give you four countercultural foundations of success.
[time=347] That's what we're gonna look at today.
[time=348] But as we look at these countercultural foundations of success, I wanna also introduce you to a great book that is, it's an older book.
[time=356] It's been around a long time.
[time=357] I read it a long time ago at the beginning of ministry for me.
[time=360] Somebody gave it to me and it's written by Kent and Barbara Hughes.
[time=363] Here's a picture of it.
[time=364] It's called Liberating Ministry from the Success Syndrome.
[time=369] An amazing book.
[time=370] And here's the beauty as I was drawn to this text and the Lord led us into this series and to talk about success.
[time=377] This book came to mind.
[time=378] Moses came to mind.
[time=379] Psalm 90 came to mind, but they use the life of Moses to outline and define what they would see as seven biblical definitions of success in this book.
[time=388] And they were in pastoral ministry.
[time=391] They saw a lot of highs and a lot of lows.
[time=393] And that is a definite challenge as you go into ministry.
[time=396] What metrics do you use?
[time=397] How do I know if I'm being successful?
[time=399] And before you say, oh good, this is a sermon about people like Moses and the elders in Pastor Kevin.
[time=404] I want you to raise your hand if you are in Christian ministry.
[time=408] This is a trick question and you should raise your hand.
[time=411] If you call Jesus your Lord and Savior, you are called to full-time ministry.
[time=416] And so you need to liberate your ministry from the success syndrome.
[time=419] Your ministry could be at home.
[time=420] It could be in the workforce.
[time=422] It could be in the corporate ladders that you try to climb anywhere you are.
[time=425] That's what we'll look at today.
[time=427] We need to liberate our ministries from what they call the success syndrome.
[time=431] So they gave seven definitions.
[time=433] They called success, faithfulness, serving, loving, believing prayer, holiness, attitude.
[time=440] They did a great job in that book.
[time=441] So I'll quote from them a few times as we go through this and another great resource.
[time=445] You might want to get your hands on.
[time=446] So here's how they define worldly success.
[time=449] And I think this is so near to all of our hearts as we talk about this topic.
[time=453] On page 106, they say the miserable yoke of worldly success is so crushing because it is a burden that God's servants were never meant to bear.
[time=464] And I believe that many of us carry this yoke, this burden of trying to be successful and defining success in this earthly life that the Lord has given to us.
[time=476] And a lot of times we end up miserable because we're trying to carry a load and we're pursuing things that the Lord never really meant for us to pursue to begin with.
[time=484] And I'm not saying you walk away from everything you're doing.
[time=486] I'll talk about that.
[time=487] Where you're planted, that's where God wants you to be successful.
[time=491] He'll open and close doors as he sees fit.
[time=493] But so many times on the journey, I know I have carried loads that God looked at me and said, I never meant for you to carry that.
[time=500] Let me carry you.
[time=501] You just do what I say.
[time=503] So let us dig in with that in mind and look at four of these foundations.
[time=507] Four counter cultural foundations of success.
[time=510] Right, number one down.
[time=511] Number one is the sovereignty of God.
[time=513] Psalm 90, we're gonna go through it just a verse or two at a time here and break it into segments and we'll get from it these foundations of counter cultural success.
[time=522] The sovereignty of God, and you say, well, what is the sovereignty of God, pastor?
[time=525] This is what I try to remind you of every single week.
[time=528] That God is still on the throne.
[time=530] That God is preeminent.
[time=532] That God is supreme.
[time=534] That God is far above all of us.
[time=535] He's the king of kings.
[time=537] He is the Lord of lords.
[time=538] He is never taken by surprise.
[time=540] He is always ahead of us.
[time=542] His providence is always true and can always be trusted that he is alive and he is on the throne today.
[time=551] That's what it means.
[time=552] Just for starters, it means so much more, but let's dig into that thought and Moses helps us with that.
[time=557] So you're ready for the word today, black home.
[time=560] Verses one and two of this great prayer of Moses says, Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations.
[time=567] Almost a hundred years old, he's seen a few, right?
[time=569] Before the mountains were brought forth or ever you had formed the earth and the world from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.
[time=581] So to think of God as our dwelling place, to think of God as someone who never was created, he never began and he'll never end.
[time=589] This is the sovereign God that we serve.
[time=591] And the theme of Psalm 90, the theme of Moses prayer is his high view of God.
[time=597] And this, my friends, is the beginnings of success.
[time=601] If you're gonna have biblical, godly success, you've gotta view God as who God is, so far above us.
[time=608] We're here, he's there, we look up to him and Moses has just such a view of God.
[time=614] And culture says this when it comes to the sovereignty of God, culture says that success is found in being your own God, in living life your way.
[time=622] You ever noticed that in today's culture?
[time=624] That's kinda what's lifted up and celebrated.
[time=626] But Moses is reminding us that God views success as being humbled under the mighty hand of God so that he may exalt us in due time, knowing that God and his mighty hand are far above me, the sovereignty of God, he is on the throne.
[time=641] And Canton Barbara Hughes wrote this about believing, believing the stuff that we know.
[time=646] And I believe it may strike you just like it did me.
[time=648] So I wanna read this little quote from their book, page 63, they said, "For us are talking a believing God." This truth points to one of the great needs of Christians, which is not to believe more and better things, but to believe what we already believe.
[time=664] During my bout with success, my faith had slipped so miserably that I was not believing the things that I actually did believe.
[time=674] Now here's how I interpret that.
[time=676] I don't know exactly what all they meant or how they meant it.
[time=678] But for me, I apply that because there have been so many times in my life where I cognitively know what I believe and I will verbally say what I believe and I can make you believe that I really believe that.
[time=689] But in the depths of my heart, in the depths of my soul, I've really slipped away from what I cognitively know and verbally say, I believe the core elements of my faith so many times I end up saying I believe them, knowing what I'm supposed to believe, being able to articulate it, but in the depths of my heart, so many times I drift so far away from those things that I wake up just like I was in the ocean.
[time=712] And you know, your umbrella was here and well, we could use an ocean right now, couldn't we with all this white stuff out there?
[time=717] But you're in the ocean and you look up, your umbrella was right in front of you and before long it's way over there because you've drifted away and the same thing happens to us when it comes to knowing the God of the word and knowing the word of God.
[time=731] You can know the word of God, but not really know the God of the word and you can drift so far away from what you think and know you believe, but is it really true in your heart and are you really clinging to that in your pursuit of success?
[time=744] That's how I take it.
[time=745] And that's what Moses is reminding us of as he gives us this high view of God, that God is sovereign.
[time=752] And as we look at believing, I love Hebrews chapter 11 verse six, I want to read it to you.
[time=756] It comes from the hall of fame of faith.
[time=758] Here it is, Hebrews 11 and verse six and the NIV says, and without faith, this is the believing part, believing God is who he says he is, he is sovereign.
[time=765] It is impossible to please God because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.
[time=775] Great picture of success that we see here.
[time=778] And there's a statement, a twofold statement that I've heard throughout all my life that I want to share with you.
[time=783] And I've tried to cling to this when it comes to pursuing success.
[time=786] Here's the first part of the statement.
[time=788] If I displease God, it doesn't matter who I please.
[time=796] Did you know that's true?
[time=797] If I'm not pleasing the one who created me and formed me in my mother's womb, the creator of the universe, the king of kings, it doesn't matter what people I please.
[time=806] And let's pause before I give you the second part of the statement.
[time=808] Let's just get this over with confessions, good for the soul, you know.
[time=811] God already knows if this is true of you, but you need for your own sake to let others know.
[time=816] Because as we confess to each other, we know they know and they know that we wanted them to know and we're in community and everything's out on the table and the church smiles can go and we can be real.
[time=824] Raise your hand if you're a people pleaser.
[time=826] God's watching you, he knows if you're being honest.
[time=829] I'm raising my hand because I've got that syndrome, that part of the success syndrome too.
[time=833] But I need to know the statement.
[time=835] I need to be reminded that if I displease God, it doesn't matter what people I please.
[time=840] The second part of this statement is the flip of it.
[time=842] If I please God, it doesn't matter who I displease.
[time=847] And I want to remind you today, if you please God, it doesn't matter who you displease.
[time=851] This is why great foundational people of our faith have often said things like I've got to obey God rather than men, even when it costs them their lives.
[time=862] If I displease God, it doesn't matter who I please.
[time=868] And that's a good word for all of us.
[time=870] And the way you can start in this is note the words of this part of the passage dwelling place.
[time=875] It says God is His dwelling place.
[time=877] That word literally means it's often translated as refuge.
[time=880] It could mean shelter, fortress, house.
[time=883] Even could be translated like as den or like a family room or a living room.
[time=888] And when you invite people over to your house, you might have a formal dining room area, a formal sitting area or you might stand in the foyer for an acquaintance.
[time=895] But if it's a family member, if it's a real close friend, they're probably going to get invited into your living room and to your den and to your family room.
[time=903] We call it different things.
[time=904] And that's the kind of picture that Moses is painting here that God is our family room, that we get, He is our safe place.
[time=912] He is our inner part of the house, that He wants to know us that much.
[time=917] And He does know us that much, but He wants us to know Him in that way.
[time=921] He is our dwelling place, He is our den.
[time=925] And Moses is teaching us to magnify Him, magnify Him.
[time=930] I'm going to wake some of you up here.
[time=931] I'm going to burn a hole in it so you can see if that works there, no, just kidding.
[time=935] Magnify Him.
[time=936] This is what, this is the beginning of success.
[time=937] The sovereignty of God means magnify means to enlarge or to make much of or to make great.
[time=943] This is what Moses is doing to start his Psalm.
[time=945] You're going to notice that he gives a lot of sorrow.
[time=948] You get to look into the heart of Moses, but he starts with this high view of God saying, you're our dwelling place from everlasting to everlasting.
[time=955] You were never created, you're never going to end.
[time=958] You are God, you are above me and I magnify you.
[time=962] But so many times we end up magnifying the little things, don't we?
[time=965] God's here and many times in your life in mind, we think God is so far away.
[time=970] You ever feel like God's a million miles away?
[time=972] You feel like He's just not present.
[time=974] And a lot of times He was right here the whole time.
[time=976] We with our magnifying glass though, we're just looking and magnifying and enlarging a problem.
[time=981] But here's what happens when you turn and you magnify a big, big God.
[time=986] Then those big, big problems that often feel so, so huge in your life, they start to shrink.
[time=994] The more you magnify a big God, the more you're going to realize that those big problems aren't so big after all.
[time=1002] So may we magnify and make much of the name of Jesus and of our God as Moses did.
[time=1008] The sovereignty of God is the starting place of success.
[time=1012] And number two, write this down.
[time=1013] Moses continues in verses three through eight.
[time=1015] The frailty of people.
[time=1017] You thought, you're like, no, wait a minute, pastor.
[time=1019] This is a success, sermon.
[time=1021] You're supposed to be helping me be successful.
[time=1023] And now you're telling me I'm frail.
[time=1025] I don't get that.
[time=1026] That's exactly right.
[time=1027] It's counter-culture, isn't it?
[time=1028] It goes against our rationale and our logic.
[time=1030] But the frailty of people is highlighted by Moses in verses three through eight.
[time=1034] Let's read that together.
[time=1036] Moses says, "You return man to dust "and say return, O children of man, "for a thousand years in your sight "are but as yesterday when it is past.
[time=1044] "Or as a watch in the night." That'd be like three, four hours.
[time=1048] So you see the temporary nature being set up here as well.
[time=1051] You sweep them away as with a flood.
[time=1053] They are like a dream, like grass that is renewed in the morning.
[time=1057] In the morning it flourishes and is renewed.
[time=1060] In the evening it fades and withers.
[time=1063] For we are brought to an end by your anger, by your wrath we are dismayed.
[time=1067] You have said our iniquities before you, our secret sins in light of your presence.
[time=1075] Yeah, how many of you feel successful after reading that, right?
[time=1081] It makes me want to cry too, as I read that.
[time=1084] So no worries, we're all in this together.
[time=1086] Can I get an amen?
[time=1087] When I read that God knows the secret sins of my life.
[time=1090] God knows all of the depths of my frailty, my humanity, my sinfulness.
[time=1096] Yet He loves me, this big, huge God.
[time=1098] The sovereignty of God is where this starts, but it's got to move to us, realizing that yes, God is big, but I am so small.
[time=1105] I am dead in my trespasses and sins, and apart from someone coming and breathing life into the dead person that I am, I cannot have eternal life.
[time=1116] This is the beginning of the gospel.
[time=1117] This is the beginning of success.
[time=1119] And Moses highlights that by giving us all these examples of frailty, he talks about dust in verse three, a night watch, verse four, a flood that dries up verse five dreams in verse five grass, verses five through six.
[time=1132] How many of you are big dreamers, like physically, literally you dream at night a lot?
[time=1137] I don't, you guys make me mad.
[time=1139] Jessica dreams a lot, and she'll have this big, elaborate story, and there's crazy stories.
[time=1144] I very rarely, I guess I'm told that I probably do dream, I just don't remember it.
[time=1148] So I don't know where I go, I'm just going, I'm just out.
[time=1151] So I kind of envy you guys that you remember.
[time=1153] So my part of the application, those of you who remember your dreams vividly, maybe it doesn't apply other than the fact that they're over when you realize like, oh, that wasn't real.
[time=1162] It's over, it's gone.
[time=1163] But for me, it was gone before I started.
[time=1165] I'd say something like, I dream something about the kids.
[time=1167] And Jessica would say, cool, what do they do?
[time=1170] And I go, I don't know, I just know they were there.
[time=1174] That's how quick this life goes.
[time=1175] That is how frail we are grass that withers and fades away and night watch this here and it's gone.
[time=1182] A flood that's here one day and dries up the snow, this outside that feels like it'll probably be here forever.
[time=1187] It's gonna go, the sun will melt it one day.
[time=1189] It will go away and the same is true of our own bodies, of this earthly life that we live in.
[time=1194] And Moses reminds us of that.
[time=1197] So understanding our need as small people for a big God is the beginning of success.
[time=1202] That's pretty counter-culture, I would say, because culture says success is found in fame and fortune of what we can do.
[time=1208] But Moses reminds us that God says success begins with owning our own frailty, sinfulness, and our need with God and trusting in Him to do what we can not.
[time=1218] Sovereignty of God, the frailty of people.
[time=1220] Number three is the brevity of life, write that down.
[time=1223] Verses nine through 12.
[time=1224] Life is short, it's brief.
[time=1227] If you don't believe me, just have kids.
[time=1229] People used to tell Jessica and I all the time, we had the kids on stage today and it just reminds me, we dedicated all three of our kids and two of which we dedicated or one of which we dedicated here in Little Miss Kaya.
[time=1240] And man, people told us before we had kids.
[time=1243] They said, you know, life's gonna go way faster.
[time=1245] And we were like, time is time.
[time=1248] Isn't that gonna change?
[time=1250] I was wrong.
[time=1250] I was really wrong.
[time=1252] Time starts going so fast when you have kids and life just goes by so fast.
[time=1256] And Moses highlights that in verses nine through 12.
[time=1260] So let's read that together, the brevity of life.
[time=1262] He says, "For all our days pass away under your wrath.
[time=1265] "We bring our years to an end like a sigh." It's over.
[time=1270] Verse 10, "The years of our life are 70 "or even if by reason of strength, 80.
[time=1276] "Yet their span is but toil and trouble.
[time=1279] "They are soon gone and we fly away.
[time=1282] "Who considers the power of your anger and your wrath "according to the fear of you?" So what do we do with all this?
[time=1287] He says, "So teach us to number our days "that we may gain a heart of wisdom." Before the service, I was talking with one of our great musicians who shall remain nameless, but Ed said that he told me a story from his childhood that I can relate with, the phrase that was often told to him that I've heard this as well.
[time=1307] Maybe you've heard it as well.
[time=1308] Life is hard and then you die.
[time=1311] You ever heard that?
[time=1313] It's pretty true and we were joking that, and he said, I used to think this was attributed to this certain family member of mine, but after I read what Moses wrote, I actually realized he was just quoting Moses the whole time.
[time=1325] 'Cause that's really this part of the song.
[time=1327] That's where Moses is.
[time=1328] It's like, it's toil, it's trouble, it's brief, it's over.
[time=1331] All right, let's pray.
[time=1335] What if that was the end?
[time=1336] But God, since Jesus, the gospel says that is not the end and that is what Moses is pointing us to.
[time=1343] 'Cause culture says that success comes from living in the moment.
[time=1347] And there's some good truth in that, making the most of the moments we have.
[time=1350] But here's the thing, while culture is saying, success comes from living in the moment, Moses reminds us that success really comes from living all of our moments in light of eternity.
[time=1361] There's a difference in living in the moment and living every moment in light of eternity.
[time=1366] That's what Moses is teaching us.
[time=1368] He's saying, listen, don't count your life in years 'cause yeah, you might live 70 or 80, but instead, number your days.
[time=1374] Why?
[time=1375] Because your days actually are numbered.
[time=1377] Moses is teaching us that.
[time=1379] You could write it down this way.
[time=1380] Your days are numbered, so make them count.
[time=1383] That's what I wanna help you do today.
[time=1384] That's what God wants to help you do.
[time=1385] That is success, and He wants them to count for eternity, not for the earthly, not for the ways we often define success.
[time=1392] For those of you who have kids and grandkids, as if you needed another reminder of how quick time flies by, that from the time your child is born 'til they turn 18, graduate high school, you have 6,570 days.
[time=1405] And if your kids are already in high school, we've got one that's about to go to middle school.
[time=1409] That's crazy to even think about.
[time=1411] How did that happen?
[time=1412] Blink, and here we are.
[time=1414] But the time your kid gets into high school, you have already less than 1,500 days left until they graduate.
[time=1420] Goes by fast, so we've got a number of those days.
[time=1423] We've gotta make those days count.
[time=1426] And that's what Moses means when he says, teach me to number my days 'cause he's saying, listen, there's a time for spontaneity and to react to the blessings of God, but Moses is saying, no, number your days.
[time=1436] Go from reacting to moments, to being proactive with your moments and having a plan for how you're gonna embrace those moments, to line them up with God's purpose and his plan for your life.
[time=1446] And here's what'll happen.
[time=1447] How many of you say things like, what time is it?
[time=1449] Like 20 times a day, right?
[time=1451] How many of you have said, what time is it now?
[time=1452] 'Cause it's like, when's this guy wrapping up so we can get to lunch, right?
[time=1455] What time is it?
[time=1456] But here's the shift.
[time=1457] You go from saying, what time is it to what should I do with my time?
[time=1462] There's a big difference when it comes to living out of success in light of the sovereignty of God and our own frailty and the brevity of life, we stop saying, what time is it in reacting to it?
[time=1471] And we say, what am I gonna do with the time that I have left?
[time=1475] This is what Moses is teaching us today.
[time=1477] And here's a good prayer you can pray.
[time=1478] You can jot this down.
[time=1480] God, teach me to count what counts and discount what doesn't.
[time=1491] Some of us spend so much of our lives, so much of our time on the things that really won't count when eternity is here.
[time=1499] And it's time to count the eternal things and discount some of the earthly things that may be a robbing you of all of these moments that God's wanting to do different things in your life.
[time=1509] And he may surprise you how he opens, closes doors to do those things.
[time=1513] So I challenge you, will you trust him?
[time=1515] And here's the heart of everything that I'm sharing with you today.
[time=1518] If you get nothing else, those of you who just went to sleep, wake back up, wake them up real quick, because this is the heart of the sermon.
[time=1523] They write this down.
[time=1524] Success is obedience to God and trusting him with the outcomes.
[time=1528] That's success.
[time=1529] A lot of times we measure things and we pursue success just by measuring outcomes.
[time=1535] But God says no, success, real godly biblical success is being obedient to me, even if it doesn't make sense and trusting me with the outcomes.
[time=1545] Charles Stanley hosted our seminary.
[time=1547] When I was in seminary, I got to meet him.
[time=1550] He got to teach our seminary class often.
[time=1552] He would always say a phrase like this.
[time=1554] Here's what he would say along these lines in his Charles Stanley voice that I don't have and I wish I did.
[time=1559] He would say obey God and leave all the consequences to him.
[time=1563] I can't say it any better myself.
[time=1566] That my friends is success and God wants us to focus less on the outcomes and more on the obedience.
[time=1572] Because life is short, but God is big even though we are frail.
[time=1576] The fourth one is this, it's the possibility of fulfillment.
[time=1580] Moses in verses 13 through 17, he prays for grace, he prays for blessings, he prays for joy, he's praying for fulfillment, he's praying for being satisfied.
[time=1589] And many of you are doing the same thing.
[time=1591] And I use the word possibility because some of you aren't convinced that it is possible in a counterculture way to have success, to have fulfillment, to have joy.
[time=1602] But I came to tell you today, it's possible because of Jesus Christ.
[time=1605] Fulfillment, purpose, peace, joy, contentment is possible because of our great, big, God.
[time=1611] Let's read verses 13 through 17 and round off our Psalm today.
[time=1614] He says, "Return, O Lord, how long, "have pity on your service, "satisfy us in the morning "with your steadfast love "that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
[time=1624] "Make us glad for as many days "as you have afflicted us, "and for as many years as we have seen evil." Notice the contrast between his work in verse 16 and our work in verse 17.
[time=1634] So important.
[time=1635] Verse 16, "Let your work be shown to your service "and your glorious power to their children.
[time=1642] "Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us "and establish the work of our hands upon us." Yes, establish the work of our hands.
[time=1652] Culture says that success is rooted in happiness.
[time=1657] But happiness is defined by the things that happen to us.
[time=1660] That's how you can remember happiness.
[time=1661] Happiness is what happens to us.
[time=1664] It's external circumstances.
[time=1665] But Moses is praying for a deeper satisfaction, a deeper joy.
[time=1669] Culture says that success comes from living in the moment.
[time=1673] Culture says success is rooted in happiness.
[time=1675] Moses is reminding us that success is really a joy that transcends all of my circumstances.
[time=1682] It's bigger than all of my problems.
[time=1684] He prays for grace and joy and blessings.
[time=1686] And then he uses this contrast of saying, "God, show your work to your service." So this is one hand.
[time=1691] And then he says, "And God, give us favor and bless our work." So here's the formula for success.
[time=1697] It's when the work of the Lord and our work become the same work.
[time=1702] And that is what Moses is praying for.
[time=1704] "God, show your work to your service and bless our work." He's saying, "merge those two together." And success truly begins when we realize a big God uses frail people in a life that is so short to bring about a purpose and a joy and a fulfillment of taking our work and merging it with his work.
[time=1724] And listen, God doesn't need our work.
[time=1726] Did you know that?
[time=1727] God doesn't even need us, but he wants us.
[time=1729] He loves us and he invites us into his work.
[time=1732] And true success begins when we take our work, whatever it is, and merge it with his work.
[time=1737] And that may mean doing something different, but it most likely means doing what God has asked you to do right where he has planted you.
[time=1744] Let me read you a verse.
[time=1745] Colossians chapter three, verse 23 says this, "Whatever you do, work heartily, "as for the Lord and not for men, "wherever you are planted, bloom there.
[time=1757] "As God opens, closes, doors, whatever you do, "true success is merging my work with God's work." John Oxenham wrote a poem for all you poets out there.
[time=1768] I think this just summarizes it so well 'cause sometimes we get discontent with what we have or where we're planted or what it looks like.
[time=1774] So here's what he wrote.
[time=1775] He writes, "Is your place a small place?
[time=1777] "Tend it with care." God sent you there.
[time=1780] "Is your place a large place?
[time=1781] "Guard it with care." God sent you there.
[time=1784] "What air your place, it is not yours alone, but his.
[time=1788] "He sent you there." And to summarize all of that, I would tell you that yes, your work for the Lord will merge with his work, but only and only if your walk is with him first.
[time=1800] So write it down this way.
[time=1801] "Success is more about my walk with God "than my work for God." His pastor saying, "Don't work for God." No, I'm saying, "Let your work for God." Everything that you do be an overflow of your walk with God.
[time=1813] And he walks with me and he talks with me.
[time=1818] He does and he cares and our walk with God is the beginning point of success that'll lead to our work for God being meaningful.
[time=1828] Back to what Hughes, the Hughes wrote about how you see and how to elevate your perspective.
[time=1835] Here's what they wrote about perspective.
[time=1837] And I pray over you, I want you to know what I prayed for you this week.
[time=1840] I pray specific things over every sermon, specifically over all of us and it starts with me.
[time=1845] And boy, this is what God has done in my heart as of late.
[time=1848] He's elevated my perspective.
[time=1850] And with that in mind, here's a couple of illustrations.
[time=1852] The first being from that book, Liberating Ministry from the Success Syndrome.
[time=1855] They write on page 103, "Those who have negative attitudes in ministry." Who's in ministry again?
[time=1860] Just checking to make sure you're awake.
[time=1862] All right, they never truly know success, regardless of their accomplishments.
[time=1866] Their negativism sours the proper sweetness of their desserts.
[time=1873] They are unable to enjoy the pleasant things that come their way for they always manage to dwell on what might have been and fear the worst in what is yet to come.
[time=1885] Wow, that hit me right here this week, right between the eyes.
[time=1891] 'Cause there's been so many times in my life that God is blessed.
[time=1895] He's used me to do things.
[time=1896] He's put great things in my heart.
[time=1898] He's done great things in me so that he can do great things through me.
[time=1901] But here I am, worry, work, Kevin, thinking about what might happen or what might mess up the blessings of God or how, well, I didn't really do this right or this didn't go according to plan.
[time=1910] And God's saying the whole time, you are magnifying problems.
[time=1913] You are magnifying things other than the God who has given you all of these blessings and in so doing, you are missing the very blessings that I'm trying to give you.
[time=1923] So focus on me, fix your eyes on me, trust me by being obedient and know that I will handle all of the outcomes.
[time=1932] So may we elevate our perspective this week.
[time=1936] And the best illustration I think I've ever seen of this is actually a sea eagle.
[time=1939] I wanna show you a picture of a sea eagle.
[time=1941] This is a sea eagle and you're seeing correctly.
[time=1944] That is a sea snake in its talons.
[time=1947] And this is real and for those of you, how many of you have ever seen kind of how this goes, this story?
[time=1952] You see eagles, sea snakes, how they eat them?
[time=1955] Great, I get to tell you.
[time=1956] And then you get to Google me and Google all this and figure out if I'm actually telling you the truth.
[time=1959] And you'll find the same story, I believe, that they actually eat, they eat sea snakes and they feed them to their young, these eagles.
[time=1966] They'll swoop down, they'll grab the sea snake.
[time=1968] And here's the thing about, this is a battle.
[time=1970] Isn't it? That's a battle.
[time=1972] Here's the thing about that battle.
[time=1973] You got one too, don't you?
[time=1974] You ever feel like you're just wrangling a snake?
[time=1977] That's your battle for pursuing godly success in today's world, is it not?
[time=1981] But here's the thing, this eagle, if it were to do battle under water, it would die.
[time=1988] First of all, I can't breathe.
[time=1989] Second of all, the snake would easily maneuver and bite the eagle and it's venomous and it would kill the eagle.
[time=1994] If this bird took the battle and just kept it at the surface of the water, it would likely be dragged down into the water and be bitten and died.
[time=2004] If it drug the snake to the land, it may be a little more fair, but still pretty likely the snake's gonna be very oriented and it's gonna strike and it's going to kill the eagle.
[time=2013] So you know what the eagle does?
[time=2015] The eagle grabs the snake and flies up into the sky.
[time=2018] It takes the battleground upward.
[time=2020] It elevates the realm of the battle.
[time=2025] And up in the air, the snake is still striking.
[time=2028] It could still kill the eagle.
[time=2031] But up in the air, the snake is disoriented.
[time=2034] The eagle can see more clearly.
[time=2036] The realm of the battle has been raised.
[time=2038] The way it sees is clear, the snake is disoriented and the eagle typically wins and goes and feeds the snake to its young.
[time=2046] And what does that mean for us, Pastor?
[time=2048] I'm glad you asked.
[time=2049] God wants you to elevate your perspective.
[time=2051] He wants you to take this spiritual battle towards success up a notch.
[time=2056] He wants you to trust and see things the way that he sees things.
[time=2061] He wants you to take this battle to the air, looking upward, stop looking left and right, stop magnifying all those big problems.
[time=2068] Look upward, go upward and focus on the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords, and it'll elevate this battle.
[time=2074] And then you'll start to see clearly that you're fighting a battle that Jesus already won.
[time=2080] And so you are a victor.
[time=2081] You are more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus.
[time=2086] So may we elevate our perspective this week.
[time=2091] I wanna help you act.
[time=2092] Look at your neighbor and say it's time to act.
[time=2096] I wanna give you an act, acronym, an acronym of application of today's message about success.
[time=2102] Here's that acronym, write these down.
[time=2104] Accept, commit, train.
[time=2107] Let's read those together.
[time=2108] This is an acronym, act, accept, commit, train.
[time=2113] If you wanna pursue godly success, accept number one, accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and savior.
[time=2118] If you don't know Jesus as your savior, that is the beginning of success.
[time=2121] There is no eternal success apart from Jesus Christ.
[time=2123] There is only hell and damnation and separation from God.
[time=2128] So accept Jesus as your Lord and savior.
[time=2130] That is the beginning of success.
[time=2132] But once you've done that, also accept that your days are numbered, accept that this life will end.
[time=2139] Did you know this life is going to end?
[time=2142] Some of us live as though we're entitled to tomorrow.
[time=2145] But accept Jesus as your savior and then accept the fact that I'm never promised tomorrow.
[time=2149] So stop putting off doing right now what you think you'll have the opportunity to do tomorrow.
[time=2155] And do it right now, especially when it comes to trusting Jesus as your savior and to pursuing the eternal things that He's placed in your heart and in your life.
[time=2163] The success story that He is writing on your journey.
[time=2166] Pursue those things.
[time=2167] Start now, don't wait till tomorrow.
[time=2169] So accept as number one.
[time=2171] Number two is commit, commit every day.
[time=2173] This is the heart of the message that I gave you from what Moses is teaching us.
[time=2176] Commit, commit to daily, pursue obedience over outcome.
[time=2182] Commit to daily, say God, I will be obedient to you.
[time=2186] And I'll trust you with the results.
[time=2187] I'll trust you with the outcomes.
[time=2188] I'll trust you with the consequences.
[time=2191] Accept, commit.
[time=2192] Number three is train, train yourself.
[time=2193] Paul says, I beat my body into submission.
[time=2196] This is a discipline.
[time=2197] Pursuing godly success is not easy.
[time=2199] It's not for the faint of hearts.
[time=2200] A good thing we have the power of the Holy Spirit, the same power that raised Jesus from the dead, working and living inside of us.
[time=2205] Can I get an amen?
[time=2206] So train yourself, train yourself to elevate your perspective, to take the battle up a notch, to look at things from God's perspective and be, listen, be present.
[time=2217] Say you train yourself.
[time=2218] Be present in the moments God has called you into whether that's at home, your kids, with people you influence, children's ministry, the ministry in the community as we light the one five together, your workplace that maybe drives you nuts, that family member that you just can't stand at the moment, be present, elevate your perspective and take action.
[time=2240] So let's act this week.
[time=2241] Let's put into action a true pursuit of godly success.
[time=2244] It's the only kind of success that will last.
[time=2247] I want to ask you to bow your heads and close your eyes today.
[time=2250] Nobody's looking around in this moment.
[time=2253] Just be still before the Lord.
[time=2255] Believers, how can you act this week?
[time=2259] How can you pursue the sovereignty of God, your own frailty and in this short life, this so brief,
[time=2267] implies that a possibility of fulfillment is not really what it actually is.
[time=2271] It's a promise of fulfillment as we pursue Jesus Christ.
[time=2275] What does it look like for you in your life?
[time=2276] What step, what phone call, what person do you need to share your faith, your story with, what way do you need to volunteer and serve through the ministers of this church and beyond?
[time=2286] What step has God called you to take?
[time=2287] Ask God, and I know they'll show you.
[time=2289] For some of you, you would say, the A really got me as except when you talked about accepting Christ.
[time=2294] I know that I need to take that step today.
[time=2296] No matter where you're at right now, God loves you so much.
[time=2300] I love passages like Psalm 90 because it shows the inner heart, the struggles behind the songs that are Psalms.
[time=2309] They're real people just like you and just like me.
[time=2313] And God sent forth his son, Jesus, to die at brutal death on a cross, to pay a price for real, raw, hurting, sinful people like those listed in scripture like Moses and like you and like me.
[time=2326] And today, salvation is yours in Jesus name.
[time=2329] If you will surrender your life to him, pray something like this from your heart to his say, Jesus, I need you to save me.
[time=2335] I'm a sinner and I need a savior.
[time=2338] I can't save myself.
[time=2341] I believe you died for me.
[time=2343] I believe you rose from the dead.
[time=2344] You are who you say you are.
[time=2347] I don't trust my good works.
[time=2349] I don't trust my faith.
[time=2350] I don't trust my own ability at all.
[time=2352] I trust in you to save me, will you save me right now?
[time=2355] In the condition of your heart, if that is your heartbeat, in this moment, is the Spirit's drawing crowd to him.
[time=2361] He will meet you right where you are in this moment of pause where you take a second to do that right now.
