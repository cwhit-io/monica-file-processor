[time=0] Mhm good morning church. It is so great to see all of you. It's so great to have all of
[time=7] you logging in. Thanks for having us over into your homes, onto your screens, wherever you're tuning in from. Thank you for just being hungry for the word of God. Great time of worship we've had today. Can I get a name, man? Yeah. What a great weekend it is. Just a joy to just be a part of the family of God on this weekend. That's about love, whatever that looks like for some of you. We want you to know that you are loved this weekend, whether football plays a part in your weekend or not, we want you to know you are loved this weekend. Whatever you brought into the doors with you this weekend, we want you to know you're loved this weekend. And we are looking at a series called counter culture.
[time=44] And I am so thankful for a group of young adults, some 70 young adults are away on a retreat. You may have heard in our 10 before them talk about that. They are they went away to study the word of God and just grow in their relationship with him. They'll be coming back I believe today. And so counter culture people in the next generation and your generation, that's what we've been studying. And so we want to continue our counter culture
[time=68] series today. We've been some seven weeks in now today. I'm excited to share with you about counter culture joy, counter culture joy. We'll be in the New Testament then toward
[time=79] the end of today's message. We'll end in the Old Testament as well. So start with Matthew chapter six and we are going to look at what Jesus had to say about joy. You need a little bit of joy? Let me ask you a more personal question. Can I ask you a more personal question?
[time=94] How many of you tend to worry sometimes? Anybody? Worry warts, confessions, good for us. We are
[time=101] often world class warriors, aren't we? And there's a lot to worry about in today's time.
[time=109] And today I believe can be a message that can really speak into the heart of anxiety, fear,
[time=115] worry, and help you find maybe some peace, some joy, some contentment that you have been looking for. So let me ask you, what do you worry about? Just think in your own mind, you'll say it out loud, but what do you worry about? What do you worry about? Is it kids?
[time=128] I tend to do that. I got three of those and they generate plenty of things to be concerned over. Can I get an amen? Parents, grandparents, for sure. Maybe it's finances, maybe it's a career. What do you worry about? And some of you are saying, I don't worry, and we don't believe you. And God knows the truth. Maybe you don't. Maybe you're in a great place of contentment, but I guarantee you life's going to bring things your way that the enemy wants to use to distract you and to lead you into a place that Jesus taught us to stay away from in Matthew chapter 6. So what is it that you worry about? What do you worry about today?
[time=163] You know, for me, big things, small things, right? Sometimes it's a big thing and it's kind of worthy of some concern in life. Sometimes it's small things. I'll share a small thing this week. I had a legit worry, fear, concern, whatever you want to call it that I would have to preach to you in a way that I didn't want to this week. Let me explain. My dad's over here. He's a handyman and he raised us in the rivers family. You just, most of us,
[time=188] we are at least a little handy. I'm nowhere near on his level. He's just like through the roof, but he passed on some of his knowledge through the years and I'm a handyman enough to get myself into trouble and do some things around the house. So we had a tub that needed a repair and some epoxy kind of stuff that I was going to do this week. You'll be glad to know that the tub turned out. It doesn't look awesome, but it's fixed for now. So that's what we needed and that happened. But sometimes I know you would never do something like this,
[time=216] but sometimes I don't really follow directions like I'm supposed to. The tub's fine. That
[time=222] part went well. They said you must wear gloves in the instructions. I read it, but I'm like,
[time=229] well, you know, I gave you this little tongue suppressor looking thing to scrape it on. I'm like, I'm a pretty steady-handed clean, neat kind of guy. I can handle it. I didn't know
[time=238] where gloves were and I'm like, I don't have time to go find gloves. And so I got that stuff all over my hands and come to find out epoxy does not come off easy at all. And so
[time=249] my legit concern was that I was going to be preaching to you this weekend with white hands way wider than the ones already have that the Lord's given me. And it looked rough and it's through like several layers of skin that came off probably in some wear and tear that they're pretty clean, you know? So little things. What do you worry about? Little things?
[time=268] Big things. You know, I thank God that I don't have to preach to you that way, but I figure confession is good anyway. So yeah, just so you know, you don't have a perfect pastor.
[time=276] I know some of you thought you did, but you don't. So I thought I'd let you know that.
[time=281] But here's the deal, friends, we live in a worried world. We really do. A.W. Tozer said,
[time=287] a scared world needs a fearless church. But a lot of times we worry just as much as those
[time=294] around us in our life. We live in this worried world and a key preface today. I'm coming at this from a spiritual angle just like Jesus did, but no doubt there are clinical, medical
[time=304] angles and perspectives that you must bring to the table when you talk about anxiety, mental health. We've done many messages on that here, and we've got great partnerships to help you with that. I am not a doctor in that sense that can help you in those areas clinically, medically, but from the spiritual angle when it all comes together, Jesus had a lot to say to help us control our perspective and our minds and our hearts and to live a life that's full of joy that goes counter to the culture. That's what I want to talk to you about today. And the truth is this, friends, if we as God's people, as the family
[time=338] of God, worry in the same way that the world around us worries, how will we win a worried
[time=347] world for Jesus? If we worry in the same way that everybody were supposed to be proclaiming
[time=353] Jesus, the one who holds the keys to death and life and to eternity, how will we win
[time=359] this world for Jesus if we worry in the same way? What if God's church looked calm in all
[time=366] the chaos? What if God's church in a world that's full of worry in a culture that's full of worry, we were worshiping? What if in a world that is so restless we were restful?
[time=380] What if in a world that is so contentious we were content? I think it would stand out,
[time=386] it would go against the grain, it would look counter-culture, which is what we are looking at, but worry comes, here's when worry happens, it comes when there's a legitimate concern
[time=396] because how many of you have legitimate concerns in your life, raise your hand, let's just be honest, okay, you probably, if you don't, you probably should, there's probably something that you should be a little concerned about that you know that you're here because you're concerned with your spiritual health as an example and that's why you're here to be fired up and to dig into the Word of God and to be equipped and inspired to go out and live it out, so worry comes when a legitimate concern starts to own you and I'll be honest, I've
[time=421] watched this and we've taken COVID seriously and there's a pandemic but I've watched this restless worried world cause people to get consumed and afraid in such a way that they're
[time=436] not having a legitimate concern about what's going on around them anymore and I've been in this boat too, just so you know, instead the legitimate concerns around us end up owning us and we live in fear and we live in anxiety and we live in worry and I'm not
[time=454] here to condemn you if you would say well that's definitely me, I think we've all been there but I want you to know that Jesus wants to set you free from that kind of life, now we have legitimate concerns, pandemics, health, those are things we take very seriously, it's changed everything about how we do ministry but we still do ministry and we still move forward
[time=471] and God's still got a plan and God's got a plan for you and that's not just true in a pandemic season, that's true in your relationships, that's true in every single area of your life and overcoming worry I believe starts with directing, guiding your worship, if you
[time=486] want to overcome worry, I think it's a worship issue because what you worship is really what is consuming you and that really is the joy that we're talking about that in a counterculture way, help us overcome worry by expanding our view of and our submission to God and when
[time=502] we do that we'll have a joy this unexplainable and that's what I want us to talk about today in Matthew chapter 6 is recorded part of what is really the greatest sermon that has ever been preached, so pressure's off for me today, I preach every Sunday knowing I'm never going to preach the greatest sermon that's ever been preached, that has been done and it was done by Jesus Christ the one about whom we preach anyway and in this great sermon Jesus talked a lot about worry and he said three times in the passage we're about to read do not be anxious yet we're in an anxiety filled world aren't we and so many times we walk with anxiety
[time=538] every single day, so let's read what Jesus had to say, Matthew chapter 6 and he taught on how to live just such a life, a life that's filled with joy, if you need some of that tell me are you ready for God's word today church, let's dig in Matthew chapter 6 I want to start in verse 25 we'll read through verse 34 Jesus said therefore I tell you do not be anxious
[time=558] about your life what you will eat or what you will drink nor about your body what you will put on, it's not life more than food and the body more than clothing look at the birds of the air they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them are you not of more value than they and which of you by being anxious
[time=580] can add a single hour to his span of life and why are you anxious about clothing consider
[time=587] the lilies of the field how they grow they neither toil nor spin much like the birds
[time=593] here yet I tell you even Solomon in all his glory was not a raid like one of these but
[time=599] if God so closed the grass of the field which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven will he not much more clothe you oh you of little faith therefore do not be
[time=610] anxious second time in this passage saying what shall we eat what shall we drink or what shall we wear for the Gentiles that's the unbelievers seek after all these things and your heavenly
[time=621] father knows that you need them all so here's our alternative we need one don't we verse
[time=627] thirty three but seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be added to you therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow for tomorrow will be anxious
[time=639] for itself sufficient for the day is its own trouble and if you can't say amen to that last verse you can't say amen to anything we know tomorrow holds plenty of things that will cause us to be anxious and the enemy wants us to be consumed by all of those worry filled things and so from this passage I want to give you what man the best sermon ever preached I want to draw some things that we need to know from it five things that we need to know if we want to pursue joy I want to talk to you about those five things from what Jesus talked about no doubt there's much more to be drawn and then we'll go to the Old Testament and I'll give you some even more personal and practical words that'll dictate your joy but let's start with these five things that we've got to know if we want to pursue joy according
[time=682] to Jesus verse 25 is the first one know what matters know what matters so many times I
[time=689] spend my life consumed by things that in the scope of eternity are not even going to matter at all in fact when I look back at the last let's do five years I was going to say decade less last five years and I think about five years ago some of the things I was worried about I don't even hardly remember them anymore maybe you can relate there's so many things
[time=709] that we just get so consumed by that even a few years from now are going to matter but certainly in the scope of eternity are not going to matter so we've got to make matter the things that truly matter for eternity and in verse 25 I love how Jesus just starts us off with that in mind in verse 25 he simply says I tell you don't be anxious about your life what you'll eat what you'll drink or about your body what you will put on he says this and here's the question I think we should ponder as we consider we need to know what matters is not life more than food and the body more than clothing what matters no what matters
[time=742] three times in this passage Jesus says do not be anxious and if I'm honest when I read it it's like I got it yeah I heard you but I just can't quite get there sometimes tell
[time=753] me how what's the secret sauce and Jesus is saying I'm telling you and I think we can gain some traction from that today this this phrase do not be anxious literally translated as take no thought and so I would say in our modern language we could say it means something like this hold that thought hold that thought Paul says let us take our thoughts captive
[time=773] and we do that through the power of the Holy Spirit so I say to you today whatever it is that you listed out when I said what are you worried about I say to you hold that thought hold that thought hold it loosely and by holding I don't mean you get to control it because some of you are like I already know I can't do that I've been trying to wrestle this thing to the ground for years but no I say hold it loosely I say hold it up to the king of kings today and just see what God can do in you and through you as you discover what truly matters Jesus says life is more than the things that we worry about know what matters
[time=804] a prayer we prayed about success last week I want to remind you of it we said God this is a great prayer for you to pray this week you need some help with your prayer life to get you jump started God help me count what counts and discount what doesn't God help
[time=819] me to count what counts and discount what doesn't maybe you've been counting things that maybe
[time=825] you should discount a little bit more ask God I believe we'll show you know what matters number two know your value know your value in verse 26 Jesus continues after saying life is is more than a lot of the things we worry about he says he gives us an example and he says hey look at the birds there they don't sow a reaper gathering to barns yet your heavenly father he feeds them are are you not of more value than they and so know your value Jesus
[time=849] says hey know your value look at the birds and I think it's interesting that he chose birds I don't know why my mind is so far below the mind of God but I wonder if Jesus chose
[time=858] birds because they kind of have an elevated perspective if he said hey look up at the
[time=864] birds they see a bigger picture than you and I want to help you see a bigger picture know your value birds you know the things about birds they don't have 401ks they don't have savings accounts they don't have 403bs they don't you know it's tax season yeah they don't
[time=880] have W2s and 1099s and all those kind of they don't have those they don't store but God
[time=886] takes care of them and we are of more value to God than even these little birds that he cares about look at your neighbor and tell them say you're better than a bird somebody
[time=897] needed to hear that today at home you better share it too tell them say you're better than a bird somebody doesn't believe that you're of more value than the birds and we laugh about that but sometimes we look in the mirror and we don't see the value that God sees and Jesus says are you not of more value than these birds and God even cares for them know your value our father feeds the birds our father feeds us but you know culture
[time=921] feeds us too we're talking about counterculture that's our series culture feeds you and media
[time=927] I'm so thankful for good godly people who show us good godly positive things in media social media television whatever it might be we have people in our church and have been in our church that that do that and I'm thankful for those people but media in general feeds you fear today did you know that we're going to talk a little bit more about that toward the end of the message but if you set yourself up to be fed by fear then you will always
[time=953] reap worry but if you set yourself up to be fed by your father like those birds you will
[time=960] reap worship and I believe that God wants to take you from a warrior to a warrior this
[time=966] week I really do I believe it I believe it with all my heart you got to know what matters and you got to know your value and if you're going to do that you got a number three know your source write that down you got to know your source number three know your source verses 27 through 30 Jesus walks us through and tells us hey you know you can't add any time to your life by worrying you do know that he asked that question Jesus is the master of questions and he says why are you anxious about clothing then he gives another example he gives the lilies of the field and he says even Solomon and all of his glory wasn't arrayed like them but God clothes them and if he closed the lilies of the field just like he feeds the birds of the air how much more will he clothe you and then he says oh you have little faith because worry becomes a faith issue it's a trust issue really do we trust this father who is our source so you got to know your source God is the giver and taker of
[time=1016] life and yet we waste life the life God has given us I waste life the life God has given
[time=1024] me so many times on worry fear don't you don't we so let me ask you today what are you wasting
[time=1032] time on with your worry what worry is robbing you of your joy the most and robbing you of
[time=1041] the time God has given you I'd say to you just like Jesus did consider the lilies consider the lilies Isaiah 40 in verse 8 reminds us of just the brevity of life if you're here
[time=1051] how many of you here last week you tuned in yeah brevity of life the sovereignty of God the brevity of life you know these are things from Psalm 90 that Moses taught us and a picture of that Isaiah 40 in verse 8 says the grass withers the flower phase but the word of our God will stand for ever so we got to know who our source is God is the giver of everything
[time=1071] and he loves us and he gives us an identity so know what matters know your value know your source know what you seek number number four know what you seek what are you seeking after what purpose in life really drives you verses 31 through 33 Jesus kind of poses
[time=1087] this question in a powerful way for us to ponder he says don't be anxious for the second time saying what should we eat what should we drink or what should we wear for the Gentiles I'll seek after those things yet your heavenly father your source he knows you need them all but
[time=1101] here's what you do seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be added to you not all the things you want but what God knows you need and how God wants to provide for you so you got to know your source but then now answer this question what do you seek and I find it real interesting that over 2,000 years have gone by since Jesus said all these things you thought about that and he's talking about what we eat he's talking about what we drink he's talking about what we wear and today over 2,000 years later aren't we still worried about the exact same things imagine that aren't we still posting on social media about the exact same things what we wear what we drink what we eat it's just these temporary things in life over 2,000 years later here we are doing the same thing so Jesus gives us an alternative he says seek first look at your neighbor say seek first and emphasis
[time=1148] on the first first seek first the kingdom of God you know a few things did you know there's
[time=1154] a couple of things God can't do they're like wait a minute okay I'm listening now pastor
[time=1160] heresy alert oh God could do anything there's a few things God can't do scripture makes it real clear he can't lie God is truth God is love he can't lie he can't sin he's holy
[time=1170] and powerful and good but you know another thing when it comes to joy that can't happen
[time=1176] with God now he's never going to be this anyway but we can't allow him to be if we won't joy the other thing that we can't allow to happen with God is that God can't be second God can't be second first of all he's not did you know that he's not second nor will he ever be second he is always sovereign he's always on the throne he is always in control
[time=1196] and I want to remind you of that today that alone should just ease some of your fear you should be able to exhale knowing that today but if you want counter culture joy in your
[time=1208] life God cannot be second therefore Jesus says seek first the kingdom of God so I ask
[time=1215] you today what do you seek the Greek word here for seek is the Teo and it's the same word that's used of Jesus in Luke 1910 where it says that the son of man came to seek and to save that which is lost that's the intent in the intensity with which Jesus came because
[time=1231] that word it literally means to to look for it a strive to find to be preoccupied by to
[time=1237] allow to fill your hearts fill your minds it's a consuming kind of seeking so what is it that you're seeking Jesus came to seek and save that which is lost the same words also use Matthew chapter 7 and verse 7 that says ask and it'll be given to you seek and you'll find knock and it will be opened to you some of your seeking to find Jesus and when you
[time=1258] do that with all your heart guess what he'll find you you won't have to find him you'll find because he finds us he meets us right where we are so what are you seeking in life
[time=1268] what purpose drives you great questions for you to dig into this week I can't answer all those for you I don't know you but God does ask him to reveal the depths of your heart which is what David does as we'll look out here in just a minute so number five is this write this down know who holds your tomorrow look at how Jesus ties all this together verse 34 after he says to seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be added to us verse 34 he says again don't be anxious about tomorrow for tomorrow will be anxious for itself sufficient for the day is its own trouble and so Keith
[time=1301] Moore how many of you know Keith Moore precious Keith Moore he's with Jesus just an amazing pastor served here and and just served the Lord so faithfully but he always talked about worry and I'll probably misquote it a little but I heard him say this many times he said you know what worries like pastor is like sitting and rocking real fast in a rocking chair going nowhere I think that's a pretty good way of saying it and I heard a statement
[time=1324] a long time ago I wrote it down I don't know where it came from but man I've just remembered this statement and the statement goes something like this that today is the tomorrow that you worried about yesterday let that sink in for a minute today is the tomorrow that you worried
[time=1341] about yesterday and tomorrow is a tomorrow that you're worrying about today and tomorrow
[time=1347] you'll worry about the next tomorrow tomorrow you see where this is going right I'm gonna just totally mess all that up but it becomes a spin cycle of worry and fear and it just gets out of control and Jesus says there's more to life than that and I want to remind
[time=1362] you of that very fact today know who holds your tomorrow there's a Jeremy Camp song I even heard it this morning early early this morning coming in to the the church here today and it's the song I think it's called out of my hands you probably heard it but the lyrics there's a phrase in it that goes like this it's out of my hands he's talking about the worries and fears of the world he says out of my hands and into yours mmm powerful thought
[time=1387] but that's so hard isn't it because if I'm honest I try to hold on to the stuff like I don't want it out of my hands because I have this this false sense of control this out of my hands and and here's what I'll remind you this is not your notes just no extra charge for this one today it's just for you to write down and remember write this down about control if you're a control freak and you're worried about what you can't control first of all let me just tell you there's a lot that is out of your hands probably you've been reminded of that but you're holding on to this false sense of control write these three words down control is an illusion control is an illusion we're not in control life reminds us of that
[time=1424] health diagnosis reminds us of that pandemics remind us of that can I get an amen all the
[time=1430] things that we think we're in control we need to realize that we can just relinquish into
[time=1436] the hands of a sovereign God who is so far ahead of us and that loves us out of my hands
[time=1443] and into yours know who holds tomorrow that's number five I love those thoughts from Jesus
[time=1449] and I pray they spawn some more thoughts for you this week as we just really focus on what matters in life and making the most and directing our thoughts looking to the birds this week
[time=1460] no holds here tomorrow King David had to learn this just like we had to learn this go to Psalm 139 I want to read to you from what King David had to say and give you four application
[time=1471] words that we're going to look at together from this passage Psalm 139 this was way before
[time=1478] what Jesus preached and it was as it was recorded but King David was a real person I love the Psalms because it just shows the real battles that people have and he answers several questions that people wrestle with even today in this passage but let's read Psalm 139 verses 13 through 24 you guys doing okay today let's dig in we're going go from warrior
[time=1498] to warrior today that's what we're going to do let's look at David's journey and notice some key shifts that David makes he feels like he's hopping around but it's not he's wrestling
[time=1508] with what's going on on the inside of him because he had anxiety fear worry just like we do to Psalm 139 starting in verse 13 we'll read through the end of the Psalm David says
[time=1518] for you four my inward parts you knitted me together in my mother's womb I praise you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made wonderful are your works my soul knows it very well
[time=1530] my frame was not hidden from you when I was being made in secret intricately woven in the
[time=1536] depths of the earth your eyes saw my unformed substance in your book were written every one
[time=1543] of them the days that were formed for me when as yet there were none of them how precious
[time=1550] to me are your thoughts oh god how vast is the sum of them if I were to count them they are more than the sand I awake and I'm still with you oh and here's one of the shifts oh
[time=1562] that you would slay the wicked oh god oh men of blood depart from me they speak against you with malicious intent your enemies take your name in vain do I not hate those who
[time=1573] hate you oh Lord and do I not loathe those who rise up against you I hate them with a complete hatred I count them my enemies that was a shift and here's another one look how
[time=1584] he ties this together and then he goes internal and says search me oh god and know my heart
[time=1591] try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any grievous way in me and lead me in the
[time=1597] way everlasting here's what he does he makes this external to internal shift did you see
[time=1603] that it's kind of interesting isn't it and that's what happens in us with our worry and fear but before he did that he answered some questions two key questions and we'll even hit a few controversial things next week as we look at counterculture humility and how we are to handle things with truth and grace and love the way that Jesus did in some of these contentious topics of the world one of them is the question of well at what point does life truly begin have you ever heard that question asked in recent years well god answered that through David here very clearly so first question god answers is at what point is a baby a fetus as we often call them a person did they actually have life well god answers that question really really clearly and it's not we'll say a conception well according to what god says it's way before that god knew all of the works and knew all of the plans for every single life way before they were conceived in their mother's womb and I thank
[time=1654] god for that truth that is true of me and it's a truth that we stand on here and next week we'll look at even how we stand for that truth god is definitely pro-life because he created it I'm so glad that god's pro-life you're are too because you're here because god created you but what does that look like to stand on that truth to stand for that truth the way that Jesus stood on and for that truth next week I want to invite you back counterculture humility because I think I and we miss that mark a lot of times but I'm glad god answered that question come back next week we'll dig a little deeper second question verses 17 and 18 that he answers is does god really care about me does god really care about me he
[time=1694] talks about how vast the thoughts that god has for us they outnumber the sand when I look
[time=1704] in the mirror and I think how I treat the god who gave me life sometimes this truth blows
[time=1711] my mind why would god think of me oh god think of you you know how small we are in comparison
[time=1721] to a big god I know that's depressing right but you know it's not depressing is that little us god came and walked among us met us where we are became sin he who knew no sin became
[time=1734] sin that's us that's our job we were already that he took that on why so that we could become the righteousness of God he thinks of you in such a highway know your value know
[time=1747] your value look at me for a minute know your value this what Jesus said and David is is
[time=1753] wrestling with that you feel it in Psalm 139 I never preached a sermon on these two together I don't know how god wove it all together but that's the point isn't it god we've stuffed together all of these works god knew we would be here looking at Matthew chapter six Psalm 139 on this day in history he loves you and he knows you and if he feeds and close the
[time=1775] birds of the air and the lilies of the field of how much more value are you and David is
[time=1782] wrestling with this fact and answers the question does god really care about me but verses 19 to 22 here's the shift that I want us to focus on in our entire time together with these thoughts here they are David shifted from what's happening to him these enemies
[time=1797] he said I hate these enemies I wish you just wipe them out god you ever feel that way about other people and certainly you do about your problems well David did too and he's wrestling with it he shifts from how he knows who god is and he knows how god views him and values
[time=1811] him and then he's like oh but all this stuff is happening around me and worry starts to sink in can you relate not if you can relate yeah I can relate it's like oh but I got all these problems and all these fears and all these anxieties and all these worries and these people god they're even going against your name and he's all riled up about that and then he stops and he shifts from the enemy to what is enemy the enemy to what is in me
[time=1838] that's what he does he shifts from the external circumstances to this internal need that he
[time=1844] has for god to do something inside of him and he says search me god know me know my heart
[time=1851] know all of these areas of anxiety know all these fears and these worries and Lord show me any grievous way show me any sin god search me and know me I know I'm a mess I'm showing
[time=1863] it even in how I'm praying and how this song is coming together little did he know we would be reading it today imagine that but that's how much god loves you he captured that so that we could know so from that I want to give you from all of this just some practical even more practical ways that you can know how to dictate your joy a little bit in god's name in the name of Jesus I want to give you four I words for I words that will dictate your joy just that our applications for the week that will help you to go assess how you can shift the shift god wants to lead in your life through the power of his holy spirit from warrior to warrior they're I words because they start in us they start inside of us just like David shift I believe god wants to shift some things inside of you write these down number one is identity identity you got to start with identity you got to know your
[time=1913] value you see how this ties us back to what Jesus said you're of more value than even the birds know your identity and I want to ask you today where do you look to find validation in life be real honest with yourself because here's the truth where you look to find your
[time=1928] validation you know your your contentment your joy what makes you feel solidified what makes you feel validated and stamped as approved what makes you feel like you're making a difference
[time=1939] all of those things where you look to find your validation will reveal where your identity is rooted no doubt many of us would say oh my identities in Jesus but if we did a deep dive in your life maybe we would find that you look to find your validation from what other people think about you and the truth is if people's opinions are where you go to
[time=1959] find validation then people's opinions really do control the bulk of your identity and what you're rooting your identity in but on the contrary counter culturally speaking here if God's opinion of you is the source of your validation then he will become your identity if I please God it doesn't matter who I just please if I just please God it doesn't matter who I please this is the joy that God wants us to walk in but it's very counter culture
[time=1984] so your identity and some of you listen you've let people name you for far too long in antiquity
[time=1990] I've talked about this many times but back in antiquity fathers had naming rights did you know that the name of a child when you name your children it would run through the father father had to do the stamp of approval well talk about counter culture it shifted hasn't it because I don't know about you guys but in my house if anybody had more of the final say of what we were naming our children it was really Jessica she men we we toiled over that and so there's been a shift in that and I think it's great that we all work on it together right so let's let's a good marriage sermon that's a whole other sermon that's counter culture too right so much counter culture stuff but in antiquity the truth is that fathers had naming rights and there's one component of that that I think we need not lose sight of you perhaps have been letting other people their opinions of you the names
[time=2033] that they have called you for far too long have naming rights in your life that speak to your identity and today in Jesus name I declare you need to walk free of those shackles and
[time=2045] chains because only your father your heavenly father has naming rights in your life and
[time=2052] if you're a child of his he's called you son he calls you daughter he calls you holy he
[time=2058] calls you righteous he calls you mine and in Jesus name is time to lose the chains of
[time=2066] other people other things and other opinions having naming rights in your life only your
[time=2072] heavenly father defines who you are because he defines who's you are let's start with
[time=2079] identity if you believe that give God some praise he alone makes that possible for us identity is number one but let me give you a few more right down integrity integrity that's number two because if you have an identity rooted in Jesus then you pursue holiness you
[time=2095] want to look like Jesus but listen you don't look like Jesus you don't live a holy life you don't live a life of integrity because you're trying to gain the approval and you're
[time=2106] trying to gain the identity of being a child of God no it's because you have been given
[time=2112] that identity as a child of God that God's work in you overflows and you cannot help but try your hardest to look like him and it happens naturally because it's no longer your strength that carries you it is the strength of the Holy Spirit of God the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead lives in us and because he lives in us we look like
[time=2133] him we look whole that's really what the word integrity means did you know that whole really means whole integer how many math geeks or nerds or friendly math people I like math anybody
[time=2145] else out good our educator I had a school says he likes math that's good that's good to know isn't it for those of you who have kids in BCS yeah I love math that was you know I didn't back then but I do now and I was better at it than kind of the other stuff but integer we get our word integers from the same root as this this word integrity you know what integer is math people shout it out it's a whole number it's a whole number whole that's
[time=2167] what integrity is we're whole we look like act like the wholeness the fullness of God
[time=2176] I want to be that in my life so consider your integrity because you really can't have joy when you lack integrity let me prove it to you are you joyful when you're one person at church and a different person at home and it hits you that like man I look that way on Sunday morning with my pretty church smile and then I went home and yelled and said those
[time=2197] things I didn't wish wish I would have said and acted those ways I wish I wouldn't have acted do you have joy when those moments hit you and you realize like man I was that way on Sunday and that way on Tuesday if you ever had joy in those moments I don't know about you but I've never had joy in those moments because integrity goes with joy but the beauty is when our identity is rooted in Christ and he overflows through us we look more like him yes listen you're not gonna be perfect look at me you're not gonna be perfect so stop trying to hold yourself to all those standards and pursue the heart of God knowing that he will sanctify us conformist to his image and one day we will be perfect it's not gonna be right now until Jesus comes back until we go to this phase of glorification where we're with him forever we can know that God has already paid the price for our mistakes but it doesn't
[time=2244] lead us to say well I could just go make more politics about that no instead it does the opposite it makes us want to walk with him even more look like him talk with him even more identity leads to integrity number three is input input write that down number three
[time=2259] input what are you inputting what you bring in what you take in will determine a lot of
[time=2266] what flows out when it comes to your identity that leads to your integrity in your life so how full are you and of what are you full of what are you filling yourself with remember
[time=2277] we talked about feeding and how media and life just feeds you fear doesn't it every single
[time=2283] day I always challenge you go biblical before you go digital when you get up in the morning they start your day if it's digital fine but don't look at a social media or email or
[time=2294] text or problems or calendar start with a word of God let it have the first word the first say in your day go biblical before you go digital because you're gonna be fed fear
[time=2305] all of the rest of the day so let your father feed you as you get started but here's the truth here's the truth so many times we come on Sunday mornings and we get this 40 minute ish whatever you know sermon on Sunday morning and we owe we try to overlay this 40 minute
[time=2321] sermon on to 40 plus hours of being fed fear and of our intake and our input looking nothing
[time=2330] like being fed faith and what we do is we overlay this 40 minute sermon on over 40 hours
[time=2336] of media that listen media that's so often hardwired intentionally intelligently designed
[time=2343] to make you anxious and to capitalize on your fears and your addictions just so that it
[time=2349] can pad the pockets of conglomerates that that are putting all these things into place to to feed and fuel your anxiety and to feed you stuff that will have you dig deeper so that they can profit off of your fear and worry and anxiety and today I say enough is enough if that is what it is and listen I'm for phones and all that they're amazing tools but if that is what is holding you back then consider your input maybe it's a relationship and you've got people around you that are just constantly pulling you away from Jesus listen God's called you to be light in dark places and in dark relationships but you can't do that if you're not first filling yourself and surrounding yourself with input and content and community even with other people that'll help you be able to have something to offer to those dark dark places in your world you guys want to see something super practical you ready JD let's do this so in my phone here I found the coolest setting I'm serious I really
[time=2403] want you to see this is super important we'll put on the screen alright you're ready for this this is the setting that I found it's the best setting I've ever found on an iPhone these are good tools by the way I'm not against phones and media I have social media we use it all here is how we use it we want to make sure it doesn't own us we own it it doesn't own us and here's a great way to start look on this iPhone if I hold down both of these buttons watch best setting on your phone some of y'all didn't even know they did that look
[time=2443] I don't know what it looks like for you to consider your input but consider your input what are you feeding yourself let your father feed you and you'll reap worship instead of
[time=2455] worry as the world feeds us fear number four write this down intimacy intimacy identity
[time=2461] integrity input and intimacy number four is intimacy because we live in a world that is so full of isolation not just because of a pandemic it was like that before the pandemic and we are very independent and our independence leads us often to isolation and isolation becomes
[time=2477] a greedy breeding ground for worry can I get an amen when you don't have other people pouring into your life you worry more I just I just know that about you like you don't know me pastor know but I know people because I am one and I have walked this path so many
[time=2492] times and let me show you this word anxious let's look at anxious look at me for a minute
[time=2498] is that you that you I want you to help me do some math for a minute what is the middle letter of the word anxious I isolation is a breeding ground for anxiety and fear and worry
[time=2513] the alternative is intimacy this is why we believe in circles and not just rose because
[time=2519] what's the end of anxious if you want to end anxiety and being anxious what's the end us
[time=2527] just hit me this week I just love that picture in the middle of being anxious there I am but at the end of it and I'm not saying if you know some people you're not going to be anxious anymore I'm not that naive because life's gonna happen but man if you want to see an end to some of those things that God's trying to bring to an end let there be an us starting with you and God vertically and intimacy with God that's vertical but let it spread out to a horizontal relationship intimacy with other people and watch what God does and here's my prayer for you that this week Romans chapter 15 and verse 13 what happened and this is my prayer for you may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in
[time=2565] him so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit that's my prayer
[time=2571] for you this week is we know the things we know as we pursue joy and we dig into these I words about me just as David did letting God do a work in us so that through us we can display counter culture joy and then next week we can come and learn how to do it all with humility in a contentious world where everybody's doing this we can display unity that comes from humility so next week we'll continue but this week let's live with joy let's walk in joy as we consider these I words about me that God will use to change us let's pray together God thank you for your word today and Lord as we bow our heads God I know believers that are in the room believers that are tuning in have many steps to consider
[time=2611] God when it comes to how we can just walk in counter culture joy so God as we consider
[time=2617] those I words as we consider our identity in you and how it overflows into God this integrity where we are whole and we look like Jesus and we consider what is coming in our input so that our output would look different God help us do it all with intimacy walking
[time=2634] with you in a vertical relationship God but then pulling other people in and doing it together horizontally with other people gonna pray for every next step that's coming up and Lord many are here right now and if this is you listen if you don't know you know Jesus today God sent forth his son Jesus to become sin even though he knew no sin he was sinless so that you could become the righteousness of God that's the gospel and your next step is to receive him as your Lord and your Savior today the gospel is that Jesus paid it all Jesus took your place on that cross so that moments just like this could happen God knew before he formed you in your mother's womb that this moment would happen and right now God invites you into his family because Jesus paid it all he paid that price for your sin you couldn't pay and today as the spirit draws you you can know that he didn't just pay that price he rose again he's alive and because he lives you can have eternal life you can
[time=2688] become a part of the family of God will you pray something like this say Jesus I need you to save me I am a sinner without you I'm destined for hell and separation from you but I trust
[time=2700] in Jesus his finished work on the cross I know he's alive Jesus will you save me I give
[time=2707] you me right now that's you believers are praying would you take a moment in this pause
[time=2713] and ask him to save you.
