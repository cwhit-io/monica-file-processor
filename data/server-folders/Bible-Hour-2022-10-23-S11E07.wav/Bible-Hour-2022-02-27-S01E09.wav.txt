[time=0] We are in our series called Counter Culture.
[time=3] Counter Culture is a series where we're looking at how we believe.
[time=7] Jesus didn't just tell us stuff He wanted us to know.
[time=9] He showed us how to live the stuff that He told us.
[time=11] So we don't want to just talk about what Jesus said.
[time=14] We want to do what Jesus did.
[time=16] And sometimes that means going against the grain, doing things that are difficult and out of our comfort zone.
[time=23] And so that's the series we've been in.
[time=24] We're actually wrapping it up today.
[time=26] And today I'm going to talk to you about Counter Culture Mission.
[time=30] Counter Culture Mission.
[time=32] We're going to be in Luke chapter 15 today.
[time=34] So if you've got your Bibles, going to find your spot in Luke chapter 15.
[time=38] And so when we're thinking about counterculture mission, it occurred to me if you haven't noticed in the world, there's a lot of chaos going on.
[time=45] And I want to speak into that, pray for that for a minute.
[time=48] But I will tell you this church, there has not been a more crucial time for us to be the church for us to pursue the mission, the counterculture mission of the church than today, than in today's time.
[time=61] And so all the stuff that's going on in the Ukraine right now, we're going to pray for them.
[time=65] I want to lead us in a prayer time right now for that.
[time=67] But we received a video, if you missed some of our announcements earlier, one of our missionaries in Poland, which is right beside the Ukraine there, the millers are right here.
[time=77] And so they're over there.
[time=78] We support a lot of ministries over there.
[time=80] Josiah Venture has ministry in the Ukraine and their director, president there for that country, gave us a video, shot of videos, about a four minute video.
[time=89] It's at blackhawk.fii.
[time=91] Encourage you to go check that out today.
[time=93] We posted it there for you.
[time=95] It's just an on-the-ground perspective that'll give you some ways to pray and hopefully pursue our mission really well.
[time=101] He had been there for some 33 hours, trying to get his wife and kids to a place of safety and then was going back to share Jesus there.
[time=109] So we want to pray for them.
[time=110] We want to pray for our brothers and sisters.
[time=112] We want to pray that God will, man, just show himself.
[time=116] Lift the name of Jesus high in the midst of a lot of evil, a lot of loss, a lot of devastation.
[time=122] And I'm so thankful that that same Jesus who can redeem the worst of circumstances is coming back one day.
[time=128] And until that day, we're called to be on mission.
[time=130] And part of that is lifting up our brothers and sisters.
[time=132] So let's do that together.
[time=133] Can we pray together?
[time=135] Father, today we come to you with heavy hearts for our brothers and sisters.
[time=138] Lord, we think we have challenges sometimes, but can only imagine what some of our brothers and sisters are facing in Ukraine right now.
[time=145] There's so much evil, so much devastation, so much loss in our world.
[time=149] And Lord Jesus, you told us that these things would all start coming together and they're signs of the fact that you are coming back.
[time=157] So God, we take heart and refuge in that, while at the same time we mourn with those who are mourning, we hurt with those who are hurting.
[time=164] We bear one another's burden.
[time=166] So God, I lift up the missionaries, even some of our own homegrown missionaries, we like to call them from Black Hawk that are in these areas right now.
[time=173] They're so heavily affected.
[time=175] Pray that as they make known the name of Jesus and meet the needs of people around them, that God, you would redeem evil and difficult circumstances for your glory and for your honor.
[time=186] We pray for an end to evil, and Lord, we know and rest in the fact that that evil will end because you're coming back.
[time=193] And we rest in that, but today God, help us to be the kind of church that lives out the counterculture mission that you've called us to.
[time=202] I believe with all my heart, it's the best, most important thing that we could do in times just like these is to be on mission.
[time=207] Help us to learn to do that well, even as we dig into your word right now.
[time=211] We pray it all in Jesus' name and all God's people, Sam.
[time=214] Amen, let's keep lifting them up, but listen friends, the best thing we can do, even in the Western world is to live on mission.
[time=221] We just got to do that together in our worship and in our prayer and lifting up our brothers, but the most important thing you can do is to be the church.
[time=228] We're not called just to go to church, we are called to be the church.
[time=231] So today, let's talk about our counterculture mission.
[time=234] Luke chapter 15, I would tell you it's one of my favorites, but you kind of know all 66 books are my favorites, but this passage, man, God has used it so many times to refocus me in times where I get distracted.
[time=247] You ever get distracted?
[time=249] Okay, I'll just make sure it wasn't just me 'cause it's a distracting world.
[time=253] And sometimes we miss the mission.
[time=255] And so today I wanna go to what Jesus had to say about it in Luke chapter 15.
[time=259] And this is a time in Jesus' ministry when he was being criticized a lot.
[time=264] He had been around the Pharisees and he was healing on the Sabbath and in Luke's gospel.
[time=268] He records all these accounts and this is somewhat of a culmination of some of those things.
[time=273] And Jesus really uses these three stories to clarify what his mission is and why he's there and what we should be following suit to do after his example.
[time=283] And so with that, it starts with some controversy from the religious crown, which it usually did.
[time=288] Luke 15, the first two verses.
[time=289] Let's read 'em together.
[time=290] You ready for the word church?
[time=292] Let's dig in.
[time=293] Verse one, Luke 15.
[time=294] Now the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear him and the Pharisees and scribes grumbled, saying this man receives sinners and eats with them.
[time=306] And there's a man of God who has made a big impact in my life, his name's Dan Hall and he made a statement one time about these verses and just about the ministry of Jesus that I've never forgotten.
[time=317] He made the statement like, you ever notice in verses like 15 one that we just read of Luke's gospel that Jesus was already always drawn to sinners.
[time=326] I think we all kind of know that.
[time=327] But it's more interesting though to study the fact that sinners and tax collectors, they had their own category by the way.
[time=333] I wonder if you do.
[time=334] That sinners and tax collectors and yous and mes, they were always drawn to Jesus too.
[time=341] He was just a magnet for that.
[time=342] I've always found that so interesting.
[time=344] I've wanted to replicate that with my life because it's obviously a part of his mission and the seekers, the word seeker.
[time=351] Have you ever noticed how we as believers in the religious circles, we take something that's really clear in the gospels and we make it really complicated and complex?
[time=358] Have you ever been guilty of that?
[time=359] I have.
[time=360] Well, we've done that with the word seeker.
[time=363] The Bible has a lot to say about seeking.
[time=364] We get all offended and all upset about what is your church?
[time=368] The seeker church is at this church or that church.
[time=370] We get all worked up over those things.
[time=372] And the Bible has a lot to say, Romans three, about seeking.
[time=374] It says really that no one seeks after God.
[time=377] So that kind of blows up some of our definitions to begin with, I think, but none of us seek after God.
[time=382] Ephesians two tells us we are dead in our trespasses and sins and that's the end.
[time=387] And we all pray and go home.
[time=388] No, that's not the gospel.
[time=390] The gospel is we're dead in our trespasses and sins, but God, while we're yet sinners, Romans five, eight, sent forth his son.
[time=397] We were dead in our trespasses and sins, but God sent forth Jesus Christ.
[time=402] Nobody really seeks after God.
[time=403] So God sought after us, Genesis three, nine, shows us that he sought after Adam and Eve, and he's been seeking after us, his people, his creation ever since.
[time=412] And I don't know about you, but I'm pretty glad he chose to do that 'cause he didn't have to, but he loves us that much.
[time=419] And Jesus came and that was his mission.
[time=422] In fact, he said it this way, his mission statement, you could call it one of them that really clarifies what he was all about as Luke, chapter 19 and verse 10.
[time=430] Luke 19, 10 says, "For the Son of Man came to seek "and to save the lost." Notice he's the one doing the seeking.
[time=438] And so if by seeker, we're meaning a watered down version of the gospel that doesn't look like Jesus, then absolutely, that's not the gospel.
[time=445] But if by seeker, whatever you wanna call it, we mean trying to look like Jesus, follow after his mission, then by all means that not only is what we do, that is the gospel.
[time=454] We want nothing more and nothing less.
[time=456] And I'm glad we have a God who sought us out and loved us that much.
[time=461] I'm so glad to serve that kind of God.
[time=463] So I pose the question as I have many times.
[time=465] If our mission as a church, if our mission as a church does not match the mission of its founder, then who are we and what are we doing?
[time=474] It's an important question for us to ask it.
[time=477] I ask it because I get distracted too often.
[time=479] I get off course and off mission too much in my life.
[time=483] It's a distracting world.
[time=484] So today we wanna not just talk about what Jesus said.
[time=487] We wanna do what Jesus did.
[time=488] He didn't just say those things.
[time=490] He showed us those things.
[time=491] And maybe there's no better place that we can learn about it than Luke 15.
[time=495] We just read the first two verses.
[time=496] But now from the next verse, I wanna read the rest of the chapter with you and break it apart into the three stories that it is.
[time=502] So that's what we'll look at.
[time=503] Three stories Jesus used to illustrate his mission from Luke chapter 15.
[time=508] It's interesting because verse three starts with a singular word parable.
[time=512] So Jesus, as they were grumbling about him, the tax collectors and sinners wanting to be around him and him being around them, he told a singular parable.
[time=521] But then he tells three stories.
[time=523] One might be confused about that until you realize that it really is three parables with one point and they all tie together.
[time=530] So let's go through them together.
[time=531] Starting with the first one.
[time=532] Number one is the lost sheep.
[time=533] It's the story of the lost sheep.
[time=535] Number one, lost sheep versus three through seven.
[time=538] So let's pick up where we left off.
[time=540] Says, so he told them this parable.
[time=542] What man of you having a hundred sheep if he has lost one of them does not leave the 99 in the open country and go after the one that is lost until he finds it.
[time=552] You ever been the one?
[time=553] I wonder, I know I have.
[time=555] Verse five and when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
[time=559] And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbor, saying to them, "Rejoice with me for I have found my sheep that was lost." Just so I tell you that there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous persons who need no repentance.
[time=576] And so I'll point out to you in this first part, the lost sheep that the proportion there is one out of 100.
[time=584] So the loss is one out of 100.
[time=586] It's a one percent loss.
[time=587] Notice the narrowing that happens with the second story.
[time=589] The second story is the lost coin.
[time=592] Number two, the lost coin.
[time=594] And so let's read about that together in verses eight through 10.
[time=598] And notice how Jesus starts to narrow things down.
[time=600] I guess more and more personal.
[time=601] And it's gonna do the same for you and for me as well.
[time=603] Verse eight, "Or what woman having 10 silver coins if she loses one coin does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it.
[time=613] And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbor, saying, "Rejoice with me for I have found the coin that I had lost." Just so I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents.
[time=627] So we went from a one percent loss with the sheep, one out of 100, to a 10 percent loss with one coin out of 10 coins.
[time=633] And now it goes to one out of two with number three.
[time=636] That's the lost son, the lost son.
[time=638] Let's read all the way through the end of the chapter.
[time=640] Let the word of God have the first word and then we'll break it apart together and just read it as it is in God's words.
[time=645] So starting in verse 11, he tells this story.
[time=649] He said there was a man who had two sons and the younger of them said to his father, "Father, give me the share of property that is coming to me." And he divided his property between them.
[time=660] Not many days later, the youngest son, younger son gathered all he had and took a journey into a far country.
[time=666] And there he squandered his property in reckless living.
[time=670] And when he had spent everything, a severe famine arose in that country and he began to be a need.
[time=676] And so he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of the country who sent him into the fields to feed pigs.
[time=684] And he was longing to be fed with the pods, the pigs ate.
[time=688] And no one gave him anything.
[time=690] But when he came to himself, you ever come to yourself?
[time=692] You ever have those moments like this guy?
[time=694] It's like, wow, yeah.
[time=695] Well, he did, verse 17.
[time=697] But when he came to himself, he said, "How many of my father's hired service have more than enough bread, but I perish here with hunger?
[time=705] I will arise and go to my father and I will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you, I am no longer worthy to be called your son, but treat me as one of your hired servants." And he arose and came to his father, but while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion and ran and embraced him and kissed him.
[time=727] And the son said to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you, I am no longer worthy to be called your son, but the father said to his servants." You notice how he just interrupts?
[time=736] "Bring quickly the best robe, put it on him, put a ring on his hand, shoes on his feet, bring the fat and calf and kill it and let us eat and celebrate.
[time=745] For this, my son was dead and is alive again.
[time=747] He was lost in his found and they begun to celebrate." Now his older son was in the field and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.
[time=758] And he called one of his servants and asked what these things meant.
[time=761] And he said to him, "Your brother has come and your father has killed the fat and calf because he's received him back safe and sound." But he was angry and refused to go in.
[time=770] His father came out and entreated him.
[time=773] But he answered his, "Father, look, these many years I have served you and I have never disobeyed your command, yet you never gave me a young goat that I might celebrate with my friends.
[time=783] But when the son of yours came, who has devoured your property with prostitutes, you killed the fat and calf for him.
[time=791] And he said to him, "Son, you are always with me and all that is mine is yours." It was fitting to celebrate and be glad for this your brother was dead and is alive.
[time=801] He was lost and is found.
[time=804] Love that story, those stories that have one point.
[time=809] And notice the two things that I'll point out to you, they're narrowing proportions and they're narrowing parties.
[time=815] Write that down, narrowing proportions and narrowing parties.
[time=819] These are two pretty distinct factors of this story.
[time=822] We went from the 1% loss in the sheep, the 10% loss with the coin, the 50%, one of two loss with the lost son.
[time=829] And the party is even narrow too.
[time=831] In the first story of the sheep, it was the heavens that rejoiced over one sinner.
[time=836] And then it was the angels and then it was the father in the last story.
[time=840] So all of that narrows.
[time=841] And why does Jesus do that?
[time=842] He's making things very personal, both for the Pharisees and to the people to whom he's speaking, but also to you and me.
[time=849] He's narrowing things down to make it very personal, to make a certain point.
[time=853] And that point really for the Pharisees to look something like this, that he was calling out their Pharisaical religious hypocrisy.
[time=861] He was pointing to the fact that there was a lost sheep and it was found and they threw a party.
[time=865] There was a lost coin and it was found and they threw a party.
[time=871] He's pointing to the fact that he came to bring lost sons to the father.
[time=876] And yet they wanted to make things about themselves.
[time=880] So what is so counter-culture about that point of these parables?
[time=885] This hypocrisy, this religious hypocrisy that gets us so distracted from the mission.
[time=890] The counter-culture part of this is listen that it's not about me.
[time=893] Because culture says it's all about me.
[time=896] It's not about a mission, it's about me.
[time=898] There's a big difference in the mission and me.
[time=900] Same starting letter, big differences in those two.
[time=904] And that's what we're seeing here.
[time=905] So who do you identify with in this story and why?
[time=908] Ask yourself that, that's a great question.
[time=911] I don't know about you, but identify with the prodigal son of some as well.
[time=914] I'm glad that the father came out to meet me.
[time=916] Glad he saw me, I'm glad he sawed me, I'm glad he embraced me even though I didn't deserve any of his love, can I get an amen to that?
[time=923] I'm glad of that.
[time=924] But Jesus is really making the point.
[time=925] He's telling the Pharisees and maybe, just maybe he's telling you and me too, that hey, you're the older brother.
[time=930] And boy, Jesus has told me that many times in my life and he's certainly telling the Pharisees that as well.
[time=937] And one of the things that we learn here is just like the coin was lost in the house, but it was still lost.
[time=942] Jesus was saying, hey, you can be in the house of God, looking the part, church smiles, and all everybody show me your best church smile.
[time=948] You know, your best church smile.
[time=949] You can look the part, you can be in the house of God, but you can be missing the point.
[time=953] You could write it down this way, that you can be in the father's house, but miss the father's heart.
[time=959] That's where the Pharisees were, and we can do the same thing.
[time=964] So Jesus narrows the proportions, but he narrows the personal parts of the story to meet us where we are.
[time=972] And I noticed something in the story that the story started versus one and two with criticism.
[time=977] They were criticizing Jesus.
[time=979] That happened to Jesus a lot.
[time=980] And whenever you live a culture, culture, Christianity, you're gonna find you'll run into criticism.
[time=985] That's just a part of life.
[time=986] Jesus showed us that, told us it was gonna happen, and walk through it to show us how to live through it.
[time=991] So we knew that that was going to happen.
[time=993] It did happen for Jesus.
[time=994] They were criticizing, but Jesus, I've ever noticed Jesus a few things stand out.
[time=998] A lot of things stand out, I'll point out a few.
[time=1000] He was never in a hurry.
[time=1003] I feel like I'm in a hurry too much.
[time=1004] You ever feel like you're in a hurry too much?
[time=1006] We're in a hurried society, aren't we?
[time=1008] Jesus was just kind of never in a hurry.
[time=1009] And he was always really quick to celebrate, turn water into wine.
[time=1013] He was there, and it's like, "You can actually have bigger things to be doing." Jesus, then that, well, no.
[time=1017] That's what he chose to do is how he started his ministry, is how he began his miracle-working ministry.
[time=1023] So I've noticed that Jesus likes to celebrate, and he wants us to celebrate.
[time=1028] But we get so somber in our pursuit of the mission that we end up sometimes getting critical.
[time=1033] You can write it down this way.
[time=1034] I believe that when you focus on the mission, you criticize less, and you celebrate more.
[time=1040] How do I know this?
[time=1041] I've looked at Jesus, and I've found it to be true, even as he dealt with the criticism.
[time=1045] He just celebrated what God was doing.
[time=1047] So in a critical spirit-minded church, a critical church culture, which is, listen, it's always gonna happen when we lose sight of the mission, 'cause we just start getting characterized by comparison and by our own preferences and by criticism, and ultimately by religious, critical self-righteousness.
[time=1066] This is what Jesus was dealing with with the Pharisees.
[time=1068] This is a critical church culture.
[time=1070] I don't know about you, but I don't really want that.
[time=1072] That doesn't sound fun to me at all.
[time=1073] And it's not what God's called me to at all.
[time=1075] Instead, he wants us to be a compassionate church, a celebratory church, a mission-minded church that's characterized by collaboration and celebration and unification, and ultimately, instead of our own righteousness, self-righteousness, be characterized by his righteousness.
[time=1091] And I wrote it down this way in my notes.
[time=1093] Maybe you should too, it's not in yours today, but I believe you cannot be a mission-minded and maintain a critical spirit at the same time.
[time=1102] I wanna say that again.
[time=1104] You cannot be mission-minded, yet maintain a critical spirit at the same time.
[time=1111] How do you know that, pastor?
[time=1112] Because I've tried.
[time=1113] How many of you tend to be critical?
[time=1115] I'm my own biggest critic, and I'm usually your biggest critic too.
[time=1119] That's what I've found about myself.
[time=1120] I can tend to be critical.
[time=1121] And when I get into a critical spot, I always, there's a common denominator, always, I start getting distracted from the things that matter most and the enemy uses that distraction to pull me off mission.
[time=1133] But I've also seen the opposite.
[time=1135] The more I focus on the mission that God has called me to, the less I'm critical, the less I'm distracted, the more I can celebrate and see the good, good father that I serve at work in the world around me, even when it may be hard to find it, even when it seems like times are tough.
[time=1152] So I wanna give you two other lists of three to help us get real personal, 'cause that's what Jesus did.
[time=1157] He narrowed it down for us.
[time=1158] Here's the second list.
[time=1159] I wanna give you three.
[time=1160] Three problematic older brother mindsets that we learned from the older brother in this story, that we learned from the Pharisees that Jesus was telling the story to, and just maybe that we also can learn about ourselves.
[time=1171] Write them down.
[time=1172] One, God views me through my accomplishments.
[time=1176] This is religion at its finest.
[time=1177] It's a works-based mentality of my identity, and it's built on self-righteousness that it's about how good I can do and what I bring to the table, and I am so glad that we are saved, fusions to by grace through faith.
[time=1195] That's it.
[time=1196] But then he tells us what it's not of, not of works.
[time=1199] Then we would be all boastful about it.
[time=1200] Yes, you and me.
[time=1202] We would probably be all boastful about it.
[time=1203] If it was about our accomplishments, it'd be our accomplishments.
[time=1206] But God says, it's not about what you bring.
[time=1208] You don't bring enough.
[time=1209] I can't meet a perfect holy God's, perfect holy standards.
[time=1213] We all sin and fall short of God's glory.
[time=1215] But religion says that God's view of me, my identity is based on my own accomplishments.
[time=1223] And so this is that Pharisaical mentality that we see even in the story.
[time=1226] He says, the older brother says to the father, he says, hey, I stayed even while he left.
[time=1232] You notice that?
[time=1233] It's what I did.
[time=1234] I stayed.
[time=1235] I did what was right.
[time=1236] I didn't disobey you.
[time=1237] He did.
[time=1238] He did that.
[time=1239] And that's what happens.
[time=1240] When we get self-righteous, we start saying, look, I did this.
[time=1242] We compare ourselves to others.
[time=1244] They're down here.
[time=1245] I'm up here.
[time=1246] But when I read my Bible, I see that we're all below the floor.
[time=1249] God's way up there.
[time=1250] And we're dead unless he comes and meets us there.
[time=1253] But Pharisaical, older brother mentality says that it's about my accomplishments.
[time=1257] No, it's not.
[time=1258] We're dead in those.
[time=1260] We're dead in our sins and our trespasses.
[time=1262] I know this is depressing, but don't worry, there's a third list I'm gonna give you.
[time=1264] So hang in there with me.
[time=1265] Number two, problematic older brother mentality is that God owes me.
[time=1269] God owes me.
[time=1271] And this is when we live in an entitlement driven society.
[time=1275] So many people, and I'll speak even in my generation.
[time=1279] Gosh, stop acting like the world owes you something all the time.
[time=1283] We got a guy, and then here's what happens.
[time=1285] We think the world owes me all this stuff.
[time=1287] And then we think God owes me all this stuff.
[time=1290] God doesn't owe us anything.
[time=1292] He created us, and we spat in his face, and we hung him on a cross.
[time=1296] Yet he loved us anyway.
[time=1299] We're not entitled to anything.
[time=1301] And in this story, we see this entitlement, religious mentality, older brother, Pharisaical mentality of entitlement where he says, hey, I took care of my stuff, and he didn't take care of his stuff.
[time=1312] He squandered his.
[time=1314] There's two big words that are a problem in that lineup.
[time=1316] It's his stuff, and my stuff.
[time=1320] God owns it all.
[time=1322] The father in this story, it was his stuff, and he entrusted it to them.
[time=1325] But he felt in a sense of entitlement saying, God, the father, he owes me something.
[time=1331] And that's what happens when we think it's about our accomplishment.
[time=1333] Then we're owed something.
[time=1334] We go from self-righteousness.
[time=1335] Then we go into entitlement.
[time=1337] And then we go to number three.
[time=1338] Write this down.
[time=1339] God didn't bless me.
[time=1341] God didn't bless me properly.
[time=1343] Write that down.
[time=1343] Number three.
[time=1344] God didn't bless me properly.
[time=1348] The prodigal son said it this way, I got nothing, and he got the fat and calf.
[time=1356] I've been with you.
[time=1358] I didn't leave, he left.
[time=1359] Self-righteousness.
[time=1360] You owe me something.
[time=1361] I'm entitled, my stuff.
[time=1363] I didn't squander my stuff like he did.
[time=1365] And then you didn't bless me.
[time=1366] You didn't reward me properly.
[time=1368] I got nothing.
[time=1369] You didn't even give me a goat.
[time=1371] You ever say that to God?
[time=1372] You didn't give me a goat, God.
[time=1373] You gave him the calf.
[time=1376] I know I have sometimes.
[time=1378] It's like, look at them.
[time=1378] They're down here.
[time=1379] I'm at least right here.
[time=1380] I know I'm not at the top.
[time=1381] But I'm at least up here.
[time=1382] And they got better stuff than me.
[time=1384] You ever feel that way?
[time=1385] Well, this is what self-righteousness that leads into entitlement.
[time=1388] And then it leads to ungratefulness, which is what we see here.
[time=1391] With God, you didn't even bless me properly.
[time=1393] These are three, just three of the problematic older brother, phariseical religious mentalities that Jesus is speaking into.
[time=1401] Maybe some of those stepped on your toes a little bit like they did mine.
[time=1404] So let me give you a third list.
[time=1405] You want a third list?
[time=1406] If I prayed and closed right now, we'd be -- yeah, that'd be a rough sermon.
[time=1410] I'm glad Jesus didn't stop there.
[time=1411] Let's learn from Jesus three countercultural Christianity actions.
[time=1416] And these we learn from Jesus.
[time=1417] We learn from the Father.
[time=1418] We learn from the ministry of Jesus and how to speak into these tendencies, not just of the Pharisees, but of these Pharisees.
[time=1426] I'm a recovering -- I'm a recovering religious legalist.
[time=1431] I'll raise my hand.
[time=1432] I'm covering a religious legalist.
[time=1433] Would you raise your hand?
[time=1434] I am.
[time=1435] Yeah.
[time=1436] Yeah, I'm still recovering.
[time=1437] I still tend towards being a Pharisee too much in my life.
[time=1440] And I'm so thankful for what we learn from Jesus.
[time=1442] And here's -- these are counterculture things to the three things we just learned.
[time=1446] Number one is this, find identity in Christ's work, not my works.
[time=1451] I'm so glad that we can take part in the finished work of Jesus Christ.
[time=1456] It is done.
[time=1457] Jesus said from the cross, it is finished.
[time=1460] He didn't say it is finished because he was tired.
[time=1462] He said it is finished because he was done.
[time=1465] It was finished.
[time=1466] It's the finished work of Jesus that gives us the ability to fight from victory and not
[time=1472] fight for victory.
[time=1474] And I'm thankful for that.
[time=1475] And if my salvation was based on the latter part of this statement, I would be nothing but dead.
[time=1482] My salvation is not based on my accomplishes.
[time=1484] It's not based on my works.
[time=1486] And here's what I know, the rising, recovering, religious, legalist in you, if you're like
[time=1492] me, starts cringing a little because you're like, but wait a minute, James says, faith without works is dead.
[time=1496] So are you saying we don't have works?
[time=1498] Nope.
[time=1499] I'm saying we got to get it in the right order.
[time=1501] Religion says that I do my works and I pursue my accomplishment so that I can get my identity.
[time=1506] I do so that I can be.
[time=1509] Jesus came and went counter to that culture and religion has shifted now to a relationship
[time=1515] that says, I be so that I can do.
[time=1518] The finished work of Jesus brings me into the family of God.
[time=1522] I am indwelled by the Holy Spirit of God, the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead lives in me.
[time=1528] And because that's who I am, I now can look like who has made me that way.
[time=1533] We get it out of order so many times, find my identity in Christ's work, not in my words.
[time=1539] Countercultural mission is about his righteousness instead of self-righteousness.
[time=1544] You see the difference?
[time=1545] So let's fight for identity in Christ in this culture that makes identity all about me.
[time=1550] It's all about me.
[time=1551] Number two, make the mission the main thing.
[time=1554] Make the mission the main thing.
[time=1557] Seems simple, but we get so distracted.
[time=1559] This is a counter to the entitlement that God owes me because counterculture mission is all about selflessness.
[time=1566] If I'm about the mission, that means I can't be all about me.
[time=1569] I need to say that again because someone needs to hear that.
[time=1571] If I'm all about the mission, that means I can't be all about me.
[time=1576] And I'm so glad Jesus demonstrated that for us.
[time=1578] And I'm so thankful for people in our church family that demonstrate that.
[time=1582] And I want to point one of them out.
[time=1584] Most of you have probably heard of this amazing man of God.
[time=1588] But for the benefit of those of you who hadn't, we have a high school basketball coach who has just loved and revered around here, and his name is Coach Mark Davidson.
[time=1596] There are boys to two state titles, man, those wins are great, but you know what the greatest
[time=1602] win is in his life?
[time=1604] He's battling cancer right now, and man, it's rocked a lot of our worlds.
[time=1609] I can only imagine their family's world, but I've watched him and Lisa.
[time=1612] And because of him, and listen, he had surgery last week, and then he was on the sideline coaching his boys.
[time=1618] You know why?
[time=1619] Because he's selfless.
[time=1620] He's about the mission.
[time=1622] We've watched him on the stage with our high school chapel recently, and he talked about his prayer started and still is.
[time=1627] Lord, heal me, and we know that God can do that, whether he does that here on this planet, on this earth, in this temporary life, or in eternity.
[time=1633] He knows that he's going to be healed, and he's praying for that.
[time=1635] But he said, my prayer is shifted to this simple phrase, and I'm going to quote him.
[time=1638] He said, Jesus, just be exalted.
[time=1641] And I've watched him live that out, and I want to show you an example.
[time=1644] Look at this picture.
[time=1645] This is a basketball game recently this week.
[time=1647] There was three.
[time=1648] I think three games this week.
[time=1649] I want to watch it on TV.
[time=1650] And you know what I've noticed about this?
[time=1651] The score, you know, some would love it.
[time=1653] Some would hate it.
[time=1654] But you know what I've noticed is when we live and make the mission, the main thing, the scores of life, they tend to just fade away.
[time=1661] They're temporary, and they go to the background.
[time=1662] Because what's happening here is this is not even on our court, a private Christian school.
[time=1666] This is out in our community, and whatever court they go to, a tradition has now started where Coach Davidson gathers these boys from both teams.
[time=1675] They've even heard there's been some referees jumping in, nobody likes those guys.
[time=1680] Just kidding.
[time=1681] Referees, we love you guys.
[time=1682] We really do.
[time=1683] You're like, I've got something in common with you.
[time=1685] It's like a pastor sometimes.
[time=1686] You just can't win sometimes, right?
[time=1688] You know, listen, if you lead anything, you can identify with a referee.
[time=1691] Can I get an amen?
[time=1693] But they gathered together.
[time=1695] And this last week, I know Coach shared about Matthew Chapter 7, and when Jesus said, "Build your house on a rock," and not on the sand, and that means it's not basketball.
[time=1704] And for us Hoosiers, it's about Jesus Christ.
[time=1709] He selflessly watches God giving the strength to get up, stand in that circle, and proclaim
[time=1716] Jesus Christ.
[time=1717] Even with all he's got going on, all of us would support him doing whatever he wants to do right now, right?
[time=1725] He wants to make the mission the main thing, so thank you, Coach.
[time=1728] We love you.
[time=1729] We celebrated him in the first service.
[time=1730] Let's thank him in case he watches this later.
[time=1732] He and Lisa and their families.
[time=1738] Thank God.
[time=1738] Thank God for people who make the mission the main thing.
[time=1741] Find your identity in the finished work of Jesus, not your works.
[time=1745] Make the mission the main thing, because listen, we've got to fight for an outward focus in a culture that makes it all about what we want.
[time=1751] And church is a hospital for sinners, it's not a hotel for saints, it's about others.
[time=1756] It's the sending ground.
[time=1757] This is an army base where we're charged up and sent out on mission, and there's a hospital for those who are wounded, a hospital for sinners, it's not a hotel where we just sit back and relax and get comfortable.
[time=1768] We make the mission the main thing.
[time=1770] I thank God for people like Coach who do just that, and for you, because you're doing the same thing, and that's where our church is where it is today.
[time=1776] Number three is serve Jesus, serve Jesus, notice the order, serve Jesus through loving
[time=1782] others unconditionally.
[time=1785] Serve Jesus through loving others unconditionally.
[time=1787] This is a counterculture counter to the ungrateful attitude that says, "God, you didn't bless
[time=1793] me right.
[time=1794] You didn't bless me properly." This says, "I'm so thankful, God, that you've given so much grace to me that I'm going to give all the grace away.
[time=1802] I'm going to give grace to those people who don't deserve it." So I want to ask you a personal question.
[time=1808] Jesus made it personal, so I'm just, "Don't get mad at me, get mad at him." Who in your life is hard to love right now?
[time=1815] Who in your life is hard to give grace to right now?
[time=1820] One of the best ways you can serve Jesus is to love them unconditionally.
[time=1825] Love them unconditionally.
[time=1826] I am blessed to be a blessing.
[time=1830] And this is the question that we often use around here.
[time=1832] I would ask you even more personally, "Who is it that's far from God and maybe that person that you just thought of?
[time=1837] Who's far from God but close to me?" Who's far from God but close to me?
[time=1843] How could you serve Jesus by loving them unconditionally, making them mission the main thing as you let your works flow from your identity that came from only the finished work of Jesus Christ?
[time=1854] We're not older brother Pharisees around here.
[time=1856] We're Jesus following grace, giving unconditionally loving people who want nothing more than to
[time=1863] make Jesus known to lift his name high.
[time=1866] That's the counterculture mission that we're called to.
[time=1868] And as we've looked at recently, that means we stand for truth and we do it all with grace.
[time=1873] This is both.
[time=1874] It's counterculture clarity and it's counterculture compassion and we do it with counterculture unity together as the body of Christ.
[time=1882] I want to ask you just to bow your heads and close your eyes and ponder.
[time=1884] What does it mean for you to dig into the counterculture mission God has called you to?
[time=1888] Who is it that is far from God but close to you?
[time=1892] Who can you love unconditionally as you serve Jesus on this mission?
[time=1897] Believers, as you're praying, asking God for those things, both here in the sound of my voice in the room and wherever you're tuning in from.
[time=1904] I want to ask all of you right now, as believers are praying, some of you would say, I just don't know that if I were to die today, that it's been eternity with God in heaven.
[time=1911] I don't know that I have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=1915] If that is you today, I want to speak to you.
[time=1918] This is the simple truth of the gospel and I'll lead you in a prayer and you've already heard it.
[time=1923] Your heart is screaming.
[time=1924] A prayer doesn't save you.
[time=1925] Jesus saves you.
[time=1926] The turning over of your heart to him is what saves you.
[time=1928] I pray a prayer, something like this, and say, "Dear Jesus, I need you to save me, I need you to forgive me, I know that I'm a sinner, I'm far from God, I need you, I know you died
[time=1939] for me." That's my perfect sacrifice.
[time=1942] Jesus, I know you rose from the dead, I know you are alive, and Jesus, I don't give you
[time=1948] a portion of me, I've already tried that.
[time=1951] Jesus, I give you all of me.
[time=1954] You're my Lord, you're my Master, you're my Savior.
[time=1959] I choose this day to follow you in your own works with your heart when you lift it up to him as believers are praying in the moment as we pause.
[time=1966] We reflect, but more than that will you respond and let God lead you into this counterculture mission that he came for and that he's called us to do that right now.
