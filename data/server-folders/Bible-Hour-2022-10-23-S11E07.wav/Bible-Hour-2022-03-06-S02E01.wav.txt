[time=0] - Well, I am privileged to share with you a kickoff of a series we've been working on for some time now.
[time=7] It's probably going to be the longest series maybe in our church's history.
[time=11] It's gonna be over 30 weeks and in that 30 weeks we're gonna give you kind of an overview of the entirety of scripture.
[time=18] We're gonna go through the whole Bible from Genesis to Revelation.
[time=21] Now obviously we can't do that verse by verse and every single story, every single chapter, but we're gonna go through the redemptive story of God.
[time=29] We're calling it this, finding Jesus, God's redemptive story.
[time=34] And that's what I'm gonna kick us off with today and kind of an intro message.
[time=37] And we're just gonna look at the word of God like we do every week, but we're gonna do it in a systematic fashion for these 30 plus weeks.
[time=45] And so you're gonna be blessed and where you can't wait to share about all of that with you in the weeks ahead.
[time=51] And so God's redemptive story.
[time=52] And we got some resources for you.
[time=54] This is a book called The Story.
[time=56] It was written by Max Lakato and Randy Fraser.
[time=59] You may have seen it before.
[time=60] Many of you have already gotten copies.
[time=62] This is written.
[time=63] It's got selections of scripture straight from the word of God, from the NIV version, but it's written like a novel.
[time=70] It reads with chapters like a novel, like a lot of the books that you would read as well.
[time=74] So it's gonna walk us through in your time.
[time=77] You can get one of these.
[time=78] We actually have some of these available for you at the Welcome Desk.
[time=81] We got a great deal for you.
[time=83] We bought about a hundred or so of them.
[time=85] I'm not sure how many's left, but they're $10 and you'll pay more than that on most other places.
[time=89] So we've got a limited quantity.
[time=91] You can get some here as well.
[time=93] But our series, as we go through chunks of scripture, will go with the outline that you can read, the chapters, the outline that you'll find in this book.
[time=102] So this would be an amazing devotional resource for you for this 30 plus weeks.
[time=106] They'll actually get us all the way towards Christmas time.
[time=109] So these are available.
[time=110] You can find them as well.
[time=112] And aren't you glad that God's redemptive story is unchanging in a world where everything around us changes and transitions.
[time=120] I'll share a little bit about my journey in a few moments about the Word of God and its role and how we find the will of God.
[time=126] I mean, my goodness, we're so blessed today.
[time=128] So I can't wait to share with you today's opening message.
[time=131] Here's my hope.
[time=132] Whether you have been a believer for all of Black Hawk's history, 50 plus years longer, or you've just come to Christ, or even if you're skeptical about whether you can really believe in, rely on and trust the Word of God, I believe today's message is gonna help spur you forward in your pursuit of what the series is called finding Jesus because Jesus is the theme of the entirety of Scripture.
[time=155] What we really have here is not one book.
[time=157] It's really a library of some 66 books written over a span of about a couple thousand years by roughly 40 authors and all different kinds of genres spanning from history and the Pentateuch Torah, the first five books of your Bible, which is the law, I mean, you find the poetry, wisdom books, the major and minor prophets, you find the gospels, the history of the early church, you find prophecy books, you find the epistles to the early church, but yet with all of that, if your head is spinning as you hear all of that, here's what you need to know.
[time=187] There is one theme of all of Scripture and his name is Jesus Christ.
[time=192] And we're gonna find Jesus in all of God's redemptive story, history really is his story.
[time=199] And we're gonna find that our story intersects into the redemptive story of God, not just through Scripture, but through all of history.
[time=209] I'm gonna give you five words today that I believe will just boost your confidence in the Lord and in his scriptures and in your Bibles.
[time=215] Number one, write this down is revelation, revelation.
[time=219] We try to each year weave these words into a lot of what we do around here at Blackhawk, but specifically at least on an annual basis, we try to hit these words specifically in a message and what better time to do that than as we kick off a journey through God's redemptive story, the whole of Scripture.
[time=234] So go to John chapter one, we're gonna be rightfully so in a lot of different scripture passages today as we look at this overview of these five words.
[time=242] Number one is revelation.
[time=244] John chapter one talks about the word.
[time=246] This is the word of God.
[time=247] And if you're ready for the word of God today church, say I sure am.
[time=251] Let's dig in.
[time=252] John chapter one versus one through five.
[time=256] John writes in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God.
[time=261] He was in the beginning with God.
[time=263] All things were made through him.
[time=265] And without him was not anything made that was made.
[time=269] In him was life and the life was the light of men.
[time=272] And here's our vision verse for our church here, John one five, the light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it.
[time=280] This is where our vision like the one five comes from.
[time=282] It comes from the word of God and then it branches into our one five zip code four six eight one five to 15 surrounding zip codes throughout our state, throughout our nation to 15 regions we've identified throughout the world.
[time=293] It's because we're called to be light and darkness.
[time=296] Skip down to verse 14, John continues and he says and the word became flesh and dwelt among us.
[time=301] And we have seen his glory, glory as of the only son from the Father, full of grace and truth.
[time=309] And so the word in that passage is word and the word for word is logos.
[time=315] The original language for word, the word became flesh and dwelt among us.
[time=319] In the beginning was the word is logos.
[time=321] And this word has so much meaning into it.
[time=324] It's the word from which we get our English word logic, logos.
[time=328] And it literally means word or speech or principle or thought.
[time=332] But in Greek philosophy, especially during the time this would have been written, there was this philosophy of the logos, which is a concept of meaning and purpose and rationale.
[time=343] It's like the meaning behind life.
[time=345] And it was determined in this day and age just like it still is today.
[time=350] I think you'll probably agree as you look around the world.
[time=352] It was determined that the logos, meaning, purpose, rationale for life, was something that could not be attainable.
[time=359] You couldn't really get your arms around it.
[time=361] And so what it turned into is everyone live by your own logos.
[time=365] You live by your own rationale.
[time=366] You live by your own meaning.
[time=368] You live by your own logic, if you will, your own hope and your own even truth.
[time=374] That's why John's writing is very counter-culture because he's saying, no, this logos that you speak of and you think you cannot know, I want you to know, it's not just a thing that you thought you could attain, but you cannot attain.
[time=385] It's not a thing at all.
[time=387] It is a person.
[time=388] It is God and God became flesh and he dwelt among us.
[time=391] He's the light of men and he has come for us.
[time=396] Not only can you attain the logos, knowledge, meaning, hope, purpose, you can know him personally, his name is Jesus.
[time=407] This is revelation, God revealing himself to us.
[time=410] Aren't you glad that we serve a God who didn't just stay off in the distance somewhere, but instead says, I want my revelation to come forth.
[time=416] I want to be known by the people that I created.
[time=421] I don't know about you, but I've looked in the mirror lately.
[time=423] Anybody else looked in the mirror lately?
[time=425] When I look in the mirror, a lot of times I'm like, God, why would you want that with me?
[time=429] But God says, I love you so much that I sent forth my sign, my only son who took away the sin of the world, took it on his shoulders and died on a cross.
[time=439] I wanted to reveal myself to you and I didn't just do that through the Holy Scriptures, through this library of 66 books where the Holy Spirit worked through these human writers to capture it all, but I want you to know me personally.
[time=455] That's the revelation of God.
[time=457] I don't know about you, but I need a little more of that in my life.
[time=459] And people often ask, you know, how do you know God's will?
[time=462] It starts with knowing God personally because here's the thing, the word of God reveals the God of the word.
[time=467] Write that down.
[time=468] The word of God reveals the God of the word.
[time=471] As we study his word, he wants us to know the God behind the word, the God who wrote the word, the God who is the word.
[time=478] And when it comes to revelation, as you study in theology, seminary classes, it kind of gets broken down, revelation does into two different distinct kind of parts.
[time=487] One is general revelation, the other is special revelation.
[time=490] General revelation is like we see God in nature.
[time=493] And I dare you to study the human eye, the millions of rods and cones and things that delight has to go through and work together with.
[time=502] I mean, I can't even begin to describe it all.
[time=504] It just, look at the human body, look at the human eye, look at nature, nature screams that there is an intelligent creator.
[time=512] And so that's general revelation.
[time=513] And so God reveals himself through general revelation, but the best part is special revelation.
[time=518] This is personal revelation.
[time=520] General revelation is stuff from the outside coming in that we see, it's all around us.
[time=524] But special revelation is personally, God revealing himself to us and in us.
[time=529] And it happens primarily through his word.
[time=532] God does something in us.
[time=533] It's a mirror that shows us ourself and it shows us who God is.
[time=538] But no doubt, as you study the word of God, you're gonna find some bumps in the road.
[time=542] Not if you've ever found some bumps in the road where it feels like, well, that part kind of hit me in between the eyes or that part I don't quite understand or that part I thought I understood it back in the day, but then I found this other resource or this blog or this book or this article.
[time=554] And now I'm not so sure.
[time=555] Now I feel a little more confused and I feel way more humbled and it feels like maybe I'm just not supposed to understand.
[time=560] Can you guys follow me?
[time=561] All right, okay.
[time=562] That is the journey through the word of God.
[time=564] You'll feel that as we go through this story book and as we go through finding Jesus, God's redemptive story over these next 30 plus weeks.
[time=572] My favorite verse when it comes to that feeling is Deuteronomy 29, 29.
[time=575] Here it is.
[time=576] Deuteronomy 29, 29 tells us that two things are gonna happen.
[time=579] The secret things belong to the Lord, our God.
[time=582] It means there are things that are way above us.
[time=584] His thoughts are not my thoughts.
[time=585] His ways are not my ways.
[time=586] And there's things that I just can't understand with this finite mind of mine, even though I like to be in control and know everything.
[time=591] Anybody else like to know everything?
[time=593] Anybody think you know everything?
[time=594] Just checking.
[time=596] The secret things belong to the Lord, our God.
[time=598] Here's the second part.
[time=599] This is what we're trying to do for this journey.
[time=601] But the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law.
[time=609] And to do that, you've got to discern and understand the will of God.
[time=613] And I told you I'd share a little bit of our journey.
[time=615] Obviously we're looking at the unchanging word of God and things around our church are even changing, including me and plans change, including mine.
[time=624] And I had a list and I wanted to share a little of this with you 'cause people ask me all the time, how do you discern the will of God, pastor?
[time=630] You ever wondered that?
[time=631] That's probably, if it's not the most common question, it's one of them that I often get.
[time=635] How do I discern the will of God?
[time=639] And the way you know the will of God, it starts with doing the known will of God, the stuff you know you're supposed to do, be faithful in that.
[time=645] And the more you do the known will of God, the more he will reveal to you his unknown will.
[time=651] And as you're faithful, you develop this posture and I've taught it to you over and over through the years and it's the posture ultimately that God used to in every past circumstance, certainly in even the circumstances and the calling that God gave my family to move here to begin with to Fort Wayne.
[time=665] And certainly in the calling that he's got on our life right now that goes against what we had planned.
[time=671] You know, in case you didn't know, our kids moved here with us and they were pretty little and they started and kept my oldest was in kindergarten.
[time=678] He's now in fifth grade.
[time=679] But we didn't have plans for that to change for him.
[time=682] We love our school, we love the church and I'll tell you, I had a list.
[time=685] I had a list that when God was making this clear that this is something that he wanted us to do.
[time=691] I had a list, anybody got a list of your plans?
[time=693] Okay, yeah, me too.
[time=694] I got a pretty big list.
[time=695] And I had plans and my list was something like this.
[time=698] God, look at all the stuff that you've done.
[time=700] Hopefully you got the letter that I sent out last week.
[time=702] We can get it to you if you didn't but it had a list of all the amazing stuff or some of the amazing stuff that God has done, has nothing to do with me, everything to do with him.
[time=709] And it was that list that I used to wrestle with God as he revealed to me his plan, his revelation of who he is but also what he wanted me to do.
[time=717] And I said, all this stuff has happened and we're so poised for the future.
[time=721] And I wanna be able to be the person to be there and build on all the stuff that you've used me and us to do.
[time=728] And I gave him this list.
[time=730] You got your list too.
[time=731] I showed him mine in my humanity and God turned it around and he said, it's that very list that I called you to Fort Wayne for.
[time=739] And now I've got somebody else that I've already been raising up to step in, including all of you, by the way.
[time=746] But somebody else to step in and I'm gonna be honest with you guys, I wrestled with that.
[time=750] It was hard.
[time=751] That was the hardest part of all this is I had my list.
[time=754] And on that list was my kids and all the logical things, right?
[time=757] We live according to our own logic, you ever do that?
[time=759] I had my list and God turned it around on me.
[time=763] And it wasn't what I planned but I've learned and I've taught you and I've got to practice what I preached that I've got to say the answer is yes Lord.
[time=770] Now what is the question?
[time=772] And I've learned that God's plans are always better than mine and God looked at me and he made it clear.
[time=776] He looked into my heart and he said, you've got to be willing to relinquish your plans and what you thought was gonna happen so that my plans can take place because my plans are always the best.
[time=787] And that was really hard for me.
[time=791] Still is very emotionally, relationally conflicting.
[time=796] But spiritually clear and that's the kind of stuff that God does in his revelation through his word.
[time=801] He takes the broad and he narrows it to the personal as his revelation.
[time=805] Aren't you glad of that?
[time=806] Even when it's hard, even when it doesn't make sense, even when it goes against our plans, even when it's counter culture as we've been looking at for several weeks.
[time=813] I'm glad that we have God's revelation.
[time=816] Number two is inspiration.
[time=818] So how do we get it?
[time=819] All right, well since we have his revelation and the word of God is this primary means of communicating with us because I'll tell you in my own journey, both past and present, the common denominator of finding God's will is the word of God.
[time=831] Through repetition, you ever seen that?
[time=833] Like it's an email devotion or somebody shares with a pastor who uses a certain scripture verse.
[time=837] God just repeats certain themes from scripture or maybe even certain verses.
[time=841] God uses his word because it's inspired and we believe that the word of God is inspired inerrant.
[time=847] We believe that it is so perfect.
[time=849] Why?
[time=849] Because it came from God and not from us.
[time=852] Go to 2 Timothy and let's read about that second word.
[time=855] Inspiration, 2 Timothy, chapter three.
[time=858] It's a common passage, but what do we do with the revelation of God?
[time=861] And Paul is writing to Timothy in chapter three, we'll go to verse 14 and he tells him what he should do with the revelation of God, what he's been taught, what he's seen.
[time=869] Verse 14, but ask for you, continue in what you've learned and have firmly believed knowing from whom you learned it and how from childhood you've been acquainted with the sacred writings.
[time=881] This is the word of God which are able to make UIs for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
[time=888] All scripture is breathed out.
[time=891] That original word is theonoustos, it's God breathed.
[time=894] Literally, he breathed it out, it's God breathed.
[time=897] All scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction and for training and righteousness that the man of God may be competent, equipped for every good work.
[time=909] God breathed, write that down, study on that, think on that, God breathed.
[time=915] God breathed, here's what that means.
[time=918] It means that God didn't just breathe into scripture.
[time=922] It means that God didn't just influence the writing of the scriptures, the writing of the word of God.
[time=929] It means that God literally breathed out the scriptures.
[time=932] It means that God is the source of scriptures.
[time=935] He used human writers, this is how it is inspired and you can think of like a ship on the sea, a ship cannot travel on the sea without the motors or just a ship with a sail unless the wind gets behind it.
[time=947] And the man who wrote, the people who wrote down what the spirit prompted, the spirit was the wind, the people who wrote were the ship and he drove it wherever he wanted it to go.
[time=959] And we're gonna talk about the harmony of all of that in just a few minutes, why you can believe it's true, why you can believe the things that we're saying, but that which was revealed was inspired.
[time=967] Theo Noustas, God breathed inspiration.
[time=971] Number three, on a camp or number three with you for a few and that is authentication or verification.
[time=977] How do we know?
[time=978] How can we believe it?
[time=979] Authentication, Luke chapter one.
[time=981] I love how Luke starts his gospel.
[time=983] Go there with me, if you will, Luke chapter one.
[time=986] Luke starts his gospel telling why he's writing, but he talks about the goal of his writing being credibility and then how we can get the credibility, how we can have authentication in knowing that we can rely on the scriptures as true and trustworthy that we can build our life around them, that our life is to be governed by its contents.
[time=1004] That's what our statement of faith says here at Blackoff.
[time=1007] So let's read what Luke says.
[time=1008] Luke chapter one, verses one through four.
[time=1011] You guys with me today, we're covering some ground.
[time=1013] I know this is some good stuff.
[time=1014] It's gonna give you some great foundations for this series.
[time=1016] Luke chapter one, verse one.
[time=1018] He says in as much as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things that have been accomplished among us, just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word and have declared them to us.
[time=1033] It seemed good to me also having followed all things closely for some time past to write an orderly account for you most excellent theophilus that you may have certainty.
[time=1044] This is my prayer for you concerning the things you have been taught.
[time=1049] And in those first three verses, Luke captures why we can have credible authenticity, verifiable evidence that the word of God is what God says it is.
[time=1060] Let me give them to you.
[time=1061] Three things that you can write down.
[time=1062] Verse one, the first part is present evidence.
[time=1065] In verse one, he says the things that are accomplished among us.
[time=1068] This is true in the context in which it was written, but it's also true now.
[time=1072] This is God's general revelation.
[time=1074] And it's the specific revelation that he reveals all around us.
[time=1078] If you look around, you'll find evidence.
[time=1080] That's what he's saying.
[time=1081] Look, you've seen the stuff that Jesus has done.
[time=1083] And even though the world feels like it's falling apart today in so many ways, you can see the stuff that Jesus has done.
[time=1088] We're in the middle of a war.
[time=1090] And even our Fort Wayne news around here shared about we've got missionaries in Poland.
[time=1095] The Millers are there.
[time=1096] And the church in Poland is doing amazing stuff to be the hands and the feet of Jesus.
[time=1102] In the middle of what seems like irredeemable, horrible stuff that's going on in our world, the church is being the church.
[time=1108] And the hands and feet of Jesus are alive and well through his church.
[time=1113] The light has entered the darkness, and the darkness can't even overcome it or understand it.
[time=1119] We see present evidence.
[time=1121] It's all around us today, but also when Luke wrote.
[time=1124] Number two, in verse two, we see past eyewitnesses.
[time=1127] Eyewitnesses.
[time=1128] You might be surprised to know this, but back in the day when Luke wrote this, there were no HD cameras that we carried around in our pockets called iPhones.
[time=1136] Or androids or whatever it is that you carry around.
[time=1139] They had eye witnesses and stories were passed from generation to generation.
[time=1143] This was the most reliable source of verification or authentication and they had passed eye witnesses.
[time=1148] And he writes that in verse two.
[time=1150] He says, the eye witnesses and the ministers, they delivered this word to us.
[time=1155] And we'll talk about the longevity of that here in just a moment.
[time=1158] Number three is personal, personal experience.
[time=1162] He had personal experience.
[time=1163] Luke says in verse three, "I've followed all these things closely.
[time=1166] I was there and I see what God's doing in me and I've watched what God's done around me and God's still doing the same thing today.
[time=1173] And this is what leads us to authentication and credibility is this listing of what Luke gives us present evidence.
[time=1180] Look around, past eye witnesses.
[time=1182] They're verifiable, not just biblically, but extra biblically, historically, archaeologically.
[time=1187] All of these scientifically, you name it, all the elites, they're out there because it's real and we can trust it.
[time=1193] And Luke is writing for that reason.
[time=1195] But the personal experience is what I pray for for you today.
[time=1198] Just like what Luke wrote about.
[time=1201] Couple of words you should know that the big theological words of how do we get our scriptures.
[time=1205] Number one is canonization, canonization, the canon.
[time=1209] The word canon talks about like a read or like a measuring stick.
[time=1212] So it's how do we get the 66 books that we have?
[time=1215] Which ones made the cut?
[time=1217] Which ones didn't?
[time=1217] Which ones went into the historical document archives and which ones are in this?
[time=1222] And we know gods in control of that, but how did it happen?
[time=1225] And there were a few criteria that were often used that they were divine in nature, the writings were.
[time=1230] They had authoritative authorship, people who had walked and had those eyewitness accounts as an example.
[time=1235] And that there was corporate recognition of them throughout history.
[time=1240] And that's how we got what we have today.
[time=1242] And it was confirmed.
[time=1243] Canonization leads to confirmation.
[time=1245] Confirmation, write that down.
[time=1247] How is it confirmed?
[time=1248] How can I know?
[time=1249] We've done series.
[time=1251] We've done messages just on specific topics like the resurrection and the biblical and extra-biblical evidence of all these things.
[time=1257] I can't do all that today.
[time=1259] Kind of giving you an overview.
[time=1260] But I'll give you two things that you can look at when it comes to the confirmation.
[time=1264] And I'll tell you, I'm a PK, preachers kid.
[time=1268] And it's a bad look.
[time=1269] Did you know it's a bad look when the PK is in high school and decides that he all of a sudden doesn't know if he really believes in the validity and trustworthiness of the Bible?
[time=1279] That's tough on old dad.
[time=1281] That happened to me, I was the kid.
[time=1284] I was in high school and I struggled.
[time=1286] I thought, well, I'm just believing all this stuff 'cause everybody tells me to believe it and I don't believe it just 'cause people tell me to believe it and I don't even know if it's true.
[time=1292] Some of you are doing that right now.
[time=1294] And you know what my dad did?
[time=1296] I'll never forget what he did.
[time=1298] He didn't say, "Now, you don't make me look bad." 'Cause that's what his parents did at one time.
[time=1302] It's like, "Don't make me look bad." That's not what he did.
[time=1305] You know what he said?
[time=1306] He said, "Search it for yourself.
[time=1307] I'll buy whatever books you need.
[time=1310] I'll pray with you.
[time=1310] I'll have whatever conversations you want to have and just see what you find." I believe you'll find Jesus.
[time=1317] Turns out he was right, but I needed to own my own faith.
[time=1322] And that confirmation process, I'll never forget what God did in me.
[time=1328] He used people around me like my dad.
[time=1330] But as I studied, not me and I bought all the books, I read all kind of different stuff, all different religions, and I kept coming back to Jesus over and over and over and over and over again.
[time=1343] And several things were used.
[time=1344] I mean, there's things like in Scripture, I'll give you a couple of things that give you some of this confirmation.
[time=1349] In Scripture, I think in the New Testament, there's over 300 times that the New Testament quotes the Old Testament and all of these 40 plus authors, they're knuckleheads.
[time=1357] You ever read about any of them?
[time=1359] God used all of them and they all had their own accounts and their own stories and all their differences, but they're all harmonized.
[time=1365] And they all work together, not just with the other stuff that's in the 66 books of the Bible, but with history and with archeology and with science.
[time=1372] And I started finding out all these things and I started learning about people who had the same questions I did and the answers that they found, but I didn't just look for the people who already agreed with me or with the lane of faith that I was in.
[time=1383] I wanted to read all the stuff, I still do that by the way, because here's the thing.
[time=1386] The way I look at it, if I can't read something that goes against what I say I believe and I can't defend against it, I might be wrong.
[time=1392] And yeah, I figured that'd be quiet.
[time=1394] But I did that and then I kept going back to Jesus over and over and over again.
[time=1398] But here's the biggest part that just blew me away.
[time=1400] You wanna know what it is?
[time=1401] It was the preservation of the word of God throughout centuries.
[time=1406] The evil, powerful, oppressive Roman Empire, 380.
[time=1411] Emperor Diocletian said that we're gonna burn every copy of scripture, all the Christian scriptures, all the books, all the places of worship.
[time=1422] And he succeeded and it looked like for a little while, but you know what happened later?
[time=1426] God turned that story and flipped that script around and later another emperor Constantine would have more copies made because number one, they weren't all destroyed.
[time=1438] They never have been and they never will be.
[time=1440] And number two, because God wanted to use that which tried to tear down his word to make more copies of it so that it continued throughout history.
[time=1449] There've been atheists whose homes and properties are used as printing presses for the scriptures over and over this perpetual story of history where we as people wanna tear down the word of God, God says not happening today, not gonna happen tomorrow, never will happen because the word of the Lord will stand forever.
[time=1469] Jesus said it this way.
[time=1472] He said, "The heavens and earth will pass away." Matthew 24, verse 35, "The heavens and earth, they'll pass away, but my words will not pass away." And the more I've studied, the more I've seen that that is so true.
[time=1486] I wanna take you to some of Peter's writing, show you some stuff in scripture.
[time=1490] We could do a ton of this, but we'll just do one more and then I'll give you those last couple of words.
[time=1494] Second Peter, chapter three.
[time=1497] Second Peter, chapter three, let's go to verse 14.
[time=1500] I wanna read this to you.
[time=1500] This is the end of Peter's life.
[time=1502] His life is coming to a close.
[time=1505] And you know what one of his dying wishes was to give people more confidence in the word of God in the scriptures, that's one of mine too.
[time=1512] I pray that I have done that, we'll do that for the rest of my life, that people see Jesus when they see me and that people maybe have a little more confidence and excitement about the word of God.
[time=1521] This is what Peter wrote.
[time=1523] Verse 14, as he closed out this letter, he says, "Therefore beloved, since you're awaiting for these, be diligent and find and to be found by him without spot or blemish and at peace, and count the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul." Notice that he's gonna quote Paul and talk about his writings as scripture, it's phenomenal.
[time=1541] You see this verified, the harmony of the gospels here.
[time=1543] My brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters.
[time=1552] There are some things in them that are hard to understand.
[time=1556] This is another reason why I believe the Bible to be true.
[time=1558] Listen, if these people were writing about, are trying to turn something fraudulent into something that is believed, if they were writing about something false, trying to prove it and make it look as if it were true, which many, the Bible's under attack today, still is, just like it used to be, and it was under attack then.
[time=1574] Then listen, if you wanted to try to prove something false to be true, you wouldn't say stuff like this.
[time=1579] The real, raw, the humor, the sarcasm, the humanity that comes through in the human writers and how they went about doing all of this, it always astounds me, that the working of God, the perfect and errant word of God could come through, flawed human beings who say stuff like that.
[time=1599] Peter, some of the stuff that Paul writes, man, it's hard to understand.
[time=1603] Raise your hand if you agree.
[time=1605] You ever read Paul?
[time=1606] Read Romans.
[time=1607] If you get it all in the first try, you're wrong.
[time=1610] This is what Peter says.
[time=1614] But then he says this, which the ignorant and unstable twist of their own destruction as they do other scriptures.
[time=1620] You, therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, take care, you're not carried away with the error of lawless people and lose your own stability.
[time=1629] But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity, amen.
[time=1637] He quotes Paul and says, first of all, like the other scriptures, he calls Paul's writing scriptures, but then he gives the raw real look that some of 'em's hard to understand, right?
[time=1647] And I love that real, raw approach to the Bible.
[time=1650] And in verse 17, I wanna hone in on this for a moment.
[time=1653] He says, a lot of us get carried away when people twist the scriptures.
[time=1656] People are still doing that today and don't think for a second that it only happens in the secular world.
[time=1661] No doubt it does.
[time=1662] People outside of our faith absolutely wanna use scripture to twist it and to carry us away and distract us from the mission God's called us to, not if you agree.
[time=1671] But I would also tell you, and I would say this is probably the most dangerous and it's also why Jesus had so much to say to the Pharisees.
[time=1677] It happens perhaps even more inside of our walls.
[time=1681] Religion has us do the exact same thing to twist the scriptures to use it.
[time=1684] For there I say it, what God has authorized to make it something that we politicize, uh-oh.
[time=1690] And we make it fit our preferences and we try to fit it to our agendas and we twist the scriptures and we end up carried away by deception and deceit that the enemy loves to use, the enemy loves to use division.
[time=1701] Did you know that? He wants to divide God's church every single day.
[time=1706] But here's what we're called to do, write it down this way.
[time=1708] We're called to hold to timeless truth in a culture filled with transient terms.
[time=1715] There's hardly a week that goes by, they don't have somebody come to me with some new term and they'll say, "Pastor, what's Black Hawk's stance "on this term?" And it's usually some, you know, attempt, a human attempt at putting a term to something, a view of something, an ideology or a philosophical viewpoint or maybe a doctrinal thing, whatever it may be.
[time=1734] And always, usually, probably with good intent, but it's like, "What's Black Hawk's stance, "pastor on this?" And I'll be honest, most of the time I'm like, I don't even know what that is (chuckles) 'cause it changes and sometimes you don't laugh 'cause it's like, "Well, you should." And yeah, we should know the stuff that's going on in the world.
[time=1750] But listen, I've watched all of my life in ministry, these terms, they come and they go.
[time=1756] What's the hot button today?
[time=1758] Won't be five years.
[time=1759] Maybe five days, definitely 10 years from now.
[time=1762] But you know what will always remain as the terms that are transient come and go, the timeless truth of the word of God.
[time=1770] And the more we hold to the timeless truth of the word of God, the more we'll see counterfeits for what they are.
[time=1777] When you know the real thing, you'll be able to spot the counterfeits over and over again with ease.
[time=1784] So let's hold to the timeless truth of the word of God, the sufficiency of Scripture, it is enough.
[time=1790] And you can believe it.
[time=1791] It is trustworthy.
[time=1792] It is totally true.
[time=1794] But here's how we do it.
[time=1795] We talked about this in counterculture.
[time=1796] Jesus is grace and truth.
[time=1800] We stand on the word of God and the sufficiency of Scripture, but we do it the way Jesus did it.
[time=1806] We don't twist it.
[time=1807] And we don't make it fit our preferences and agendas.
[time=1811] We love people, even who don't believe.
[time=1813] We love people, even who look at things differently in our denominational circles.
[time=1817] Why?
[time=1818] Because we stand for the truth of the word of God, but we do it with grace.
[time=1822] It is the both and.
[time=1823] Because Jesus is the fullness of grace and truth.
[time=1827] Silence.
[time=1829] That's hard, isn't it?
[time=1831] That is hard.
[time=1832] But this is what Peter is writing about.
[time=1833] And also, don't be surprised as you do this and you engage with people who don't believe or maybe believe differently than you.
[time=1839] Certainly people who are lost.
[time=1841] Don't be surprised when you find unredeemed behavior from unredeemed people.
[time=1845] I think that was brother Raybur quote from back in the day.
[time=1848] And that is stuck with me.
[time=1849] Don't be surprised when you get unredeemed behavior from unredeemed people.
[time=1853] Love them like Jesus did.
[time=1854] People, sinners, people that didn't believe are always comfortable to be around Jesus.
[time=1858] Yet he never compromised truth.
[time=1860] And that's what we're called to do.
[time=1862] And that's what Peter is writing about.
[time=1863] We're called to be ambassadors, ministers of reconciliation.
[time=1867] Second Corinthians chapter five.
[time=1869] That's our vision.
[time=1870] We wanna build up and send out ambassadors for Jesus.
[time=1873] Let me give you number four.
[time=1875] Number four is translation, translation.
[time=1877] First Corinthians chapter 15.
[time=1879] This is a chapter on the resurrection.
[time=1882] Let's read those first, those couple of verses there.
[time=1885] Verses three and four translation.
[time=1886] What translation should we read?
[time=1888] By the way, my usual answer is which translation is best passed from the one you'll read.
[time=1892] That's a good starting place.
[time=1894] But I'm gonna break that down a little further because here's what we wanna see happen in our lives with our translations.
[time=1899] For I delivered to you as a first importance what I also receives.
[time=1903] This is what we get through translation.
[time=1904] That Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures.
[time=1912] Did you know, and this is for my skeptical friends, but for all of us, that the manuscripts written in the original languages, the scripture is written in.
[time=1921] The manuscripts are the most translated documents in all of human history.
[time=1927] What an amazing thought that is.
[time=1932] That those manuscripts, and they've been translated into depending on if you look at old and or new Testament, thousands of languages that are out there.
[time=1940] Still the best seller, because God has always preserved his word, and he always will.
[time=1946] But I wanna give you four categories of translations.
[time=1948] Three of them are great.
[time=1949] You can just use them as great tools.
[time=1951] The first one is not.
[time=1952] There are number one perversions.
[time=1955] There are, I think it's the NWT, things that they take out very key words and very key things about who God is, his gender, all these different things that are in there where it really perverts the original language and exactly what God has given to us.
[time=1970] So these we stay away from.
[time=1971] And listen, all this list I'm about to give you.
[time=1973] I'm gonna give you a couple of examples, but there's dozens of them.
[time=1976] And our elders and leaders and pastors and deacons, we would love to help you know.
[time=1979] If you're looking for a Bible, and you don't know about translations, we'd love to have a deeper conversation with you about the translation.
[time=1985] Perversions, that's the one to stay away from.
[time=1987] The others are great tools.
[time=1988] The second one, you can write this down, is paraphrases.
[time=1991] Even the story, it's got some stuff that paraphrases things and even fills in to make it read like a novel.
[time=1997] It has selections of scripture.
[time=1998] They're amazing tools, great tools.
[time=2001] So paraphrases, this is like the living Bible or the message you'll find those type of tools and resources out there.
[time=2008] I've got some of those as well.
[time=2010] The last two gets a little more specific and more true to the actual text in the original language.
[time=2015] Thought for thought, and then number four is word for word.
[time=2018] And thought for thought is things like the NLT or the NIV, they're kind of more thought for thought.
[time=2023] Word for word, we read typically out of the ESV, the NASB, New King James Version.
[time=2029] Those are a few examples of what would be more word for word translation.
[time=2033] So that gives you a quick overview.
[time=2035] Which one should I choose, pastor?
[time=2037] The one you'll read.
[time=2038] Start with that one.
[time=2039] Stay away from the perversions.
[time=2040] If you don't know if it is, we'd love to help you with those things.
[time=2043] So the translation part.
[time=2045] Lastly and most importantly, illumination.
[time=2047] We won't got to illuminate his word in our heart.
[time=2050] Last scripture on read two is in the Old Testament.
[time=2052] We've been mainly in the New Testament.
[time=2054] Psalm 19 verses seven through 11.
[time=2057] The Bible, according to verse seven, is the only perfect document on earth.
[time=2062] I know you thought that paper was perfect that you wrote, that you got that A+ on, but it doesn't even come close to the word of God.
[time=2068] Psalm 19 verses seven through 11 says, the law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul.
[time=2073] The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.
[time=2076] The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart.
[time=2079] The commandment of the Lord is pure and lightening the eyes.
[time=2082] The fear of the Lord is clean and during forever.
[time=2085] The rules of the Lord are true and righteous all together.
[time=2088] More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold, sweeter also than honey and the drippings of the honeycomb.
[time=2096] Moreover, by them is your servant warned in keeping them, there is great reward.
[time=2102] As you know, the Bible is also the only book that reads you while you read it.
[time=2106] And some mirror shows you what's going on on the inside of you.
[time=2109] Everyone kick between the eyes as you read scripture before me too.
[time=2113] Me too, Hebrews chapter four, verses 12 through 13 says for the word of God is living in active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
[time=2127] It's about to get real personal up in here and he continues and no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give an account.
[time=2139] But it's that very person that gave us his word that reveals himself to us and is personal with us.
[time=2146] The author wants to meet with you.
[time=2147] Do you know that?
[time=2149] He loves you.
[time=2150] Psalm 119, 105 says your words, a lamp to my feet and a light to our path.
[time=2155] And the spirit of God is ready to use the word of God to change the people of God.
[time=2160] And what I want you to know today as we go into this series is that Jesus is the theme of every book of the Bible.
[time=2167] Before I give you three closing quick applications for you to take home, I want to just read just for a minute or two here.
[time=2173] This list, I've read it to you before, it's been a couple of years ago.
[time=2176] You can close your eyes if you like or just take in the power, friends, of the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=2181] He is the theme of every book of the Bible.

[time=2357] Jesus is the theme of every book of the Bible.
[time=2362] I want to give you three applications just to take home with you.
[time=2364] You may really personal number one, write this down.
[time=2366] It's a process for you.
[time=2367] Read, reflect, rejoice, respond, repeat.
[time=2375] Let's say that together one time.
[time=2376] Ready?
[time=2377] Read, reflect, rejoice, respond, repeat.
[time=2381] And keep on doing it every single day.
[time=2384] Go biblical before you go digital.
[time=2386] Make sure you read, reflect, rejoice, respond and repeat.
[time=2389] So that number two, this is our series theme.
[time=2391] Number two, look to find Jesus.
[time=2393] We're talking about finding Jesus in God's redemptive story.
[time=2396] Look to find Jesus in God's word and in your world.
[time=2400] Look for him.
[time=2401] Look for the God sightings, the God wings.
[time=2403] Look for those moments where you see Jesus at work.
[time=2406] In what you read in his word and in what you see him doing in and through you and around you in your world.
[time=2411] So that number three, you can be a witness.
[time=2413] Write this down.
[time=2414] Share what you've seen.
[time=2416] That's what witnesses do.
[time=2417] They go to a stand and they share what they've seen.
[time=2420] Here's what happened.
[time=2421] I've seen Jesus and I want to share him with you.
[time=2425] Don't ask you to bow your heads and close your eyes today.
[time=2426] Ponder, what does it mean to read, reflect, rejoice and ultimately to respond to the word
[time=2436] of God today?
[time=2436] A pray that God has spoken to your heart.
[time=2438] Believers, pray and ask God, what is my next step?
[time=2441] How can I make Jesus known as I find him in God's word and in the world around me?
[time=2446] How can I be a witness for him to share what I've seen?
[time=2450] Those of you who are watching or in the room right now that would say today, I just don't know if I have a personal relationship with the God of the word through Jesus Christ.
[time=2458] That's the gospel.
[time=2459] Jesus is the theme of every book of the Bible.
[time=2462] Just went through every single book and gave you a quick glimpse.
[time=2464] Why?
[time=2465] So that people like you and me could enter from death to life.
[time=2469] Sinners who are separated from God could say something like this.
[time=2472] Like, God, I know I'm a sinner and I need you.
[time=2475] I know you died for me.
[time=2476] I believe in my heart with all of my heart that you're my perfect sacrifice.
[time=2482] That you're alive right now.
[time=2486] And today I surrender everything to you.
[time=2489] I trusted you and you alone for salvation in your own words.
[time=2491] Let that be the cry of your heart today and you shall be saved.
[time=2495] Anyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
[time=2498] May we not just read God's word today, but may we reflect.
[time=2501] May we rejoice.
[time=2502] But ultimately right now, may we respond.
[time=2504] Take a minute and do just that.
