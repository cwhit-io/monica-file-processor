[time=0] We're going to jump into the story.
[time=4] Finding Jesus, Kevin set up this 30 week series that we're going to go through.
[time=10] The story of the Bible.
[time=11] So what is the Bible?
[time=12] Well, as Kevin mentioned last week, it is 66 books written by about 40 different authors
[time=19] over a couple thousand years.
[time=20] It is the best-selling book of all time.
[time=23] More than five billion copies have been sold.
[time=27] To put that in perspective, really popular books like The Lord of the Rings, The First Harry Potter, they've sold 150 million.
[time=36] The Bible has sold 5 billion.
[time=38] That's 33 times the amount of those other best-sellers.
[time=44] But the Bible is so much more than that.
[time=47] I want to read to you the statement from our Blackhawk Ministry Statement of Faith on the Authority of Scripture.
[time=53] This is what we say about the Bible because it's what the Bible says about the Bible.
[time=59] We believe that the Bible is the inspired and errant, complete, authoritative word of God.
[time=65] It is totally true and trustworthy and therefore our lives are to be governed by its contents.
[time=71] And we list nine Bible verses citing why we say that about the Bible.
[time=77] So that's what the Bible is.
[time=79] But what is its theme, what is its story?
[time=83] Well, quite simply and succinctly in one word, I would say the theme is Jesus.
[time=89] That is the story of the Bible.
[time=91] To say it a little bit longer, I would say it like this, it is the story of God's creation, man's sinful fall, the redemptive work of God through Jesus Christ and his restoration
[time=103] of heaven and earth.
[time=105] This series that we're going to go through 30 weeks will not be exhaustive.
[time=111] It will be an overview.
[time=113] We will not go through every chapter of every book of the Bible word for word.
[time=118] But I encourage you to.
[time=120] I hope that it motivates you to do just that.
[time=123] Today we'll be in Genesis 1 through 8.
[time=126] I hope sometime this week by yourself with a friend, with your spouse, with your life group, you go through Genesis 1 through 8.
[time=135] I'm currently going through every book of the Bible with my two best friends on a daily basis and I cannot tell you what it has added to my life.
[time=146] My relationship with God feels so much deeper and richer than it ever has because I am in his word daily going through every book of the Bible.
[time=157] So the Bible is essentially God's story and we get to play a part in it.
[time=162] So it makes sense that we would then have a good understanding of who God is and who we are.
[time=167] And I want to play a short video clip for you here.
[time=170] It's from Ligonier Ministries, a wonderful Bible teacher named R.C.
[time=174] Sproul.
[time=175] A few years ago he's in a panel discussion and a question comes in from the audience and
[time=181] the question is why was God so harsh and why was the punishment on an Adam and Eve for
[time=188] that first sin so severe?
[time=191] Check out his response.
[time=194] That God's punishment for Adam was so severe.
[time=202] This creature from the dirt defied the everlasting holy God.
[time=211] After that God had said the day that you shall eat of it, you shall surely die.
[time=219] And instead of dying Thanatos that day he lived another day and was clothed in his nakedness
[time=231] by pure grace and had the consequences of a curse applied for quite some time, but the
[time=242] worst curse would come upon the one who seduced him whose head would be crushed by the seat
[time=248] of the woman and the punishment was too severe.
[time=254] What's wrong with you people?
[time=257] I'm serious.
[time=259] I mean this is what's wrong with the Christian church today.
[time=262] We don't know who God is and we don't know who we are.
[time=268] So maybe we don't understand who God is or who we are, maybe we forget.
[time=273] So who is God and who are we?
[time=276] Well the Bible gives us answers to both questions over and over again.
[time=281] So let's dig into the word and find out.
[time=283] Today we'll be in Genesis 1 through 8 and we'll start here in Genesis 1 through 5 because
[time=290] God speaks the world into existence.
[time=294] In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
[time=298] The earth was without form and void and darkness was over the face of the deep and the spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light.
[time=310] And God saw the light was good and God separated the light from the darkness.
[time=314] God called the light day and the darkness he called night.
[time=317] There was evening and morning the first day.
[time=322] In the beginning God over the last few weeks as I prepared for this Sunday morning I've become convinced that I could probably get three full series out of Genesis 1 through
[time=333] 8 and I could easily get a full sermon out of those first four words in the beginning
[time=339] God.
[time=341] The Bible is the beginning of our story.
[time=345] It's the beginning of the story of earth but it is not the beginning of God's story because God has no beginning.
[time=353] He is beginning.
[time=356] He is the end.
[time=357] He said he is the Alpha and the Omega.
[time=360] God existed before time existed.
[time=365] Why does he speak the world into existence in these first few verses that were told through the writings of Moses?
[time=373] To be clear I don't know.
[time=376] I'm not sure.
[time=378] One of the songs we sang this morning used the phrase marvelous mystery.
[time=383] There's a lot about God that is a marvelous mystery.
[time=386] I don't know.
[time=387] But I think there are two reasons that make sense to my human mind as to why God spoke the world into existence when he could have done it any way he wanted to, could have waved his hand, could have created a pile of dirt, molded it, folded it into the earth but he
[time=403] spoke it into existence.
[time=404] Why?
[time=405] Well, I would suggest one reason might be to show how truly holy and other he is.
[time=412] Man has created all kinds of amazing things.
[time=415] They're sitting in a beautiful building created by man.
[time=418] They're skyscrapers and cars and computers and phones.
[time=422] Man has created them.
[time=424] Great things, right?
[time=426] No man has ever spoken anything into existence.
[time=430] I can't say create an iPhone and hold an iPhone.
[time=435] But God spoke everything into existence.
[time=438] He is truly other.
[time=440] His ways are not our ways, he is holy and set apart.
[time=445] Maybe another reason he spoke the whole world into existence was because he uses his voice
[time=451] with us over and over again.
[time=454] Throughout the whole Bible, we are told about God's voice.
[time=458] And I believe today that he still speaks to us.
[time=462] Maybe it's audible for you at times.
[time=465] It's probably inaudible a lot.
[time=468] But when you hear the voice of God, take it seriously, you are hearing the voice that
[time=474] spoke the world into existence.
[time=479] God creates heaven and earth and everything in both he creates light and dark and time in these first few verses.
[time=487] Let's talk about time.
[time=489] One of my favorite ways to think about God is the fact that he exists outside of time.
[time=494] Time dominates my life.
[time=497] It dictates my life, getting to meetings, classes.
[time=500] I marked the weeks and the months and the years that fly by.
[time=504] Everybody in this room knows exactly how old you are because of time.
[time=509] But God exists outside of time.
[time=512] As kids, we learn that he holds the whole world in his hands.
[time=515] We sing that.
[time=517] But he doesn't just hold the whole world in his hands.
[time=519] He holds all of time in his hands.
[time=522] He knows what's going to happen 10,000 years from today just as well as he knows what happened yesterday.
[time=529] I don't know what's going to happen five minutes from now.
[time=534] He holds all of time in his hands.
[time=536] Speaking of time, the Bible is very clear about the time that God uses to create heaven
[time=543] and earth.
[time=544] It tells us that he uses days.
[time=549] I think we have an important choice to make here.
[time=552] Do we believe the Bible right off the bat or do we not?
[time=557] A lot of people, even inside the church, think that God used millions or billions of years to create the earth.
[time=566] But the Bible tells us that he used days.
[time=571] Let's say he had used millions or billions of years.
[time=576] Why wouldn't he just tell us that?
[time=578] If God's words said and God used a million years to create the ocean and five million
[time=585] years to create the animals, would you think anything less of him?
[time=591] Would his power not be on full display with the majesty of his creation cease to exist for you?
[time=599] If he had done that, he would have simply told us that.
[time=603] He says, "I created light and dark, day and evening."
[time=610] These were six days that God created earth and he rested on the seventh day.
[time=617] Another controversial thing about time is that a lot of people truly do believe the earth is billions of years old and that the galaxy is multiple billions of years old.
[time=629] I don't happen to believe that.
[time=632] That's why.
[time=634] The earth was created in a mature state.
[time=638] How do we know that?
[time=641] Adam and Eve were created as adults.
[time=645] Adam was not a fetus.
[time=648] Adam wasn't put into the womb of a woman and given birth to.
[time=652] He was created in a mature state.
[time=655] The garden wasn't a bunch of seeds that turned into plants and flowers and trees and bushes.
[time=663] The garden was a bunch of trees and bushes and flowers and grass in their mature stage.
[time=672] If God created man and God created the garden with age in its mature state, why would we
[time=680] suggest that the rest of the universe is different?
[time=686] These things were created with the appearance of age.
[time=690] In my old life as a meteorologist, I would go to meteorology conventions surrounded by
[time=696] people who believed in the Big Bang theory, that this is all one big accident, that it's
[time=704] all one big reorganizing of matter.
[time=707] We can tell you where that matter came from, where it was created, but a Big Bang happened
[time=713] that matter got reorganized into the happy accident that we are here today.
[time=723] Creation screams that we have a creator.
[time=726] The intricacies of man screams that we have a creator are unbelievably unique position
[time=733] to the sun and in the galaxy that allows life to exist screams that we have a creator.
[time=740] We have a decision to make and we have to make it right off the bat.
[time=743] Do you believe the Bible or do you not?
[time=746] If you don't believe what God says in Genesis 1, what stops you from believing what Jesus
[time=752] says in the New Testament?
[time=754] What stops you from believing all of the rich truth in this book?
[time=759] Get out of the gate, you have a decision to make, believe God's word or don't.
[time=767] I say let's believe it.
[time=770] In Genesis 1, 26, a couple of important things happen.
[time=777] God says, "Let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth." God creates man.
[time=793] God refers to himself in plural.
[time=796] God is three and one.
[time=798] God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit are all right here at the beginning of creation.
[time=803] Jesus is there before time begins.
[time=809] We're also created differently.
[time=812] Did you catch that?
[time=813] He speaks everything else into existence.
[time=817] He forms man into existence.
[time=820] We are set apart.
[time=822] We are made in His likeness and in His image.
[time=825] God forms man into existence.
[time=830] He then rests on the seventh day and in Genesis 2 we get a little more insight into the process
[time=836] of God creating man.
[time=839] And we get the first not good.
[time=842] Through all of Genesis God creates everything and at every turn He calls it good and times even calls it very good.
[time=850] But we get our first not good in Genesis 2, 18.
[time=857] Then the Lord God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone.
[time=860] I will make him a helper fit for him." And then in 2.23 we see Adam's reaction to Eve's creation.
[time=869] The man said, "This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.
[time=873] She shall be called woman because she was taken out of man." This is Adam saying, "Finally, you thought this was all good, but it was not good."
[time=885] I remember one of the times about 12, 13 years ago probably I had the talk with my boys and
[time=892] I did it in different ways at different times.
[time=894] One of the times I did it I decided to sit all three of them down at the same time, which was a little risky because at the time my oldest probably would have been 14, my youngest probably would have been about eight.
[time=906] And I say to them, "Guys, the most beautiful thing God ever created is women."
[time=918] That's what Adam's saying in 2.23, "Read between the lines, Adam's screaming, "Amen."
[time=926] I can tell I'm losing my eight-year-old completely here.
[time=930] He's looking at me like I'm talking Chinese.
[time=933] "Girls, beautiful, what are you talking about?" My 14-year-old looks over at him after a minute picking up that he's not getting it, and my 14-year-old says to my eight-year-old, "Someday you'll understand."
[time=950] Adam understood right off the bat, again because Eve was not a fetus.
[time=955] She was an adult woman.
[time=957] I want to talk about the word helper.
[time=959] It's the word that Genesis uses to describe Eve.
[time=964] This is another controversial topic, especially in our day and age.
[time=968] The word helper, a helper supplies strength for the one who has helped, and the term
[time=974] does not imply that the woman is stronger or weaker, but fit for him, matching him as
[time=981] opposed to like him.
[time=983] Men and women are made to complement each other.
[time=986] In fact, the noun form of the word helper in the original language is the same word
[time=992] that is used to refer to God as the one who helps his people in almost every other usage
[time=998] we see in the Bible, it's the same word.
[time=1002] Helper is not a word of weakness.
[time=1005] Women are not lesser, they're not greater, they're simply different from men.
[time=1012] We were made for each other.
[time=1013] And even though most eight-year-old boys don't understand that, it's a good thing.
[time=1022] Moving forward to Genesis 3, we see that man allows evil to enter into the world.
[time=1032] I struggled with exactly how to say this because while Adam and Eve get credit or blame for
[time=1040] the first sin, that is true on earth, but evil pre-existed them.
[time=1046] They allowed it to come into our world.
[time=1049] Let's read Genesis 3, 1-5.
[time=1054] Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the Lord God had made.
[time=1059] He said to the woman, "Did God actually say, 'You shall not eat of any tree in the garden,' and the woman said to the serpent, 'We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden,' but God said, 'You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that's in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it lest you die.' But the serpent said to the woman, 'You will not surely die.' For God knows that when you eat of it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God knowing good and evil." This is how evil enters our world, this is how sin begins, and look at how it began.
[time=1091] It began so small.
[time=1094] Letting twist God's words just a little bit.
[time=1098] Then Eve agrees with the twist and twists them herself.
[time=1104] Then Satan blatantly lies.
[time=1107] Then Eve eats the fruit.
[time=1109] And don't let Adam off the hook.
[time=1111] Where was Adam standing right there?
[time=1116] And then he eats the fruit.
[time=1118] And then when God shows up, these two, Adam and Eve have the audacity to hide from God.
[time=1126] They're the only two people on the planet.
[time=1132] And speaking of audacity, listen to what Adam says.
[time=1135] When God says, 'What did you do?
[time=1138] Why did you do this?' Adam's response is, 'The woman whom you gave to be with me.
[time=1144] She gave me the fruit of the tree, and I ape.
[time=1146] It's your fault.
[time=1148] It's your fault.' Adam blames God himself and Eve.
[time=1154] Then Eve blames the serpent.
[time=1157] Satan slithers away, saying nothing more, thinking he's won, but I don't think he understands
[time=1164] God's warning to him in 3.15.
[time=1167] When we get our first direct response, our first direct connection to Jesus, 'He shall
[time=1175] bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.' I think Satan either doesn't understand or he is such a deceiver that he deceives himself into thinking he can stop it.
[time=1185] And then ultimately sin leads to death.
[time=1187] Look at this short little verse in 3.21 that has meaning, I think we often gloss over.
[time=1193] And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins and clothed them.
[time=1200] How did God get garments of skins from an animal?
[time=1206] Something died.
[time=1209] Sin happened, separation from God happened, and a sacrifice had to be made.
[time=1215] Sin leads to death, right off the bat.
[time=1218] The very first sin leads to the very first sacrifice.
[time=1224] In 1 Peter 5, 8 Peter tells us that Satan is like a lion who prowls and looks to devour
[time=1230] us.
[time=1231] Well, how do you devour something?
[time=1233] When I'm starving, if you put my very favorite meal in front of me, a big fat juicy steak,
[time=1240] I'm not going to swallow it whole.
[time=1242] I'm not going to inhale it.
[time=1244] It's going to go really fast, and I'm going to devour it, but it's going to happen bite by bite.
[time=1250] And that's how sin works.
[time=1253] Think of the truth of this list again, small little twist of the words, agreeing with the twist, another little twist, a blatant lie, the sin of action, eating the fruit, the sin
[time=1264] of inaction, standing there and doing nothing, then blame and shame and guilt.
[time=1270] Satan slithers away and then death.
[time=1274] That's how sin plays out in the garden.
[time=1277] That's how sin plays out in our lives.
[time=1281] Through this list, we see that sin multiplies and grows exponentially.
[time=1286] What started as the twist of God's word, one generation later, Cain kills Abel.
[time=1293] One generation later, we have murder.
[time=1297] And by the time we get to Noah, Genesis 4 and 5, take us through the 10 generations, just 10 generations from Adam to Noah, listen to the words of Genesis 6, 5 through 7.
[time=1312] The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually, and the Lord regretted that he
[time=1324] made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart.
[time=1329] The Lord said, "I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things in birds of the heavens for I am sorry that I have made
[time=1339] them." One little twist of his words, a generation later, we have murder.
[time=1346] Ten generations later, God is sorry, the whole thing happened.
[time=1353] In Romans 3, 10 through 20, Paul, quoting the psalmist, paints a very stark picture of
[time=1360] who we are.
[time=1363] As it is written, "None is righteous, no not one, no one understands, no one seeks for
[time=1370] God, all have turned aside, together they have become worthless, no one does good, not even one.
[time=1376] Their throat is in open grave, they use their tongues to deceive, the venom of asps is under their lips, their mouth is full of curses and bitterness, their feet are swift to shed blood, and their paths are ruined and misery, and the way of peace they have not known."
[time=1392] There is no fear of God before their eyes.
[time=1394] For by works of the law, no human being will be justified in his sight since through the law comes knowledge of sin.
[time=1402] Do you ever want to be depressed?
[time=1405] Do you read Genesis 6, 5 through 7 and Romans 3, 10 through 20?
[time=1411] Do you ever wonder about the goodness of man?
[time=1414] Re-read those two passages and wonder no more.
[time=1419] The Bible is very clear about who we are, but it is very clear about who God is.
[time=1427] Back in Genesis, right after God regrets, in 6, 5 through 7, and Genesis 8, it says,
[time=1435] "But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord."
[time=1441] God is both perfectly just and perfectly and completely merciful.
[time=1447] How?
[time=1448] Hold that thought.
[time=1451] I was trying to think of how best to illustrate how pervasive and how evil, how pervasive
[time=1458] sin is in my life and how evil I am.
[time=1461] And trust me, I could share a thousand different examples of how that's true.
[time=1466] I'm going to choose one that's kind of light and funny.
[time=1470] So back in Bill McGill's Church, right after I say to Jesse, "Help me pray to get us out of here." Bill goes up one last time and says, "We're going to sing one more song.
[time=1481] The next voice you hear from the pulpit is going to be Curtis.
[time=1483] He's going to bring a good word to us.
[time=1485] At this point, I am legitimately struggling to breathe and swallow." Bill calls me up onto the stage.
[time=1492] The stage is empty, the band is off to the side, sits me in this huge throne chair.
[time=1497] It felt like I was 5 years old, the back of the chair is 10 feet beyond my head, it was probably only 6 inches, but it felt like 10 feet.
[time=1504] I'm staring out at an African-American church in worship and it's going exactly as you might
[time=1511] imagine in your head.
[time=1512] People are dressed to the nines, up in the aisles, singing, dancing, shouting, it's jubilant.
[time=1519] I don't know the words of the song, I can't even sing along, I can barely breathe.
[time=1525] The song ends.
[time=1528] I somehow stand up, get to the pulpit, start to get the first few words out.
[time=1532] I'm not sure how.
[time=1535] And instantly, I'm getting feedback.
[time=1537] One of the great things about an African-American church is you know how it's going.
[time=1543] If it's going well, you know.
[time=1546] If it's not, you know.
[time=1550] I can tell it's going pretty well.
[time=1552] And while I'm sitting there preaching the word of God, the thoughts in my head are, I'm
[time=1560] pretty good.
[time=1561] This is going pretty well.
[time=1565] I'm kind of killing it here.
[time=1569] Five minutes after begging God to remove me from the church, the only thing I can think
[time=1577] while preaching his word is, boy, I have got it all together.
[time=1583] Didn't need God, did I?
[time=1585] Look at me.
[time=1587] That is how sin plays out in our lives.
[time=1590] That is how wicked I am.
[time=1592] That's how pervasive sin is.
[time=1597] So pervasive that just ten generations after forming us with his hands, breathing his life
[time=1603] into us, God regrets and grieves.
[time=1607] In Genesis 6, we learn about the flood.
[time=1611] In Genesis 6, 3, God gives a 120-year warning.
[time=1617] And at that time, he calls Noah to start making the ark.
[time=1622] And Noah is making the ark right there in front of all his friends and neighbors and his community.
[time=1628] There's not a drop of rain and this guy's making a boat the size of one and a half football fields.
[time=1635] Can you imagine what that looked like?
[time=1638] I know the pain of a bad forecast.
[time=1644] Noah probably felt pretty darn crazy, but he was listening to the voice of God.
[time=1649] And when you listen to God, it may appear crazy to others, but it is always the right
[time=1655] thing to do.
[time=1658] I want you to catch something about the flood story in 716, Genesis 716.
[time=1668] And those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him and the Lord shut him in.
[time=1674] Have you ever noticed that?
[time=1677] Noah didn't shut the door to the ark.
[time=1679] God did.
[time=1681] For 120 years, he gave them warning that it was coming.
[time=1685] They watched Noah build the ark.
[time=1687] The door was open.
[time=1689] Anybody could have come in and then God shut the door.
[time=1695] In John 10, 9, Jesus says, "I am the door." The door is open to you today.
[time=1702] All you have to do is walk in.
[time=1706] Jesus is the door.
[time=1709] There came a day that God shut the door to the ark.
[time=1712] And there will come a day the door is shut for us.
[time=1715] Do not miss that door.
[time=1719] Walk through the door that is Jesus.
[time=1723] In the interest of time, we're skimming over and skipping over a lot of the flood.
[time=1728] But I want to recommend two books to you for those who would love to do more of an intellectual scientific dive into the flood.
[time=1738] One is called the Genesis Flood by John Wickham and Henry Morris and the other is called Noah's Ark, a feasibility study by John Woodmorep.
[time=1746] Full disclosure, I had not finished both books, but I have started both.
[time=1749] I got them as Christmas gifts, ironically.
[time=1753] And they are amazing.
[time=1754] But what the point of both books is, is that science, creation, the signs of this earth
[time=1762] all validate what we learn in Genesis.
[time=1766] Science proves God is the creator.
[time=1769] And it has been studied and proven.
[time=1772] And if you doubt it, those are two great books.
[time=1776] So through the flood, we see that God is both justice and mercy.
[time=1782] First he regrets and grieves, but he is both justice and mercy.
[time=1788] We see that in the story of the flood, but we really see it through our Lord and Savior,
[time=1794] Jesus Christ.
[time=1796] In 2 Corinthians 5, 21, Paul writes, "For our sake, he made him to be sin, who knew no
[time=1803] sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."
[time=1810] Jesus is the picture of God's justice, his wrath, and his holiness.
[time=1815] But Jesus is also the picture of his mercy, grace, and compassion.
[time=1821] Every sin ever committed wasn't just laid upon Jesus, Jesus became those sins.
[time=1826] He bore them completely and holy.
[time=1828] The justice of God demands a price is paid for sin, and it was paid.
[time=1835] We talk about mercy and grace as free gifts from God, and they are for us.
[time=1843] But they came at a high price.
[time=1846] We just didn't have to pay it.
[time=1848] Jesus paid it all.
[time=1851] He didn't only endure the beating, mocking, and torturous death of man, he endured the wrath of God.
[time=1859] God poured out every bit of his hatred for sin upon Jesus so that we could bask in the
[time=1866] glory and every bit of his forgiveness, grace, mercy, compassion, and love.
[time=1873] And even to the point where we become his righteousness, that is who God is, the perfect
[time=1882] balance of justice and mercy.
[time=1886] Through this first stretch of Genesis, we have learned who God is, and we have learned who we are.
[time=1893] Here's a list of some of the things we've seen just today, just in a brief overview of these first few chapters.
[time=1901] God is the Creator.
[time=1904] Man is created.
[time=1906] God is infinite.
[time=1908] Man is finite.
[time=1911] God exists outside of dimensions.
[time=1914] We are bound by time's face in the laws of physics.
[time=1918] God is perfect.
[time=1919] We are inherently flawed and wicked.
[time=1923] God is justice.
[time=1924] We are unjust.
[time=1927] God is merciful, we are selfish and wicked.
[time=1933] So this is how the whole story begins.
[time=1936] And we're going to go through the Bible over 30 weeks.
[time=1938] But spoiler alert, as the kids say, I'm going to tell you how it ends.
[time=1945] This world exists to give him glory.
[time=1949] Evil is allowed to exist so that God receives the glory he is due.
[time=1956] In Satan and sin and man's spoil it, God is putting it right.
[time=1964] We're in Genesis today, but I'm going to read to you out of Revelation.
[time=1969] Satan slithered out of the garden, not even having an understanding or deceiving himself
[time=1977] about who Jesus is.
[time=1981] And watch Jesus die a brutal death on the cross and laughed as he thought he had victory
[time=1988] in his grasp.
[time=1990] He couldn't see Jesus.
[time=1992] When he did see Jesus, he saw him incorrectly.
[time=1995] But I want to tell you about the Jesus Satan is going to see.
[time=2000] In Revelation 19, 11 through 16, then I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse.
[time=2007] The one sitting on it is called faithful and true, and in righteousness he judges and makes war.
[time=2013] His eyes are like a flame of fire and on his head are many diadems.
[time=2017] And he has a name written that no one knows but himself.
[time=2020] He has clothed in a robe, dipped in blood, and the name by which he is called is the Word of God.
[time=2026] And the armies of heaven arrayed in fine linen, white and pure were following him on white horses.
[time=2031] From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations and he will rule them with a rod of iron.
[time=2037] He will tread the wine press of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty on his robe and on his thigh.
[time=2043] He has a name written King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[time=2048] That is the Jesus that Satan is going to see, and there will be no mistake at that point.
[time=2057] Today we've heard how the story begins, but here's how it ends.
[time=2063] Here's how the story ends for Satan in Revelation 2010.
[time=2069] And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.
[time=2081] That is the end of the story for Satan.
[time=2084] The lake of fire and sulfur tormented day and night forever.
[time=2090] And if you don't make Jesus the Lord and savior of your life, that's the end of your story
[time=2098] too, tormented day and night forever and ever.
[time=2105] But for those of us who place our trust and our lives in Jesus, the conquering hero we
[time=2111] see in Revelation, this is how the story ends.
[time=2116] See if it sounds a little better to you.
[time=2120] Revelation 21, "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first
[time=2126] earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.
[time=2129] And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
[time=2137] And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man.
[time=2144] He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God.
[time=2152] He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more.
[time=2160] Neither shall there be mourning, or crying, or pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.
[time=2168] The irony that I tear up, reading about no more tears.
[time=2176] This is the way it ends.
[time=2178] That's the end of the story.
[time=2180] Our salvation comes by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone.
[time=2187] One day every knee will bow, and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=2195] Until then, we know He is coming again, and we say, "Come, Lord Jesus."
[time=2202] Let's pray.
[time=2206] Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your Word today.
[time=2212] I thank You that we are a part of Your story, and that we have Your Word as a way to know
[time=2218] who You are and who We are.
[time=2223] I thank You that while You are completely just, You are also completely merciful, and that
[time=2233] even though You regretted having made us, You saved us.
[time=2240] The door was open, and the door still is open through Jesus Christ.
[time=2247] Lord, above all, I thank You for Jesus.
[time=2252] He is Your Word, He is Your Son, He is our Savior.
[time=2258] He is the door, and I pray that we would walk through it and make Him the personal Lord and Savior of our lives.
[time=2268] I thank You for the story that You lay out Your Lord, and I thank You for the way that
[time=2274] it will end.
