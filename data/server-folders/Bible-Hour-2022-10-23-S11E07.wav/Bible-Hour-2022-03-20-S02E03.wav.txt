[time=0] We're in a series called Finding Jesus, God's Redemptive Story, and I thank God that Jesus
[time=7] is the theme of every book of the Bible. And we've got these story books like this. We've got several of them available at the Welcome Desk. You can find them in different locations, but they are available at the Welcome Desk for ten dollars. Really good deal. We've got a good church deal that we can give to you guys as we've got a bulk quantity of them. And our series is
[time=26] following the chapters of this book. And so it's an amazing resource. How many of you have your copy and you've already been reading some? I know I have to. That's right. I love it. I love it. We've been doing it as a church. Never too late to get on board with us. Our series will follow the chapters.
[time=41] In fact, today will be in the second chapter, which is about Abraham. And so first things first, though. I got to give it up for my friend Curtis Smith. Then he did a great job last week kicking us off in Genesis. Let's thank Curtis. So thankful for him. Thankful for our elders. And you'll be
[time=58] hearing an update on how they've been working. And we've been working hard together. We're going to transition, finish, and continue well as a church body. Can I get a name in? All right. God
[time=68] is just getting started. And in fact, that's the whole point of this series is that Jesus is in every circumstance. And we're going to look for him. He's the theme of every book of the Bible. This series is about the fact that there are 66 books of the Bible written over a span of almost about 2,000 years, roughly 40 authors. Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic, these different languages, all these
[time=88] different people coming together to be used by the Spirit of God to write the words of God.
[time=93] Yet it has one theme, and his name is Jesus. So we're finding Jesus in God's
[time=99] redemptive story. And we have these books available to help you with that. And here's what we hope
[time=105] for. There's a story of a pastor that every week he would share a passage of Scripture, which is a good way to go as a pastor. And he would get up. But usually when he would tell a story from Scripture, he would kind of cut himself short. And the congregation noticed he kept doing that.
[time=119] He would say something like this. He'd start telling the story from Scripture. And then he would say, "Well, you know the story." And then he would just move on. And he would do that over and over and over and over until eventually he did the same thing that he usually had done. He started sharing a story from Scripture. And he went, "Well, you all know the story until this little old lady sitting in the back seat of the church, piped up and said, 'Yeah, we might, but we're paying you to tell it.'" And you know, in religious circles, we are bad sometimes about assuming
[time=151] that maybe we all get and see the thread of Jesus through the holistic redemptive story
[time=158] of Scripture. And we don't want, at Black Hawk, to assume that we put all those pieces together.
[time=164] And better yet, I would tell you, if you think you do capture and know and have a grasp on the
[time=170] holistic story of how Jesus is the thread through all of history, through all of God's
[time=176] redemptive story, I would tell you you are wrong because we can never fully grasp with our finite
[time=182] mind the power that we hold in our hands with the Word of God. And I'm so thankful that we can spend some time digging into it together to draw attention to that thread. So last week we looked
[time=193] at the beginning, we looked at how God created everything, and sin marred all the good creation
[time=199] that God created. Sin has made its entrance. And you know what I'd say to you and me today?
[time=204] Sin made its entrance into the buildings of Black Hawk Ministries. How do I know? You're here, and I'm here. But sin has made its entrance into the world. And in chapter one of the story,
[time=214] and last week, as Curtis preached, we see a theme. And the theme is that God has a vision.
[time=220] You know what that vision is? It's you. It's me. God has a vision to be together with us,
[time=226] to be family with us, even though sin marred his perfect creation. Chapter two, let's write
[time=232] this down together and go there together. Go to Genesis chapter 12. I'm going to talk to you about Abraham. Abraham, God builds a nation. Just as God's vision was clear in chapter one,
[time=242] in this first part of Genesis, we see that God wants us to be a part of his family. Now we see that God creates a means by which he can make us part of his family. That God is building a nation.
[time=253] God is building a covenant. God is building a people. God is building a bridge, a connection,
[time=259] a relationship with people. And a central theme of this connection is Abraham. Father, Abraham.
[time=266] Now in this section of Genesis, we'll be primarily in Genesis 12, but I'll be jumping us around a lot of other passages in Genesis. This covers the time span, does this chapter, and today's sermon
[time=277] will scratch the surface of Genesis 12 through about chapter 35. Now in that time span, you'll find
[time=283] Lot, Hagar, Rebecca, Isaac, Leah, Rachel, Esau, Jacob, to name a few of them. There's a lot of people, but Abraham is a linchpin. I want us to focus on him, and I believe you can probably relate
[time=294] with him. Abraham, God builds a nation. And lately, as we talk about God building, I've realized that
[time=302] I often build things. If you build things in your life, you build plans, you build careers, you build families, you build these things. Sometimes I realize I'm building with toothpicks
[time=313] on a foundation of sand. Can I get it, amen? You ever thought, I was doing pretty well, and then it just all crumbled. All my plans went away. If you don't believe me, I take you back to the year, yeah, I'm going to say it, 2020. Whoo, COVID, global pandemic, and everything we thought
[time=327] was kind of normal, kind of changed. And that's what happens. And we have an amazing coach in our midst, Coach Mark Davidson, through a lot of highs and lows. The highest of highs, the lowest of lows
[time=338] as he's battled cancer, and a theme that he has constantly pointed people to as he shared his testimony on his Matthew 7 and verses 24 through 27. I've heard him bring it up many times. And this is where Jesus is speaking and saying, you should build your house on the rock, not on the
[time=354] sand. On the sand, if it's that foundation, when the wind and waves come, it all washes away, but we want to build our house on a rock. And that's what I pray for you, that we as a church, and we as the church, individually speaking, we build the foundations of our life on the rock.
[time=370] Can I get it, amen? You guys ready for that today? That is what Abraham is a picture of. Now, he's a knucklehead like you and me, and I'm going to prove it to you today. If you didn't believe Father Abraham is just like us in his sinfulness and his knuckleheadedness in his life,
[time=384] but God builds a nation through him. Let's look at today at finding three ways. Three ways we'll
[time=391] find Jesus in Abraham's story today, but before we do, how many of you know the song? You know the song, Father Abraham? Let's sing it together. Those of you who don't know it, you're just going to think we're weird, but just indulge with us for a minute. Father Abraham had many sons,
[time=406] many sons had Father Abraham. I am one of them, and so are you. So let's just praise the Lord.
[time=416] Ride on. We'll stop there. We'll stop there. Then it goes, ride on. Then you do it again, and left arm, and right foot, and left foot. Oh, man, it brings back so many memories.
[time=424] And I thank God for those memories because I learned that Abraham was the father of me and you,
[time=431] and we're here, and we're a part of this nation that God built. But when I look at his story, I realize I have a lot in common with Abraham. So let's look at how we find Jesus in his story.
[time=441] Write this down. Number one, Jesus in the calling, Jesus in the calling of Abraham. We see Jesus
[time=447] there. Let's make those ties. Genesis chapter 12, if you're ready for the word today, give somebody an elbow or a high five or a fist bump. And let's dig in to the word of God. Genesis chapter 12, verse one, here's what the word of God says. Now the Lord said to Abram, he's Abram now.
[time=461] I'll read to you in just a moment how he became Abraham. Now the Lord said to Abram, go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you. He did not say,
[time=473] Abraham, go. I'm sending you a pin drop map to your iPhone, and you just punch it in, and you go
[time=479] there. And when you get there, here's what to expect. And after you've been there for six months, then this outcome is going to happen. No, he says, go to the land. I'll show you. Where am I going?
[time=489] I'll show you. Well, what am I going to do when I get there? I'm going to make it clear as you go.
[time=493] Well, why did you choose me? I chose you. Just do what I said. Well, what's the outcome? You'll
[time=500] see when you get there, just go and trust me. To start to the journey of Abraham, isn't it? There's
[time=506] a couple of key words you're going to find with Abraham that come up over and over and over in his story. One is journey. He says, Abraham journey. He was on a journey. You're on a journey, and I'm on a journey. Sojourned is the other word. He journeys, and he sojourns, and you'll see those words a few times in our studies today. And our church is on a journey right now. And it feels a little bit like what Abraham felt like, right? We don't know what the future holds. We don't know of all the details of the journey we have ahead. I feel that way. You feel that way. Not only is
[time=536] it that way for us many times as a church, but it definitely is that way if you choose to follow Jesus. I think it was David Platt that said to everybody wanting a safe, untroubled, life free from danger, stay away from Jesus. If you follow Jesus, you will have uncertainty,
[time=553] and no doubt we feel that corporately. We feel that individually. And so I love that Abraham is our focus today. How many of you ever taught a kid to walk at a kid or grandkid? You remember their first step? You remember their first step? Here's the thing. Every journey starts with a step.
[time=567] You should write that down. That's not even on your screen, but man, that'll preach.
[time=570] Every journey starts with a step. And God's got a step for you. And that first step for your child usually went something like this, right? And then down they went. And we went, "Yeah, you took a step,
[time=580] right?" That's the worst step I've ever seen in my life. But we cheer and we go crazy and we
[time=586] go nuts over one step. And I've always thought that that's a beautiful picture of how our Heavenly Father helps and celebrates and cheers us on when we take a step. It's a wobbly, terrible step,
[time=597] but we tried. And we took a step. And what did you do as parents? You picked them up? You said,
[time=603] "Let's go for two." And then they got two steps. And God does the same thing with us. And Abraham sees the same thing. He took a step and he went to the land that God would one day hopefully show
[time=613] him. God has you, my friend, on a journey today. He has our church on a journey today. And he will
[time=619] pick you up when you fall down and he will cheer you on when you boldly take a step, even if it's
[time=625] into uncertainty. Abraham reminds us of Jesus in our calling. You say, "Well, where's Jesus in all
[time=631] this?" Write this down. Abraham's calling points to Jesus' commission of his church. Matthew 28 is
[time=638] where we call it the great commission. This is before Jesus ascended to heaven and he gave his church a command. Now remember, verse 1, God said to Abram, "Go." And let's look at what Jesus
[time=648] said to his church, to us as he ascended to heaven. Matthew 28 verse 19. Let's look at it. What does he say? "Go, go, go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
[time=660] Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." Verse 20, he says, "Teaching them to observe all that
[time=666] I have commanded you and behold, I am with you always even to the end of the age." The literal
[time=672] translation of the word "go" in Matthew 28, you could translate it this way, as you are going
[time=678] make disciples, as you are going. There's a level of uncertainty with that, isn't there?
[time=683] As I'm going, well tell me where I'm going first. No, as you are going, when you go to the grocery store, when you go to your career, when you go home, as you are going make disciples. And we see a
[time=697] parallel there with the commission of Jesus and with the calling of Abraham. There's an unknown element in the calling. So I ask you, what's the calling maybe God's placed on your life right now?
[time=706] I've been having to live this in new ways. My plans, listen, Caleb, my oldest was in kindergarten when we moved here. He's in fifth grade now. We didn't have plans to uproot again.
[time=715] When we came here, our plans was to be here. Let them graduate here. And that's why I wrestled, because it's got like God, I have my list. Remember I talked to you about my list? You got your list too, your list of plans? Sometimes God says go and I'll figure out the stuff, the details that maybe are driving you nuts that you didn't plan out. So what happened to Abraham? So maybe where we're at as a church is definitely where we get sometimes as we follow the great commission.
[time=738] We see Jesus in the calling. Number two, we see Jesus in the covenant. You can't talk about Abraham without talking about what's called theologically speaking, the Abrahamic covenant. And here's what it is. It's a promise. It's a commitment. It's a connection. It's a relationship that God was
[time=754] establishing with Abraham. And in so doing was establishing it with his people. And we'll see
[time=760] that as we continue on. Let's look at verses two and three where we left off. We see Jesus in the covenant. And I'll show you how as we go journey onward. Verse two of Genesis 12. And I will make
[time=771] of you. Here's the promise, the covenant, a great nation. And I will bless you and make your name great so that you will be a blessing. Do you know God blesses us to be a blessing? This is where it all began right with Abraham. Verse three. I'll bless those who bless you and him who dishonors you, I will curse. And in you, all the families of the earth shall be blessed. Father Abraham. We see
[time=792] the covenant that God made with Abraham's taking shape here. Genesis chapter 15 and verse six. We
[time=798] see that God credited to Abraham righteousness. He became a part of the family of God because of
[time=804] his faith, because he believed God. He believed God's covenant. He believed God's promises. So God credited to him righteousness. He made him a part of the family of God. He called Abraham a friend of God. Friend of God. Later I'm going to show you another term that he called Abraham and is probably going to surprise you. But Abraham made a lot of mistakes, but it started with the
[time=825] covenant because God made a promise to an unhealthy, sometimes sinful, big knucklehead like Abraham.
[time=833] You're like can you say that pastor? I think we're all in the same boat and God knew at this why he made these promises to begin with. And it's good for us to acknowledge those things. And I want to take you to Genesis 17. Flip over a few pages. Save your place and Genesis 12 will come back.
[time=846] Genesis 17. We can't talk about another C word that was used to establish and used as a sign of
[time=854] the covenant, a response by the people that would be impacted by the promises of God and Abraham's lineage and Abraham's family and the people, the nation that God was building and its circumcision.
[time=864] Yeah, you can't talk about Abraham without talking about circumcision. There's chapters and sections devoted to that, but it was an establishment, a sign of the covenant that we just read about.
[time=874] So let's read Genesis 17. You'll see a little about that, but you'll see how God now is about to change the name, the identity of Abraham to Abraham. And it's all because of his promises,
[time=885] his faithfulness and his covenant. Genesis 17, verse 1, "And Abraham was 99 years old when the Lord appeared to Abraham and said to him, 'I am God Almighty. Walk before me and be
[time=896] blameless that I may make my covenant between me and you and may multiply you greatly.' Then Abraham
[time=902] fell on his face." Great response. When God comes to us, may we constantly have that posture.
[time=907] "And God said to him, 'Behold, my covenant is with you and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations. No longer shall your name be called Abraham, but your name shall be called Abraham. For I have made you the father of a multitude of nations. I will make you exceedingly
[time=922] fruitful. I will make you into nations and kings shall come from you. And I will establish my covenant
[time=929] between me and you and your offspring after you, throughout their generations, for an everlasting
[time=935] covenant to be God to you and to your offspring after you. And I will give to you and to your
[time=941] offspring after you the land of your sojournings." Remember journeys and sojourns. "All the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God." That was all God's part. Now he says,
[time=953] now you do your part. You respond to this promise, verse 9, and God said to Abraham, I love that it's Abraham because God gave him a new name, new creations in Jesus Christ,
[time=963] 2 Corinthians. We're new and you see that picture of grace with Abraham. He said to him, "As for you,
[time=969] you shall keep my covenant. You and your offspring after you throughout their generations." And God does several things here. He gives this establishment. He's establishing his covenant. He's giving signs of the covenant with things like circumcision and tangible ways that is shown, that it is followed,
[time=985] that is believed, that it is embraced. And he reminds Abraham in the first four verses there
[time=991] of his unchanging character. I'm the God Almighty and we need to be reminded of the unchanging character of God in a world that is changing constantly around us. Am I right about it? We need to be reminded of that and that's what God does with Abraham. Then he changes his name. He makes him a new creation. He gives him a new identity and don't miss that because we're going to see that Abraham doesn't live up to that identity super well. Do you? I know I don't. But God never
[time=1016] changes and he charges him ultimately here. As he reminds him of his promises, he says, "Now you do your part. You respond to my promises and you keep this covenant. You live in this covenant
[time=1027] and you honor me and all that you do. And I'm going to do my part and I'm going to be faithful no matter what." So let me give you two things that we see. There's probably a list of 50 things that we could talk about. Theologically speaking, as we study God about the Abrahamic covenant, but I want to give you two. Number one, write this down. The Abrahamic covenant reminds us that God always keeps his promises. Aren't you glad of that? How many of you have kept every promise
[time=1053] you've ever made? You know, we've just faltered, don't we? But God is a miracle-working, way-making,
[time=1059] promise-keeping God. And his covenant with Abraham reminds us of that fact. And it points us to
[time=1066] people like Paul in the New Testament now, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years later, for 2 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 20, Paul writes this. He says, "For all the promises of God find
[time=1077] their yes in him." That is why, through him, this is Jesus. We see Jesus in the covenant. This is
[time=1083] where we start to see those ties. Through him, we utter our amen. The word amen means may it be so.
[time=1089] We solidify it. We follow it. We believe in it. We put our life around it to God for his glory.
[time=1095] I want to make that personal for a minute. I want to ask you, my brother, my sister, church family, how has God been faithful to you lately? I believe one of the greatest
[time=1106] remedies to discouragement in life. Some of you are here in your discouraged day, you're watching your discouraged today. I believe one of the greatest remedies to discouragement
[time=1115] is just pausing to remember the faithfulness of God. We sang about it earlier. The same
[time=1121] God who did it then will do it again. Why? Because when the world around us is changing,
[time=1127] he remains constant. He never, ever changes. And if he did it then, he'll do it again.
[time=1133] And I know some of you are hurting, and right now you feel like God has abandoned you, and I challenge you this week. Ask yourself, how has God in the writing of his story,
[time=1143] the redemptive story of God, intersected his faithfulness with my story? How has God been
[time=1149] faithful to me? And you've got a list. That list may be buried amongst a lot of other things that
[time=1155] have distracted you from how faithful God is, but the covenant God made with Abraham reminds us
[time=1161] that God keeps his promises, and he's still faithful today. Another thing that the Abrahamic covenant does, write this one down, the Abrahamic covenant paves the way for the new covenant we have in Christ. We live in a new covenant. Jesus called it the law of Christ. He didn't come to abolish the law, the Old Testament laws. He came to fulfill them. And because he fulfilled them, and here's what I mean by fulfill, he lived them out. He was perfect. You and me, we can't do that.
[time=1185] He did it. He is perfect. He has fulfilled the law. That's why we have the law of Christ. He says,
[time=1191] now a new command I'm given to you, John chapter 13, is that you love like I have loved you,
[time=1197] is what he says. As I have loved you, you go do that. He fulfilled it. He set the bar really high,
[time=1203] and now we live in a new covenant. But the thing is, that's what you may wonder, why don't we sacrifice animals like they did? Well, because Jesus, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world, was the ultimate sacrifice, and he fulfilled all of the requirements of the law, and the Abrahamic covenant just points us to and paves the way for the new covenant that God has
[time=1222] with his church, and that is a covenant of grace. It's the same covenant we celebrate and remember and commemorate on days like today when we do communion. Steve did an awesome job leading us through that. It's the bread that represents the body of Christ that was broken for us, the blood that was spilled out for us. Jesus said, do this and remember it's of me. This is the new covenant in my blood. It's a covenant of grace where we couldn't do it. Jesus did it. The finished work of
[time=1249] Jesus gives us grace so that now we have an identity as a part of the family of God, and it causes us to want to look more and more like Jesus and to be a light in a dark, dark world,
[time=1260] and the Abrahamic covenant reminds us of the new covenant. Everything points to Jesus in all
[time=1266] of the Word of God. I'm glad to be a part of that kind of family. You guys glad?
[time=1271] We'd be pretty dead apart from that. Steve read it earlier, Ephesians 2-1, well, you were dead and your trespasses and sins, but God, verse 4 of Ephesians 2, is rich in mercy.
[time=1282] He showed up and he changed everything, and I'm thankful for that, and I want you to see the connection between the covenants. That's what I wanted to point to here today. We see Jesus in the calling of Abraham. We see Jesus in the covenants, and you think of covenants oftentimes as conditional, or covenants that would be conditional, like if you then I, right? That's a covenant.
[time=1303] And you think, well, that's kind of how it read when I read it a little bit ago, but what we learned and I'm about to show you and prove it to you now is that Abraham didn't always hold up his name of the bargain. And so we see that this covenant with Abraham was unconditional.
[time=1315] God kept his promises even though Abraham would not. And that is a picture of grace. That is a picture of Jesus. That is a picture of the new covenant because Abraham's circumstances didn't
[time=1326] always uphold the covenant. And that's number three. Let's look at Jesus in the circumstances.
[time=1331] Number three, Jesus in the circumstances. Abraham had a lot of them. Verse four, go back to Genesis 12 with me real quick. Verse four, let's tie together where we were. Verse four, it says, so Abram,
[time=1342] he was still Abram then, went. You know, he got a lot wrong, but he went. When God said go, he just went. I think that's a good posture for us to have. The answer is yes, Lord. Now, what is the question? So Abram went, as the Lord had told him, and Lot went with him, and Abram was 75 years old when he departed from Huron. And what you're going to find is that
[time=1361] started well this journey, but it didn't continue well in every aspect. Let's look down at verse 11
[time=1368] of Genesis 12. And in a world that was uncertain for Abraham, we can relate. If you notice the news lately, there's wars, gas prices are through the roof. I wonder what the economy is going to do.
[time=1378] We wonder about a lot of things these days, don't we? And we can identify with circumstances that are uncertain and changing and scary sometimes, not if you agree. I know I can. And here's what
[time=1389] Abraham did. He made mistakes. You ever do those things? They tend to follow some of us around,
[time=1395] don't they? Let's look at one of them. Hagar, if you could read about Hagar, I mean, that's quite quite an interesting story that we can read about in Abraham's journey. But I'll just talk to you about his wife, Sarah. Sarah, who became Sarah, and we see verse 11, she's beautiful. That's what we find out. Curtis said that last week, that God's most beautiful creation was women. That's what he said. You should listen back to last week. And I agree. And so did Abraham.
[time=1416] And so here's what we read, verse 11, Genesis 12. When he was about to enter Egypt, he's on his
[time=1422] journey. He said to Sarah, his wife, I know that you are a woman, beautiful in appearance. And when the Egyptians see you, they will say, this is my wife. This is his wife. Then they will kill me, but they will let you live. So do this. Say you're my sister, that it may go well with me because of
[time=1438] you and that my life may be spared for your sake. And then if you flip over to Genesis chapter 20,
[time=1444] Genesis chapter 20, he does it again. He does it again. You ever have reruns of your worst moments
[time=1451] in life? You just kind of keep going back, maybe it's to the same habits, the same addictions, the same sins, maybe the same abusive or unhealthy situations. We keep going back to things. And
[time=1462] well, Abraham did the same thing. And verse two of Genesis 20, we see an Abraham set of Sarah.
[time=1467] She's Sarah now. His wife, she is my sister and Abimalek. King Abimalek is in the country of the
[time=1473] Philistines, an enemy territory here. And Abimalek, king of Garar, sin and took Sarah. And he's taking her into his harem. And then verse three, another but God moment shows up. God meets Abimalek, the king
[time=1484] in a dream. He had not known her or been with her. And he says, you're a dead man. And if God shows
[time=1490] up to you in a dream and says, you're a dead man, you're in the middle of a nightmare, my friend.
[time=1496] And then he tells Abimalek what to do. But I don't want you to miss verse seven. Go down to
[time=1502] verse seven. Genesis chapter 20, verse seven says this. Now then, here's what God's telling Abimalek to do. Return the man's wife, for he is a what? That just doesn't make sense to me. You realize
[time=1514] what's going on, right? He's doing the same sin again. And we find out later, by the way, it's kind of a half truth, kind of a weird story. I told you the Bible's interesting. You thought it was boring, right? The Bible's, it's got all kinds of crazy stuff that'll, that'll keep you interested, but it'll also be something you can relate with. Because this half truth he was using deceptively became a whole lie. And that's what he was doing here. But he says, he is a what again?
[time=1536] I just can't even read that. I mean, if I were him, I'd say he's a big time problem. He's a big
[time=1542] time knucklehead. But he says, all right, this friend of God is a prophet. So that he'll pray for
[time=1548] you and you shall live. But if you do not return her, know that you shall surely die. You and all
[time=1555] who are yours. And so I love the next verse verse eight. It says, he got up early in the morning.
[time=1560] I bet so, right? And did exactly what God said, I'm sure that he did. And what we see here,
[time=1566] and by the way, Sarah would have been at this point in the second round of this sin. She'd have been about 90 years old. Must have been a good looking 90 year old, right? I need some of those
[time=1576] genes, right? Yeah. But here he is again. And I'd written this statement down many years ago as I
[time=1584] just took notes about Abraham's journey because I could relate back then, I can relate again now, and maybe you can too. And it just is something I come back to over and over as I read about Abraham.
[time=1593] Write this down. What I see is that our identity is secure even when our actions are sinful.
[time=1598] His actions were sinful again and again and again. But God kept his promises.
[time=1605] God was faithful and God does the same in us. Our identity is given to us by God. It cannot be
[time=1613] earned. We are saved by grace through faith. He who knew no sin, second Corinthians five,
[time=1619] became sin so that we could become the righteousness of God. We have an identity that is gifted to us
[time=1627] by Jesus. This is Jesus in our circumstances. It's given to us and it is secure. We can't earn it.
[time=1633] Therefore we can't lose it. He gives it. He keeps it secure even when our actions don't look like the identity that we were given. And Abraham reminds us of this picture of Jesus, this picture of grace. His sin was based in fear. I mean, he's afraid. He took things into his own
[time=1649] hand. He's afraid he's going to die. So he just kind of took over. He went back to the same sin, familiarity. You remember the Egyptians? They'll come later. We'll talk about them in the story.
[time=1657] They prayed that God would deliver them from slavery and bondage in Egypt and God sends Moses and he delivers them. And then they get into this unknown season in the wilderness. And what do they say? They grumble and they say, let's just go back to Egypt. At least we know what we get there.
[time=1670] That's what some of us do. That's what Abraham did. And it ends up leading us into this faithless
[time=1676] walk with God where our view of me goes up and the view of God goes down and pride wells up.
[time=1682] And what scripture says may I decrease so he can increase flips. He decreases and I increase.
[time=1689] And then I get myself into a mess. Sometimes the same mess over and over and over again. Can I get an amen? Abraham reminds us of that. But what we see is even through all his highs and his lows,
[time=1701] God says he's a friend of God. He's a prophet. And his identity is secure. God keeps his promises.
[time=1708] God is steady even when our sinfulness in our world is shaky. God is a promise keeping God.
[time=1715] And the best promise keeping moment in his story to me happens in chapter 22. I want us to tie this all together with chapter 22. Meet me there. Genesis chapter 22. I'm going to read the first 14 verses. And I'm not sure you'll find a place in anywhere in the Old Testament that better points to Jesus and has parallels with Jesus than what we see with Isaac. Now you've got to know Isaac is the promised son that Abraham was promised because he said he would be the father of many nations.
[time=1739] You kind of need a son if that's going to happen. And what we find is the first parallel of Isaac and Jesus is both came through supernatural births. Jesus was born of a virgin. Isaac was born of an
[time=1750] old old lady whose childbearing days should be over. But she's born chapter 21. This happens.
[time=1755] And then God asks Abraham to do something quite interesting and unique in chapter 22. Let's read it together. Verse one, after these things, God tested Abraham and said to him, Abraham.
[time=1766] And he said, here I am. He said, take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love. And go to the land of Mariah and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.
[time=1777] So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took his two young men with him and his son, Isaac. He cut the wood for the burnt offering and arose and went to the place of which God had told him. On the third day, who will love this passage? On the third day, you guys can see it already, can't you? On the third day, Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar.
[time=1796] Then Abraham said to his young men, stay here with the donkey and I and the boy will go over there and worship and will come again to you. And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac, his son, and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they were both, went both
[time=1812] of them together. And Isaac said to his father, Abraham, my father. And he said, here I am, my son. He said, behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?
[time=1822] I'd have been asking that too, right? Verse eight, Abraham said, God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son. So they went both of them together. When they came to the place which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac,
[time=1838] his son and laid him on the altar on top of the wood. Then Abraham reached out his hand, took the knife to slaughter his son, but the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, Abraham,
[time=1849] Abraham. And he said, here I am. He said, do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him.
[time=1856] For now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son from me.
[time=1863] And Abraham lifted his eyes and looked and behold, behind him was a ram, underlined that word ram.
[time=1868] That's so significant. It was a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and Abraham went and took the
[time=1874] ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son. So Abraham called the name of the place the Lord will provide. As it is said to this day on the mount of the Lord, it shall be provided.
[time=1887] Whoo, I'm about to get excited folks because listen, there are so many parallels of Jesus in here.
[time=1892] I can't even go through all of them, but I want to point out a few of them. First of all, look at verse 2 and then you see it again in verse 12 and you see it again in verse 16. In verse 2, take your son, your only son. Does that sound familiar? John chapter 3 and verse 16, for God so loved the world that he gave his only son. In the land of Moriah is where they're at,
[time=1913] that's verse 2, and that land is known to be the place where Jerusalem where the temples would be and ultimately the general vicinity of where a hill called Galgotha would be, where Jesus would one day drag his cross. So this place where Isaac is is literally in the same general area where
[time=1930] we know Jesus would one day become the sacrifice for the world. Verse 4, own the third day. You know of anything else that happens on the third day later in scripture? Jesus rises from the dead, own the third day and he looked up and he sees the place that God is showing him. I love verse 5
[time=1946] because he tells the servants that are with him, these young men. He says my son and I are going to go over there, you stay here. And he says we will come again because he believed that they both
[time=1957] would be alive. Even though he knew he was being called to sacrifice his son, he believed God. And in the same way Jesus said I must be put to death, but I will rise again. Whoo, does anybody
[time=1969] else get excited about all this? And that's only halfway through. Let's keep going. In verse number 6 he says Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac, his son. Did you know Jesus would one day have the wood for an offering laid on him? He would carry his wooden cross to a hill called Galgotha where he would be sacrificed for the sin of the world. And we see
[time=1989] him pictured here. Both of the sons submitted to their father. Jesus in the garden of Gethseman he
[time=1995] asked if there's any way the cup that he was about to bear could be taken away from him that God would do that. But he says nevertheless God, not my will, but sure as be done. Scholars
[time=2006] believe that Isaac would have probably been a teenager here. At least he could have outrun his old man, but he submitted to the will of his father. He says to his son verse 8 God will provide
[time=2017] for himself this lamb for the burnt offering. But look at verse 13. What did I have you underline?
[time=2021] What was called in the thicket? A ram. It wasn't a lamb. It was a ram. Why? Why is that significant?
[time=2027] Because John the Baptist would come later. John chapter 1 verse 29 he says he sees Jesus and he says behold the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. And this foreshadowing of Jesus.
[time=2041] Jesus in these circumstances comes from the fact that the lamb had not yet been offered up just yet.
[time=2048] A ram was there because the lamb was on his way and his name is Jesus. And we see him pictured in
[time=2055] all of these circumstances. And then we see the picture of the character of God and what Abraham names the place in verse 14. Jehovah Jaira. You can write that down. Jehovah Jaira means the Lord our provider. And God indeed did provide. He provided his son, his only son,
[time=2071] to be the perfect sacrifice for our sin. I'm glad Jesus is in all the details. Can I get an amen?
[time=2078] And we see it in this story. Let's tie it together with a statement. Here's what Abraham's journey shows us. Write this down. Abraham's journey shows us that God uses ordinary, or you could scratch it out and say knucklehead, crazy, whatever you call yourself people. God uses ordinary people
[time=2093] to do extraordinary things for eternal purposes. So I want to give you two questions to ask
[time=2099] yourself this week as we tie it together. Jesus in the calling, the covenant, and even the circumstances.
[time=2104] Abraham's and yours. Number one, how are you finding Jesus in your circumstances? Look for him this week.
[time=2109] He'll make himself known. Cry out to him. Number two, how will you share Jesus by following your calling?
[time=2116] Your calling. Just like Abraham had one, God's calling you to take a step. What step is he calling you to take? I want to tell you today is a step worth taking. I want to ask you to buy your heads and ponder today what step God is calling you to take. Believers, what is God doing? What is God showing you? What step has he laid out in front of you? Some of you right now are watching. You're in
[time=2137] the room, though, as believers are praying. You would say, I just don't know I have a personal relationship with Jesus. We're all sinners and we all fall short of God's glory. Jesus came. He is
[time=2146] the Lamb of God who came to take away the sin of the world. And today can be the day of your salvation.
[time=2151] Why? Because he paid the price you could never pay after living the sinless life you could never live. He rose from the dead so that moments of victory just like this could happen where you could receive him as Lord and Savior. In your own words right now will you pause and just ask Jesus to
[time=2166] forgive you to save you. Let him know you believe he is who he says he is. That he died and that he is alive and you shall be saved. Will you take your next step right now?
