[time=0] I want to preach a message to you today about Moses this week and next week We're building off of where we've been looking at the life of Joseph and today I want to start a little two-part mini series just built on the life of Moses 10 life lessons from Moses 10 life lessons from Moses
[time=16] Will be an Exodus chapter 2 today, and don't worry. This is part one I'm gonna give you five today and five next week. I don't have a 10-point sermon But I do over these next couple of weeks So go to Exodus chapter number two and I want to give you to start before I start with those life lessons a
[time=33] Timeline of Moses life a timeline of Moses life kind of break that apart the way I try to remember it is 340 year segments
[time=40] He dies at the age of 120 Deuteronomy 34 and verse 6 tells us that and so in those three forty year segments
[time=48] Some key benchmarks happen But before I give you those to help you remember it Exodus chapter 1 to connect us back to Joseph I shared a message with you about Joseph last week. Joseph has led the people of God the nation of Israel
[time=60] Into Egypt and that is where they are and Joseph at this point in Exodus Joseph and all of his generation have now died and the king Pharaoh Doesn't care about or remember or really know anything much about the descendants and the generation
[time=76] That was Joseph's and we know that because he sees Exodus chapter 1 and verse 7 that the Israelites have multiplied and
[time=84] Exodus 1 7 says the land was filled with them to combat his fear of the growing number of the population of God's nation
[time=93] He ordered that the baby boys the firstborn those boys would be killed. It's a very dark time and now enter Moses
[time=101] This is when Moses comes on to the scene So we're gonna look at ten life lessons we can learn from him But let's talk about this timeline it starts with this these two B words baby boy. I'll give you three sets of these baby boy
[time=113] He's born and he's born into that season. He's born into a season. Listen where he Should have been one of the baby boys to be killed But God But God shows up but God had different plans. Exodus chapter 2 we see Moses was born doomed
[time=129] But he was delivered to become a deliverer That would ultimately point to the ultimate deliverer who is Jesus Christ. He's a baby boy
[time=139] He's born and then at 40 years of age here's the second benchmark right this down It is the big blunder how many of you got some of those in your life?
[time=146] Can I get an amen in the house a big blunder? Well, he had a huge blunder. He murdered an Egyptian we're gonna read that story here in just a minute We know that he was 40 years old when this happens. So he's born baby boy 40 years old he has a big blunder and he goes from Egypt where he has all this prosperity to Midian and we're gonna read about that and then at the age of 80 we see that he runs into God's presence through a burning bush and
[time=171] God changes everything Exodus 2 is where we see those first two and then the burning bush is actually where we're gonna pick up next week And so Acts chapter 7 for all of you Bible scholars that want to dig a little deeper this week Acts chapter 7 verses 23 and 30 you say how do you know how old he was that he was 40 here and 80 here
[time=190] Acts chapter 7 tells us that verses 23 and 30 you can read that this week And he dies Deuteronomy 34 verse 6 at the age of a hundred and twenty some of the things that happen later
[time=201] He has a lot of excuses Exodus 4 chapters 5 through 7 deliverance. We learn requires waiting the P word
[time=208] I call it patience They all have to have patience the 10 plagues happen Exodus 7 through 11 the Passover that pictures Jesus comes into play and Exodus 12 13 and 14 the Passover continues as does the
[time=220] Exodus and now the parting of the Red Sea perhaps you know the story of Moses because of that they left Egypt and God
[time=226] delivers them through Moses and they run into the Red Sea and God parts the Red Sea and they walk across it on dry land
[time=232] Then we have Moses song the wandering in the wilderness bread from heaven water from the rock
[time=238] Jethro's leadership advice Mount Sinai all the way through chapter 19 chapter 20 is the 10 commandments God gives them through
[time=246] Moses and as they're building this season of waiting for the temple and what that's going to look like then Moses is hearing from the Lord and Aaron and the people get restless maybe you get restless and they build a golden calf
[time=257] Exodus chapter 32 I believe it is and then as those Continuations continue getting ready for this season of the temple the tabernacle then chapter 37 becomes the ark of the covenant or the 10
[time=268] Commandments are stored and if your head spinning you're like me like man I wish God would just do one or two of those little bitty things like that in my life All of this is the life of Moses and you can remember him through the baby boy who ended up having a big blunder
[time=282] Who hears from God with a burning bush and to follow were some of the greatest years of his life So let's dig in now to what I will call 10 life lessons for Moses Give you 10 of them. Let's start with the first five today The first one comes from Exodus chapter 2 will read the first nine Verses if you're ready for the word give somebody a fist bump. Say let's go Let's dig in together today. Exodus chapter 2 verse 1 Now a man from the house of Levi went and took as his wife a Levi woman The woman conceived and bore a son when she saw that he was a fine child She hid him three months now Why does she do that because of the order of the king Pharaoh here and all these baby boys?
[time=321] So she hid him verse 3 when she could not when she could hide him no longer She took for him a basket made of bull rushes and daubed it with Benjamin and pitch She put the child in it and placed it among the reeds by the river man And as his sister stood at a distance to know what would be done to him now The now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bay that the river while her young woman Walked beside the river. She saw the basket among the reeds and she sent her servant woman and she took it When she opened it she saw the child and behold the baby was crying I would be crying too if I went on a river ride like that one But here's Moses. She took pity on him and said this is one of the Hebrews children Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter Shall I go and call you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?
[time=369] Look at God's hand in this story verse 8 and Pharaoh's daughter said to her go So the girl went and called the child's mother Moses mother and Pharaoh's daughter said to her
[time=379] Take this child away and nurse him for me and I will give you your wages So the woman took the child and nursed him and will pause there for just a minute because there's so much that just happened there
[time=390] And I'm gonna give you point number one and I'm gonna tell you it's probably the longest sermon point Maybe I've ever given you but here it is you ready for it?
[time=396] Write this one down and I'm gonna need a second to do it number one We learn from these verses God will place you wherever he wants you However, he wants to get you there over around or through anyone or anything in the way and all guys people said
[time=411] That is true, and we see it in the life of Moses notice what's happening here. He's supposed to be
[time=417] Murdered he's supposed to be killed he ends up in a river in a basket and God alone
[time=423] Orchestrates that the very king through whom all of this stuff is happening that he shouldn't be there now
[time=429] his daughter sees him and his daughter makes sure that from Pharaoh's own treasury that the mother of
[time=436] Moses is paid to nurse him and care for him God will place you wherever he wants you and
[time=444] He'll put you there however he wants to get you there He'll do it over around and through anything and anyone he needs to do to put you where he wants you
[time=453] I'm glad to know that today God is on the throne my friends. He is in control He is sovereign even though the world and your circumstances in mind may make us feel like he is not
[time=467] Moses has gone now from doomed to delivered to now become a deliverer to point us to the ultimate deliverer who is
[time=473] Jesus and I want to help you remember this and I want to introduce you to a friend of mine. Here he is you ready for him. Here he is
[time=481] All right, and you're like what in the world's this guy you think in ten plagues pastor This is the wrong passage the plagues hadn't come just yet, and you're exactly right I'm not showing you this guy because of the ten plagues the frogs Plague is not where I'm going. This is elite frog We're gonna call him mr. leap frog And I hope you this week are reminded of this truth that God places you wherever he wants you However, he wants to get you there and you're gonna remember this picture Let me tell you a story to tell you why I chose a frog for this There is a mentor of mine. His name is Bill Purvis. He has been the pastor of a church called Cascade Hills Church in Columbus, Georgia
[time=513] And back when I was 21 years old I was about to turn 21, but Jessica and I were married and and she reached out to him I had listened to these things called CDs you guys remember those they were leadership CDs I had this huge stack of leadership CDs that my dad actually used to give me and it was from Bill Purvis
[time=532] And I'd listen to all of them I just thought he was awesome looked up to him and never had met him But Jessica for my 21st birthday just sent him an email took a shot in the dark and said hey my husband really loves you
[time=542] He's listened to probably all of your leadership CDs and I'm sure for his 21st birthday He would love to meet you. We come to wherever you are She didn't tell me this and he emailed back and said sure Let's meet up he named a place and we met up and it was just one of the coolest things ever and he's been a friend and mentor Of mine ever since so if you ever hear this I love you my brother But here's something that he did and that time so here's where I was in my life I was 21 I was full-time and seminary taking 15 credit hours. I was full-time in construction to pay the bills
[time=569] I was a part-time Marketplace chaplain and I was part-time in ministry and we all know that ministries never part-time whether you're paid a dollar or not
[time=579] You're all in full-time ministry, but even when you're paid to do some it's full-time too, and I was married Thankfully, I didn't have kids at the time because I just thought I was Superman Got this and you're like you're nuts, and now I look back and I'm like man. I was nuts And you know what Bill Pervis told me you're nuts he sat down and I had all these questions that I wanted to ask him and and He walked me through the goals the dreams that just asked me questions about what God's placed in my heart
[time=606] And he helped me get my priorities in order But he kind of picked up on something that I was struggling with and you know what it was me My biggest struggle in my life at that time was me You know what my biggest struggle in my life at this time is me You know what your biggest struggle in your life at this time of your life probably is probably you But it definitely was mine, and I didn't think God would ever be able to do something with a guy like me He called me into ministry. I'd always said I'd never be a pastor like my dad guys. I very reluctantly said yes But he spoke to me some truth that I hope this leapfrog will help you remember. Here's what he said to me
[time=641] He said Kevin God will leapfrog you over around and through anything and anyone to put you wherever he wants to put you in your life believe it and
[time=653] I've held on to that And I think God for those kind of moments, you know Or somebody believes in you more than maybe you believe in yourself or maybe somebody believes God
[time=665] over your life a little more than you believe God in your life and so as you Walk through your life this week be reminded that God will leapfrog you to put you wherever he wants To put you where whenever however he wants to put you there I'm glad of that and some of you right now. I have just given up I believe that on the notion that God could use somebody like you you've got some I words because I'm my biggest problem
[time=688] I came up with some I words that maybe you can relate with maybe it's inadequacy I'm just inadequate inadequacy Insecurity you all have those your insecurities or something that the enemy uses in your life over and over again instability
[time=701] Maybe your circumstances have led you to a place of instability where you feel like they just preclude me from anything God could do Maybe it's infertility and just you feel not only barren in your ability to bear children But in your life and it's impacted you in many kind of ways inability in ability in your life
[time=717] Maybe it's incompetence all over and over I hear people say well, I'm just not smart enough. I don't have the education
[time=723] I don't have the abilities. I don't I can't speak well. I don't have the confidence I can't whatever it might be insufficiencies. Now look at your neighbor and tell them say you've got some insufficiency Just let them know go on and tell them right now. They need to hear it I know it's gonna be hard for them to hear but just let them hear it now you get to look them back right now and say yeah, you too We all do but I want to give you the most important I word you ready for it
[time=745] Identity Identity because here's what God will do in this leapfrog moment in your life God wants to remind you in this moment that your identity in Jesus will far surpass all of the
[time=758] Inabilities all of the inadequacies all of the i-words or any other word that hold you back that the enemy is using to steal
[time=765] Kill devour and destroy the work of God in your life to feed you lies that you've been believing your
[time=771] Identity in Jesus is the foundation is the truth upon which God will leapfrog you over around and through
[time=779] Anything and anyone to put you wherever he wants you. However, he wants to put you there Believe it hold on to it this week No that no matter what life throws your way got to put you where he wants to put you Moses reminds us of that Let's read verse 10 cuz from verse 10. We'll see the second truth So it says when the child grew up she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son She named him Moses because she said I drew him out of the water and that leads us to point number two
[time=809] Life lesson about Moses is that God's deliverance usually requires divine disturbance Now Pharaoh's daughter Pharaoh Moses mother Moses didn't have any plans at this point of his life but everybody around Moses had a lot of plans and We all know that we need some deliverance and there was certainly a feeling of that in this season
[time=829] But it's those divine disturbances those interruptions. You ever have any interruptions It's got ever divinely disrupt and disturb at your plans you got your list This is how supposed to go But then God just changes everything or God uses something that you thought changes everything for the worse And then God uses it for the good. Well, that is exactly what's happening in the life of Moses In fact his name in Hebrew it literally means to draw out To draw there's some foreshadowing in there because just as Moses was drawn out of the water
[time=858] He's named a draw out a deliverer. He's to deliver. He is to draw out He would be called by God and used by God to deliver to draw God's people out of Egypt and ultimately point to the ultimate deliverer
[time=869] Who is Jesus? And I'm thankful that his story reminds us listen not to ignore not to ignore
[time=876] The disturbances the divine interruptions in our life God often sends detours Disruptions disturbances and uses them as avenues of deliverance. There was a horrible wreck yesterday on 469
[time=890] I was out driving and thankful I was on the other side, but man I just prayed that it looked terrible So I don't know if you know anybody hope you lift them up But I was thinking about I had to take a big detour to come back and I felt kind of inconvenienced You know how you realize like man That was petty of me to even feel disturbed in that moment and it was like man I need to get on back home and I didn't want to take the long way and thankfully in Fort Wayne There's like 30 different ways to go everywhere and so I you know found my way home and I was just fine But I've got to thinking about my petty feeling of feeling disturbed and then I thought about the people who Were in that wreck. I bet they didn't plan to be in a hospital I don't know Lord Lord knows what's going on there And I pray for them and I lift them up in this moment But I thought about all of us I thought about this point some of you are on a detour right now Some of you have a very big disturbance in your life You didn't know you're gonna have that health diagnosis you didn't know you're gonna have to walk with a family member Who is gonna go through such a tough time? You didn't know that you're gonna have such a relational problem. You didn't know Fill in the blank, but this disturbance listen is something that God wants to use to do divine things to bring about divine
[time=948] purposes in your life and Moses story reminds us of that his name alone reminds us of That when God disturbs our plans listen this week look for his deliverance Look for what he's trying to do to bring some deliverance to bring some purpose in and through your life because God's greatest
[time=964] Invitations the things he invites us into They'll often come from the biggest interruptions that happen in our life Here's a prayer our staff prays together quite often that maybe you could try out this week as well But don't pray it listen warning don't pray it unless you mean it because I've prayed this prayer before and God has followed through and done
[time=981] Exactly what I prayed for I'll often pray something like this God interrupt my schedule today To help me stay on your path your purpose your plans God interrupt my schedule
[time=992] Sometimes he will sometimes it will be disturbances that we will often have the do not disturb sign on the door of our life
[time=999] Well, God will often rip it down and so be aware But also know this those moments God will use in big ways now in Moses life
[time=1008] He gets real human you ever get real human your humanity shows will so does Moses verses 11 through 14
[time=1015] He's grown now and he makes a big mistake. This is the big blunder part that I was walking you through a minute ago Let's read together verse 11 one day when Moses had grown up He went out to his people and looked on their burdens He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew one of his people. He looked this way and that you ever do that?
[time=1032] He did and seeing no one he struck down the Egyptian hit him in the sand when he went out the next day
[time=1039] Behold two Hebrews were struggling together. They're fighting and he said to the man in the wrong Why do you strike your companion? He answered who made you prince judge over us
[time=1049] Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian boom, right?
[time=1054] Can you imagine Moses face in that moment then Moses was afraid and thought surely the thing is
[time=1061] Known pause there for a minute because from those verses. I'll give you number three here And it's that temporary emotional decisions can have permanent Consequences and I want to talk to two groups of people for a minute about this as we read these verses and we look at his
[time=1076] Temporary is emotional decision. Listen kind of from a good place a decent motive He didn't want an Egyptian to be beating on a person that it comes from the same bloodline the same people that he had come from
[time=1088] I mean maybe pure motives But what he did with it didn't really work out so well as a temporary emotional decision to do something wrong That now had permanent consequences that would follow him all of his life two groups of people I believe are here you're dealing with your own permanent consequences temporary emotional decisions that you made in the past
[time=1105] And you're dealing with those point number four is for you So hang in there with me for just a second But I'll go on and tell you notice that Moses never finds God giving up on him because of this decision God still does amazing things through him The second group of people are people and that's probably all of us that we're in a process right now of making poor decisions
[time=1125] Temporary decisions based on emotions that may just end up having permanent consequences that will follow us around all of our lives
[time=1133] So these temporary emotional decisions I want to give you now some signs that you're making them some signs that you're making poor decisions you ready for them Here they are four of them. They come from verses 12 and 14 verse 12 We see that Moses look this way and that way seeing no one then he killed the Egyptians number one you're being sneaky
[time=1151] This is a sign you're making poor decisions. Are you sneaking around about something right now?
[time=1156] And this is what Moses did. Here's what some of us look like And then we go And any time you find yourself having to be sneaky It's a good sign that you're making decisions that may just have permanent consequences You don't want to continue in continuing in verse 12. We see the second thing. You're hiding things You're hiding things. What did Moses do? He killed the Egyptian and then he buried him in the sand
[time=1182] He covered him up. He was covering things up and some of you right now these two they characterized your life You're looking at things you shouldn't be looking at you're talking to people in ways You shouldn't be talking to them and people maybe that you should stay away from if you're married you're having these conversations You're looking at things on computer screens or smartphones or you're engaging in problems You're stealing and nobody's caught you and you're sneaking or whatever It may be you fill in the blank you're having to be sneaky about it And then you're having to cover it up and then your cover up starts to cover you up And you feel covered by it and the shame and the guilt is now riding around with you
[time=1217] And it's becoming a permanent consequence based on these temporary emotional Decisions that you are making you're being sneaky and you're hiding things hoping that number three won't happen But it's going to happen and here's number three you're being exposed in verse 14 Moses is called out He says what are you who are you a judge or who made you prince and judge over us?
[time=1235] What are you gonna do you gonna kill me like you killed that Egyptian?
[time=1238] Right the big drum dramatic turn of events there and Moses now knows like I'm being found out
[time=1245] I'm being exposed and scripture reminds us that all the stuff we do in the dark is gonna come to light It's gonna come to light and so today. I'm gonna give you some steps to help you move forward so that you don't have to do number four
[time=1255] Here's another indicator as if you needed another one. You're living in fear verse 14. It says Moses was afraid
[time=1261] He said surely this thing is now known. I've been found out. I've been Exposed and I don't know where you're at or how these things strike you today But I want to challenge you don't let a temporary problem because listen your problems They'll go away everything we face in this life. They're temporary They feel really big in the moment, but in the grand scheme. They're very temporary don't let a temporary problem lead to permanent consequences
[time=1284] Don't make a permanent decision based on some temporary emotions in the middle of a temporary problem
[time=1290] So I want to give you some steps if this is you here you are kind of being sneaky You're covering things up Maybe you've been exposed. Maybe you feel like you're going to be exposed the stuff you're doing in the darks coming to light And that's the true test of integrity by the way if you want to know if this is you what do you do when no one's looking?
[time=1309] When you have idle time Idle hands nothing to do nobody's looking in on you What is life like for you a lot of times? That's when these things happen. We get sneaky we hide things
[time=1320] And we end up exposed and we live in fear that we're gonna get exposed again or that exposure is gonna cause this or that
[time=1326] And here's some steps for you to take you ready for them very simple We got two benchmarks in our home as parents and we certainly will have it all figured out and when these will probably change But for right now our season of life based on all of the mentorship and all of the stuff we've read and studied honor and honesty
[time=1340] Honor and honesty. These are two benchmarks in our home We honor God and we honor each other but the second one's what I want to help you with for just a minute It's honesty and they know our kids will tell you Cali's in the room I won't I won't put her on the spot because I told her I'd never do that unless I got her permission first I didn't but Cali would tell you and she would nail it. I can just about promise you is when we lie everything gets and
[time=1361] They will finish it and they'll say worse when we tell I and it's true Everything gets worse when we tell a lie never gets better. It always gets worse. So we just value honesty
[time=1372] It's I want to give you three ways. You can be honest number one be honest with God Be honest with God get honest with God if this characterizes you temporary emotional decisions are leading to permanent consequences
[time=1382] Currently, or they already have get honest with God. Come here for a minute. Come here. I'll tell you a secret You want to know what it is? He already knows your secrets And here's the good news. He still owes you anyway He's never given up on you. He already knows your secrets. So be honest with God number two get honest with yourself
[time=1403] You how many of you self-talk people in the room you self-talker I have to talk to myself all the time I'm a knucklehead guys man. I'm my biggest problem all the time anybody anybody with me You your biggest problem with me, too And I have to tell myself the enemies using all these lies and I have to say Kevin let's get it together Stop believing what the enemy's telling you you got to focus on Jesus in this situation stop focusing on yourself
[time=1425] I got to tell myself these days So maybe you need to get honest with yourself have some self-talk really you read the songs a lot of self-talk in those
[time=1432] Things and I love those songs because I can so relate get honest with God get honest with yourself
[time=1438] Here's where it gets a little harder number three get honest with somebody else. It starts with one person Then we hope it can turn into a life group We often say around here we believe in the circles more than the rows because a row can't know a row can't know what you're going through
[time=1451] They don't know what your list looks like what you're being sneaky about or what help that you need in your life support systems
[time=1457] That you need to have so get honest with somebody else start with one person and get into a circle get into a life group
[time=1463] We call them. We love to help people with that so that you can have health and help when you need it because you are not meant to do this life
[time=1470] Alone, so that's a good remedy to those temporary decisions. All right, so let's keep going I hope that is helpful to each of you wherever you're at if you can identify with Moses get on us with God You and somebody else and we'd love to help you with that process and let's see what happens with Moses after this Terrible thing happens in his life. I love verse 15 because I can relate to it so much
[time=1491] That's a three verse 15 when Pharaoh heard of him He sought to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and stayed in the land of Midian and
[time=1500] Circle this next part and he sat down by a well He sat down by well He ran and he had good reason to run but he ran and so point number four here is when you run from your problems. They follow you
[time=1514] You ever run from your problems?
[time=1517] Here's the problem with running from your problems. You show up wherever you go And so do your problems and I think of Moses in this moment. He sat down at a well
[time=1527] I wonder some of you right now
[time=1537] Metaphorically you're sitting down you're sitting in a church building or you sitting on a couch or wherever you're at and you're watching this But metaphorically speaking spiritually speaking you sat down at your well The Midian I well I wonder what's going through Moses mind. Think about it. He's come from Egypt He had everything afforded to him everything. He had it made and now Pharaoh The Pharaoh whose house he lived in his riches. He enjoyed it. It's trying to kill him And now he's in this strange land Midian and he sits down at this well and wonder what's going through his mind
[time=1572] I'm guessing it's something like this. Well, there goes my life There goes any hope of me having a future. He had good reason to flee I mean Pharaoh's trying to kill him He's trying to survive But I'm guessing he felt something like this that all sense of hope and purpose and future that I could have had
[time=1589] I left it back in Egypt So now here I said at this strange well I'm guessing you probably felt like giving up. Maybe he did give up some of you right now are seated at a well
[time=1600] And you just feel like giving up Today's message is for you. You're trying to run perhaps from your problems But here's the thing a couple of things happened at the well that I want to encourage you with first of all He sat down at the well and his problems followed him He ran from his problems, but his problems problems as problems were seated with him at the well And that's the problem with me every time I sit down in my sorrow and grief and pain I'm there and therefore my problems are there. You just can't get away from yourself. Can I get a name in?
[time=1630] Moses felt that and he sat down at this well and two things were there with him His problems were there with him now. They're even worse But there's a second thing that Moses probably didn't feel at the well His problems were seated there with him, but so was his God And he didn't feel it in that moment and I'm just guessing maybe you can relate Maybe you sit down at the wells of your life and you don't feel the presence of God right now
[time=1656] You feel like he's a million miles away But I want to remind you today that as Moses sat down at that well as he sat there in his sorrow As he sat there in his grief as he sat there feeling like life as he knew it was over that there's no God No thing know how no way that anybody could do anything with him His life as he knew it has come to an end his God sat there with him And it was at this very moment that God began to prepare him for the miracles That would come his way at this very moment this low moment of sitting down at the well
[time=1689] God has now poised now God has poised Moses to depend on him in a new way to trust him in a new way
[time=1696] So that he could do miracles in his life and through his life My friend God has not given up on you and at your well. He sits there with you
[time=1708] Your problems do too, but your God doesn't give up on you. He's now poised Moses forget this though another 40 years
[time=1717] For all of you who thought we're gonna talk about God's time and next week God's timing you ever struggle with God's timing All of you who think you're too old don't miss next week because God now entered Moses From verse 15 into this season of preparing him for the greatest miracles. He'd ever do through his life
[time=1733] And so let's keep reading Let's read through the end of the chapter knowing that as our problems follow us our God stays with us as well verse 16
[time=1740] Let's continue on says now the priest of Midian had seven daughters and they came and drew water and filled the troughs
[time=1746] to water their father's flock the shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and saved them and
[time=1752] Watered their flock when they came home their father Ruelle said how is it that you have come home so soon today?
[time=1759] They said in Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and even drew water for us and watered the flock
[time=1765] And he said to his daughters then where is he?
[time=1767] Why have you left the man call him that he may eat bread and Moses was content to dwell with the man
[time=1774] And he gave his gave Moses his daughters a porah She gave birth to a son and he called his name Gershim for he said I have been a sojourner in a foreign land verse 23
[time=1785] During those many days the king of Egypt died Remember God will leapfrog you over around and through this was a threat to his life and God has spared Moses yet again
[time=1795] From these kings who wanted to kill him he died And the people of Israel groan because of their slavery and cried out for help and their cry for rescue came From slavery came up to God and God heard their groaning and God remembered his covenant with Abraham with Isaac and with Jacob
[time=1811] Verse 25. I love this verse God saw the people of Israel and God knew and God knew and I want to remind you today and God knew you He knew them he knew Moses he met him at the well when he sat down by well and God knows
[time=1832] You and from that I want to remind you of one last truth before we tie our time together to number five
[time=1838] God's greatest work in our lives often comes out of our greatest weakness When I am weak then I am made strong all this stuff that happens through Moses here in this
[time=1849] Continuation of his story came at his weakest moment came off of verse 15 came at a time where he's at Midian He didn't know anything about Midian. Why am I at Midian? He came from Egypt, but here he is and in the Midian of his life
[time=1862] At the well of his life Excuse me God uses it. He uses his weakness Y'all just get me all choked up today
[time=1877] Katie to the rescue. Thank you, Katie
[time=1884] God uses us in our weakest moments Sometimes we focus on what maybe we don't have. What's your thing? I wonder what's your thing?
[time=1894] What's your thing that if I could just speak better if I had more confidence if I was smarter if I blank, what's your thing and
[time=1902] I've wondered if all the people in scripture and in history
[time=1909] We're given their thing You know, what would happen? I think Paul may have not written some of those things down David would have been bigger than Goliath Can you imagine and then you know what we miss?
[time=1923] We miss a really strong God who showcases his strength on the foundation of the weaknesses a very frail fragile
[time=1930] people sometimes in our life It's just as important to note what we feel like God left out of our life than what he put in God will take your weaknesses and he did this with Moses Moses is at the worst point of his life the lowest moment of his life
[time=1946] And he uses his weakness to showcase his strength And he also uses Moses and uses those weaknesses to help him do toothpaste to rely on God and to rely on other people
[time=1956] To rely on God and to rely on other people Moses speaking ability that he would make excuses about later He never as far as we see in scripture never got much better at it But you know what God did he used Aaron and Aaron's in the Bible and Aaron's a part of this story because of a weakness of Moses
[time=1972] And all of those things came together to work for good for those that God loves and calls according to his
[time=1979] Purposes and this is exactly what God wants to do in your life. So write down this question to ponder this week What is it that God has called you to do that you don't feel equipped to accomplish?
[time=1988] What is it that God's called you to do that you don't feel equipped to accomplish whatever it is this week as you sit down at
[time=1996] Your wells as you determine the cycles of decision-making that maybe you've been going down a bad path with lately
[time=2003] Maybe you're dealing with things in your past Moses can relate I want to challenge you this week to know that God will even take your weaknesses He called me to preach and now's this kid who couldn't speak right and and some of you you're like
[time=2017] I mean all I've ever known you to do is speak in front of people on you I mean you're not so great, but you do alright every now and then right it's like but you've all you've never seen is this But Jessica will tell you I couldn't do that she watched that young kid. I couldn't even look somebody in the eye I couldn't have a conversation in a in a small group much less get in front of a large group and God called me to preach and
[time=2035] Anybody who knows me there've been times where I was like God's called me to preach and they didn't know I was a pastor and they're like no Simmy a link. I don't believe you What because God takes listen He takes knuckleheads like me and Moses and you and all these people that don't have what it takes and he builds on the
[time=2053] Foundation and the platform of their weaknesses to do things that showcases strength even through people like Moses and even through people like you and me
[time=2061] So what is God called you to do that you don't feel equipped for next week?
[time=2066] We're gonna continue talk about the timing and how he brings some of those things about in Moses life and yours I want you to come back but in the meantime ask yourself this question this week I dare you to ask God to interrupt to disturb your schedule and I believe he's gonna do some great things I want to ask you by your heads to close your eyes for just a moment wherever you're at today I know that God's got a special work. He's doing in your life believers. What's that step that God's called you to take?
[time=2089] Ask him right now. He's gonna show you. He's gonna help you. He's gonna bring some deliverance through the disturbances of your life
[time=2097] Some of you right now though would say I just don't know that if I were to die today I would spend eternity with God in heaven today. I want to tell you the gospel is very simple that you are a sinner
[time=2107] And your sin separates you from God. That's why God sent forth Jesus. He lived the perfect life You could never live He died to pay a price for your sin that you could never pay And he rose again because he lives you can have eternal life. Pray something like this in your heart to him Say Jesus. I know I'm a sinner and I need you. I deserve eternal death But I know you all for eternal life Thank you for dying for me Thank you for rising again. I believe it with all my heart I turn from my old way of thinking and I turn to you. I trust you I surrender to you For my salvation I give you me right now in your own words. We cry that out to Jesus as we all reflect And ultimately respond to what God is calling us to do in this very moment. Take a moment do that right now
