[time=0] Today I wanna talk to you about the earthquake of Easter.
[time=4] The earthquake of Easter.
[time=5] If you got your Bibles, then meet me in Matthew chapter 27.
[time=9] Matthew 27 is where we'll start.
[time=10] The resurrection is actually in Matthew chapter 28.
[time=13] We're talking about this theme of all access.
[time=16] And to walk us through that today, I wanna talk to you about some earthquakes that happened around Easter.
[time=22] And here's the thing, I know many of you come and you're here maybe because it's Easter, because someone compelled you maybe forcefully to join us or to watch online wherever you're at today.
[time=33] And especially for those of you who are my skeptical friends, because listen, I doubted my faith for many years.
[time=40] I was a PK and I wrestled with the question and PK's a pastor's kid, I was a preacher's kid.
[time=46] And I thought that, and I'm just believing this stuff because somebody told me to believe it.
[time=51] Then I researched it for myself.
[time=53] And here's what I found out, and I wanna share it with you today, that if the resurrection is real, then its implications is eternal forever.
[time=62] Implications are for all of us, like it or not, if the resurrection is real.
[time=68] And for those of you who may be our skeptical about that, there is a sermon that is linked in your sermon notes.
[time=73] You can find that online, however you're watching us online.
[time=76] You can find that, you can access that through our website, wherever you get our sermon notes.
[time=80] And there is a link to a sermon where we walk through the verifiable evidence, both biblical, extra-biblical, archeological, historical, going beyond just what the Bible says about the resurrection.
[time=91] I would invite you to give that a listen and to dig in the way that I did, and you know what I found?
[time=96] The more I dug, the more I found Jesus.
[time=98] And I believe you're gonna see the same thing today.
[time=101] I wanna talk you through today three earth-shaking moments.
[time=104] Three earth-shaking moments, three earthquakes, if you will.
[time=109] And the first one comes from the death of Jesus, going back to Matthew 27.
[time=113] And we have a little thing around here, we ask everybody if we're ready for the word.
[time=117] And if you are, if you're ready for the word, give somebody a fist bump, both in the room, at home, wherever you're at.
[time=121] You ready for the word today, church?
[time=123] He is risen.
[time=124] Let's talk about this first earthquake.
[time=126] Comes from verse 50, verses 50 through 54 of Matthew chapter 27.
[time=132] Let's dig in.
[time=133] It says, "And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit and behold, the curtain of the temple was torn into from top to bottom.
[time=143] And the earth shook, here's our first earthquake.
[time=145] And the rocks were split.
[time=147] The tombs were also open and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection.
[time=154] They went into the holy city and appeared to many." We skip that part a lot of times, we forget.
[time=158] The power of the resurrection, look at verse 54.
[time=161] This is where some internal implications start to take place when the centurion and those who were with him keeping watch over Jesus saw the earthquake and what took place.
[time=171] They were filled with awe and said, "Truly, this was the son of God." Earthquake number one, write this down.
[time=178] Is when Jesus died, we just read about that.
[time=182] He said, "It is finished to tell us died." Means paid in full.
[time=187] And he said, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit." And he dropped his head and he breathed his last.
[time=195] Now, the Bible tells us, history shows us that this is a real event and for there to be a resurrection, there has to be a death.
[time=202] Jesus died and darkness was over the land at that time.
[time=206] When he died was about 3 p.m.
[time=207] There was darkness over the land and when he died and he'd given up his spirit.
[time=211] There was an earthquake, the earth shook.
[time=213] And when the earth shook, there was a veil in the temple.
[time=216] And this veil in the temple was a big veil, it was a big curtain.
[time=219] The temple represented and housed the presence of God in this era.
[time=224] There was a place called the Holy of Holies.
[time=226] It was the innermost part of the temple.
[time=228] There were curtains before that, but the big curtain was right before that.
[time=231] Even the high priest, and there's only one high priest, it's not all the priests.
[time=236] A high priest could only enter the Holy of Holies, which represented the very presence of God only once a year on the day of atonement.
[time=245] And he would have to go through all kind of rituals and routines and rigorous details, even to enter into the Holy of Holies to go through that curtain once a year.
[time=254] Now, that curtain as we study in history, and we learn both in the Bible from the details of the temple, and we learn throughout history about the curtain that was made.
[time=264] We know that, let's look at Matthew 2751.
[time=267] Here's where we're at.
[time=269] Let's read it real quick for I'll tell you about it.
[time=270] At that, read it with me.
[time=272] At that moment, it was a big moment.
[time=276] At that moment, the veil, the curtain in the temple was torn from top to bottom.
[time=282] And it represents how God came down to man, from top to bottom.
[time=287] Not from bottom to top, where we did the work, he did the work, so it was top to bottom.
[time=291] And this curtain was known to be at least some 60 feet high, some 30 feet wide, 15 feet on either side, most likely, as best we can tell.
[time=300] And it was woven from the finest fabric and history, Josephus, particularly, describes how it was woven together and that it's probably about four inches thick.
[time=309] Like, this isn't a curtain that us little wimpy people are gonna come and just, and it ripped from top to bottom.
[time=318] This was an earthquake, number one, is when Jesus died.
[time=321] And when that happened, Jesus' death represented, don't miss this, the end of separation, the open all access to the presence of God.
[time=332] Jesus ended the ways and the approaches that people went about to know God and be in relationship with God.
[time=341] The curtain was ripped, the author of Hebrews, Hebrews eight, nine, and 10, if you want more commentary for the week, talks about Jesus as our high priest, talks about the temple, talks about the curtain, I'll read to you a couple of passages.
[time=352] One of them's Hebrews eight, 13, talking about the new covenant that Jesus came to instill.
[time=358] And this is represented in this first earthquake and the ripping of the curtain.
[time=362] In speaking of the new covenant, he makes the first one obsolete.
[time=365] And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.
[time=370] Jesus has started something new.
[time=374] And that newness, we had on our shirts for the baptisms, it talked about newness, made new.
[time=379] Why are we made new?
[time=380] Because Jesus started a new approach, a new covenant, a new way we can have relationship with God and it was represented in this first earthquake.
[time=389] And as I think of that, here's what we're talking about all access, all access.
[time=394] This is what it represented.
[time=395] We can boldly access the very presence and have a personal relationship with God.
[time=402] Jesus made that possible in his death.
[time=405] And verse 54, the earth shook and so did the guards.
[time=409] It says that they were in awe and that they said, "Surely this was the Son of God." They saw it and I believe some of you, and here's what I wanna challenge you with today.
[time=418] Don't miss this moment and don't miss this moment.
[time=423] The moment that God is using an external earthquake
[time=429] has already happened to bring about a new earthquake happening inside of you.
[time=434] All access, let's talk about that.
[time=436] How many of you have ever had an all access pass, backstage pass?
[time=439] Can I tell you about my, nobody?
[time=440] Come on, yeah, yeah, of course you have.
[time=442] Those are fun, right?
[time=443] And you get to be around all these prestigious people.
[time=445] Now I'm a huge Atlanta Braves baseball fan.
[time=448] Some of you, and they won the World Series this year.
[time=451] Woo, yeah, thank you.
[time=453] All three of us, we're glad, yeah.
[time=455] (congregation laughing) And I was a pitcher, I pitched when I played baseball in high school, and as a pitcher, I idolized.
[time=462] I mean, I just looked up to the 90s Atlanta Braves pitchers.
[time=465] This is Steve Avery, John Smolz, Greg Maddox, Tom Glavin.
[time=470] Anybody, I remember them?
[time=472] Yeah, well, I do.
[time=473] And I wanna tell you about my favorite all access moment.
[time=475] Several years ago, we had a men's event at a church, and I got to be a part of that, and we invited John Smolz.
[time=484] He was my favorite.
[time=485] Whoa, man, I looked up to that guy.
[time=487] He could bring the heat.
[time=488] And I wanna show you a picture, 'cause I got a backstage pass.
[time=491] Look at this picture.
[time=492] (congregation laughing) That's a young Kevin.
[time=495] And a good looking tall, amazing man named John Smolz.
[time=500] You ever met somebody that was a prestigious person, and they were really mean?
[time=504] Not this guy.
[time=505] I have before, and it's like, whoa, wish I'd have never met them, right?
[time=509] He was the greatest guy.
[time=510] He told me about his faith.
[time=513] We talked about baseball and pitching, like I'm in his league or any of that kind of stuff, right?
[time=518] What a moment.
[time=521] But here's the thing.
[time=522] When I think of backstage passes, that I'll never forget that moment.
[time=525] That was so cool.
[time=527] But meeting prestigious people pales in comparison to meeting and having access, having a backstage access relationship with the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, the creator of the universe, the maker of heaven and earth, the one who formed us in our mother's wounds and has a purpose and a plan for us, the Lord of all, the King of all, and when Jesus died and when the earth shook and when that curtain ripped, we gained all access to the God of the universe.
[time=567] That's a good message to rest in this Easter.
[time=570] That is what Jesus brought about to us and having that access ripped the curtain.
[time=577] Jesus represented.
[time=578] Hebrews 10 verses 19 to 23, let's read a little more about it.
[time=581] Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence, this is what I hope you can gain today, to enter the most holy place by, how do we do this?
[time=589] By the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way open for us, how through the curtain?
[time=595] What is the curtain now?
[time=596] That is his body.
[time=598] Jesus is now the way that we enter into the presence of God.
[time=601] And since we have a great high priest over the house of God, let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with full assurance that faith brings.
[time=610] Having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water.
[time=617] Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful.
[time=624] That's our first earthquake.
[time=625] Let's talk about the second and to do that.
[time=626] Let's continue reading.
[time=627] Let's go to the resurrection.
[time=629] Y'all resurrection ready?
[time=630] Here it is.
[time=631] Matthew 28 verses one through four.
[time=633] It says, "Now after the Sabbath," this is a Saturday and so on Sunday morning.
[time=638] Here's where we are.
[time=640] Now after the Sabbath toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary, Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
[time=645] And behold, there was a great earthquake.
[time=648] There's our second one.
[time=649] "For an angel of the Lord descended from heaven "and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it.
[time=655] "His appearance was like lightning "and his clothing is wide as snow.
[time=658] "And for fear of him, the guards tremble "and became like dead men." Earthquake number two, "When Jesus rose." There was another earthquake that we just read about.
[time=672] And here's the thing about death.
[time=674] In this life, come here, I wanna tell y'all a secret, real quick, if you didn't know this, unless Jesus comes back first, you are going to die.
[time=685] Our life will come to an end.
[time=687] That's natural, we know that, right?
[time=689] Let me ask you a question.
[time=689] So death feels natural, even though it doesn't, and we feel attention, it's a normal part of our lives here on earth.
[time=697] But if you went to a cemetery today, and you walked around and people just started coming up out of the grave and walking around and coming up and saying, "How you doing today?" Well, that feel natural or unnatural?
[time=708] Pretty unnatural, because in this life for us, death is very natural.
[time=715] We know that, we don't like to acknowledge it or talk about it a lot of times.
[time=718] But we know death is natural, and resurrection is unnatural.
[time=722] But what I love about Easter is that God says, "Oh, resurrection is what is natural for me." Death is unnatural, death is not a part of my endgame.
[time=733] Death is not a part of my plan.
[time=735] It entered because of sin, so I set forth my son, and he died a brutal death to pay a price that we could never, ever pay, so that we would conquer death, so that death would be defeated, and we could have life because our God is a God of eternal life.
[time=754] Death is unnatural to him.
[time=756] Resurrection is what's natural.
[time=758] That is the message of Easter.
[time=761] Do you believe it?
[time=762] I believe it.
[time=763] I'm so thankful for the resurrection of Jesus.
[time=766] You can write it down this way that the resurrection of Jesus was the death of death.
[time=771] He conquered it, he defeated it, he destroyed it.
[time=773] And when he rose from the dead, Matthew 28, two, let's put it back on the screen.
[time=777] Let's look at it together.
[time=778] And behold, there was a great, what?
[time=781] Earthquake, here's our second one.
[time=782] For the angel of the Lord descended from heaven.
[time=785] It reminds me of the curtain being ripped from top to bottom, God coming down to us.
[time=789] The angel descended from heaven and came, and rolled back to stone.
[time=793] This was another barrier.
[time=795] You remember they were sitting there feeling hopeless?
[time=797] Roll back the stone and sat on it.
[time=801] Some of you are here Friday night.
[time=804] Y'all get the gold star.
[time=806] Just kidding, the rest of you can come on this journey with us too.
[time=809] We talk Friday night.
[time=811] Good Friday about Silent Saturday, about how Matthew 27 and verse 61 says that Mary and the other Mary sat opposite the tomb.
[time=822] And I've wondered what they felt when they sat opposite the tomb.
[time=825] Despair, sorrow.
[time=828] I wonder if you're sitting opposite a tomb.
[time=831] Sitting in death, sitting in sorrow, sitting in despair, grief, pain, hopelessness.
[time=839] That's what they were, verse 61 of Matthew 27.
[time=843] But then we are at Matthew 28 and verse two.
[time=846] And where does the angel go after he rolls the stone away?
[time=850] He sits.
[time=852] I love this passage because we see a shift in the sitting.
[time=856] We see Mary and the other Mary sitting in their despair and their agony.
[time=861] In Matthew 27, 61, Matthew 28, two, we see the angel sitting on top of that which was a barrier between them and the reason for all of their despair.
[time=872] So what does that mean for us?
[time=873] It means that our God sits on top of whatever it is that makes us sit in sorrow.
[time=880] I love what the angel did.
[time=885] I love what Easter represents.
[time=887] I can't sit and preach this.
[time=888] That's all I got guys, I can sit for a minute.
[time=891] But he sat on that which was causing them to sit in their sorrow.
[time=896] The earth shook and again so did the guards.
[time=899] Verse four says they trembled and they became like dead men.
[time=902] The first two earthquakes, they were external earthquakes.
[time=905] When Jesus died, when Jesus rose, an earthquake happened externally.
[time=909] But then what happened next is where we're gonna spend the rest of our time and it's the point of Eastern.
[time=914] It's what God wants for you and for me is the third earthquake became an internal earthquake.
[time=920] It happened on the inside of God's people and for centuries since more of these such earthquakes have taken place.
[time=928] And I wanna read about it in Matthew 28.
[time=931] Let's pick up in verse five, we'll read through verse 10.
[time=933] We see Mary and we see an internal earthquake because of these external ones.
[time=936] Verse five, but the angel said to the woman, "Do not be afraid for I know that you seek Jesus "who is crucified.
[time=943] "He is not here, for he has risen as he said.
[time=947] "Come, see the place where he lay.
[time=950] "Then go quickly and tell his disciples "that he had risen from the dead.
[time=954] "And behold, he is going before you to Galilee.
[time=956] "There you will see him.
[time=957] "See, I have told you.
[time=958] "So they departed quickly from the tomb "and with fear and great joy and ran to tell the disciples.
[time=965] "And behold, Jesus met them." Can you imagine this moment?
[time=968] All of the emotions sitting in despair to seeing the angels sit on top of the stone?
[time=974] And then you see Jesus and what does he say?
[time=977] Greetings!
[time=978] How's that for an Easter greeting?
[time=981] And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him.
[time=987] Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid.
[time=989] "Go tell my brothers to go to Galilee.
[time=991] "There they will see me." And this third earthquake, earthquake number three is when Jesus reigns.
[time=999] When Jesus reigns.
[time=1001] And I got news for you, he always has.
[time=1003] He is right now and he always will.
[time=1006] But we see a picture of worship from Mary and he's reigning in her heart in a new way.
[time=1010] There's a new thing springing forth that has changed the course of history, has changed the way we relate with God.
[time=1017] And let's talk about how they process their fear and their grief and their doubts and their pain.
[time=1023] When I look at John 20, Mary, this same Mary, she's the outward process or any outward processors when you're in pain, grief, you're just gonna let it out.
[time=1031] You're gonna find somebody and they're gonna listen, right?
[time=1033] You're the outward processor, just don't it.
[time=1035] There's all three of you and I know there's more.
[time=1037] You need to be outward and admit it in this moment.
[time=1040] That's Mary.
[time=1041] She wants to get as close to Jesus as she can.
[time=1043] She's the outward processor.
[time=1045] Then I look at the disciples, John 20, 19 to 23.
[time=1048] The disciples met together after Jesus died to process their grief and their doubt and their fears and their pain.
[time=1054] And they wanted to be in community.
[time=1057] How many of you are like that?
[time=1058] I just gotta be around some other people.
[time=1059] I gotta find some other people.
[time=1060] But they did it in fear.
[time=1062] They did it behind a locked doors.
[time=1063] Jesus came there.
[time=1064] We'll talk about that in a minute.
[time=1065] Then there's Thomas doubting Thomas.
[time=1068] I'll go in and raise my hand.
[time=1069] I process doubt, grief, pain, fear, the way that Thomas did.
[time=1074] He isolates.
[time=1075] Thomas was not with the disciples in the room in John chapter 20.
[time=1078] He went and isolated and sat in his despair and in his questions and in his doubts.
[time=1083] And when I have pain and grief, I tend to turn inward.
[time=1086] I tend to kinda just go hide from everything and everybody.
[time=1090] This is Thomas.
[time=1091] How many of you can relate with me?
[time=1092] That's you.
[time=1093] All right, yeah.
[time=1094] And then there's Cleopas in his companion, Luke 24.
[time=1099] He ran.
[time=1100] He left Jerusalem where all these events happened.
[time=1102] He just ran away from it.
[time=1103] And I wanna ask you if you're a runner, 'cause you might not wanna admit that.
[time=1106] But sometimes we run, don't we?
[time=1108] And Cleopas ran.
[time=1109] But there's a common denominator about all of these people, about Mary, about the disciples, about doubting Thomas and about Cleopas and about all of us that we all grieve and process pain and doubts and questions and fears differently.
[time=1122] But the common denominator with all of these people and with all of us is that Jesus met every single one of them right where they were.
[time=1132] He embraced Mary and he called her by name.
[time=1135] And she called him Rabbini.
[time=1137] That's more than Rabbi.
[time=1138] Rabbi means teacher.
[time=1139] Rabbini is like my teacher is personal, my Lord.
[time=1143] And he met the disciples in their locked room while they were gathered together in fear.
[time=1148] And he called for Thomas to come to that room and let him feel the scars on his hands and his feet.
[time=1156] And he met Cleopas on the road as he left from Jerusalem.
[time=1161] And the same thing is true of us, my brothers, my sisters, my friends, wherever you are, however you process, Jesus who reigns, stops what he's doing to meet us where we are.
[time=1174] Some of you can relate with this picture, check this picture out.
[time=1176] It's an emotion drawing picture to me 'cause I can think of so many moments where I'm not a big journal or maybe you are, but where I've tried to write things down either on paper or in my mind or through a prayer, perhaps when I say dear Lord, comma, I just got no words, but I've got tears.
[time=1194] Wherever you are today, the reigning king of kings cares about you.
[time=1201] He loves you so much.
[time=1204] And just like he met them where they are, he will meet you where you are.
[time=1208] And I love how this came together because the angels, verse seven told them, told the ladies there, told Mary to go and tell the disciples.
[time=1218] This is one of many reasons as I studied and wrestled with the truth of God's word that I know and believe with all of my heart that the Bible is 100% true and it's accurate.
[time=1227] And here's how, because if I'm gonna create a believable account of a false narrative, which many people believe the Bible is a false narrative or the resurrection is a false narrative, if I'm gonna create a believable account of that false narrative, here's the number one thing I would not do, I would not write down.
[time=1244] Even if it were true, I would not write down that women were the first to see Jesus after he rose from the dead and that women would be the first reporters of Jesus being resurrected from the dead.
[time=1256] Now here's the thing, don't get mad at me.
[time=1257] I like women, I married one.
[time=1259] But back in this day, the account, the eyewitness testimonies of women would not hold up in court.
[time=1268] It's meaningless.
[time=1269] Yet these are the first people, who are the first people that Jesus shows up to?
[time=1272] Mary and the other Mary and they're there at the tomb and they're the first to see Jesus and they're the first reporters of the resurrection.
[time=1282] How's that?
[time=1283] That's a good resume builder.
[time=1284] I'm the first reporter of the resurrection of Jesus.
[time=1287] I'd like to be that lady there.
[time=1289] And that's what happened and in John's account, we see that Jesus called Mary by name and as I told you, Mary called him Rabbi Naimai, teacher it was personal.
[time=1297] And I wonder who you're giving naming rights to in your life, naming rights.
[time=1302] Who named you?
[time=1303] In antiquity, it was the fathers who had to sign off on that.
[time=1307] And whose naming, I can tell you who it is, is whoever or whatever reigns in your life.
[time=1313] So I ask you, what reigns in your life?
[time=1314] Let's get this stool here.
[time=1316] This is the throne of your life.
[time=1319] And I need some help.
[time=1321] And I've already picked my helper.
[time=1324] I need Mr. Chip Clark to come up here.
[time=1325] Y'all give it up for our worship pastor.
[time=1327] Are you awesome?
[time=1328] Come here Chip.
[time=1329] (congregation applauding) He didn't know I was gonna do this to him by the way.
[time=1333] So this is totally unscripted, but I wanna use Chip as an illustration.
[time=1337] Chip, thank you for coming here.
[time=1338] Can you slide that way for just a second?
[time=1340] Why do you have a mic?
[time=1341] You ain't still in my sermon time.
[time=1342] (congregation laughing) Let me, look, here's a part of verse nine that Mr. Chip, with his microphone, and I want you to see.
[time=1351] Verse nine, and they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him.
[time=1361] Chip, you are now Jesus.
[time=1363] They're laughing, they're laughing about that.
[time=1367] Come here, come here, Jesus.
[time=1371] (congregation laughing) Jesus, I'm thankful for you.
[time=1376] I'm surrendering to you.
[time=1378] You're on the throne of my life.
[time=1380] I give you the throne of my life.
[time=1383] And I like it.
[time=1383] This is, it changes everything.
[time=1385] Jesus, you told me it would change everything.
[time=1386] I didn't believe you, but I believe you.
[time=1388] This changes everything.
[time=1390] It shifts everything about my life.
[time=1392] I love it.
[time=1392] It's just going so well, really well.
[time=1395] Jesus, thank you.
[time=1396] Thank you.
[time=1397] Can you scoot over here?
[time=1400] It's going really well, come here, come here.
[time=1402] Yeah, yeah, don't go too far.
[time=1405] Come here.
[time=1406] (congregation laughing) It's going really well.
[time=1410] I really, life's good.
[time=1411] That's okay, yeah, my legs are tired.
[time=1414] I'm gonna just hold on a minute.
[time=1416] See my life, everything's different.
[time=1420] It's different.
[time=1421] Whoa, hold on, the doctor called.
[time=1422] Come here, come here, hurry, hurry.
[time=1424] The doctor called, they said something looks weird.
[time=1427] It just, do something.
[time=1430] Come on, oh, hey, hey, it's, yeah.
[time=1435] (congregation laughing) The test was negative, so, I mean, imagine that.
[time=1443] The test, it was negative.
[time=1444] It's false alarm, it's all good, it's all good.
[time=1446] You know, things are going well.
[time=1448] Don't go far now, stay close.
[time=1450] You know what I really need?
[time=1452] This dating thing is hard.
[time=1453] It's not going well.
[time=1455] Yeah, I know, I'm not married.
[time=1459] I'm not married in this one, Jesus.
[time=1461] I know you know the future, but I don't at this moment.
[time=1463] Y'all, y'all go with me on this.
[time=1465] I need, I need some help in the dating game a lot.
[time=1470] But hold on, let me pick her out first.
[time=1472] Hold on.
[time=1473] That girl, yeah, you do something about that.
[time=1476] Yeah.
[time=1477] Hey, she said yes to the date, Jesus.
[time=1480] She was, it's going well.
[time=1482] Things are going great.
[time=1484] Yeah, I got, got me a girl.
[time=1486] Thank you, you helped me out.
[time=1487] She's crazy.
[time=1488] Oh, stay here, stay, get rid of her.
[time=1492] Isn't it true?
[time=1497] Can you relate?
[time=1499] I know I sure can, but here's the thing, some of you are super spiritual Christians.
[time=1506] And you would say, I would never pastor, I would never ask Jesus to get off the throne.
[time=1511] Ever, I wouldn't do that.
[time=1512] You would just say, scoot Jesus, come on, just a little, a little bit more.
[time=1519] Yeah, I need, I need the bulk.
[time=1521] I mean, you just get the, there you go, that's good, yeah.
[time=1524] I hope nobody's filming this or anything.
[time=1526] And we would say, I'm not going to push Jesus off,
[time=1532] but this is what we do.
[time=1535] Can I get an amen?
[time=1537] Can y'all thank Jesus, also known as Chip?
[time=1539] Thank you, man.
[time=1540] (audience applauding) This is the throne of your life, who reigns.
[time=1549] The difference, I think, in being a believer in Jesus and a follower of Jesus.
[time=1555] Luke 9, 23, Jesus said, bear your cross.
[time=1559] Take up your cross, there's a key word though, daily.
[time=1562] Daily is the difference.
[time=1564] You want to daily pick up your cross?
[time=1566] Make sure Jesus is on that throne.
[time=1568] Stay on your knees, stay humble.
[time=1570] No who reigns, he reigns forever, no matter what.
[time=1574] And I thank God for him, write it down this way my friends.
[time=1576] I believe this can change your life this Easter.
[time=1578] When you realize Jesus reigns and though he sure does, and you relinquish the throne of your life, you find rest.
[time=1587] I think when I'm in control of my life, sitting on the throne of my life, I'm rested.
[time=1592] But I found the more I'm in control, the more rest less I become.
[time=1596] But when I relinquish the throne, give it to Jesus.
[time=1600] It's then and only then that I find rest.
[time=1605] Matthew chapter 28 and verse 18, we're gonna look at it next week, you guys should come back.
[time=1609] We're gonna be in a series called This Is Us, we're gonna look at how Jesus ascended and went back to heaven with our mission and our vision.
[time=1615] Next week, Matthew 28 verse 18 says, Jesus came and said to them, how much authority?
[time=1620] Yup, all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me and it has.
[time=1626] But I want to ask you a question, you don't have to raise your hand, it's a quiz, pop quiz, but it's Easter, so I'm gonna be really nice to all of you guys.
[time=1631] Let me ask you, how many of you, if I were to ask you, who was the most powerful person with the most authority?
[time=1638] Who was the Roman emperor when Jesus died and when he rose again?
[time=1645] And you can't say Caesar because that's not a name, that's just a title that went with all of them.
[time=1650] I wonder how many of you would know.
[time=1652] There was a story, a real true story for me in seminary and a professor asked us that and I'm like, psh, I mean, you know, I'm in seminary.
[time=1663] I'm an up and coming pastor, supposed to know this stuff, right?
[time=1667] And I was like, Caesar in my mind and it was like, no, you can't say Caesar because they all had that title and I didn't know.
[time=1674] I didn't know, I'll never forget that moment.
[time=1676] And I'm like, you know what, I didn't even know who the Roman emperor was when Jesus died and when he rose again, I'll tell you who it is, it's Tiberius Caesar.
[time=1686] I'm guessing if we polled everybody, there will be some of you who knew that, but I'm guessing that most of you, when I eliminated Caesar as your answer, you didn't know.
[time=1696] But every single one of us in the room right now and listening and watching us online right now, every single one of us know this person who became a carpenter from Nazareth named Jesus.
[time=1709] We all know the name above every name.
[time=1712] The Bible says at his name, every knee will bow and every tongue will confess.
[time=1717] And we didn't even know who the most powerful person in the world at the time was when he died.
[time=1722] But we know the name of Jesus and the challenge of Easter is that one day we will all bow.
[time=1729] Our tongues will confess and know that he is Lord and that he deserves the throne of life.
[time=1734] But our challenge this Easter is to bow now.
[time=1738] Earthquake number three is an internal earthquake.
[time=1741] It's an earthquake where we say Jesus reigns and we relinquish the throne of our life to the king of kings and the Lord of lords.
[time=1750] I say, let's relinquish the throne.
[time=1753] I say, let's follow him.
[time=1756] What happens when we do?
[time=1757] Colossians chapter two, verses 13 and 14 says, "When you are dead in your sins "and the uncircumcision of your flesh, "God made you alive with Christ.
[time=1766] "He forgave us all our sins, having canceled the charge "of our legal indebtedness.
[time=1772] "We stood against us and condemned us.
[time=1776] "He has taken it away, nailing it to the cross.
[time=1781] "All access." When I read this, that's what I read, all access.
[time=1788] He's ripped up, nailed to the cross.
[time=1791] All of the skeletons in your closet, all of the things that make you separated from him.
[time=1796] Hebrews chapter four, verse 16 says it this way.
[time=1799] What do we do with this?
[time=1800] Hebrews four, 16, let us then approach God's throne.
[time=1804] This was our throne, the throne of our life.
[time=1806] That's a way bigger throne.
[time=1808] This is the way bigger in the game of thrones.
[time=1810] You all with me?
[time=1811] Yeah, y'all get that later.
[time=1813] This is the biggest throne.
[time=1814] This is God's throne.
[time=1817] We're talking about our throne.
[time=1818] It's a measly little stool compared to the throne of the king of the universe.
[time=1822] But let us then approach God's throne of grace with confidence so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.
[time=1834] Mercy is not getting what you do deserve.
[time=1836] Grace is getting all the stuff you don't deserve.
[time=1838] We have both because Jesus nailed our indebtedness, our death, our sin to the cross, giving us all access to the very presence of God.
[time=1851] People often ask me, what makes Christianity different?
[time=1855] Maybe you've come today wondering that.
[time=1857] Why is Christianity any different than any other path to God, any other way of religion or faith?
[time=1864] There's two distinctives that I always point to, Easter embodies both of them fully.
[time=1868] And every day is Easter when you know Jesus, can I give an amen?
[time=1870] Number one is the resurrection.
[time=1873] It was the death of death.
[time=1875] It's when our record of indebtedness was canceled and nailed to the cross and our sin and our death was defeated, the resurrection.
[time=1882] Here's the thing, when you look at the founders of any other faith or any other way of pursuing God, they're all commemorated in a tomb because they're buried there.
[time=1892] The founder of my faith is not there.
[time=1896] He is risen just as he said.
[time=1900] This is a distinctive of following Jesus, the resurrection.
[time=1904] Oh, but let's get even more personal.
[time=1905] The resurrection is as personal as it gets, but even more personal as number two is grace.
[time=1910] What sets it apart?
[time=1911] What sets Christianity following Jesus apart from everything else?
[time=1914] It's the resurrection.
[time=1915] He's not in a tomb anywhere to be commemorated.
[time=1917] He lives in us.
[time=1919] And number two, it is grace.
[time=1921] Every other way of pursuing God will ultimately come back to how good you are and to your works and to you hopefully outweighing your good works or a little heavier than your bad works.
[time=1932] But my Bible teaches me and more than my Bible teaching me, Jesus showed me and I look in the mirror and I see that I am dead in my trespasses and sin.
[time=1944] If that was the end of the story, we'd be in big trouble.
[time=1947] But the hope of Easter is that we have mercy and grace because of Jesus Christ, because of his resurrection.
[time=1954] And instead of me staying dead, God initiated something.
[time=1958] God came down just like that curtain that was ripped from top to bottom.
[time=1962] God became a man.
[time=1964] He lived the sinless life I could never live so that he could pay a price for my sin.
[time=1969] I could never pay any rose from the dead to defeat death, to defeat hell, to defeat the grave, to defeat my sin, to win a victory.
[time=1978] I could never win.
[time=1980] Ephesians 2, 8, 9 tells me that I'm saved by grace through faith, not of works.
[time=1989] Because then I would boast about it.
[time=1991] Resurrection and grace.
[time=1993] I wonder, do you believe in the resurrection?
[time=1996] I wonder, do you need to receive his grace?
[time=1999] I wanna ask you to buy your heads.
[time=2000] Ponderate believers, if you're a follower of Jesus today, you have all access.
[time=2005] What's your next step?
[time=2007] That God has challenged you and called you to take.
[time=2009] Ask him and he's gonna show you.
[time=2010] But some of you right now, don't miss this moment in the room watching online.
[time=2013] It's the most important moment of Easter.
[time=2016] It's that third earthquake.
[time=2017] It's where Jesus reigns.
[time=2019] It's the internal earthquake.
[time=2020] Can you feel it right now?
[time=2022] And you know you're separated from God because of your sin.
[time=2025] And I've presented the gospel as good as I could today and even better because it's God's gospel.
[time=2030] I have nothing to do with it.
[time=2031] But today you've heard it loud and clear.
[time=2033] And you know you're a sinner and you know you need Jesus.
[time=2035] Pray something like this.
[time=2036] Say, Jesus, I give you the throne of my life.
[time=2039] I believe you died for me.
[time=2040] I believe you rose from the dead.
[time=2044] And I receive your free gift of grace.
[time=2048] I wanna be saved by grace through faith that I'm putting in you now.
[time=2053] Forgive me, save me.
[time=2056] I give you me, give you the throne of my life.
[time=2059] In your own words, right now as believers are praying and we look at these external earthquakes and now we step into the internal earthquake of Easter.
[time=2067] Will you take your next step?
[time=2068] Pray and ask Jesus to save you in this very moment as we reflect and respond.
