[time=0] And I wanna talk to you today about the Great Commission Mission.
[time=4] And I'm gonna read to you what we often call the Great Commission.
[time=7] And these are the words that Jesus shared with his disciples before he ascended, he's appeared to people, to his disciples and to hundreds of people.
[time=16] In fact, after his resurrection.
[time=18] And that's why I started today simply reminding you, 'cause we need to be reminded that he is risen.
[time=25] So I wanna start today by talking about something that you're probably familiar with.
[time=30] And it's a subject that I don't like to talk about.
[time=33] And it's a serious subject.
[time=34] And that serious subject is shopping.
[time=37] Yeah, I don't like shopping.
[time=40] But I've learned there's a couple of different kinds of shoppers, at least a couple.
[time=45] Then when we have to shop, whether that's groceries or clothes or it doesn't make any difference to me, you probably can tell I'm not a big fan of the shopping process.
[time=51] But how many of you are experience driven shoppers?
[time=55] It's all about the journey, you wanna take your time, you wanna check your options.
[time=60] It's about the experience.
[time=61] So you let maybe more than the end result.
[time=63] Raise your hand, be just on it.
[time=64] I know I'm saying it like I don't like that.
[time=66] And it's true, I really don't.
[time=67] But I still love you.
[time=68] It's okay, I'm married to an experience driven shopper.
[time=71] I get it, so raise your hand.
[time=72] If you're an experienced driven shopper, be proud.
[time=74] There you go.
[time=74] All right, now how many of you are the mission driven shopper?
[time=77] Where it's like, we're gonna go in, we're gonna get what we need, nothing else.
[time=81] We're gonna get to the car, we're gonna time ourselves and we're gonna get home as fast as possible.
[time=85] How many of you could tell that that's the kind of shopper that I am?
[time=89] Yeah.
[time=90] So we are all different with our shopping.
[time=92] But as I've looked, and by the way, I think there's a third kind nowadays.
[time=96] And I think I'm adopting this and I kind of like it.
[time=99] It's the own line or pickup shopper.
[time=103] Where you do it all online and they put it in your trunk for you or they ship it to your house, it's glorious.
[time=109] It's life changing.
[time=110] And so I think that's another kind of shopper.
[time=112] How many of you are like, yeah, that one is me.
[time=113] There you go, there you go.
[time=115] I'm with you there too.
[time=116] As I've looked at shopping, experience shopping, here's what I have found.
[time=120] You ever notice why they put the milk in grocery stores?
[time=123] Way back there in that back corner.
[time=125] Why do you think that is?
[time=127] It's because they've got all of these bombs planted on the way to the milk that are gonna set off and be an explosion of distraction for you to stay.
[time=136] Ooh, I know I'm here for milk, but I need one of those, right?
[time=140] And how many of you've ever been distracted by those?
[time=143] I have two, that's why I'm an old mission shopper and I wanna do it online 'cause they try to get my money all the time.
[time=148] But you know what the truth is, whether you're an experienced driven shopper, a mission driven shopper, an online shopper, there are bigger distractions than the ones in between you and the milk in the store.
[time=159] You wanna know what they are?
[time=160] There are distractions and traps for us as believers.
[time=165] The enemy is constantly looking to seek out, to kill, steal and destroy us, fulfilling the purpose and the mission that God has for us and they're way bigger distractions than those that lie in between us and the milk in the back corner.
[time=179] So that is why every year we do a series called This Is Us to stay on course, to stay reminded, to stay engaged and to make sure that we don't get distracted from the things that really do matter.
[time=192] And so today as we talk about the Great Commission mission, have in your mind what are some things that the enemy is using to distract you from what matters today?
[time=200] Jesus in Matthew 28 gave the Great Commission and this Great Commission was given to us so that we would not get distracted.
[time=210] Jesus knew that the disciples would have all of these detours in life that would follow his ascension when he would go to be with the Father and the Spirit of God would come and the church would begin in glorious powerful ways as we read about it in the book of Acts.
[time=225] And we'll look at that even more in this series.
[time=227] In fact, as we look at our method of gather, connect and go in the subsequent weeks, but Jesus gave them this statement, this commission, this mission so that they and we would stay on track.
[time=241] Let's read about it together.
[time=242] You ready for the word today church?
[time=244] Matthew chapter 28, I wanna read verses 16 through 20.
[time=248] Some of you may be very familiar.
[time=249] May you have it memorized.
[time=250] Some of you may be hearing it the very first time.
[time=253] No matter where you're at, listen to it as though you're hearing it for the first time and may we get a fresh perspective and a fresh reminder of what really matters in life.
[time=262] Let's dig in together.
[time=263] Matthew chapter 28 verse 16 says, now the 11, they're 11 because Judas has betrayed Jesus and has hung himself.
[time=271] The 11 disciples, they went to Galilee to the mountain to which Jesus has directed them.
[time=276] And when they saw him, they worshiped him, but some doubted and Jesus came and said to them, all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[time=287] Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you and behold, I am with you always to the end of the age.
[time=304] And I pray that the reading of God's word is a seed that just blooms and blossoms in your life in mind this week in powerful ways.
[time=311] From this, I wanna give us today five key reminders, five key mission things that Jesus pointed to for his disciples, ready for these, right the first one down.
[time=320] Number one is we see that Jesus uses all people.
[time=325] Verses 16 and 17, it says that these 11 disciples went to where Jesus had told them, they've encountered the risen Jesus on numerous occasions at this point and he told them to go to this mountain, go to this place, I'm gonna see you there.
[time=338] So from the get go, we see the people that Jesus is using, the disciples that Jesus has called, but I point you specifically to verse 17 where we see that some of them worshiped and some doubted, says that they worshiped, could understand that, right?
[time=352] A risen savior, Easter has happened.
[time=354] As we saw in the video, it's not the conclusion, it's just the beginning, they know this, they know that all these things Jesus has been telling them is they're about to happen, things are about to change in their life.
[time=364] So they worshiped him, they can see him, they've felt of his scars on his hands and his feet.
[time=370] Can you imagine this moment of worship that they had?
[time=373] But I love that the Bible captures these real accounts
[time=379] of those moments of worship with realism, with the humanity that is involved with the people Jesus called, because what we see is those next few words and some doubted.
[time=393] You wonder what they doubted?
[time=394] I've always wondered, I wonder what their doubts were at this point in their life.
[time=398] Jesus uses all people, they went where he told them, and they have this mindset doubt.
[time=404] At this point, at least four times, they've encountered the risen Jesus.
[time=408] So what are they doubting?
[time=409] I mean, they felt of his scars.
[time=411] I mean, are they doubting that it's really Jesus?
[time=413] The Bible doesn't really say, and I imagine it varied from person to person.
[time=416] I've always believed that at least some of their doubt went something like this, that I don't really doubt you, Jesus, but all this stuff that you've told us that we're going to do and you're going to do through us, I don't doubt you, but I really doubt me.
[time=432] I really doubt that even you, as much as I believe in you, and I see you, I really doubt that you could do the things you've taught us about through somebody like me.
[time=443] And I really doubt that I can carry them out without you, because you're saying you're gonna leave us, and I don't know what the doubts look like, but I can relate, how about you, to those kind of doubts?
[time=453] Really me, really those things, without you, I'm gonna have to walk this path, and I don't know what all their doubts look like, but I imagine it looks something like that.
[time=463] There's a journey ahead of them.
[time=464] I don't know if you've ever been on a long journeys with young kids before, right?
[time=468] Yeah, what's the thing you know you gotta anticipate when you go on a long journey with kids?
[time=474] Yeah, all those things.
[time=476] I heard it all, it's like you guys said third different things at once, 'cause you've done it before.
[time=480] There's gonna be a pit stop, right?
[time=483] I gotta go potty.
[time=485] I'm hungry, you know, I gotta stretch my legs.
[time=488] You gotta get gas, the list goes on and on.
[time=491] And this is a pit stop in the journey, the beginnings of a new journey, of a new life, a new creation calling that the disciples had entered into.
[time=501] This is a pit stop for them.
[time=503] And Jesus, here's what he does.
[time=506] He did it in their lives, and he does it in yours in mine.
[time=509] Write this down.
[time=510] Jesus shifts us from a mindset of doubt to the mission of discipleship.
[time=516] Has Jesus ever had to grab your mindset and shift it back to the mission before?
[time=523] He does with me all the time.
[time=524] This is one of those moments where Jesus grabs the mindset.
[time=527] In this case, we see that it is a mindset of doubt that the disciples had, but he shifts it back to this mission of discipleship, this mission of make disciples.
[time=537] And we need that same kind of reminder.
[time=541] And one of our philosophical ministry things that we believe in and we say here often at Black Hawk is that as we talk today about how Jesus uses all people, have you ever read about the disciples for anybody?
[time=552] They're knuckleheads, just like you and just like me and Jesus uses all of us.
[time=556] And it's a great reminder of this ministry philosophy that we have around here that we say something like this.
[time=561] There is a seat for everyone at Black Hawk.
[time=564] It's a place you can come and you can belong and you can find connection.
[time=566] Even while you're wrestling with what you believe.
[time=569] We have many people who have done that.
[time=570] We had 12 people baptized last week.
[time=572] Many of them did that as they went on their journeys and I'm thankful to be a part of a church family that says there's a seat for you here.
[time=580] It may look different.
[time=581] We're young adults at some point in our journey, but we started as spiritual infants.
[time=586] Maybe we grew to spiritual children.
[time=588] Maybe that's where you are now.
[time=589] You become a young adult.
[time=590] You become a parent.
[time=591] We come in spiritually dead and Jesus saves us and we find life there's a seat for you at the table of the family of God.
[time=599] And Jesus shows us this even with the disciples that he calls Jesus uses all people.
[time=605] With each of these five things I wanna share with you straight from the great commission mission today.
[time=610] I'm gonna give you a personal question.
[time=612] Then I wanna challenge you to just write down and ponder this week.
[time=615] Here is the question I wanna ponder with you this week when it comes to the fact that Jesus uses all people.
[time=621] How does God desire to use you in the lives of others right now?
[time=626] And what I'll tell you as you write that down as you think about that question, Jesus always uses us for the sake of other people.
[time=636] Christianity, the mission, the discipleship journey that we are called to be on, it's not about us.
[time=642] It's all about him and them.
[time=645] So that's why I ask you this question.
[time=646] How is God, is it about him?
[time=648] He's desiring to use you in the lives of other people right now, family members, friends, coworkers, acquaintances, neighbors.
[time=655] Who does God bring to your mind?
[time=658] Jesus uses all people, even you.
[time=661] Look at your neighbor and tell them, say God is using you, let them know.
[time=664] They need to hear it right now.
[time=665] Find somebody, say God is using you.
[time=667] He is, and he's just getting started.
[time=669] Right now, number two, coming from verse 18.
[time=671] Number two is that Jesus has all power.
[time=674] Jesus uses all people, but Jesus has all power.
[time=678] The great commission reminds us of this because in verse 18, Jesus says all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[time=686] Jesus has all power.
[time=689] And I came to remind you today, my friends, that the resurrection of Jesus means that anything is possible, even that he would use someone like you, even that he would use someone like me.
[time=701] The fact that he is alive, the resurrection is a reminder that anything is possible with God.
[time=708] Can I get it, amen?
[time=710] And it all starts with this fact that Jesus has all power.
[time=713] And that is why this whole journey of discipleship and faith begins with us submitting.
[time=718] Remember the throne last week, those of you who are here for Easter?
[time=721] We've got to make sure that Jesus is on the throne of our life and stop trying to push him off or share the throne.
[time=727] We hit our knees, we bow, because at the name of Jesus, every knee is going to bow, but we bow now, because he has all power.
[time=736] They worshiped, even through their doubt, they did worship.
[time=738] Maybe that is a good reminder for us.
[time=741] And it reminds us that think about the authority that Jesus has.
[time=744] It's an authority you and I could never have.
[time=747] Jesus has authority over creation.
[time=749] Jesus has authority over people.
[time=751] Jesus has authority over nature.
[time=753] Jesus has authority over his church.
[time=755] Jesus has authority over demons and the devil and the evil powers that work around us.
[time=759] Jesus has authority over teaching.
[time=761] Jesus has authority over the Sabbath, over Sundays, over Mondays, over Tuesdays, all the way through Saturday.
[time=767] Jesus has authority over forgiving sins.
[time=770] Jesus has authority over hell.
[time=772] Jesus has authority over death, because his resurrection was the death of death.
[time=778] Jesus has authority over authority itself.
[time=781] There is no authority that is greater than our Jesus.
[time=785] And yet he wants to be our friend and call us a part of his family.
[time=790] I want to submit to him and follow after him.
[time=793] And I love the word all in this passage.
[time=795] There's four all's that I see in this passage that we read.
[time=799] This is the first one, all authority has been given to him.
[time=802] Later, we're gonna see all nations.
[time=804] Then we're gonna see teach them to observe all.
[time=807] I have commanded you and even says always, I'm gonna be with you.
[time=811] I'll be with you always.
[time=814] Jesus is the Lord of all.
[time=817] And I just need to be reminded of that sometimes.
[time=819] And the fact that he has all power gives me that reminder.
[time=822] And in a couple of areas we see that this power is applied in heaven and on earth.
[time=827] In heaven and on earth.
[time=829] When I read in heaven, I'm reminded of our origin.
[time=831] I wrote that down in my notes.
[time=833] Our origin of participating in God's power.
[time=837] Our origin is way higher than us.
[time=840] The origin of power that is supernatural is way bigger than any of us.
[time=844] It comes from heaven, it comes from God.
[time=846] Jesus has all power.
[time=847] So our origin of power, we see it pictured in the in heaven part.
[time=851] But the on earth part, the origin part shifts to an opportunity part.
[time=855] It goes from an origin to participate in God's power to this opportunity to participate in how God's power is being manifested and made known and made alive in the world around us.
[time=866] And we have both in Jesus.
[time=867] He holds all the power and he invites us in.
[time=870] And because of that, it reminds me that we have a never changing mission because God's power has never changed.
[time=876] He's always been in power.
[time=878] He's always had all authority.
[time=880] He does have all authority and all the power and he always will.
[time=885] Not a government, not you, not me, not him, not them, not that thing that seems to hold power in your life.
[time=893] He sits above it all.
[time=895] Just like the angel sat on the stone that was rolled in front of the tomb.
[time=899] He rolled it away and sat on it.
[time=901] God sits above and on top of all of the things that make us sit in sorrow.
[time=906] And in fear and in doubt.
[time=909] I need to be reminded of that.
[time=911] This is the source of our power.
[time=912] It's a never changing mission to make disciples.
[time=915] But we live in an ever changing ministry, don't we?
[time=918] In our world right now, if you notice things changed before you blink, I've told you before, people bring terms and things like that to me as a pastor.
[time=924] Like, hey, pastor, what does Black Hawk believe about this?
[time=927] And some new terminology, some new ism, some new thing.
[time=930] And I can't hardly keep up with it all.
[time=931] It's an ever changing world.
[time=934] But what we need to remember is that we hold to the never changing truth of the character of God and of the gospel of Jesus Christ and of his death and of his resurrection, even in the middle of an ever changing world.
[time=948] We have to make this distinction, right?
[time=950] This now, there's a distinction between theology and methodology.
[time=954] Theology is who God is.
[time=956] It's the study of God.
[time=957] And I've got good news for you.
[time=959] This word right here reminds us that even though everything in your life is changing and fluctuating and going up and down, God is the same.
[time=967] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[time=971] He never changes.
[time=972] Boy, but our methodology sure do, don't they?
[time=974] And you know, I'm encouraged because Jesus modeled this for us.
[time=977] As Jesus went from town to town, some places he'd tell a parable.
[time=981] Some places he would teach from the Old Testament scriptures.
[time=984] Some places he would do a miracle.
[time=986] He would bring healing.
[time=987] This place he would have a conversation, a small group gathering.
[time=991] In this next place he would have a large crowd.
[time=993] His methodology looked different everywhere that he went and he modeled that for us.
[time=997] But he is theology.
[time=999] He is the son of God.
[time=1000] Theology is never changing.
[time=1002] Methodologies are ever changing as we continue to strive to live out this great commission mission.
[time=1010] So let me give you a personal question to ask.
[time=1012] That's a kind of big picture global look at the power of God and how it comes through his church.
[time=1017] But you are his church.
[time=1018] Raise your hand if you are the church.
[time=1020] That's you.
[time=1021] If you know Jesus and you claim him as Lord, it's not the buildings of Blackhawk.
[time=1024] We're a part of something way bigger than what these buildings can house.
[time=1027] God's presence is in us.
[time=1030] And here's that question for you.
[time=1031] How have you seen God's power at work in your life lately?
[time=1034] And I know when I ask a question like that, some of you may go, I have it at all.
[time=1039] And I would challenge you today to know that God is still at work.
[time=1044] God does still love you.
[time=1046] God is revealing himself to you.
[time=1048] I know that because in all the times he's felt a million miles away from me.
[time=1052] When I look back, I go, you know what?
[time=1054] I couldn't see it then.
[time=1056] But God was working some stuff around me.
[time=1059] And I would challenge you this week to look for often calling the God-winks where it's like God goes, see, I got you.
[time=1065] I'm there.
[time=1066] I haven't left you.
[time=1067] Look for him.
[time=1067] I bet you'll find some.
[time=1068] Ask God for some.
[time=1070] I bet you he'll give you some.
[time=1071] And if you start looking, I bet you'll find that God's been working in ways.
[time=1074] Maybe you just haven't slowed down enough to notice.
[time=1078] So how have you seen God's power at work in your life this week?
[time=1082] Jesus uses all people.
[time=1083] And how is he desiring to use you through his power because he has all power and how have you seen that power at work?
[time=1089] Number three, and this is where we'll camp for a lot of our time today 'cause I wanna talk about discipleship.
[time=1093] Number three is that Jesus gives us purpose.
[time=1097] In verse 19, we read the beginning of this great commission.
[time=1100] Jesus says, "Go therefore and make disciples "of all nations." I wanna break that into three parts that verse to talk about how Jesus gives us purpose.
[time=1110] Look at me for a minute at home, in the room, all of you, God has a purpose for your life.
[time=1116] God has a purpose even for the pain,
[time=1122] even for the things in your life that you would just assume he'd do away with.
[time=1126] God brings good from things that are meant for evil against us and God is not done with you yet.
[time=1133] I don't know who that was for, but you need to know that Jesus has a purpose.
[time=1136] And this verse, this commission reminds us of that purpose.
[time=1141] And did you know that Jesus is gonna come back again, by the way?
[time=1145] He's coming back.
[time=1147] That should get somebody excited.
[time=1148] I say, "Come Lord Jesus." But in the meantime, he's given us a purpose.
[time=1153] He's given us a mission to go forward with.
[time=1156] And so as we look at that today, let's break it into three parts.
[time=1158] Let's look first of all at the go and make part.
[time=1160] Go and make.
[time=1161] He says, "We'll go therefore and make disciples.
[time=1166] Go therefore and make disciples." Let's look at the go and the make.
[time=1170] The verbs, the action items in this purpose, 'cause listen, if you want to follow the purpose of God in your life, you're gonna have to get moving.
[time=1176] You're gonna have to pursue some action steps, some verbs and so go and make.
[time=1180] This is that discussion, the ongoing discussion throughout all of life.
[time=1183] Well, what kind of church is Black Hawk pastor?
[time=1186] I've asked that.
[time=1186] Is it an evangelism church or discipleship church?
[time=1188] And what is my answer?
[time=1190] Yes, you can't do one without the other.
[time=1193] It is a both and and it baffles me sometimes how many times you'll hear these questions and it gets applied in ways where you neglect one for the other.
[time=1203] It's a go and a make.
[time=1204] It is reaching out to people who don't know Jesus and it is building up the saints, edifying, encouraging, correcting, rebuking.
[time=1213] It is equipping people to go and do more of that but you can't do one without the other.
[time=1218] And I would submit that if you are, you're not doing it the way Jesus told you.
[time=1223] One leads to the other.
[time=1226] So which are we?
[time=1228] I believe that the church and when it comes to this discipleship process, 'cause when it comes to making disciples, it's reaching and it's equipping.
[time=1236] It's both and I believe that the church, globally speaking has been in a little bit of a coma in some ways for hundreds of years in this and it's a part of my heart's passion, calling and desire to make sure I lead in any church, whatever God asks me to do at any calling, any personal relationship, any encounter at a grocery store, any family member conversation at a Christmas thanksgiving, Easter gathering that I would make sure I fight to do the what that Jesus called me to do.
[time=1268] And to do it the way Jesus called me to do it.
[time=1272] And that's what God wants to remind us of with this purpose today.
[time=1275] And one of the things that I see constantly infiltrating my mindset, I'll be honest with you.
[time=1280] I'm a recovering Pharisee, anybody else with me?
[time=1283] Oh man, all four of us?
[time=1285] Okay, yeah, there you go.
[time=1285] Some of you are trickling on in, yeah.
[time=1287] The earlier translations of the English Bible, like the King James and some other of the earlier translations, good translations, but they will translate this word where we say go make disciples as teach.
[time=1301] Did you know that?
[time=1302] You can look it up.
[time=1303] You can look at some parallel versions and it'll say go and teach and you'll find that.
[time=1307] And I think that we've done that and listen, I'm all what I'm about to say.
[time=1310] I'm all for teaching.
[time=1311] I'm doing it right now.
[time=1312] That would be quite the hypocrite if I've taught against teaching, right?
[time=1315] I'm not doing that.
[time=1316] We should have that.
[time=1317] We need teaching.
[time=1317] It's a part of the Great Commission.
[time=1319] And we're gonna look at it next, going, baptizing, teaching, it's a part of it.
[time=1323] But sometimes we go into the world and we teach.
[time=1325] We go into the world and we took that translation to heart and we miss this point that I wanna share with you right now.
[time=1331] That discipleship is the course of your life, not a course you take.
[time=1337] I need to say that again, 'cause some of you just needed that this week 'cause I used to think it was just about accumulating.
[time=1343] I went to school, went to seminary.
[time=1345] I would do it again.
[time=1346] I wanna be real clear.
[time=1347] I should know those things.
[time=1348] But discipleship is not a course that you take.
[time=1350] It is the course of your life.
[time=1352] In fact, the literal translation of go therefore and make disciples is as you are going, make disciples.
[time=1359] It's a course of your life.
[time=1361] It's as you go to the grocery store, as you deal with that knucklehead family member, as you go through the highs and the lows of life, make disciples.
[time=1369] It's not a thing that you do.
[time=1370] It is something that you become.
[time=1373] It is who you are.
[time=1375] And that is what God wants us to lead into.
[time=1378] And so what are we gonna make then?
[time=1379] So it's the go and the make.
[time=1381] But what do we make?
[time=1382] The word disciples, go therefore and make, go and make disciples.
[time=1385] Second part, let's talk about what are we gonna make because the definitions that we hold to will determine what kind of disciples we make.
[time=1393] And let me prove my point for just a minute.
[time=1395] I won't do a big poll, but if I did do a big poll in the room and say, hey, what is a disciple?
[time=1401] You would say a lot of things in your mind, or actually just shout them out on three.
[time=1404] Shout out what comes in your mind when I say, what is a disciple?
[time=1406] One, two, three.
[time=1408] A lot of different words came out.
[time=1411] And I'm just gonna guess that probably almost all of them were correct.
[time=1416] They're good words, they're right words.
[time=1419] But what I'm guessing is if we take our own path of discipleship without a unified definition that comes from Jesus.
[time=1427] And that's what I'm gonna suggest to us.
[time=1429] And we've been suggesting it for years.
[time=1430] And I don't think there's one specific way you have to do it in a church, what you put on the wall.
[time=1434] But if we have different definitions, we're gonna make different disciples.
[time=1439] We're gonna have different mentalities.
[time=1440] And so we wanna hold to a unified definition of what does it mean to make disciples.
[time=1445] And this word is Matthew 2-0 in the Greek.
[time=1447] And it's interesting because we always ask questions like, well, what defines success for ministry, for church?
[time=1454] We look at what metrics we're using.
[time=1456] How many people come to Christ?
[time=1457] How many people are baptized?
[time=1459] How many people are showing up on Sunday?
[time=1461] How many people are in small groups?
[time=1462] And listen, I'm all four of the numbers because to me, every number represents a person and every person matters to God.
[time=1468] Therefore, we track all of those things because we know that every number represents a name that matters to God.
[time=1474] And so we do track those things.
[time=1475] And we know if you ask our team around here, the numbers, we've got 'em, we track it.
[time=1479] We've got spreadsheets, we've got all of those things.
[time=1482] But constantly you ask, you're asked and you do ask in ministry and you should be a part of all of these, ask, how do we truly define success?
[time=1491] And I've talked to you about success before.
[time=1493] I believe it really goes back to obedience.
[time=1495] Success equals obedience.
[time=1497] That's a whole other sermon.
[time=1498] And I preached it a little while back.
[time=1499] You can go check that one out or maybe we'll look at it again in the future.
[time=1502] But here's the thing, as we talk about how we measure success, I'm a kind of business-minded guy.
[time=1508] Bottom line kind of guy like results and things like that.
[time=1510] Anybody like that with me?
[time=1511] I'm a type A, black and white, concrete kind of guy.
[time=1514] That's a good thing.
[time=1515] And we're gonna measure over those things.
[time=1517] But you really can't use, here's what I've learned.
[time=1519] You really can't use business metrics to measure biblical maturity.
[time=1523] And so there's a lot of intangibles in that.
[time=1527] And so I think we must go back to these definitions that Jesus gave us.
[time=1531] Matheto disciples, that word, get this.
[time=1534] The original language here is the word from which we get our English word, mathematics metrics.
[time=1541] Sounds like a pretty good place to start, if you ask me, for where we measure things is, how are we making disciples?
[time=1547] This is applicable to our church as a corporate question and to us individually as a part of God's church.
[time=1555] How are we making disciples?
[time=1556] And we've chosen to define it this way.
[time=1558] Real life ministries, other churches across the globe define it through the words of Jesus for Matthew 419.
[time=1564] Matthew 419 is a great place where we can discover what is a disciple.
[time=1568] And we see at least three things from his words.
[time=1570] And this is a unified definition we've used around here for years, I don't wanna give it to you again.
[time=1575] A disciple is one who is.
[time=1577] Jesus said in Matthew 419, follow me.
[time=1579] A disciple is one who number one is following Jesus.
[time=1583] Following Jesus, that's even the meaning of that word.
[time=1586] Disciples go and make disciples.
[time=1588] It's a follower, it starts with this idea of following.
[time=1591] So it's one who is following Jesus.
[time=1594] Matthew 419, Jesus says, come follow me.
[time=1597] Then he says, I will make you.
[time=1599] That's number two.
[time=1600] A disciple is one who is B-ing.
[time=1603] Look at your neighbor and say, I-n-g, tell him.
[time=1607] I-n-g, circle the I-n-g.
[time=1609] It's not one who has been changed.
[time=1611] We're not glorified, we're not in heaven yet.
[time=1613] We're being transformed and made into the likeness of Jesus.
[time=1617] We're being changed by Jesus.
[time=1619] That's why you're not, listen, look at me from it.
[time=1621] Some of you, I've walked with some of you and you look at this journey to trusting Jesus as your Savior, to being baptized, taking your next step is, I gotta get cleaned up enough.
[time=1630] I gotta meet some standard.
[time=1632] I gotta check all these boxes before.
[time=1634] I can be a part of the family of God or I can take that step and listen, we want you to know that we're all being changed by Jesus.
[time=1640] No one has arrived.
[time=1642] We are being changed by Jesus.
[time=1645] I-n-g, he said, and by the way, you're not doing it.
[time=1648] Who's gonna make us?
[time=1652] I, he says, Jesus is gonna make us.
[time=1655] I'm not gonna make me that.
[time=1656] He is gonna make me that.
[time=1657] A disciple is one who is following Jesus, being changed by Jesus.
[time=1661] He says, I will make you number three, one who is committed to the mission of Jesus.
[time=1665] Follow me, Jesus said, and I will make you fishers of men.
[time=1671] I love the chosen.
[time=1672] I've been watching the chosen.
[time=1673] We've been watching it with our kids lately and it's just awesome.
[time=1676] The way they depict this scene where Jesus said this was after the big catch with the disciples and he calls Peter and calls his brother Andrew and they're there and I love this depiction because he looks at him and says something like this, hey, from now on, you're gonna catch men.
[time=1690] You're gonna catch people.
[time=1692] So you catch 'em and you're gonna catch all kinds.
[time=1695] He says, and then he says, and I'll sort 'em out.
[time=1698] What a great reminder.
[time=1700] I am one who is following Jesus.
[time=1702] Come follow me.
[time=1703] I'm being changed by Jesus and I'm letting him make me into the fisher of men, the fisher of people, of all kinds of people that he's called me to be.
[time=1713] And when we look at that definition, what we will find is we often end up saying Christian.
[time=1718] Would you say you're a Christian, if you believe?
[time=1720] I would.
[time=1721] That's a good thing, no trick question.
[time=1722] But in the Bible, Christian has used some three or so times.
[time=1725] It's a descriptive word.
[time=1727] But disciple is more of a dynamic word.
[time=1730] There's a difference in a descriptive word and a dynamic word.
[time=1733] Disciple is used in the Bible some 269 times.
[time=1737] 238 of them are in the gospels.
[time=1739] Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John alone.
[time=1741] And it reminds us that we don't, I don't want to be a descriptive Christian.
[time=1745] I don't need a descriptor that is my title.
[time=1748] I don't want to be a descriptive Christian.
[time=1749] I want to be a dynamic Christian because dynamics put me to work and give me action.
[time=1755] And I'll say it to you this way.
[time=1756] I'll say it to you again.
[time=1757] That information without application equals stagnation.
[time=1762] Knowing Jesus here is not the end game.
[time=1766] It's the beginning point.
[time=1767] Jesus said, listen, he said, go make disciples.
[time=1770] He didn't say go make decisions.
[time=1772] Do you hear me?
[time=1773] He said, go make disciples, not go make decisions.
[time=1775] I'm all for, we have people acknowledge their decision to follow Jesus.
[time=1779] And a lot of times we look at it bad as the end game.
[time=1781] That's the beginning point.
[time=1783] He said, go make disciples.
[time=1784] He didn't say, go make decisions.
[time=1786] He didn't say, go make baptists.
[time=1788] He didn't say, go make Presbyterians or Catholics or Lutherans or Pentecostals or Charismatics or conservatives in this and they said, go make disciples.
[time=1799] And if we just look at that process as informative, as cognitive and miss the application, the rubber meeting the road, the dynamics, we'll get stagnant.
[time=1808] Maybe that's why you're stuck right now.
[time=1811] Maybe it's time to apply some of what God is teaching us.
[time=1814] Go and make disciples.
[time=1816] The third part is of all nations, of all nations.
[time=1819] I love this part.
[time=1820] I love, love, love this part of all nations.
[time=1823] And I'm reminded of Romans two, I think it's verse 11 that simply reminds us there's no partiality with God.
[time=1829] Do you hear that?
[time=1831] That's powerful.
[time=1833] Sometimes it feels like, well, God must be more partial to people like blank.
[time=1836] There's no partiality with God.
[time=1838] And in fact, the end of scripture, Revelation five verses nine and 10 gives a description of the end game, gives a description of what the church of Jesus is gonna look like when we're together with Him.
[time=1848] And the word all is there again.
[time=1850] Remember those alls in this passage?
[time=1852] All people of all tribes, all nations, all tongues.
[time=1856] They'll all be together, worshiping Jesus.
[time=1858] We'll all have our white robes, our palm branches.
[time=1860] We're all gonna be singing praises.
[time=1862] We're all gonna be worshiping the same Jesus as one body.
[time=1866] And our purpose, because Jesus has a purpose, is to practice for heaven today.
[time=1871] I say let's practice for heaven today.
[time=1874] Jesus has a purpose.
[time=1876] Here's the question for you because listen, the gospel is not a come and hear thing.
[time=1879] It's a go and tell thing.
[time=1881] It's a purpose thing.
[time=1882] So the question for you is what does it mean to you to know that God has a purpose for your life?
[time=1888] In this season, I wanna contextualize it even a little further.
[time=1890] What does it mean for you to know that God has a huge purpose for your life in this season?
[time=1896] All of it's ups and all of it's downs.
[time=1899] All of the transitions, all of the changes, all of the things that we didn't see coming.
[time=1903] Remember how he said I had my list?
[time=1905] What I thought God was doing and what these next years we're gonna look like?
[time=1908] Well, God blew all that up for me.
[time=1909] What it means for me to know that God has a purpose right now in this season of my life is to know that he's trustworthy because I'm reminded of all the times where I didn't see something coming in the past, but God walked me through it.
[time=1920] And I see his past faithfulness and it gives me future hope.
[time=1924] There's an example of some of the things God's teaching me.
[time=1927] Maybe you can relate.
[time=1929] Let me give you number four.
[time=1930] These will be shorter, don't worry.
[time=1932] I know you're like, you gotta listen faster.
[time=1934] Y'all just listen to slow sometimes.
[time=1936] These are shorter.
[time=1938] Number four, Jesus modeled his plan versus 19 and 20.
[time=1942] He tells us what to do.
[time=1943] He says, go there for make disciples of all nations.
[time=1946] And he sells us, so the go parts there.
[time=1947] It's the baptizing and the teaching, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[time=1952] We're gonna be doing that second service with an 87 year old Paul who I've been talking with and I cannot wait.
[time=1957] What a big moment.
[time=1958] We've been talking about this for a couple of years.
[time=1960] God started in his heart.
[time=1961] He just really felt like, you know what?
[time=1963] I didn't get baptized really after I nailed down my personal walk in salvation and relationship with God through Jesus Christ.
[time=1969] And he wants to do that at the age of 87.
[time=1972] And it's gonna take him a while to get up those stairs too.
[time=1975] And you know what?
[time=1976] He said, I'm gonna do it.
[time=1977] Y'all help me.
[time=1978] So we got some of the elders, myself, our pastors and leaders, we're gonna take all the time next service and we're gonna walk up those stairs because he's committed to what Jesus gave him as a purpose and to the plan that God has for his life.
[time=1990] What a story.
[time=1992] I wonder what yours is.
[time=1994] But what I want you to know today is that Jesus modeled his plan.
[time=1998] How?
[time=1999] How do we go about pursuing the purpose that God gives us?
[time=2002] Going, literally as you are going, make disciples, baptizing the name of the Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
[time=2008] Maybe you need to be baptized.
[time=2010] You've been having some excuses.
[time=2011] I bet they're not bigger than Paul's.
[time=2013] Maybe it's time for you to take that step.
[time=2016] Go to blackcockministries.org/nextsteps.
[time=2018] We'd love to help you.
[time=2020] Teaching, teaching them to obey.
[time=2021] All I have commanded you, Jesus summarized the law.
[time=2025] Jesus gave it to us and multiplied it and elevated it.
[time=2030] And we walk in this new covenant call and command and we're to teach it, we're to know it.
[time=2035] That's why you're here right now.
[time=2036] That's why we value these moments and we all ways will.
[time=2039] Jesus modeled it for us, but one of the passages that just captures it so well, we're gonna look at a little more in depth over the next couple of weeks.
[time=2046] It's Mark chapter three and verse 13 and verse 14.
[time=2050] You can jot that down, read it this week.
[time=2051] We're gonna look at, listen for the next three weeks, we're gonna look at gather, connect, and go.
[time=2057] It's modeled perfectly in this passage.
[time=2059] Here they are, gather.
[time=2060] Jesus said Mark 3, 13, he called to him those whom he desired and they came to him.
[time=2066] There's a gathering component to that.
[time=2067] He called them together, they got together, they spent time together.
[time=2071] So gather, this is our method.
[time=2072] We're talking about our mission and our vision.
[time=2074] This is our method, gather, connect, go.
[time=2075] Gather, he called them to himself.
[time=2078] They came to him, connect.
[time=2079] After that, it says he appointed the 12 for a couple of reasons.
[time=2082] The connect part so that they might be with him.
[time=2085] There's a relational component to this.
[time=2087] That's why we say we believe in those circles way more than just the rows.
[time=2090] A row can't know, the rows are a starting place, but it should lead you into a circle of connection with other people just like Jesus modeled.
[time=2097] You may have thought life groups.
[time=2098] This is worship service, life groups, and then it's serving, giving, connecting, and using your time, town, and treasure for the Lord.
[time=2105] This is what we're about at Blackhawk.
[time=2107] You may have thought we came up with the life group I did.
[time=2109] Nope, Jesus did.
[time=2111] Mark 3, 13, and 14.
[time=2112] We call him different things, but Jesus came up with it.
[time=2115] Go, he appointed the 12 so that he would send them out to preach, so that he would send them out to preach.
[time=2122] Gather, connect, go.
[time=2124] This year I challenge you.
[time=2126] Be in a worship service.
[time=2127] We're gonna look at Gather next week.
[time=2129] Be in a life group and use your time, talent, and treasure to serve and give like never before.
[time=2137] This year, every year ahead.
[time=2140] And so here's the question I ask you today personally.
[time=2142] What step should you take to follow Jesus model?
[time=2146] What step should you take?
[time=2149] And as you do, here's the good news.
[time=2150] It's like, man, I'm overwhelmed by those things.
[time=2152] Number five is really good news for you.
[time=2154] It's this, that Jesus is always present.
[time=2157] He's always here at the end of the Great Commission.
[time=2160] In verse 20, he says, "And behold, I am with you always." It's that last all, I love that last all.
[time=2166] And with you always, even to the end of the age.
[time=2169] And I love that the purpose and plan of these five points, here's the purpose and the plan of God.
[time=2174] At the beginning of that is God's power.
[time=2176] The end of that is God's presence.
[time=2178] We're at the front end, it's the people.
[time=2180] But it's the power of God and the presence of God that sandwiched his purpose and his plan for us.
[time=2186] It holds us together.
[time=2188] I'm glad that I have an ever present savior.
[time=2190] Can I get a name in?
[time=2192] God's presence is our source of peace.
[time=2194] Listen, no matter what your problem is, it's God's presence that'll give you peace.
[time=2199] Peace is not the absence of the getting rid of your problem.
[time=2201] Peace is God's presence with you through whatever problem, through whatever high, through whatever low.
[time=2206] God may walk you through whatever life throws your way.
[time=2210] So the question with this one is, how can you trust God's presence in a painful situation right now?
[time=2217] If you're not in a painful situation, I'm guessing one will probably come.
[time=2221] Jesus said it this way in this world, you're gonna have trouble.
[time=2223] But take heart because I have overcome the world.
[time=2227] And that same Jesus said, and I will be with you even to the end of the age.
[time=2232] So how can you trust in God's presence right now in a painful situation?
[time=2236] I ask you to buy your heads, close your eyes today as we've looked at these five reminders of our mission and vision.
[time=2241] This is us, this is who we are.
[time=2244] This is who's we are.
[time=2246] Believers right now, would you take a moment and just ask God, what step God would you have me to take?
[time=2254] Maybe it's one of those personal questions I gave you that God's just wrestling with you about on the inside right now.
[time=2259] Ask you, commit to him that you're gonna follow him this week.
[time=2261] Don't let Sunday be the end game.
[time=2265] Monday's coming.
[time=2266] But because Sunday came after good Friday, 'cause Jesus rose from the dead, you have his power, the same power that raised Jesus from the dead lives.
[time=2276] And will you trust it this week?
[time=2278] Many of you are listening right now, watching your in the room right now.
[time=2281] And you would say, you know, I just don't know that I have a personal relationship with Jesus.
[time=2285] Most important, an eternal thing that'll ever happen in this room, outside of this room.
[time=2289] And in this moment, as you trusting Jesus as your Lord and Savior of the Spirit's drawing you right now, pray from your heart and his in your own words, just let him know, Jesus, I do need you.
[time=2298] I am such a sinner.
[time=2299] And today I give you me in this moment right now.
[time=2305] I know you died for me.
[time=2307] I know you rose again.
[time=2308] And I know you're coming back.
[time=2310] And I trusted you for so much.
[time=2311] And in your own words, will you cry it out to him in the silence of this moment as we reflect and respond to what God's doing in our hearts?
[time=2317] (gentle piano music)
