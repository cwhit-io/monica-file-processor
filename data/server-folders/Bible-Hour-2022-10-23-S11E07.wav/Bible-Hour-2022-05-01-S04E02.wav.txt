[time=0] But for these next few weeks in our This is Us series, I want us to focus on our method.
[time=5] How do we fulfill, pursue the mission, the commission that God has given us and the vision
[time=11] that God has given specifically to the local body of believers? This amazing family that we get to be a part of called Blackhawk. How do we go about it? Three things, gather, connect and go.
[time=21] We're going to spend a week per each of these things and a good glimpse of this comes from Mark
[time=27] chapter 3. And we're going to be in Hebrews in just a few minutes if you want to go in and find your place. But Mark chapter 3 verses 13 and 14 is where Jesus called his disciples and shows us
[time=37] what it looks like to go and make disciples. Mark chapter 3, let's read those two verses. Starting in verse 13, we see that it says, "Jesus, he went up on a mountain. He called to him those he desired
[time=49] and they came to him." This is the gathering component. Then in verse 14, "And he appointed the 12 and two things are mentioned, these 12 that would be named apostles, number one, so that they might be with him and secondly so that he might send them out to preach." We always say, gather,
[time=66] connect, go. Be in a worship service, be in a life group and serve, give, go. Make a difference
[time=72] using the time, talent and treasure that God has given you. And you may have thought that was a really great thing that we came up with. Spoiler alert, it was Jesus idea. Mark 3, 13 and 14, gather,
[time=82] connect, go. We put some words to what Jesus did and that is our method. But so for today, I
[time=89] want us to look at these three things. Gather is he appointed the 12 and they came to him. They
[time=95] came together. They gathered. Connect is he appointed the 12 here. He called them. He appointed them so that they would be with him. Connect, connect. And then go is he appointed the 12 so that he could
[time=107] send them out to preach. He would send them out. Look at your neighbor and say, you're a preacher
[time=113] too. Make sure they know because they may not know. Did you know your actions, how you live your life, it preaches every single day. Did you know that you are a worshipper? Some of you say,
[time=125] I didn't come here to worship. I'm not even sure what I believe. You may not be worshiping Jesus, but you worship because worship is worship. It's where you ascribe weight and value and worth in your
[time=138] life. And we all value things. We all ascribe worth and weight to certain things. I'm going to help
[time=144] take us on a journey today as we look at those three one week at a time. Today we're talking about gather. Let's talk about our worship. Let's talk about this all important question of why should I
[time=155] go to church? Or for some of you, you may ask it this way. Should I value going to church?
[time=161] And I want to give us an outline from Hebrews chapter 10. You can find your place in God's word toward the end of your Bible. Hebrews chapter 10 verses 19 to 25 is where we're going to start.
[time=170] This in today's era, we love technology. Many of you are watching online. Don't worry. I'm not about to condemn or throw anything at the cameras and we're still going to be there. I'm going to give us an outline and a picture of what is online ministry because I believe that Jesus would always use every tool, including technology that was available to him to make sure the good news of the gospel goes forth. So we intend to do the same. But at the same time, today's era has made it very comfortable to maybe not value so much going to church, being in an in-person gathering,
[time=199] being with other people. And so how does all that work? What does God's take on those things? And so let's look at some of those and I'm going to give you several reasons why I believe we should, according to the word of God, according to what God plans for us. But before I do, I acknowledge there's a lot of reasons you may not find value in that. I hear it quite a bit. I want to give you three statements that kind of narrow to more personal that I've heard as very frequent statements when it comes to going to church as we tackle that question. The first one, common statements from people that maybe don't see that value is I don't have to go to church to be a Christian.
[time=232] Have you ever heard that one? Maybe you've said that one and I would tell you that is true. You don't have to go to a building to be a Christian. You don't have to. But there have been many responses
[time=242] to that by various pastors in my life. The most most recently, my favorite response to that that just sticks with me. I heard it most recently from Tony Evans and he said it this way. He said, "Well, you know what? You're right. You don't have to go to church to be a Christian. And in the same
[time=259] way, I don't have to go home to be married. But stay away long enough and your relationship is going
[time=266] to be affected." And the same thing kind of feels true of gathering together and I'm going to outline
[time=272] some of why in a minute. Let's narrow it a little more. Another statement I've heard many times is, "I love Jesus, but I'm done with the church." And I'm going to let you in on a little secret, come here. As a pastor and a PK and growing up in church, I have not only felt that sometimes.
[time=287] I have said it in my head sometimes. You know, one of those moments where you're like, "I just said that. I hope God didn't hear me." Spoiler alert. He did. He already knows.
[time=297] I have felt that. We laugh about these things sometimes, but some of you are listening right now. You're watching and you're not in the room, perhaps, just because you have been hurt in church.
[time=306] And I want to speak directly to the D church. People who maybe you don't go to church anymore, you know the most common reason. People don't go to church because they've been there before.
[time=317] And they ran into people like you and me, flawed people. But what I would say to you,
[time=323] if that is where you are today, I have a big heart for you because I know people hurt people.
[time=329] But here's the thing. To say, "I love Jesus, but I'm done with your church." Would be something like saying to me, "Pastor Kevin, I love you, but I'm done with Jessica, my brain." Now,
[time=341] you better be glad. If you do that to me, you probably should be glad I'm not Jesus.
[time=344] Jesus doesn't handle it the way I would handle it. I would be like, "Well, then I'm done with you because we're a packaged deal." Right? But yet, that's what we often do. It's like, "I love you,
[time=354] Jesus, but your bride, the body of Christ, not going to deal with that." But Jesus would say,
[time=361] "Well, we're a packaged deal because he said I will build my church and the gates of hell won't even prevail against it." So I want to unpack that with you, even though you may say, "Well, I'm still going to push back on that. We're going to unpack that further. Let's make it real personal. The last statement is, "I don't go to church because it's full of hypocrites." My response
[time=379] to that, and I've heard it many times, is always the same, my opening response. And then depending on who it is, I may take it a step further. But my opening response is when someone says, "Pastor, I don't go to church because it's full of hypocrites. I always say, 'You are so right.'" And I love the response. I usually get back. It's kind of like, "I want to inspect and
[time=399] pastor to say that." And then depending on how I know them or the conversation is going, I might say something like this. So you should come too because one more won't hurt. And the truth is,
[time=409] my friends, the church is full of hypocrites because you're one and I'm one and he's one and
[time=415] she's one because we are all flawed human beings and God, for whatever reason, even though he could
[time=421] have chosen to do it anyway, he chose to build his church on top of through and among and with
[time=429] flawed people like you and me. So much he loves us. And so I have learned this the hard way,
[time=438] many times, and maybe you're learning this, that our call is to view God's church based on him, not on them. There is always going to be a them associated with God's church, but my call is to
[time=450] view God's church and to be a part of it, participate in God's church based on him, the one who started the church to begin with, not based on them or what they do or do not do that
[time=461] hurts me or does not hurt me. I do it for Jesus. And so I want to help us with that today because here's the relational principle that I want to apply to the church. I've got a magnifying glass that says this, "What you magnify will multiply." I've said this to you many times through the years
[time=476] and I wanted to apply it specifically to worship. It's true in relationships. In my marriage, if I want to find something wrong that I don't like in my marriage and I put a magnifying glass
[time=486] on it and I talk about it all the time with Jessica, I'll find a few things because she's so awesome.
[time=491] But if we turn it around and she said, "I'm going to find plenty wrong with Kevin," and she took the magnifying glass, she'd be like, "Whoa, the list is huge." But what you'll find in your marriage, you'll find it with your kids, with your parenting, with grandkids, with your co-workers, with family, with friends is what you focus on the most, what you magnify,
[time=512] you will get more of that. It'll seem like it's multiplying even if it's not, it's going to feel like it is. What am I saying? What you magnify will multiply means, you'll find what you're looking
[time=523] for in your relationships, in life, and even in the church. If you're looking for a reason to not go
[time=532] to church or to not like the church, you will find it 100% of the time. But today, I want to put a
[time=538] magnifying glass on some reasons we should, some reasons we should consider and make sure that we
[time=545] prioritize being a part of God's church in the way He's called us to. You guys ready for the word today? We're going to pull eight reasons that we'll magnify today as we magnify the name of Jesus, eight reasons I think we should go to church, we should engage. And so let's dig in. Hebrews, chapter 10, starting in verse 19, the writer of Hebrew says, "Therefore, brothers, two senses He gives us, since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way that He opened for us through the curtain, that is through His flesh." And here's the other sense. And since we have a great priest over the
[time=581] house of God, let us draw near with a true heart and full assurance of faith. With our hearts,
[time=588] sprinkle clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast
[time=594] the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful. And let us consider
[time=602] how to stir up one another to love and good works, verse 25, not neglecting to meet together. This
[time=610] is gather, this is our call, our command, as is the habit of some. And I would say some of you,
[time=616] even right now, you're at home, maybe not because you have to, but just because it's kind of cozy and it becomes a habit. And I'm not here to pick on you. We're going to be online and we're excited for that. But this is important, is what we're reading in the text. And I want us to dig into that for a few minutes, because sometimes we develop not so healthy habits. And then He gives an alternative, the end of verse 25. But instead, encouraging one another and all the more, as you see the day
[time=642] drawing near. What's the day? It's the day that Jesus didn't just come one time for,
[time=648] He's coming again. And we will enter into eternity and we need to be ready for that day. And a part
[time=655] of that is gathering. So let me give you eight reasons that I believe we should from this text today, make sure we engage in God's church that we gather, that we go to church. Number one, gathering refocuses us on Jesus. How many of you ever need a kick in the pants to refocus because
[time=673] you get distracted? Anybody? How many of you find Sunday mornings a good time for God to do that?
[time=678] I hope so. That's our goal. That is a hope for us. It's the beginning point. It's not an end or a destination. But it's the beginning point of refocusing us, sometimes giving us the karate chop,
[time=688] karate kick, saying get back on course. Keep your focus where it needs to be. And this is
[time=694] verses 19 and 20. We have this confidence to enter the holy places. How? By the blood of Jesus.
[time=701] By the new and living way that He opened for us through the curtain that is through His flesh.
[time=708] Go back to Easter. What was the theme of Easter? Two words. If you know it, shout it out. The theme of Easter this year was? Okay, six people came to Easter this year. Just making sure you're away.
[time=718] And we'll say it together. Here it is. All access. The theme of Easter and the theme of our life this year is all access. We have been given all access through the curtain. The curtain was
[time=728] in the temple. It divided the holy of holies where the ark of the covenant sat that represented the very presence of God. It was a place at that time. There was a curtain that divided it. Only the high
[time=738] priests could enter into this place where the presence of God was once a year and through all of these rituals. But the moment that Jesus died, this huge curtain ripped from top to bottom,
[time=750] symbolizing God coming down to us and through the curtain that became His flesh. We now have
[time=757] all access. This is the message of the gospel. This is the good news of Jesus and we can enter these
[time=763] holy places because we have a priest, a theme of Hebrews as Jesus as our priest because it was
[time=769] written to an audience that was trying to reconfigure things because this new and living way that was talked about here in verse 20. This was a new covenant. The way everyone approached the presence of God
[time=780] looked different but then Jesus showed up and He changed everything. He gave a new and a living
[time=786] way and everyone was processing what does that look like. And so Jesus is viewed as this priest who changed everything. A new and living way, a new covenant that we enter into. And we have a
[time=798] place because of our priest who is Jesus. He's the one. He's the reason that ripped that curtain,
[time=805] that we have all access now. And so when we gather, we refocus ourselves on what matters the most.
[time=811] We refocus ourselves on Jesus. But I have found that my focus tends to shift towards me. Raise your
[time=818] hand if yours does that too. Yeah, I'm guessing it does. It kind of shifts towards me. And if I try to do this by myself, I just kind of make it more about myself is what I have found by experience.
[time=829] But when we do it together, our focus shifts upward towards Jesus. And then a part of that,
[time=835] the second thing happens. Gathering. Number two, write this down. Gathering reminds us of who's in charge. Verse 21 that we just read, "Since we have a great priest over," read that word with me,
[time=845] "since we have a great priest over the house of God." When Jesus came, the presence of God
[time=852] shifted from a house. This is the audience to whom he's writing. He's describing the shift.
[time=857] The author of Hebrews says, "The presence of God was tied to a place until Jesus." Then the presence of God shifted to a people, which is God's church because of Jesus Christ. So we refocus on
[time=869] Jesus when we gather. And we were reminded of who is in charge. Worship is worth ship. And I magnify.
[time=876] When we worship, when we're singing a moment ago, I love this moment a few minutes ago, we're saying, holy, holy, we remind ourselves, God knows he's holy, but we magnify the name of Jesus
[time=891] so that we are changed. The light of the Son of God is holiness shining on us and through us
[time=897] and being present inside of us reminds us that he's in charge, not me. And when we gather,
[time=904] what a moment it is. I'll tell you, this side of heaven, I don't know that there is a sweeter moment for us. It's a closer experience of what it's going to be like in heaven than when God's
[time=916] people are all together, all of our differences and quirks and weirdness. And we come together and we in a unified way sing and lift high the name of Jesus, study his word to be unified around his
[time=928] principles, doing things his way. In those moments where we sing and lift high the name of Jesus,
[time=934] you know what we're going to be doing in heaven? One of the things? I don't know. I don't know what all we're going to do. I can't even wait to find out, but one of the things we know about is we're all going to sing. We're all going to worship. And this side of heaven, I'm not sure we can get much closer than when we together in a room magnify the name of Jesus.
[time=950] Usually I'm running my mouth on a Sunday quite a bit. And you know, so during the week I'll use online. I'll watch worship services. I have worship moments in the car. I have worship moments on a
[time=961] computer screen. I get those things. What a great tool that we have, but I'm going to tell you nothing compares to what we've gotten to do this morning. Or we just get to be in a room and lift high the name of Jesus together. And I thank God that we can do just that. We're reminded of who
[time=975] is in charge. He's over the house of God. Jesus said, I will build my church. That means listen,
[time=981] it's not based. If I've taught you anything these several years that we've been together, I pray with all of my heart that you will remember that I constantly pushed us and our mindset towards
[time=992] the church belongs to Jesus. Black Hawk is God's church. And it's never built on the back of any
[time=1000] personality or any person or any pastor or any leader. Jesus has for over five decades cared for
[time=1007] his church at Black Hawk and his big sea church globally. And he always will. We belong to him.
[time=1015] The church is his church. He is in charge. And that is encouraging for us. And that's why we gather.
[time=1022] We recognize a refocus on Jesus. We're reminded of who's in charge. Number three, gathering keeps us
[time=1028] confident in our closeness to God. Verse 22, the beginning of it says, let us draw near. You're
[time=1034] probably watching online right now. You're in the room right now because you want to draw near. You want to be close to God in a world that constantly pulls you away from him to refocus and redirect
[time=1045] you. You want to draw near to him. We do it with two things. A true heart and in full assurance of our faith. True heart, it means there's no divided loyalties. There's no distractions.
[time=1055] It's one focus, one thing all of the time. No divided loyalties. And there's nothing much
[time=1062] better than those moments where God's people are unified and worship and singing and digging into the Word of God. Just like right now, this is my favorite moment of the entire week. We get to do this together. Keeps us confident in our closeness with God. Full assurance of faith. Hebrews 11 gives
[time=1077] us a full picture of faith. We know we're saved by grace through faith. Ephesians 2. We also walk by faith. We're saved by faith. But we walk by faith. 2 Corinthians 5. We're not walking by sight.
[time=1088] We're walking by faith. And you can maybe recognize that in this season of your life. But wherever you're
[time=1094] at right now, you can be confident that God is near. God speaks oftentimes in a still small voice.
[time=1101] I think one of the reasons he does that instead of shouting at us is because he's really close.
[time=1106] He can speak in a still small voice because he never went anywhere. He's close to you. He hears
[time=1113] you. He sees you. He cares for you. He'll never leave you or forsake you. And when we gather,
[time=1119] we're reminded of what it's like to be confident and have a full assurance of faith that he's close,
[time=1125] that he's near. Hebrews 4. One of my favorite passages about this. Let's go to verse 14 of Hebrews chapter 4. Hebrews 4, 14 says, "Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession." Verse 15 reminds us that we
[time=1141] don't have a high priest that's not able to sympathize with us in our weaknesses. But one, who in every respect has been tempted as we are yet without sin. Because of that, verse 16 tells us
[time=1153] what to do. "Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy
[time=1160] and find grace to help in time of need." I love those passages because it reminds us that he is
[time=1167] near. And in this season of change and transition for our kids, my wife and I, we try to parent this way anyway. But in a season of change and transition, this is good advice for all of us
[time=1177] at times. We try to lead our home in such a way where our kids know that like you can come ask us anything. You can boldly approach dad. Dad's not going to be mad because you asked some dumb question. There are no dumb questions. You can ask anything. Why? Because I'm their father. Because Jessica is their mom. You can ask us anything, anytime there's no restrictions because we're family
[time=1198] in this season. And they do sometimes ask some pretty crazy questions. And I can relate. And I'm
[time=1204] like, God, you're laughing right now because that kid that just asked me that question was me asking those same kind of questions back in the day. And it's coming back around full circle. Can I get a name in anybody that's had kids before? You know what I'm talking about. Yeah, come on. Amen. That's a mom back there if I've ever heard one, right? The same thing is true of your father in heaven.
[time=1223] Questions are okay. This place, this family called BlackHawks a place, you can belong. Even if you're
[time=1229] not even sure yet what you believe, you can ask your questions of your father. And therefore, we want to magnify and exemplify our father and make this a safe place where you can ask questions
[time=1240] and grow in your faith and come to know what it is like to be close to your creator. Because he
[time=1246] cares for you. Questions are okay. Number four, gathering allows us to illustrate the gospel.
[time=1254] Verse 22 continues and scholars take this all kinds of directions on like how do you apply these verses and man they apply everywhere all throughout scripture. I'll hone in on one comparison, one illustration. The word illustrate means to give a picture to. And that's what happens when we gather and we do things like communion and baptism. Jesus said do communion. Have the Lord suffer, do this in remembrance of me. And he says in the great commission we looked at last week, go into all nations. And what did he say first, baptize them. Go make disciples of all nations, baptizing them. And in verse 22, we see kind of a picture of both. Hearts sprinkle clean from an evil conscience. You got one of those? You bring one to church with you today? Yeah, you did. But it gets sprinkled clean the moment Jesus takes over and his body that was broken, his blood that was spilled out. Hebrews 9, 22 tells us that without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of
[time=1306] sin. And this is a picture of the communion that we have that being sprinkled clean from an evil conscience just even reminds us of communion that we step into. And then water, our bodies are washed with pure water. Water represents the spirit, it represents the presence of God, many different things, the word of God through scripture. But it's also represented in baptism. Maybe you need to be baptized. And when we gather, when we have communion, when we do the Lord's Supper, when we baptize people like we've done over these last couple of weeks, we illustrate the gospel. And it
[time=1336] firms things up in us and it encourages our hearts as believers. But then people who may not know what they believe or may not be following Jesus have not given their lives to Jesus. They see an illustration, a picture of the gospel. Baptisms may be the most clear. You go under the water, what do we say? Buried with Christ in baptism. You go under it. Jesus died and was buried. And when you come out of the water, our shirts say new or made new because we're given a new life. When you come out of the water, we'll say raise to walk with Him in a new life. It illustrates the good news, the gospel, the message of Jesus. And when we gather, we get to do that. And we get unified
[time=1372] church through all the highs of life, through all the lows of life. When we illustrate the gospel
[time=1379] together, when we lock arms together, our differences fade and our unity gets raised to the roof
[time=1385] as we lift high the name of Jesus and illustrate the gospel. Number five, and we want to get grounded
[time=1391] in that. This is what happens next. Number five, gathering grounds our faith in God's faithfulness. Some of you came in today and you're discouraged. You're really discouraged. You came
[time=1403] today hoping maybe you could find some encouragement. And I have learned through all the discouraging seasons of my life that the greatest remedy to discouragement is to remember the faithfulness of God.
[time=1415] Because if God was faithful then, He's going to be faithful now. And it gives me hope and confidence
[time=1423] and His closeness and His faithfulness for the future because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever. Verse 23, let us hold fast. Hold on. I ask you today, what hope are you holding
[time=1436] on to? You're worshiping something. You're holding on to some kind of hope. Which one? What are you holding on to? I suggest this. Let's hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering. For he
[time=1447] who promised is faithful. Hebrews chapter 6 verse 19 is a source of a song that we sing. We have
[time=1456] this hope as an anchor for our soul. He is with us. You remember that song? This is what it comes from. We have this as a sure instead fast anchor. Some virgals say this hope of a hope that enters
[time=1468] in the inner place, again behind the curtain. You see the imagery, don't you? The illustration of
[time=1474] the gospel. And we ground our faith and Christ's faithfulness. And when we gather, that's what I hope you leave with. You sense the closeness, the call of God. You sense that the foundation upon
[time=1484] which you stand on the Word of God. But more than that, the God of the Word and that He loves you and He sent Jesus for you. And He modeled the way for you that you leave with a sense of steadfast
[time=1494] groundedness, stability in what you believe, why you believe it, what you're going to do, how you go out and trust in the faithfulness of God. Because let's be honest, Monday's coming.
[time=1503] And that knucklehead family member of yours is still a knucklehead. And then you're going to
[time=1509] look in the mirror and you're going to realize that everywhere you go, you show up there too.
[time=1515] And you're going to need to be grounded in a faithful God. And when we gather, we remind ourselves of that. Number six, gathering helps us put "we" before me. A better way of saying it,
[time=1526] perhaps, might be it makes sure, as we've talked about it, refocuses on Jesus, it makes the "he" first. So then the "we" is second and then the "me" is last. But when we gather, we do it together.
[time=1537] Look at this verse, verse 24. Let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good words.
[time=1543] When we gather, we lift high the name of Jesus. I think of the definition I often give you of joy.
[time=1548] J-O-Y. Jesus, others, yourself. Jesus, others, yourself. When we gather, we put the name of Jesus
[time=1555] first, the "we" becomes second and we go last. Jesus said, "Do you want to be first?
[time=1561] You've got to be the servant of all. He who is last is going to be first." It's counterintuitive
[time=1568] to our culture, is it not? Very counter-culture. Two phrases in here, let us consider. It means to contemplate, think about. That's what I'm hoping we can do when it comes to going to church, being a part of God's family. How to stir up the original language for stir up.
[time=1582] We read it and it's like, okay, kind of makes sense, like, kind of gently prod them forward.
[time=1586] The original language actually isn't that word. It means to provoke or push. And actually that word and its original language would typically be used in a negative sense. Like, I'm going to provoke you. Push you. Like, you know, it's like, yeah. And you're like, what did you say? It would
[time=1603] be a very attention-grabbing word choice. You provoke each other. You push each other to love
[time=1610] and good works. And he uses that strong word to fit the mold and the model that Jesus gave
[time=1617] when he said a new command I give you. And then he said, love God and love people. And they're like, that's not new. And Jesus said, but here's what I want you to do that's different. Do it and love one another the way I have loved you. It's like, oh, well, that's going to take some stirring up.
[time=1632] And here's what I've learned. We can't do that in our own strength. Have you ever tried? It's hard
[time=1640] to stir up one another to love and good works to one another, each other, the way that we're called to in Scripture. And Brother Rayburn is right over here and he often says, you know what you can't do?
[time=1649] And it's a very true statement. So biblically true. You cannot one another yourself.
[time=1655] Some of you've tried. I'm in any introverts at heart. I recharge. I'm a kind of a professional
[time=1662] extrovert. I love being around people. But to recharge, I got to get away. Jesus did that too.
[time=1666] So good model. I follow his model. He goes away. I got to do that too. Especially for people like me. It's hard to make sure we don't isolate too much. Can I get an amen? Those of you who
[time=1677] know what I'm talking about. And we end up trying to one another from afar. But the Bible says to bear with one another. The Bible says to bear one another's burdens. Jesus said those things.
[time=1687] Paul taught us these things to apply that new command Jesus gave to us. But we can't do that
[time=1693] on an island. We can't do that. We can't bear with one another if we won't be with one another.
[time=1701] It's way easier to stay away sometimes because some of us, we just make life messy.
[time=1706] Can I get an amen? But we are called, yeah, we are called. We are called to one another each
[time=1713] other and to stir each other up. Next week I'm going to talk to you about that very thing.
[time=1718] Connect. So come back next week. If you want some more, if you struggle with that, next week is for you. Number seven is this. The gathering fosters obedience to God. Verse 25. This is the go-to verse
[time=1729] for make sure you go to church. But I wanted to give you the full picture. The full context today.
[time=1734] Hopefully these are good reasons to engage. Not neglecting to meet together as is the habit of some. But here's the alternative. Encourage one another. All the more because the day is drawing near where we will enter into eternity is what we are reminded of. And gathering truthfully is not just something that we do as a church. It's actually who we are. In the New Testament, the language, the original language for the church is echlesia. It's ech and caleo. It's two words put
[time=1760] together, ech is out of, caleo is called. So we are called out of. We are called out people, people it means an assembly, a gathering of called out people around a person, a purpose, or something that really is compelling in our case. And that person is Jesus Christ who is building
[time=1776] his church. So we are by definition a gathering. So to say that we don't need to gather to be the
[time=1783] church would negate the very definition of the church. This is what Jesus did. Even in Matthew 28,
[time=1789] he gathered them together. He called them to Galilee in the Great Commission. He called them to go there. They gathered up. Jesus, Mark chapter 3, he gathered them together. And they came to him.
[time=1798] They got together. And then they connected at a more deep level, which we'll look at next week.
[time=1803] Mark never wrote it this way about gathering. He said a local church is more than a congregation,
[time=1809] and I totally agree. We're called to way more. Come next week and the following week, we'll talk about what that means. A local church is more than a congregation or a gathering. Here's what he says. But it is never less. It's kind of a beginning point, isn't it? Getting together.
[time=1822] And I'm thankful for all the tools that we have to help us do that. For those who can't be in a room, maybe you're traveling and you stay connected, but that connection begins with us coming together,
[time=1832] even by our own definition. I've learned it's hard to be the church if I don't even go to church.
[time=1837] You're here. Those of you in the room, you're like, "Woo, good. I'm glad I showed up today."
[time=1845] But maybe you're watching. I'm not here to condemn you. We're going to be here. Here's what online is. You know, what is our online ministry? It's the own ramp. It's not the destination.
[time=1853] It's tools to help us connect with shut-ins, to help us stay connected with people while they travel, or when you can't be here. But it's not a destination. It is an own ramp to community,
[time=1863] to deeper things that go beyond the roads, to go beyond the screens that go to the commission and the calling that Jesus modeled for us. So online is an own ramp. It's not a destination. We're going
[time=1874] to be there. I'm not here throwing stones at you. I love that we have such a great family that goes way beyond. We've got missionaries from across the seas that watch us every single week. Those are great things. But it's a beginning point. It's a launch pad. It's an own ramp. And today we're in a
[time=1890] season of change in our nation, our world, but certainly even locally in our church, a season of transition with my transition and God's call. And so here's what I'd challenge you with church.
[time=1899] If you're watching online and all of you in the room today, show up. Your church needs you today.
[time=1906] And even more than that, you need your church. We need each other. Be present. Show up on Sundays.
[time=1914] Make it a priority. Not does that mean you got a checkbox and Jesus is going to give you a spanking if you don't, if you miss a week or what to know, of course not. It's not a checklist.
[time=1924] But man, when you really know what we have and being a part of the family of God,
[time=1932] how would we ever want to disconnect from that? Let's show up. Let's be present. Make your presence
[time=1940] known. Sometimes your greatest present that you can give somebody is your presence.
[time=1944] So let's show up, especially in a season of change like we're in now. But why? Because God calls us to be contributors, not consumers. We're in a consumer-minded culture today,
[time=1956] but we're called to be contributors, to serve, to give, to show up. Not to say, "I didn't get
[time=1962] anything out of church today." What about us to begin with? David Jeremiah, I love it. Our 50th anniversary talked about the holy hatred. That was his word that he had for the times when people would leave a church and say, "Well, my needs weren't getting met." And here's what he said about that. At our 50th anniversary here, what a sweet time that was for us. He said, "I've found that if people would come to church to meet the needs of others, they would find that their needs get met every single time." Can I get an amen? But sometimes we're consumers and we think it's about
[time=1992] me, but it becomes about we when it first is about he, when Jesus is at the top of that list. The day
[time=1998] is drawing there, so let's maximize our days. Number eight is this from Hebrews 13, 15. "Is
[time=2004] gathering offers a sacrifice of praise to God." I know it's a sacrifice to get the kids ready.
[time=2008] My wife does it all by herself every Sunday. I'm here super early and it's a big sacrifice for her
[time=2014] to make it a priority for our kids. And she gets all three of our kids ready. And some of you are here and it's all you all the time. And I talked to a lady this morning and said, "Satan did everything he could to keep me from showing up today." But she was here at our earlier service. I'm guessing there's somebody in this room right now that's the same way. It's a sacrifice of praise to get ready, get up, to get out the door, to get there on time. I get those things, but we're called to what?
[time=2037] Therefore, let's read it together. Through him, then let us, what's that word?
[time=2040] Continually, not just on Christmas or Easter, not just on Sunday, all week, all year. Let us
[time=2047] continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God. That is the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name. And I want to give you two application points, especially if you have kids. Don't miss
[time=2058] this. Don't check out. I know you're like, "What's the update this coming? I want to hear those things. I want to go to lunch." Don't miss this, especially if you have kids or grandkids. Two words of application. The first one is priorities. Write that down in your notes, not on the screens, but write it down. Priorities. How are you internally making your relationship with God priority through
[time=2079] how you gather and be a part of and participate in God's church? Priorities. Number two, it's perspectives. How is your perspective being affected by how you're making God's
[time=2090] church a priority? Those are internal questions. Now use the same words and make them external, because if you're a parent, you've got a lot of little eyes. If you're a grandparent, if you influence anybody, you've got a lot of eyes looking to you. How are others seeing your priorities? And how are your priorities shaping their perspectives of Jesus by how you
[time=2109] participate in God's church? I think it's a great question that we should know the answer to,
[time=2115] and we should strive to look like Jesus and do what He's asked us to do. Not out of a have-to, but out of a get-to. I get to be a part of the family of God. That's why I should go to church.
[time=2126] That's why I want to be a part of gathering with the body of Christ. I want to ask you to bow your heads, ponder that, close your eyes for a moment. I'm going to give you a chance to pray and respond. Believers, what's your next step? Some of you today would say, I don't know that if I were to die today, I would spend eternity with God in heaven because of a personal relationship with Jesus. Today can be that day. If you're not sure of that, pray something like this from your heart. Say, "Dear Jesus, I give you me today. I know you died for me, for my sins.
[time=2153] I know you rose again in your life today. Forgive me, save me. I give you all of me. I surrender.
[time=2165] In your own words, cry that out to him. In this moment, may we respond as we reflect and take that next step, so we're never promised tomorrow. So take that step right now in this moment.
