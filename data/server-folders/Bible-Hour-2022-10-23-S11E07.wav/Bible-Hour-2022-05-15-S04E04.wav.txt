[time=0] [APPLAUSE]
[time=4] Man, I thank God for you guys.
[time=8] Man, I just said I was going to have my last Sunday sooner. If any of you are going to turn out like this, this is beautiful.
[time=16] Man, what a special, special day.
[time=20] I thank God for all that video, by the way, is to represent all of the great ways God is still working, and blackhawk.foi is still going to be filled with all kinds of stuff.
[time=28] And we're still going to worship God through giving every single week, because He gives to us, and we invite you into all those things. Get to do that and want some more here today, but man, this is just the beginning of what God has yet in story.
[time=40] You know, today, this week, quite an emotional little stretch.
[time=44] Can I get a name, man?
[time=48] I'll look over and see my Davidson family sitting in there.
[time=52] That's why I love you guys. From Coach, she's pointing up.
[time=56] That's what Coach would do. If you're here, it would teach us this, this. Let's do it together. This, this.
[time=64] That's how Coach would start us. That's what they're here doing.
[time=68] After a very long weekend, we love you guys so much. What an emotional week this has been leading up to today, but you know what? God is good. He is faithful.
[time=80] Great is His faithfulness. God is good all the time, and all the time, God is good.
[time=88] And I cannot think of a better thing for us to do on this Sunday, and Sunday filled with all kinds of emotions.
[time=96] It's like this, isn't it? Life? Is it not? It's like this?
[time=100] Then to focus on the horizon that is Jesus Christ.
[time=104] Then to focus on the mission that God has given to us. We've been in this series called This Is Us, and I get to get us into our last couple of weeks of it here.
[time=112] And how our mission and vision is very simple. Jesus gave it to us.
[time=116] The great commission is to make disciples. It's never changed.
[time=120] Through all the changing, shifting seasons of life, Jesus has remained the same. And because of that, how He views us stays the same. This is us.
[time=128] It's our mission. Our vision is to light the one-five locally in our four-six, eight-one-five zip code all the way to 15 regions globally all the way around the world.
[time=136] And these past couple of weeks we've been looking at our methods. Say it with me if you know it. Three things.
[time=140] Go, gather, connect, go. Ready one more time.
[time=144] It's gather, connect, go. Mark 3, 13 and 14.
[time=148] Great picture of how Jesus came up with this method. It wasn't ours at all.
[time=152] And so we've looked at gather and connect. And today, not ironic is the fact that I get to preach on go.
[time=160] And it's okay. You can laugh. Go ahead. It's good. Laughter's good for the soul.
[time=164] I've always said I've got to practice what I preach. So my last sermon as your lead pastor serving in this way, in this season is going to be one about what it looks like to go. To be used by God.
[time=176] To use your time, talent and treasure for His glory.
[time=180] So let's talk today about Go. Steadfast. Steadfast in shifting seasons. A little bit of an unconventional text maybe for a Go sermon.
[time=188] But then again, it's about a goodbye. It's Acts chapter 20.
[time=192] Acts chapter 20 is actually a model for a godly goodbye. But it's a model for a godly goodbye. This is actually more like a godly I'll see you later and we're going to serve in some different ways in this season because Paul is saying goodbye to a church that he loved so much.
[time=208] And I wrestled with the Lord. I said, "God, I don't think I can, with all the emotions of the week, I don't think I can do a godly goodbye passage this week." But this is what God said to do and so I'm going to be obedient. Yes is the answer, Lord. In shifting seasons.
[time=220] How can we be steadfast? So find your place. Acts chapter 20.
[time=224] Welcome to all of you who are tuning in from all over the place, all the way to everybody in the building with us today. Steadfast. Let's talk about that word.
[time=232] We sang it earlier. I'll remain steadfast, steadfast.
[time=236] Steadfast in shifting seasons. Steadfast is defined this way in the Oxford dictionary, resolutely or dutifully firm and unwavering. I think that's a good word for us. Jesus is the epitome of that.
[time=252] Scripture reminds us that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever. And in shifting seasons we need to be reminded of how we can be steadfast because he is steadfast. Let's go to Acts chapter 20. I'm going to give you three things that we can hold on to three ways we can be steadfast even in shifting seasons in our lives. Are you ready for the word today church?
[time=272] Give somebody a fist bump if you are at home and in the room. And let's dig in Acts chapter 20. Let's go to verse 17 and I will read through verse 21 to start. Paul says this. This is what we learn in Acts about Paul.
[time=284] Now from Melitus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church to come to him. And when they came to him he said to them, "You yourselves know how I lived among you the whole time from the first day I set foot in Asia, serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials that happened to me through the plots of the Jews. How I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable and teaching you in public and from house to house." Isn't that a great picture of where we've been these last couple of weeks?
[time=312] Verse 21, "Testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance towards God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ." Quick disclaimer, in no way as I'm reading this do I even begin to equate myself with Paul.
[time=324] But I sure am glad that we can learn from him in goodbyes and shifting seasons. He looked back then didn't he at what they had been through together and that's what I want us to do for a few minutes and we're going to learn from him together how we can be steadfast. Write this down. Number one, number one, appreciate. I'm going to give you a verb with each of these because it doesn't do us any good if we just talk about it. Can I get an amen? So let's appreciate God's blessing in our past. That's what Paul did as those things were said. He appreciated all of the blessings of the Lord in their past together as he looked back. So we are to in shifting seasons constantly. This is true. Listen of our church right now in a season of transition, corporately speaking, but personally life goes like this doesn't it? Some of you have walked through tough times slightly.
[time=372] Some of you are experiencing grief and loss and pain. Some of you are in joys, the peaks, the valleys, but in all of those seasons as they come and go we are called to be steadfast and we serve a God who already is and it is so important. Even though Jesus is not the great I was he's the great I am. I believe that was said yesterday very eloquently.
[time=392] He's the God of what will be. He's the God of what will come.
[time=396] He teaches us what it looks like to be appreciative of what God has done in our past. And so I sent out a letter to all of you and I'm going to read some of these things to you knowing good and well that 1 Corinthians 3 verse 6 is true. God is the giver of growth. We only plant and water. God brings the growth but it's so important for us to be mindful of, to be celebratory towards and to appreciate all that God has been doing. Here's a list that was in the email and the letter that I wrote to you guys back a few months ago. Just recapping a few of the things God has done over these last several years together.
[time=428] Hundreds of people have given their lives to Jesus. Some 250 people got baptized just like we've seen today. Over 50 mission partners that we've continued to pour into. We've developed a great online ministry that's robust.
[time=440] Our congregation is continually and multiplying in its diversity looking like the demographics of the community in which God has planted us. Our outward focus has continued to multiply our culture of presenting the gospel, reaching the loss.
[time=456] It is only just beginning and equipping the save with a discipleship journey to what people on a pathway of growth. Dozens of life groups have been launched.
[time=464] Millions of dollars have been given to missions and to building and up-drating and caring for and expanding our amazing facilities that are now among the most excellent facilities in our church's 50 plus year history.
[time=476] And it's all debt free. We have no debt as a church. We are financially stable as a church because you've continued to give so generously. We have endless opportunities to light the 1-5 with an Acts 1-8 strategy and the list could just continue to go on and for all that I want us to give God a roaring hand clap of praise to tell him thank you as we appreciate his blessings in our past.
[time=500] God we appreciate all of your blessings in our past and I'll tell you
[time=506] my favorite thing through all of it is seeing people come to Christ, eternity has changed, but through all of that what tops the list for me are their relationships.
[time=518] I thought I was out of tears.
[time=522] I look around and I see all your faces.
[time=526] And there's people hate me and I love you too.
[time=530] I see people that I've done weddings for.
[time=534] I see people I've done funerals for children just baptized on to their son's funeral. I see people that we've walked through a lot of lows. I see people we've walked through a lot of highs.
[time=546] And I thank God for the people. That's what it's all about.
[time=549] God has brought us together. You know what I say every Sunday? Just about all of you for me say it because I said it to you. Blackhawk is a great family.
[time=556] And just so you know you're stuck with me for eternity.
[time=560] Don't think for a second that this is goodbye. You're stuck with me forever in eternity. We have different roles in the meantime, but I thank God for the relationships and I was reminded many times as I've been reflecting this week's been a heavy week as we walked with the Davidson family and more in the loss of a giant of a man, Mark Davidson, our coach. And I was reminded of the first few months that when I came here I've done a lot of funerals. Even in that first little stretch I see faces for husbands, wives.
[time=588] But in my first couple of few months there we had a funeral for Joe Cox.
[time=592] It was a big funeral. It was a big deal. Many of you were there for that. How many of you are here for that?
[time=596] You remember that? Yeah. And then this last week in the last stretch, Coach Mark.
[time=600] And I got to tell you guys, man.
[time=604] Boys, you guys shared yesterday.
[time=610] Mitch and I in the funeral, these all five of the older boys shared.
[time=616] And Mitch and I said we should have just prayed at the beginning and prayed at the end.
[time=622] I couldn't be more proud of you guys.
[time=626] I don't have words and I got plenty all the time.
[time=630] I'm so proud of you. I love you guys. And I want to show this picture because the people, these stories are what make it all so celebratory as we appreciate. This is probably a pretty familiar picture to all of you. Coach would gather the troops and then players, coaches, people from all the other teams.
[time=650] And he would share his story. And every time he would share the gospel.
[time=654] And I'm going to let him do it again. I read this in his funeral service just yesterday. But here's what he said.
[time=658] This is what Coach said. And man, by the way, aren't you glad Coach is doing way better than us today?
[time=662] I can't imagine how great it's going up there. Well done.
[time=666] Good, a faithful servant. But here's what he said in one of these such circles and what he would like for us to hold on to today. He said this.
[time=674] When I think about the scripture in Matthew 1626, it says, what does it profit a man if he gains everything in the world? And yet, forfeits his soul.
[time=682] Because one day we're all going to stand before our Creator and we are going to have to give an account of how we lived our life. And on that day, fellas, I'm telling you, it is not going to matter. You're scoring average. It's not going to matter.
[time=694] The trophies you've won or the banners you put in the gym. That stuff will be absolutely meaningless. And all that matters on that day is, did you receive Jesus Christ as your Savior?
[time=706] And I tell you guys, that is the greatest decision you can ever make.
[time=710] He offers a free gift of salvation to each and every one of you and I would encourage you.
[time=714] If you have never made that decision, I would encourage you to do so.
[time=718] And all God's people said, thank God for these stories.
[time=722] For watching Coach sit right over there, even when he wasn't physically able to stand quite like he used to. And boy, when he stood, you knew.
[time=730] He sat with his arms lifted high.
[time=734] And it led to these fellas representing Jesus and sharing the gospel like they did yesterday. And they're here today, just like they were after every late Saturday night sitting in their spot. I thank God for his blessings in our past.
[time=746] As we look back, God has done amazing things. And all God's people said, let's continue because God blesses us in our past so that right now he's doing something special. Let's read on further.
[time=758] Acts chapter 20, let's go to verse 22. I'll read through verse 27.
[time=762] We see, and now, and now, shifting to present. And now behold, I'm going to Jerusalem constrained by the Spirit, not knowing what will happen to me there, except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me that in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me. But I do not account my life of any value, nor as precious to myself. If only I may finish my course.
[time=786] And the ministry that I receive from the Lord Jesus to testify to the gospel of the grace of God. And now, he says it again, present.
[time=794] And now behold, I know that none of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will see my face again. And by the way, one way I don't identify with Paul. I have no plans to be, we'll be back at four-way. And I'm glad that's not true of me.
[time=806] Paul knew, listen, they would probably never see his face again. He knew he would probably not just be in prison but killed at this point. And I don't know what tomorrow holds.
[time=814] I'm not promised tomorrow, and neither are you. And I hope maybe we get to see each other's face again.
[time=818] But if we don't, I pray that we can live lives just like Mark Davidson's just like Paul did in these moments. Can I get an amen?
[time=826] Verse 27, he says for, verse 26, "Therefore I testify to you on this day, I'm innocent of the blood of all of you, for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God." Number two is to accept God's call in our present. Appreciate God's blessing in our past, but accept God's call in our present. He says, "And now he shifts from the past to the present, and what shifted him is being constrained by the Spirit of God." I can relate with that because I wouldn't be here in Fort Wayne if it weren't for the constraining calling, pulling of the Spirit of God.
[time=862] I'll never forget the workings of God in my heart. I didn't know what God was doing, but I knew he had something different, something new. He just stirred it in me. And yet again now, not just as I came, but as I go, the same thing happens. And it's a hard thing to feel that constraining pull of the Spirit, but it is a powerful thing that we must listen to.
[time=882] Because they are 43, verses 18 and 19, I want to read these to you. These were things God used in my life back then, and it's funny, not funny, not ironic. It's every time that the word of God always speaks to us in different seasons. It remains the same. It remains constant as does our Jesus, but God uses his word to speak to us in different seasons and shifting seasons in different ways to help us be steadfast. This is one of those for me, verse 18. Remember not the former things.
[time=910] We appreciate the things that God has done in the past, but we're letting God work in the present.
[time=914] Remember not the former things nor consider the things of old. Look at verse 19.
[time=918] "Behold, I am doing a new thing. Now it springs forth.
[time=922] Do you not perceive it?" You need to underline that word in your Bibles or like poke it on your phone or something like that. It's that powerful, perceive it. We'll get back to it.
[time=930] He says, "I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert." And it was that passage that God really used back in the day to foster a mindset and a philosophy you've heard me share with you many times, and on this sermon today, I cannot let it go by without one more time reminding you that this should be our posture. Here it is. The answer is yes, Lord.
[time=950] Now what is the question? Now what is the question? This is present.
[time=954] This is now because God is doing something new in you. He's doing something new in our church. He's doing something new and maybe your family, but in your heart today. Look at me for a minute. In your heart today, God wants to do something new.
[time=966] He's not done with you yet. You're here. There's breath in your lungs. His mercies are new every day, every morning as he wants to do something new in you. That word "perceive." I'm doing a new thing. Will you not perceive it? It doesn't just mean like, "Hey, don't you see it? Look, open your eyes and look at it." That's not what it's meaning. The original language there has a way deeper meaning, something like this, to be acquainted with to accept even, and which is our verb, accepting God's call, to embrace to know. And here's how it can also be translated to make known or to declare. So this is saying, "God, you're doing something new. I accept it. I don't just see it, but I internalize it. And I'm going to know it and walk with it and receive it. And I'm going to declare it and make it known in my life. I'm going to walk with you and trust you to do the stuff that I cannot do. It's a way deeper meaning.
[time=1014] So don't say, "Yeah, I perceive it unless you really do." Because God will stretch you when you do. Appreciate God's blessing in our past.
[time=1022] Accept God's call in our present. What's God doing in you right now?
[time=1026] How's He stretching you as you appreciate what was?
[time=1030] What's God doing in the right now? And when you do that, number three will happen, but to get there, let's read what we see about Paul as we continue here together. Acts, chapter 20, let's read verses 28 where we left off, all the way through verse 36. So here he shifts us now to the future. What do they do with all of this?
[time=1046] Pay careful attention, he says, to yourselves, and to all of the flock, which in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, he's talking to the elders of the church, to care for the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood. I know that after my departure, here we go, future stuff, fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock, verse 30, and from among your own selves will arise men, speaking twisted things to draw away the disciples after them.
[time=1074] Therefore, here's what we do with this. Therefore, be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish everyone with tears, and now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
[time=1090] I coveted no one's silver or gold or apparel.
[time=1094] You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities and to those who are with me in all things. I have shown you that by working hard in this way, we must help the weak, and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, and now he himself said, "It is more blessed to give than to receive." And when he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all. Number three is to anticipate God's plan for our future. Definitely appreciate his blessing in our past. No doubt except his call and his stirrings right now in the present, but anticipate, lean into and look for and look forward to his plan for our future.
[time=1134] And he does have one. Just like it was for Paul, the season was shifting. My season of leadership in this church and this role comes to an end today. But you know what does not?
[time=1146] Your commitment. God's vision.
[time=1150] Our being family. Our being on team Jesus together. But he knew two big dangers would happen. Verses 29 and 30. Here's two dangers that Paul points out. The first one is in verse 29.
[time=1162] The second one is the biggest dangers from verse 30, and it's inside the church.
[time=1166] Then he says in verse 30, and even from among your own selves, people are going to speak twisted things and draw away the disciples and say, "It is not just for us today, but for the church." The second one is the biggest dangers from verse 30, and it's inside the church.
[time=1182] Then he says in verse 30, "And even from among your own selves, people are going to speak twisted things and draw away the disciples isn't it crazy to think that Satan, the enemy, would use children of God to tear down the work of God amongst the church of God.
[time=1202] But I have found that his greatest tool that he often uses are believers that get very distracted.
[time=1210] He's not worried about people who don't believe. If he can distract us as God's church and get us focused on everything but our mission and our vision, everything but making disciples and lighting the one-five, gathering, connecting and going, will then will implode from the inside out. He loves to use shifting seasons like transitions to let preferences start to rear their head or let agendas rise to the top. In church, you've got an amazing elder board, amazing pastor, staff, leaders, deacons, and you are an amazing family and may it not be so for us. Definitely not from outside the church, but certainly not inside the church will those dangers arise and take over and tear down the great and amazing work and foundations that God has built is building and has only just begun to explode to light the one-five in this area and around the world. May we lean in as a church family to that, not succumbing to those two dangers.
[time=1262] To tie all this together with those last verses, here's what I want to do. Free, you want to give you a challenge forward, just like Paul was doing and I'm going to use a lot of his words to do this, give you seven things to hold tight, to hold near, to hold dear, to hold onto and shifting seasons. Seven things you can hold tight to as you move into new seasons. We do this as a church, but we also do this individually as God leads us. Let's write these down together. The first one is Jesus centered everything. I toiled over the word to use for this one. I got real profound. I just chose everything.
[time=1294] It's like what should be Jesus centered? Well, everything.
[time=1298] Everything. I pray if I've done one thing as your pastor is we have lifted high the name of Jesus and in every service and in every meeting and in every gathering and every life group that the name of Jesus gets lifted high that what Mark Davidson stood on this stage and said as they talked about their journey through cancer. He talked about their prayer for healing that continued but said my prayer shifted and my number one prayer is Jesus be exalted. Never forget that moment. I pray that that's who we are as God's Church. That we lift high the name of Jesus no matter what comes our way. Verse 32 he starts with this. He says I commend you to God. Everything goes back to God. Jesus is the word that was made flesh. So church here's what I challenge you to do. Keep Jesus your focus reach the lost unapologetically make disciples with all that you've got. This is God's Church. It's God's mission and for over 50 years God has been faithful to his church at Black Hawk and he is just getting started. Don't let the mission get marginalized by all the stuff in life and in our world.
[time=1362] Make our mission my friends bigger. Make our vision bigger than the problems that will come.
[time=1370] Magnify the mission. Magnify the vision and it will shrink down the problems. Make Jesus your focus because I've taught you over and over what you magnify will. Multiply let's say it together what you magnify will multiply. So let us magnify the name of Jesus. Hold tight and shifting seasons. You can be steadfast when you hold to the name above every name. The name that never changes and we have Jesus centered everything.
[time=1398] Number two abundant grace. You can't have Jesus centered everything without abundant grace. He says I commend you to God and to the word of His grace. We hold to the word of God here at Black Hawk unapologetically but you can't hold to the word of God without knowing the God of the word and you can't know the God of the word without showing abundant grace because He showed abundant grace to us first. I praise God that He did so may we have abundant grace. It noticed that it has said the word of His grace. So have abundant grace. Have grace for your leaders. Look at me for a minute. Look at me. I know y'all know I'm a knucklehead. You already know that.
[time=1430] But your leaders in the days ahead, a few things are going to happen. They're going to make mistakes. They're going to make decisions that you won't like. Yeah I'm talking to you.
[time=1446] Have grace for your leaders. As you've done with me trust them because there's a plurality of them. It never hinged on me.
[time=1454] It still does it today. There's a plurality. There's a big great group of leaders that God has called in this season to lead you for. Trust them and follow them as they follow Jesus because we all follow Jesus together. Lean in in this season.
[time=1470] Have grace for your leaders. And as you do listen do not neglect how you talk about the bride of Christ in this season. Because as preferences don't get met and you're hoping that this changes or that changes. Have grace for your leaders.
[time=1482] But also have grace with your speech. Have grace with your conversation.
[time=1486] Consider the impact of how you talk about the bride of Christ.
[time=1490] The body of Christ. The church. The local church at Blackhawk. In front of your children.
[time=1494] And in front of other people. Because it shapes how they see Jesus as you talk about God's church. So we'll go some of the trajectory of how they see the church of God. And so may we with our speech show grace. May we show grace to our leaders. May we build up the body of Christ. Have grace for your new pastor. You guys prayed for me for over two years. You didn't even know me. And you had to show me a lot of grace.
[time=1518] And I showed you a lot of grace. And grace has carried us for show grace for your new pastor. He'll make mistakes too. And God's already working in his heart. He may not even have a clue who he is or what God is doing.
[time=1530] Show grace to him and lift him up in prayer as you've prayed and lifted up me. Show grace for each other. Consider how much grace you require. And give it out accordingly.
[time=1542] Show grace for each other. And show grace for how you engage with a world that's lost and dying. Don't expect redeemed behavior from the people I've heard it said. Mr. Raybur, love them like Jesus. And may we be known
[time=1558] as the disciples of Jesus because of the love that we have for one another.
[time=1562] As we love, as he loved us, the world's going to know he's the son of God and that we are his disciples. So let's have grace. Abundant grace. Jesus centered everything. Abundant grace. Number three, have constant encouragement.
[time=1574] Verse 32 he says it will build you up in a world that is constantly tearing down. Look for ways to encourage. Look for ways to build each other up. Be builders in a world that is tearing itself apart. We've talked about the ratio of encouragement to criticism. I think it's still probably about the same. I think it was six to one. We average about six criticisms that we give out for every one encouragement. I say let's reverse the ratio. Let's give out at least six encouragements for every one criticism. Look for ways to build up. Not to tear down. Number four, persistent unity.
[time=1610] I say persistent because unity takes hard work. Unity takes hard work.
[time=1614] Paul says among all, how many is that? Again, what's that word? Just making sure you're awake. Among all those who are sanctified. That means even the people that drive you the craziest. Them to persistent hardworking, steadfast unity. Pursue it with all that you've got. Church, keep the primary things primary. Give grace and preference to one another about the secondary things. Don't let the enemy use those things to tear us apart. Don't allow seeds of discord or of gossip.
[time=1642] Talk to the person, not about the person as you deal with issues. Believe the best and live and trust for Jesus and then love one another even through the knucklehead mistakes that they're going to make in the days ahead. Prioritize your relationships over being right.
[time=1658] Guard against the dangers from outside the church and inside the church that we just talked about. Remember, the church is a family. Things get hard.
[time=1666] When it does, don't run away. Step in.
[time=1670] Lean in. Don't pull back.
[time=1674] The mission is just beginning. In fact, it's already been going.
[time=1678] Way before you and me, but God's role for us in that mission is just beginning. Let's have persistent unity. Number five, faithful service.
[time=1686] Verse 35, he says, working hard in this way. We must help the weak. Reminds me of light the one five. We're not called to put our light under a bushel. We're not called to hide it in a bush. We're not called to put it in a church building. These are amazing facilities, but they are just buildings and they will one day be meaningless and will burn down and go away.
[time=1706] What will not is the people of God in the mission and the light we have in Jesus. May we be faithful with our service to give of our time and our talent and our treasures and constantly serve. Lift others up.
[time=1718] Help the weak. Be Jesus to a lost and dying world that needs his light. Be faithful.
[time=1726] I pray that your faithful service will lead you beyond the black hawk bubble. We talk about that a lot. Let's burst that black hawk bubble. We tend to want to make it tight and close. Nobody else can come in.
[time=1738] If we're honest, it gets really comfortable, but I believe comfort can be one of the greatest enemies of our calling. Go beyond the black hawk bubble. Go beyond your comfort zone. Be ambassadors. I've shared with you many times we say a seat for everyone. Look around. There's all kinds of seats in this building for a reason because we want there to be a seat for everyone. We know that that is who Jesus is and listen to my brothers, my sisters, there will not be a seat for everyone until you and me get uncomfortable in ours.
[time=1766] So don't settle in and comfort. Let God do the big things in your life that he is showing up to do. Don't shrink back, step up and lean in with how you serve with your time and your talent, but also your treasure. Number six is generous giving. Number six, generous giving. He quotes Jesus. He said, "Even our Lord Jesus said it this way. So more blessed to give than to receive. Be generous.
[time=1786] Church, you have been such a generous church. We're financially stable.
[time=1790] We're debt free. We're giving to missions like crazy. We're mobilizing missionaries. We're multiplying ministry because God is using us. Did you know this little secret about giving? He doesn't eat you. He doesn't, he owns it all. It's his.
[time=1806] You're like, "Well, good. I'm off the hook." No? Because he calls us family and he gives us the privilege of giving.
[time=1814] If you don't see it that way, I double dog dare you to give it a start. And for those of you who are like, "Yeah, you're just saying that because you get your salary here. Well, I'm leaving and I'm still saying it because I believe that much, I believe that much in the power of being generous.
[time=1830] God has given everything to us." We always say it this way. We don't give to Blackhawk. No, we give to Jesus. We give to the Lord.
[time=1838] We do it through Blackhawk. We do it through the local church so that his ministry can multiply in us and through us. And you will be blessed.
[time=1846] God says, "Test me in this. Try him. If you don't take my double dog dare take his. He doesn't give back to you necessarily in the ways you want with all the dollar signs, but he'll bless you. So be generous just as Jesus said. Be obedient to God." That's what giving really is. We give to him.
[time=1862] We do it through our local church, which is his plan. And lastly, and certainly not least, number seven is unceasing prayer.
[time=1870] Verse 36, "After he'd said these things,
[time=1878] he knelt down and prayed with him all.
[time=1882] God, I want to do the same thing with you. I want to ask all of you on. Do this in your couches, in your rooms, wherever you're at, wherever you're watching.
[time=1890] Be weird in the restaurant, whatever you need to do." In the building though, I want to ask those of you who are willing and able. Some of you can't get up and that's totally fine. You can stay in your seat, but I'm going to kneel.
[time=1898] That's what Paul did. I'm going to do the same thing. I'm going to kneel right here and I'm going to pray over all of you and lead you in a time of prayer. Let's fill the altar. If you're willing and able, get in your seats, get in the aisles, stay in your seat, wherever you're at.
[time=1910] Just come and move even right now as we live out this number seven.
[time=1914] Let's be unceasing in our prayer. Let's do that together.
[time=1918] And as you're coming, believers,
[time=1936] what's God calling you to do to be steadfast in this moment, huh?
[time=1940] He's stretching you. Lean into it.
[time=1944] And I've said to the Lord, this has been my call and commitment.
[time=1948] Anytime I have a microphone, I make the gospel clear.
[time=1952] Some of you right now, as we kneel, you need Jesus.
[time=1956] You need a bended knee to say, "God, I'm such a sinner." And I give you me. Pray this from your heart right now. It's like Jesus, I know I'm a sinner.
[time=1966] I need your grace. Will you forgive me? Will you save me?
[time=1972] I know you died for me and I know you rose again.
[time=1976] In this moment, I want to give us just a moment of silence to be still.
[time=1982] Be still and know that he is God. Take that next step as you do.
[time=1996] And we need to smoke in those things.
[time=2006] He knelt down and prayed with him all.
[time=2010] God, I want to stand on your models, not just talk about what you said, but do what you did.
[time=2014] You did that through Paul, and so God, I want to do that right now.
[time=2018] God, we appreciate all your blessings in our past.
[time=2022] Thank you, Lord. You're the giver of all growth.
[time=2026] God, we accept your call for our present.
[time=2030] Your plans are way better than ours. Your thoughts are not our thoughts.
[time=2034] Your ways are not our ways. They're so much higher.
[time=2038] And God, we're so excited. Today's not a day of sadness as we accept your call in our present. It's a day of joy.
[time=2045] These are tears of joy, God.
[time=2047] As we appreciate what you've done in our past, as we accept what you're doing in our present, and God, we anticipate what you're going to do in our future.
[time=2055] God, this church is your church, and you have only just begun.
[time=2061] God, you're going to change lives. You're going to build on these foundations in ways.
[time=2065] I can't wait to champion. I can't wait to celebrate.
[time=2068] You're going to call the next pastor, and I'm going to be his biggest fan, and I can't wait to see how you use him to continue building that which you are building.
[time=2077] Jesus, you said, "I will build my church," and even the gates of hell won't prevail against it.
[time=2082] We claim that. We thank you for that.
[time=2087] It got through all the shifting seasons of life, grief, and loss of death, pain,
[time=2093] even the celebrations and joys, the peaks and the valleys.
[time=2097] We know that eternity is ours with you together.
[time=2102] This one today is a see you later. That's why yesterday's funeral is a see you later.
[time=2106] God, we thank you for Jesus. We lift high the name of Jesus. Jesus be exalted.
[time=2113] Jesus be exalted.
[time=2116] God, as Paul said, I commend this amazing group of people to you.
[time=2124] God, thank you for the privilege it has been. They've loved my family so much.
[time=2129] I remember asking them to do so. They walked with us through adoption.
[time=2134] Salvation's baptisms. Thank you.
[time=2138] We love you. We commit this church, this body, this family to you.
[time=2143] It's your church. We do it in Jesus name, and all guys people say.
[time=2147] Amen. Amen. Let's give Jesus a shout of praise. Let's clap.
[time=2151] Give him some praise in this place today.
[time=2160] You can take your time going to your seats for a moment. I'll ask Curtis to come and join us.
[time=2164] And as he does, I've got a couple of Scriptures on to read over you.
[time=2172] Thank you for that privilege church. I'll never forget that.
[time=2177] Philippians chapter 1, verse 3. This is what Paul said.
[time=2182] I thank my God every time I remember you. That I will forever.
[time=2188] Verse 6 of the same passage is what Paul says.
[time=2191] Being confident of this. You know, you can be confident. Today's not a day of sadness.
[time=2195] These are tears, but they're tears of the way it's supposed to be.
[time=2198] We're brothers and sisters. We're family. But we're just getting started.
[time=2201] We're on Team Jesus together. That's why we're confident.
[time=2204] We know. Have you read the end? Let me ask you one more time.
[time=2206] Have you read the end? I've read the end. And Jesus wins.
[time=2210] Yeah, that's right.
[time=2215] And that is why we are confident of this, that he will began a good work in you.
[time=2219] We'll carry it on to the day of completion, to the day of Jesus Christ.
[time=2223] Thank you for loving my family, walking with us through adoption, salvation, baptisms.
[time=2232] Thank you for embracing change, even though some of us kicked and screamed along the way a little bit.
[time=2239] Thank you for trusting, following me as I follow Jesus.
[time=2243] Thank you for following Jesus together with me, as his children.
[time=2247] As they have 55, verse 12 is what I'll leave with you.
[time=2250] This has been my New Jessica's prayer. This first part, just the first two lines.
[time=2253] You will go out in joy, be led forth in peace.
[time=2258] That is our prayer. We all get to do that. We're going to do that, but will you?
[time=2262] You be led forth into whatever God is doing in your life with joy.
