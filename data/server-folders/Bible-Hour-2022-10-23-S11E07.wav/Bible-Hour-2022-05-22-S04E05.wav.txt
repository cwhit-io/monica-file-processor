[time=0] But today I want to look at the word vision in four different areas.
[time=5] The first is vision for our church.
[time=8] We have a clearly-divined vision from the Word of God.
[time=12] At Blackhawk, our vision is to light the one-five.
[time=16] As we define that in our documents for the last few years, that means several things.
[time=20] It's based on the verse John 1-5.
[time=23] The light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it.
[time=28] And we do that by taking the light of Jesus to dark places, starting with our own zip code, taking the light of Jesus into our 15 surrounding zip codes, and taking the light
[time=39] of Jesus into 15 strategic world regions.
[time=43] In addition to that, just over a year ago, the elders and senior staff of the church met to shape our vision further, and we identified the desire to develop 1,500 ambassadors by our 60th anniversary.
[time=55] People who would be disciples who make disciples.
[time=59] That is the vision of our church.
[time=60] You've heard Kevin say that many times, and we do these things by gathering, connecting, and going.
[time=66] You've heard him say that many times.
[time=67] It's all based on Acts 1-8.
[time=70] Jesus' last words before ascending to heaven, he said, "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and all Judea and Samaria and to the end of the earth." I think there are three big ways you can look at that statement.
[time=87] Literally, Jerusalem is the city that welcomed Jesus as the conquering hero in the city where he was beaten and crucified just days later.
[time=96] Judea was the region Jerusalem was located in.
[time=99] It included Bethlehem and the surrounding region.
[time=102] Samaria was the area just north of Jerusalem, located between Judea and Galilee, covering about 50, 60 miles, so it would have taken about 50, 60 hours to walk it.
[time=113] The only real mode of transportation for most people in those days.
[time=117] And remember, from the story of the Good Samaritan, we know that these are people that did not like each other, did not get along, didn't have things in common.
[time=126] And then the ends of the earth.
[time=127] In Jesus' day, this would have basically been Europe, Africa, and Asia.
[time=132] All else was known about the other continents beyond the oceans, and even to think about those three continents would have felt like the end of the earth to people in Jesus' day.
[time=143] Imagine getting to Eastern Asia or Southern Africa when all you can do is walk.
[time=147] It would have been like getting to Mars feels like to us.
[time=151] The other way to look at that statement is relative to our current world.
[time=154] Jerusalem is Fort Wayne, Judea maybe is Indiana, Samaria is the Midwest, and the ends of the
[time=161] earth are still the ends of the earth.
[time=164] Parenthetically, Jerusalem is your home.
[time=169] It's where you're known.
[time=170] It's where you live and you work with the people you love.
[time=175] Judea is your region.
[time=176] For us, maybe Indiana, perhaps the Midwest, it's the area outside of your immediate home where you travel the most, you know the most outside of your home.
[time=185] Samaria is a distant place, probably a place where you don't feel inside of your comfort
[time=191] zone.
[time=193] Maybe for you geographically, it's the West Coast or the Deep South or taking it further.
[time=197] Maybe it's Russia or China, but I think more importantly, more to the point, it could be even here when you're in a new and strange setting.
[time=206] And the ends of the earth, parenthetically, I would say that means wherever you go, whatever you do, whoever you're with, as you are going, let your life speak the gospel.
[time=217] You should actually scream the gospel from every mountaintop in every valley and every spot in between.
[time=225] That is the vision for our church.
[time=229] In God's Word, the vision for the church is laid out, and there are many instructions and directions for us as the church, the bride of Christ.
[time=241] The Bible, mainly through the words of Jesus and Paul, give us a very good picture of the church.
[time=247] Jesus states in Matthew 16, 18 that he will build his church on this rock and the gates
[time=254] of hell won't stand against it.
[time=255] We sang that this morning.
[time=258] And a lot of people confuse that because he says it to Peter, and it kind of reads like Peter, you're the rock, I'm building it on you, but no.
[time=265] This is right after Peter exclaims that Jesus, you are the Christ.
[time=271] That is the rock that we are built upon.
[time=273] Ephesians 2.20 says it in a different way that we just sang.
[time=278] Christ is the cornerstone.
[time=281] He is our cornerstone.
[time=282] He is our rock.
[time=283] He is what the church is built upon.
[time=286] Paul describes our relationship as the church with Jesus comparing it to husbands and wives
[time=292] and to marriage.
[time=294] In Ephesians 5.25 to 32, he says, "Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing
[time=305] of water with the words so that he might present the church to himself and splendor without spot or wrinkle or any such thing that she might be holy and without blemish.
[time=314] In the same way, husbands should love their wives as their own bodies.
[time=318] He who loves his wife loves himself for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes it and cherishes it.
[time=325] Just as Christ does the church because we are members of his body, therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife and the two shall become one flesh.
[time=335] This mystery is profound and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church.
[time=340] It sounds like he's talking about marriage and he is, but he's talking about Christ and us.
[time=346] We are the bride of Christ.
[time=350] Inside God's word, there are many instructions.
[time=352] I want to highlight ten of them today that his word gives to us.
[time=357] Ten things for the church to do.
[time=361] Number one, we are to gather.
[time=363] Matthew 18, 20 says, "Where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them."
[time=370] When we gather here on a Sunday, when we gather on a Wednesday night, when we gather in life groups, when you gather with another believer, Jesus is there.
[time=378] His spirit is right here moving among us.
[time=382] When we gather, Christ is with us.
[time=386] Number two, a church should be elder-led.
[time=390] Titus 1 through 5 through 9, Paul writes, "This is why I left you in Crete so that you might put what remained into order in a point elders in every town as I directed you.
[time=399] If anyone is above reproach, the husband of one wife and his children are believers and not open to the charge of debauchery or insubordination, for an overseer as God steward must be above reproach.
[time=410] He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined.
[time=420] He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught so that he might be able to give instruction and sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it."
[time=429] A church is to be elder-led, but I want to make no mistake.
[time=435] At the elder room, we have looked at this verse and others Paul has written like it.
[time=440] We do not reach that standard.
[time=443] I fail in these areas every day, all the time.
[time=450] I only make it through his grace, by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone.
[time=458] So our elders, very much myself included, are flawed.
[time=464] We are humans, we're going to make mistakes.
[time=466] In this season, we need your grace, we need your prayers, we need your patience because
[time=472] while we're going to strive to live to this standard of the Paul outlines for us in Titus, we will fail.
[time=479] We won't make it, we won't be perfect, we will make mistakes, there will be bad days.
[time=485] So please keep us in your thoughts and your prayers and give us your patience.
[time=491] The only way we can make it is by his grace through faith.
[time=497] Number three, we're to make disciples and baptize them.
[time=501] We often call this the Great Commission at the end of Matthew in 28.
[time=506] It says, "And Jesus came and said to them, 'All authority in heaven and earth has been given to me, so go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have can manage you and behold, I am with you always to the end of the age.
[time=523] Make disciples and baptize them.'" We do that here at Blackhawk, we will continue to do that here at Blackhawk.
[time=531] We protect the gospel, that's the fourth direction in God's Word for the church.
[time=536] Protect the gospel.
[time=539] Galatians 1, 6 through 9, Paul says, "I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel, not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.
[time=555] But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed." As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed.
[time=572] I don't know if you'll find this comforting, but take comfort in the fact there's nothing new under the sun.
[time=580] You may wake up each day, today in our world, in our present day and think, what is going on?
[time=587] What is happening?
[time=588] The gospel is being perverted, it's being twisted, it's being denied, it's being overlooked.
[time=593] It's not being lived out.
[time=596] Again, take comfort in the fact that was happening from day one in Paul's day.
[time=602] The moment Jesus left, people were twisting the gospel, perverting the gospel, using it
[time=609] for their own good, making things up, there is nothing new under the sun.
[time=616] We're not living in any tougher times than Paul was, we're living in the same times.
[time=622] Number five, celebrate the Lord's Supper.
[time=626] We do this here at Black Hawk once a month, there is no direction on exactly how frequently to do it.
[time=631] Some churches do it every week, some do it every month, some do it periodically.
[time=636] We're just told to celebrate the Lord's Supper, and in 1 Corinthians 11, 23 and 24 it tells us why.
[time=641] "For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread.
[time=648] And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, 'This is my body, which is for you.
[time=652] Do this in remembrance of me.'"
[time=658] Proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
[time=662] Remember his death and sacrifice for us.
[time=666] The next few directions we get from God's Word are more about practical things that we should be doing in our daily lives.
[time=672] The way we're to live things out here in our present day, in our current situation.
[time=677] Verse 6, "Bless and build each other up." 1 Corinthians 14, 26 says, "What then, brothers, when you come together, each one has a hymn,
[time=686] a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation.
[time=689] Let all things be done for building up." We are to love each other, we're to take care of each other, we're to bring our different gifts together to bless and build each other up.
[time=699] Let's always be a church that is about giving all glory to God and loving each other.
[time=705] If we will do that, it's going to be okay.
[time=709] Number 7 takes it even further.
[time=711] Take care of physical needs.
[time=713] James 2, 14 through 17 says, "What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith
[time=719] but does not have works?" Can that faith save him?
[time=723] If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, "Go in peace and be warmed and filled without giving them the things they needed for the body." What good is that?
[time=736] So also, faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.
[time=742] Strong words, hard words to wrestle with at times.
[time=747] But we know this, works will not save us, they won't.
[time=752] Works are an outflowing, they are evidence of our faith.
[time=756] If our faith is alive and real, we will do good works in the name of Jesus.
[time=765] Our works won't save us, but faith that is dead is dead.
[time=772] Number 8, be a true community.
[time=775] In Acts 2, 42 through 47, the Bible tells us they devoted themselves to the apostles'
[time=781] teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers, and all came over
[time=787] every soul and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles, and all who believed were together and had all things in common.
[time=794] And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all as any had need.
[time=800] And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having favor with all people.
[time=809] And the Lord added to their number, day by day, those who are being saved.
[time=815] Church is not this hour on Sunday morning.
[time=821] Church is us.
[time=823] Church is the bride and body of Christ.
[time=826] And we are to live that out every day in every setting.
[time=832] Be a true community who takes care of each other.
[time=835] We should do that in two ways.
[time=837] We should be a community that goes out and loves others, takes care of others, provides for the need of others.
[time=844] But we should be a community that draws people in.
[time=847] We should be so full of love and grace and mercy and forgiveness and taking care of people
[time=853] in this way that people are drawn to us.
[time=859] People look at us and say, "What is going on there?
[time=862] What is different about them?" Let me go figure out what's going on there.
[time=868] Number nine, care for widows and orphans.
[time=871] James 1, 27, religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father is this, to visit orphans
[time=878] and widows in their affliction and to keep oneself unstained from the world.
[time=882] I would take it further and say, "Take care of people who are alone.
[time=887] There are people in our midst without community.
[time=891] Let's take care of them.
[time=892] Let's love them.
[time=893] Be a community for them." And when we come together, we are to worship.
[time=898] Number 10, in song together.
[time=902] Ephesians 5, 18 through 21 says, "And do not get drunk with wine for that is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit, addressing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart, giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ." When we come together, when our worship team leads us, let's have a posture of worship.
[time=931] Let's praise God.
[time=932] Let's give Him the glory and the honor that He is due.
[time=936] It's not about us, it's about Him.
[time=940] The third area of vision I want to speak about today is vision for the world.
[time=944] You might even think about this as vision for you individually.
[time=946] So we talked about vision for our church, Black Hawk, vision for the church at large,
[time=952] and now vision for the world.
[time=955] What all of this boils down to is love.
[time=959] Love God, love others, love yourself.
[time=963] When Jesus was asked in a way to trip Him up, by the way, which commandment was the greatest,
[time=970] He responded in Matthew 22, 37 through 40 by saying, "And He said to Him, 'You shall love
[time=976] the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind.
[time=980] This is the great and first commandment, and a second is like to it.
[time=983] You shall love your neighbor as yourself, on these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets.'" Love God and love others.
[time=993] If we would just do that, how much better would our lives be?
[time=999] How much better would Black Hawk be?
[time=1002] How much better would the church be?
[time=1005] How much better would this world be?
[time=1009] Most of us are pretty good at loving ourselves, but we so often fail to live out this very
[time=1015] simple commandment that Jesus placed above everything else.
[time=1020] Love God, love others.
[time=1023] A verse that God has been laying on my heart the last few months, I shared it when I was with our legacy group a couple of months ago, is the first stretch of 1 Corinthians 13.
[time=1033] It's right before that really famous passage that so often gets read at weddings about
[time=1039] love being patient and kind, that it's not envious and boastful or resentful, that it bears and believes all things.
[time=1046] We all know that stretch very well.
[time=1048] If you've ever been to a wedding, you've likely heard it.
[time=1051] But right before, Paul makes what I believe is an even stronger statement about love.
[time=1056] In the first three verses of chapter 13, he says, "If I speak in the tongues of men and
[time=1062] of angels but have not love, I'm a noisy gong or a clanging symbol.
[time=1068] And if I have prophetic powers and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains but have not love, I am nothing.
[time=1078] If I give away all I have and if I deliver up my body to be burned but have not love, I gain nothing." Does the power of those words strike you?
[time=1090] Paul is saying you can be the smartest, most faithful, most sacrificial person in the world.
[time=1097] But if you don't operate in love, it's all for nothing.
[time=1102] It doesn't mean a thing without love.
[time=1105] This point reminds me of what's become my favorite non-biblical quote.
[time=1111] It's my favorite quote ever and over the last few years, as I've gotten older, I've realized how true it is.
[time=1118] It's from the late poet Maya Angelou.
[time=1122] She said, "I've learned people will forget what you said.
[time=1126] People will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel."
[time=1133] The most obvious example of this in my life is my grandfather.
[time=1140] My grandfather died about ten years ago.
[time=1144] He was 91 years old, brilliant guy.
[time=1147] He had a bachelor's, master's, and doctorate from the University of Michigan.
[time=1153] I actively remember in my head not allowing him to play trivial pursuit with us.
[time=1160] As kids he was banned from the table.
[time=1163] The game would have been over in six questions and it would have been fun for nobody.
[time=1168] Brilliant guy.
[time=1169] He was a professor of anatomy in the Ivy Leagues and then was recruited to the University of Tennessee, so he moved his family to Memphis.
[time=1177] That's why I was born in Memphis.
[time=1179] He moved his family from Penn to Memphis, taught anatomy at Penn, and then taught at the University
[time=1187] of Tennessee for about 40 years.
[time=1190] Through his lifetime, he helped train hundreds, probably thousands of doctors.
[time=1198] He was married to my grandmother for about 60 years.
[time=1201] Was a great loving guy, incredibly bright, probably said a ton of great smart things.
[time=1210] I'm sure there were days he went home, frustrated about paying the mortgage, probably hated
[time=1216] traffic, probably even fought with my grandma even though that's hard to imagine.
[time=1222] He had all the normal stuff of life, lived 91 years.
[time=1230] He lived til I was about 40, so I don't only have childhood memories of him, and I can't
[time=1236] tell you one thing he ever said.
[time=1238] I can't give you a quote from my grandfather.
[time=1242] I don't really know what he did every day.
[time=1245] I don't know what his day looked like.
[time=1249] When I think about my grandfather, here's what I think about, here's what I remember.
[time=1254] For about 10 years, when I was a little kid, baseball was my absolute favorite sport when
[time=1260] I was a little kid, and my grandfather knew I loved it.
[time=1263] So every year, for about 10 years, he bought two season tickets to the Memphis Minor League Baseball team, one for him and one for me.
[time=1273] And dozens and dozens of times, every summer, my mom would drive to about halfway to the
[time=1279] stadium.
[time=1280] He would drive halfway.
[time=1282] I'd hop out of my mom's car, I'd hop into his car.
[time=1286] We'd go sit and watch baseball for three or four hours.
[time=1290] I spent hundreds of hours watching baseball with my grandfather, and I can't give you a
[time=1296] quote.
[time=1297] I don't really know what we did other than sit there and watch baseball.
[time=1302] All I remember is how great it felt to be sitting right next to him.
[time=1310] All I remember is how much he loved me, that he wanted to be with me, that he wanted to
[time=1316] spend time with me.
[time=1318] I have no idea what we talked about.
[time=1321] I don't remember one result of one game that at the time, that so much to me.
[time=1327] All I remember is being with my grandfather and being loved.
[time=1333] 91 years of his life, I can't tell you one thing he said, but I can tell you that he
[time=1340] loved me and it's still powerful to me today more than 10 years after he died.
[time=1350] Think about that in your own life.
[time=1353] Today's show that the average person says about 7,000 words a day.
[time=1360] Now, actually, studies show that the average male says about 7,000 words a day.
[time=1371] The average female says about 20,000 words a day.
[time=1376] Because my wife is in the room, I'm not going to belabor this point.
[time=1382] So let's just take the 7,000 figure.
[time=1385] If you live the average lifespan of about 80 years and you speak about 7,000 words a
[time=1391] day in your life, you're going to speak somewhere in the 250 million word range, a quarter of
[time=1400] a billion words.
[time=1406] No one's ever going to remember them.
[time=1410] That may be frustrating.
[time=1414] That may make you think, rethink how you use your words.
[time=1423] You're going to say a quarter of a billion words in your lifetime and 10 years after
[time=1429] you die, no one's going to be able to quote you.
[time=1433] And they won't know what you did every day.
[time=1436] They won't remember the things you did.
[time=1441] All they will remember about your life is how you made them feel.
[time=1447] And as the bride of Christ, we have the charge and the pleasure and privilege of loving people
[time=1456] with the love of Jesus.
[time=1460] And if that's all they remember from our lives, hallelujah.
[time=1467] Let's use our lives the way they're supposed to be used.
[time=1474] The perfect, sinless son of God makes it that simple.
[time=1478] It's all about love.
[time=1480] If we do that, everything else will fall into place.
[time=1484] If we don't do that, we can do everything else, and Paul says do it with excellence.
[time=1490] You can be the smartest, the most faithful.
[time=1493] Do it with excellence.
[time=1494] It means nothing.
[time=1495] It doesn't matter at all.
[time=1498] Love people.
[time=1501] The final area of vision is vision for the future.
[time=1506] Back to that definition, vision for things that we cannot see.
[time=1513] I'm so drawn to revelation these days, and there are four truths about the future that
[time=1519] I want to pull out of revelation for you.
[time=1523] Number one, Christ is alive and lives forever.
[time=1529] This is in the first chapter of Revelation verses 12 through 18.
[time=1533] Then I turn to see the voice that was speaking to me, and on turning I saw seven gold lampstands.
[time=1537] And in the midst of the lampstands, one like a son of man clothed with a long robe and with a golden sash around his chest.
[time=1544] The hairs of his head were white like wool, like snow.
[time=1547] His eyes were like a flame of fire.
[time=1549] His feet were like burnished bronze, refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the roar of many waters.
[time=1555] In his right hand, he held seven stars.
[time=1557] From his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining in full strength.
[time=1565] When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead.
[time=1568] He laid his right hand on me, saying fear not, I am the first and the last and the living
[time=1574] one.
[time=1575] I died, and behold, I am alive forevermore.
[time=1581] And I have the keys of death and Hades.
[time=1584] We are the only people that serve a Savior who is alive.
[time=1591] And he is alive forevermore, and Revelation tells us he is coming back with the keys to
[time=1597] death and Hades in his hands.
[time=1601] The second truth when we look at vision for the future from Revelation is one that will not comfort you.
[time=1608] The world will get worse.
[time=1612] We wake up these days, turn on the news for a second, and what do we say to each other
[time=1618] all the time?
[time=1619] How much worse can this get?
[time=1620] What is wrong with this world?
[time=1622] Is it going to get crazier, like how much crazier can this possibly get?
[time=1627] Well, Revelation tells us how much worse it's going to get.
[time=1633] This is from chapter 13, verses 1 through 8.
[time=1637] And I saw a beast rising out of the sea with ten horns and seven heads with ten diadems on its horns and blasphemous names on its heads.
[time=1646] And the beast that I saw was like a leopard.
[time=1648] Its feet were like a bear's, and its mouth was like a lion's mouth.
[time=1653] And to it, the dragon gave his power and his throne and great authority.
[time=1656] On its heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its mortal wound was healed, and the whole
[time=1662] earth marveled as they followed the beast, and they worshiped the dragon for he had given his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast?
[time=1671] And who can fight against it?" And the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words, and it was allowed to exercise authority for 42 months.
[time=1681] It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God, blaspheming his name and his dwelling.
[time=1687] That is those who dwell in heaven.
[time=1689] Also, it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them.
[time=1694] And authority was given it over every tribe and people and language and nation, and all who dwell on earth who will worship it.
[time=1701] Everyone whose name has not been written before the foundation of the world and the book of life of the Lamb who was slain.
[time=1707] Do you want to know how bad it's going to get?
[time=1712] It's going to get bad.
[time=1714] It's going to get so much worse.
[time=1717] In the '50s, parents woke up one day with rock and roll and thought, "How much worse can this get?" In the '80s, we looked at all the greed and thought, "How much worse can it get?" Today we wake up.
[time=1730] I'm not even sure what the number is.
[time=1732] I think there are 98 genders.
[time=1738] There's actually two, by the way.
[time=1741] How much worse can it get?
[time=1746] It's going to get worse, much worse.
[time=1751] But Revelation does not leave us there.
[time=1754] The final two points are much more uplifting and comforting.
[time=1758] The third truth, the third vision of the future we learn from Revelation is that evil loses.
[time=1765] It loses.
[time=1767] In Revelation 27 through 10, John wrote, "And when the thousand years are ended, Satan had
[time=1774] been bound for a thousand years.
[time=1776] Satan will be released from his prison and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for the battle.
[time=1783] Their number is like the sand of the sea.
[time=1786] And they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire came down from heaven and consumed them.
[time=1795] And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were.
[time=1803] And they will be tormented day and night forever and ever."
[time=1811] People loses, if you are not found in Christ, this is how it ends for you.
[time=1820] This is how it ends for our earth.
[time=1823] It's not a pretty picture.
[time=1827] But God wins.
[time=1832] And so do we, thanks to Jesus.
[time=1835] We are joint heirs with Jesus in the picture that I read to you two months ago when I was
[time=1841] on the pulpit and the picture I can't get away from these days, Revelation 21, 1-7.
[time=1848] Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away and the sea was no more.
[time=1853] And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a
[time=1859] bride adorned for her husband.
[time=1861] And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man.
[time=1866] He will dwell with them and they will be his people and God himself will be with them as their God." He will wipe away every tear from their eyes and death shall be no more.
[time=1874] Neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.
[time=1881] And he who was seated on the throne said, "Behold, I am making all things new."
[time=1887] Also, he said, "Write this down for these words are trustworthy and true and he said to me, 'It is done.
[time=1892] I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end to the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment.
[time=1899] The one who conquers will have this heritage and I will be his God and he will be my son."
[time=1906] Amen, and Hallelujah.
[time=1911] That's what vision looks like in God's Word.
[time=1916] That's the vision for future.
[time=1920] So how do we know this is going to happen?
[time=1922] Why can we trust in God's Word that this is what will happen?
[time=1928] But this is how it will play out because God's Word is true and it has been proven true.
[time=1938] And the things that God has said will happen have already happened.
[time=1941] So the things that he says will happen will happen.
[time=1944] It's not just me saying this.
[time=1948] Let me share something from a scientific study years ago.
[time=1953] Peter Stoner who lived from 1888 to 1980 was the chairman of the Department of Mathematics
[time=1959] and Astronomy at Pasadena City College until 1953 and chairman of the science division of
[time=1965] Westmont College from 1953 to 1957.
[time=1969] He calculated the probability of one man fulfilling the major prophecies made concerning the Messiah.
[time=1977] Now keep in mind Jesus fulfilled over 300 prophecies from the Old Testament fulfilled
[time=1986] in Jesus.
[time=1990] These estimates were worked out by 12 different classes for Dr. Stoner representing some 600 of his university students.
[time=1998] The students carefully weighed all the factors, discussed each prophecy at length and examined the various circumstances which might indicate that men had conspired to fulfill a particular
[time=2009] prophecy.
[time=2011] They made their estimates conservative enough so that there was finally unanimous agreement even among the most skeptical students.
[time=2016] The professor then took their estimates and made them even more conservative.
[time=2021] He also encouraged other skeptics or scientists to make their own estimates to see if his conclusions were more than fair.
[time=2027] Finally, he submitted his figures for review to a committee of the American Scientific Affiliation.
[time=2033] Upon examination, they verified that his calculations were dependable and accurate in regard to the
[time=2040] scientific material presented.
[time=2042] Don't miss how big that is.
[time=2044] He didn't take them to a church group of elders.
[time=2048] He took them to the American scientific community and said, "Tell me I did this wrong.
[time=2054] Tell me I looked at these numbers and came up with a wrong conclusion." I said, "Nope, you're right.
[time=2060] Here's how they did it." Concerning Micah 5-2, for example, where it states that Messiah would be born in Bethlehem, the professor and his students determined the average population of Bethlehem from the time of Micah to the present.
[time=2072] Then they divided it by the average population of the earth during the same time period.
[time=2076] They concluded the chance of one man, any man, being born in Bethlehem was one in 300,000.
[time=2083] Jesus fulfilled over 300 prophecies.
[time=2088] They decided that was too big of a bite to take, so they decided to look at eight prophecies.
[time=2095] After examining only eight different prophecies, they conservatively estimated that the chance of one man fulfilling all eight prophecies was one in 10 to the 17th power, the number
[time=2109] you see on your screen.
[time=2111] A one with 17 zeros.
[time=2114] This is a hard number to get your mind wrapped around.
[time=2118] I don't really fathom it.
[time=2121] Dr. Stoner realized that people didn't really fathom it, so he put it into context that we can kind of grasp.
[time=2129] Here's an illustration.
[time=2130] Suppose we took silver dollars.
[time=2133] How many?
[time=2134] 10 to the 17th power.
[time=2137] We took that many silver dollars, and we laid them on the face of Texas.
[time=2142] They would cover the face of the state of Texas two feet deep.
[time=2149] Mark one silver dollar with a red X, stir the whole thing up, lay them over the face
[time=2155] of Texas two feet deep, blindfold the man, and say, "You got all the time you need.
[time=2162] So as far as you like, take as long as you like, but you get to pick one silver dollar.
[time=2168] Now go find the one with the red X." What are his odds of finding that silver dollar?
[time=2175] One in 10 to the 17th power for eight prophecies.
[time=2182] So Dr. Stoner and his 600 math and science students said, "Let's think this a little
[time=2188] further.
[time=2189] We can accurately depict what 300 prophecies fulfilled looks like, but maybe we could
[time=2196] figure it out for 48." And this is the number that they determined, is the likelihood that one person could fill 48 of the prophecies that Jesus fulfilled.
[time=2210] One in 10 to the 157th power.
[time=2218] That's about a sixth of the prophecies that Jesus fulfilled.
[time=2225] When he concluded his study, Dr. Stoner said this and I quote, "Any man who rejects Christ
[time=2233] as the Son of God is rejecting a fact, proved perhaps more absolutely than any other fact
[time=2241] in the world." Why can we trust God's vision for the future?
[time=2250] Because he was right about the past.
[time=2252] Because his word has been proven scientifically, factually correct.
[time=2262] So our vision here at Blackhawk is to lean on him, to be in him, to worship and praise
[time=2270] him and to give him all the glory.
[time=2274] Let's be a church that loves God and loves others.
[time=2280] If we will do those two things, what Revelation 21 will come true for you, it will come true
[time=2288] for us.
[time=2289] Put your faith in Christ.
[time=2291] It is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone, that these things are true.
[time=2298] Let's pray.
[time=2300] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you this morning for who you are.
[time=2309] You are a God who exists outside of my ability to comprehend.
[time=2315] I cannot fathom how big you are, how great you are, how much control you have.
[time=2326] Lord, it has been proven.
[time=2332] As much as our human minds can understand it, your greatness, your truth has been proven.
[time=2339] And as we think about your truth for the future, your vision for us, in this season, in the
[time=2347] seasons to come, in the unknown that is our future, Lord, I pray that we would just wholly
[time=2356] trust in you, that everything we would do would be about loving you and loving others,
[time=2363] putting our faith in you, because we serve a God who is alive.
[time=2370] Lord, thank you for who you are.
[time=2376] I thank you for what you've done in this church, what you're doing right now, and what you're going to continue to do in this place, it is such an honor to be a part of your family.
[time=2386] To be a part of the fabric that makes up the bride of Christ, Lord, let us never take that
[time=2392] for granted.
[time=2395] Forgive us of our sins, draw us close to you, and help us to be the lights in this world for you, shining that light out into the community and drawing that community in, not to us,
[time=2407] but to you.
[time=2410] Lord, most of all, we thank you for Jesus, who died and yet lives.
[time=2419] It's in His precious name we pray, amen.
