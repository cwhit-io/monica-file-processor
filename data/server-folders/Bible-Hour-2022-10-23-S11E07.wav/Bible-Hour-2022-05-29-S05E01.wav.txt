[time=0] As my brother Chip said, my name is Donovan Coley,
[time=7] President CEO, Senior Pastor for the Fort Wayne Rescumission.
[time=15] We've been around since 1903.
[time=18] I've not been around that long.
[time=20] I've been around there going on 15 years.
[time=25] What a tremendous blessing to serve God's people.
[time=29] The way we do it is simply this.
[time=31] We follow a simple blueprint.
[time=34] It's called the Independence Continuum.
[time=37] People come to us in crisis.
[time=39] So once you remember this, this might be on the quiz, crisis.
[time=45] They're still at a risk.
[time=48] And in many cases, they're still the tug of the streets.
[time=51] So between crisis and at risk, there is still much vulnerability and then we encourage them
[time=58] to get to that place of safety.
[time=62] And so crisis at a risk and safety, it's a stable stability.
[time=73] And then to thrive.
[time=74] Did you get it?
[time=76] See the movement, from crisis to thrive.
[time=84] But what better way to tell you the Rescumission Store because I want to share from God's Word today?
[time=90] We're here to hear from God.
[time=94] But why don't you just watch Todd's story and see what the Rescumission does and then we're going to come back and look at God's Word.
[time=102] So let's watch Todd's story.
[time=107] Powerful.
[time=109] Through drinking and drugging from trap house to flop house to couches, I've never had a
[time=116] place on my own.
[time=120] I wouldn't have known what was here waiting for me in Fort Wayne.
[time=127] I had a pull to trigger to make this decision a long time ago.
[time=138] Growing up, I've always had really solid parents.
[time=141] I was raised with a good set of morals, I knew clearly right from wrong.
[time=146] And I was always growing up to be respectful.
[time=150] So this is no fault of their own.
[time=153] This is a decision that I made entirely upon myself.
[time=158] Towards the end of high school, there's never I could tell that I had an addiction problem.
[time=162] I couldn't just get a buzz and call it a day.
[time=166] I was able to hide it from a lot of people, work my bosses for a long time until I wasn't.
[time=173] Maybe he's just going through his early 20s, you know, maybe he's just going to get him out of his system, but then went a little too far.
[time=181] He never did anything for you, but he would just always want something, always want something,
[time=187] always want something.
[time=188] I blocked over and I just was like, I can't deal with him, I don't want to be out.
[time=195] I don't care about you anymore.
[time=198] Once he got towards the very end, when you're completely shut out by society, your friends
[time=206] and family don't want to talk to you, it's a really bad place to be in.
[time=210] I didn't care about nothing, I didn't care about family, friends, relationships, building
[time=216] credit, getting a relationship, getting a job, getting a card, I just lived for him the next bottle.
[time=221] I lived bottle to bottle.
[time=224] It was, it got really dark, it got really dark.
[time=232] He was in a motel room because he had stolen his father's car and he had wrecked it.
[time=238] If I even had the cops go to his room, where he hung up a noose, and that moment there,
[time=248] it was just like something's wrong with him, it's not just the drink and there's something up here.
[time=254] So, a cryptic message, pretty much saying goodbye to him because I was going to hang myself,
[time=260] and I had warrants off my arrest.
[time=262] My mom got off the phone, she's friends with cops, local cops, said they had half the squad come to my hotel, make sure I was alright, make sure I was going to kill myself, we were not here for your warrant, we're making sure I'm alright.
[time=275] My mom showed up, my brother came and he untied the noose I made.
[time=281] It was at that point, you know, I decided to actually get checked out and I got diagnosed
[time=288] with bipolar.
[time=289] When they've told me, I just clicked, I'm like, I knew it.
[time=294] It wasn't just him, there was something literally chemical imbalance and it made so much more sense.
[time=301] He untied going through his addiction was crazy.
[time=307] I didn't want to lose my son, nor did his father, but we both agreed that if he doesn't
[time=314] get help, we're just going to literally watch him die, that's not an option.
[time=320] He didn't help and he didn't it now.
[time=327] So I started this rotary recovery this time around in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=332] I'm an insomniac, I have a hard time sleeping and I was doubling up on my sleep meds and
[time=339] they decided to withdraw me from the program and that right there was a big hard slap in
[time=346] the face because I'm really early in recovery, I felt like I'm doing everything right.
[time=351] My roommate was telling me, here's the address to the warming center, it's the old mission.
[time=359] I make my way to the warming center, already thinking like, what type of bottle I'm going to get.
[time=365] If I'm even one bottle or getting a chaser, I'm literally on my phone looking at hotels and I'm just about to make a decision.
[time=372] This guy comes in and he sits right next to me and he opened up a Bible.
[time=377] I can't remember exactly what we read but it just hit me, it hit me really hard and he
[time=385] ended up telling me about the rescue mission and how they had a long-term program, something I was really, something I was looking for.
[time=394] I asked him to follow him back to the rescue mission at night and they immediately got
[time=400] me put into the long-term recovery program for the rescue mission.
[time=407] If he wouldn't have sat down next to me that day and pulled out of the Bible and showed
[time=413] me about the rescue mission, where I would have been, I probably would have been jail or dead.
[time=418] A few days later, I looked back at it and I realized, God is real, I can't explain that
[time=426] no other than God in the moment of desperation when I needed him the most.
[time=431] He sent an angel to sit down next to me and point me in the right direction.
[time=436] They always say that God's never late and he's always on time.
[time=441] It was right there where I knew that this is real, God's real and it just changed my
[time=450] trajectory in life to where I'm at now.
[time=455] When I first met Todd, I could tell that he was ready for real change.
[time=459] He came into my office and we had our first case management meeting and we set to work on some obstacles that were in front of him.
[time=466] The changes were night and day that I noticed what Todd was.
[time=469] It was our classes that really kind of broke his walls down and had him step out of his
[time=475] comfort zone.
[time=476] He had to challenge himself.
[time=477] They give you personal development skills in class, budget money, anger management, learning
[time=483] about the 12 stops and what they entail and meeting etiquette was tremendous.
[time=489] One of the things that stands out in my mind about Todd's successes is that he surrounded himself with a group of people both here at the rescue mission and outside of it that we're willing and able to support him and ensure his continued success and sobriety.
[time=503] Todd came into the mission, lost and when he walked out of the mission, he was confident
[time=510] in himself and his abilities.
[time=513] I got my license back which I thought was going to be impossible.
[time=516] I got a car.
[time=517] I got a roof over my head that I ran.
[time=520] He's striving now.
[time=522] I mean, if it wasn't for rescue mission, he honestly would not be alive today.
[time=526] I honestly believe that in my heart.
[time=528] Two, five, seal, recover, can't wait to get his phone call, can't wait to receive his
[time=535] tax message.
[time=536] The whole heart is like lose your brother and they give him back.
[time=542] It's great, it's wonderful.
[time=546] I know that with the donation to the rescue mission that employs the staff and it's a tremendous staff that they have there.
[time=553] I've never felt more comfortable and accepted in my recovery than I have in the rescue mission.
[time=559] I actually get into recovery working a program and working with my sponsor.
[time=565] I was able to purchase some White Sox tickets to take my sponsor and my dad and my brother
[time=572] to the game.
[time=573] After I heard that first crack at the baseball game and just sitting there, stone cold sober,
[time=579] being happy, having fun at that point, I'm like, now I'm really bad.
[time=585] I'm really bad at being tired when I'm supposed to be.
[time=590] Wow.
[time=591] To God be the glory, amen, amen, amen.
[time=600] Sotad experienced a season of change and that's the one thing that is so constant at the rescue
[time=608] mission.
[time=609] As I said, people come to us in crisis, in brokenness, but God just keeps transforming
[time=617] lives as our vision statement at the rescue mission says transforming lives through the love of Jesus Christ.
[time=626] So that's what we're all about.
[time=629] Now let's turn the corner and get back to the text.
[time=632] I want to talk about seasons of change and I want us to look at the Word of God.
[time=636] So if you have the Word, I'm going to invite you to take that out because we're going to be looking at the Sermon on the Mount, but I want to set it up by looking at seasons
[time=647] of change that you see in some of the passages before that.
[time=652] So we're going to go to chapter three and pick up one section of how we see seasons of change, then in chapter four and then we quickly jump into chapter five.
[time=663] We saw about change and we see seasons of change here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=668] You're experiencing seasons of change.
[time=672] And so one of the things that I want to do today is to give you a perspective on how to look at your season of change.
[time=680] And recently I walked through a season of change dealing with my own health.
[time=686] And by the grace of God I stand before you as an individual who have walked through that
[time=693] and I'm still walking through it, but I'm much better than where I was.
[time=699] So God is just moving me through that season of change.
[time=703] And there was, on sure day, there was crisis and confusion.
[time=710] But you know when you walk through a season of change, God walks with you.
[time=715] And so let's read Matthew 5 verses 13 to 16 as our core passage.
[time=723] And then we're going to see seasons of change in other parts of Scripture.
[time=729] Jesus said, "You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt loses its saltiness, how
[time=736] can it be made salty again?
[time=740] There's no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled onto foot.
[time=747] You are the light of the world.
[time=749] A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.
[time=754] Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl.
[time=757] Instead they put it on its stand.
[time=760] And it gives light to everyone in the house in the same way.
[time=766] Let your light shine before others that they may see your good deeds and glorify your father
[time=775] in heaven." Let us stop right there.
[time=780] As we look at the Word of God and as we look at the book of Matthew, we see a season of change in Jesus' life and ministry.
[time=791] Now we know before Jesus stepped into his ministry, we see the incarnation.
[time=796] And we all celebrate that at Christmas, right?
[time=799] And so the incarnation, what a powerful invasion of God Almighty into the life of humanity.
[time=810] And so we see the incarnation, but now we see the initiation.
[time=815] In Matthew chapter 3 and verse 13, the Word of God says, so look at the text.
[time=821] In verse 13, the Bible says, "Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized
[time=827] by John." Now this was not a baptism unto repentance.
[time=834] This was Jesus fulfilling the righteous deed of now being baptized or even being immersed
[time=843] so as to step into his priestly ministry.
[time=847] And so there he was being anointed by water and stepping in.
[time=851] And so we call this the initiation, a season of change in Jesus' life and ministry.
[time=861] But then we notice that immediately after John baptized Jesus as the ministry continued
[time=869] in John's life, he experienced incarceration.
[time=875] And so we see a season of change in John the Baptist's life and ministry.
[time=880] In chapter 4 and verse 12, the Bible says, "When Jesus heard that John had been put
[time=888] in prison, he withdrew to Galilee, leaving Nazareth, he went and he lived in Capernaum,
[time=896] which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naptali."
[time=902] And so we see the incarceration.
[time=904] Now that was a season of change in John the Baptist's life.
[time=910] And so while men and women and children are the rescue mission, they experience their own seasons of change.
[time=916] We notice that change is a part of life even in the Scriptures.
[time=922] And so you might be going through something significant in your life.
[time=928] Just so you know, the sovereign plan of almighty God is at work in governing and in guiding
[time=937] the process.
[time=940] Thank you for that amen over there, Brother Pentecostal.
[time=945] And so he just gave you example of how you can respond in church, even at Black Hawk
[time=951] Ministries.
[time=953] And so we see the incarceration.
[time=956] The season of change in chapter 4 and verse 12, when Jesus heard that John had been put
[time=964] in prison.
[time=966] But it was interesting, the incarceration of John the Baptizer or John the Baptist precipitated
[time=976] a season of change in Jesus' ministry.
[time=980] And so the Bible says, as soon as John was incarcerated, Jesus relocated and he moved
[time=991] to a lakefront property.
[time=996] Let's look at the text.
[time=999] Verse 12, when Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee, leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake.
[time=1010] And so there was Jesus by the lake.
[time=1014] But this precipitated a season of change in his ministry and in chapter 4 and verse 17.
[time=1022] Here's what the Bible says, "From that time on, Jesus began to preach, repent for the
[time=1033] kingdom of heaven, similar to repent for the kingdom of God, has come near."
[time=1043] You see the movement there from all the way from the incarnation.
[time=1048] And now what we see, this incredible initiation of his baptism, with the incarceration thereof
[time=1056] of John the Baptizer, to now we see the inauguration.
[time=1063] And so Jesus is getting ready now to step into his ministry.
[time=1067] May I see this to you again?
[time=1071] You are moving through a process of change, not only the church, Black Hawk Ministries,
[time=1079] but I believe God is leading you and you may have come to church today.
[time=1084] It's Memorial Day weekend.
[time=1086] And as you're sitting here, you're thinking, "My life and the change doesn't make sense."
[time=1096] John the Baptizer felt the very same way.
[time=1099] In fact, while he was incarcerated, he actually sent a couple of his disciples to go to Jesus
[time=1108] to say, "Are you the one or should we look for another?" You see, often in Christ's confusion accompanies it.
[time=1117] And so there is a sense of feeling so overwhelmed, problems and pressures surround and surmount
[time=1125] and there is darkness, but God is up to something great.
[time=1131] Amen, and he's doing that even in your life.
[time=1136] And so Jesus introduces and we see the inauguration of the kingdom of God.
[time=1145] And we see in Matthew 4, you look at verse 12, we see that, then you see verse 17 of
[time=1152] chapter 4.
[time=1154] Look at what the text says in verse 17.
[time=1157] From that time he began to preach and then verse 23.
[time=1162] "Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news
[time=1168] of the." All right, we're going to do better than that.
[time=1175] He went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and he was healing every disease and sickness among the people.
[time=1188] And so here's what we have, the message of the kingdom is seen in the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=1199] May I suggest to you that when you are walking through a season of change, whatever the situation
[time=1207] is, God may be calling upon you to come face to face with the demands of the kingdom,
[time=1218] with the presence of the kingdom of God.
[time=1223] And when we say the kingdom of God, we're talking about the rule of God, the reign of
[time=1229] God.
[time=1230] We're talking about the righteousness of God.
[time=1234] We're talking about God Almighty invading your life.
[time=1238] And he is bringing order to a life that is often out of order.
[time=1245] And he's walking you through a process, just as we see in the seasons of change, all the
[time=1252] way from the incarnation, all the way now to the inauguration.
[time=1256] And so Jesus is stepping in.
[time=1260] May I say this to you, that black-hot ministries?
[time=1266] I don't think you have seen yet what God has in store for your ministry.
[time=1275] If for some reason you're looking at your history, you're looking at your past, you're looking at those days of stability, but I'm here to say, I have not seen an ear has not
[time=1288] heard or understood what God has in store for the kingdom people of God.
[time=1297] I'm not a Pentecostal.
[time=1303] I'm not charismatic, but I'm a kingdom, Holy Spirit believer that God is leading you through
[time=1313] a season of change.
[time=1316] But He wants you to come face to face with the reality of His kingdom.
[time=1323] What do we pray in the Lord's prayer, thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as
[time=1332] it is in heaven.
[time=1335] There is a blueprint of God's work in heaven, and He wants to manifest it His rule.
[time=1342] He wants to manifest heaven on earth, and it's called the kingdom of God.
[time=1350] Are you with me church?
[time=1352] Does this make sense on a Memorial Day weekend where we have all saved a lot of money by
[time=1358] not traveling?
[time=1362] So we might as well have fun and bask in the glory of the kingdom.
[time=1370] What is the backdrop to the sermon and the mount?
[time=1375] If you read the sermon and the mount, and it goes like this, we're the salt of the earth.
[time=1383] As a church, we ought to be the salt, and we're the light of the world.
[time=1388] May I say this to you?
[time=1391] What God is looking for, He's looking for a people who understand who they are, and these
[time=1399] individuals are infused, first of all with a perspective, they're infused with a presence,
[time=1407] they understand the power of God, and they are now going to be living it out.
[time=1417] So here's what I see, Jesus in His exposition of the kingdom identifies His people by making
[time=1431] a strong declaration.
[time=1434] So I've taken courses in biblical exegesis, hermeneutics.
[time=1440] Here's what I notice in Matthew 5, 6, and 7, the sermon and the mount.
[time=1445] There's only one section there where you see this incredible declaration within the context
[time=1455] of the kingdom, and then He says simply this, you are the salt of the earth.
[time=1465] You are the light of the world.
[time=1470] Now the typical preacher, here's what we do.
[time=1473] But when you think of salt, salt was a very, very important item in Jewish history.
[time=1481] In fact, salt is all about preservation and purification.
[time=1486] Soldiers were paid with salt, and in fact, if they didn't really meet the standard, then
[time=1493] they were not worth their salt.
[time=1495] That's where that came from, did you know that?
[time=1501] Jesus is doing in this passage.
[time=1505] He is declaring, because in using the words you are, He was declaring the foundational
[time=1514] truth of who they are and who they were.
[time=1522] You are salt, you are not just a person who attends Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=1536] Intrinsically you possess the quality that has the ability to preserve the reality around
[time=1550] you, and then to infuse a certain quality of life in those that are around you so that
[time=1560] your life will make a difference in somebody else's life, because the kingdom of God is
[time=1568] behind you.
[time=1570] Who you are is a reflection of what Jesus says you are.
[time=1576] And so as Jesus says, "The great I am," He now says, "You are the salt and the light."
[time=1587] So there isn't an option whether I'm going to be a Christ follower today or not.
[time=1598] It is who you are.
[time=1600] So last week I preached at an international church, and there were quite a few nations in this particular church, and I said to this gentleman, I said, "Sir, what country you from?" And the person said, "I'm from Burundi." And I thought, "Wow, in fact I just love the accent, I love the foreign accents.
[time=1619] This is a fake American accent.
[time=1622] I'm as Jamaican as they get, and listen, I can switch it just like that.
[time=1627] So I'm a Jamaican, and I can talk like a Jamaican if I want."
[time=1638] And so the issue is he was Burundi.
[time=1642] Where are you from?
[time=1643] I'm from the Congo.
[time=1645] And then a woman in the back says, "I'm from Haiti." And then I thought, "Well, that's not in Africa, but I appreciate you because I knew there
[time=1654] were a lot of Africans in that room." And so here's what I said to them.
[time=1661] Being from Uganda or even being from America isn't what defines you when you are a child
[time=1672] of God.
[time=1674] What defines you is the Kingdom of God and the imposition, listen to this now, the imposition
[time=1684] of the identity that Jesus places within you.
[time=1690] And Jesus says, "You are salt, and you are light."
[time=1700] And so what Jesus was doing now, let's go to Matthew 5, 13 to 16.
[time=1705] He's unwrapping the essence or the inner core that constitutes who we are as Christ followers.
[time=1715] There is the intrinsic nature or the indispensable quality of something, and he says, "You are
[time=1722] salt, and you are light." So here's the vision simply, to be the light who reflects Jesus Christ, to be salt, 46815
[time=1737] is doable.
[time=1739] If you're from 46835, it's doable, wherever you are, whatever, zip code.
[time=1748] If you are not penetrating with the light and the salt, that's who you are, and then if
[time=1758] you have stepped back and you're not being the influencer in your community, then something
[time=1765] is wrong.
[time=1766] Don't expect Black Hawk Ministries because of its name and its reputation to continue
[time=1773] to be the incredible church that it is.
[time=1779] It comes down to you being salt and you being light.
[time=1786] Now here's the cool way we reach our neighborhood.
[time=1789] I believe I have the cutest grandkids on the face of the earth.
[time=1798] If you want to disprove me, come up afterwards, you bring your kids I bring mine.
[time=1808] But here's how we do it.
[time=1810] Yesterday.
[time=1811] Oh, how we want to influence our community.
[time=1813] We live in a cul-de-sac, just down the streets off a maple-crest road, around the corner.
[time=1821] We just put him out, the six-year-old.
[time=1826] He starts talking to a little Lucy across the street.
[time=1831] Lucy's dad comes out, so Seth comes out.
[time=1835] The other kids come out, and you know in America, you got to keep your eye on your kid, so the
[time=1842] adults all come out.
[time=1843] So what do you do?
[time=1844] You talk.
[time=1846] What do guys want to know?
[time=1847] What do you do?
[time=1849] Glad you ask.
[time=1851] And so that's how relationships and my sisters and brothers, that's just one simple little way.
[time=1857] My goal is to do a cookout in our cul-de-sac, stop all the traffic and be salt and be light.
[time=1869] Here's my big idea.
[time=1870] You see, who you are as a church has already been determined by Christ.
[time=1887] So while you're walking through a season of change, just embrace the fact that you are
[time=1894] an extension of the kingdom of God, step out and step in to becoming what God has already
[time=1901] called you to be.
[time=1904] See, we tend to complicate stuff, and we're so bogged down on church, and we're bogged
[time=1913] down on structures, and we are bogged down on polity, and we are bogged down on different
[time=1920] events and plans and so forth when Jesus says, "Be salt and be light."
[time=1928] See, the passage before us in Matthew 5, 13 to 16 gives us three key truths that will
[time=1934] strengthen a local church in our attempt to retain, reposition and reclaim her identity.
[time=1943] Here's what I'm going to encourage you to do as time is fleeting.
[time=1946] It may invite you to examine.
[time=1952] Find yourselves individually and collectively to see if kingdom life still exists.
[time=1962] Is there still a pulse?
[time=1963] Now here's the cool thing.
[time=1965] I believe you have all passed the test because you showed up, and you're here.
[time=1976] And if you believe that what God is up to is just to grow a church, then you're missing
[time=1984] the point.
[time=1987] It is that the kingdom of God, the rule of God, would be extended in you and through
[time=1996] you that the nations of the world, that even the city of Fort Wayne or whatever city you're
[time=2005] from, would know that there is a God who has manifested himself in the person of Jesus
[time=2012] Christ, who has then sent the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit now inhabits the body
[time=2019] of Christ, and that the glory of God is going to be manifested not only in you, but through
[time=2027] you.
[time=2028] See, I have to roll it because you and I are called to more than just church.
[time=2041] We're called to a church that manifests the glory and the power of God.
[time=2051] And until we know who we are, we're going to miss it.
[time=2058] So it starts with an examination of ourselves individually and collectively to see if life
[time=2065] still exists.
[time=2067] And so in chapter 5 and verse 13, the Bible says, "You are the salt of the earth."
[time=2076] Does that mean anything to you?
[time=2082] The rescue mission, we've been around since 1903, and it's amazing how the world has advanced
[time=2089] in its understanding to say that the poor and the homeless should be set aside.
[time=2096] Get them out of the way.
[time=2100] Go get a job is what they often say.
[time=2104] They miss the chronic mental illness, the trauma, the addictions, but you see God called
[time=2115] us to be the salt.
[time=2119] And often, even political leaders, they said, "You know what?
[time=2124] We will even give you Elmer's High School to get you out of downtown Fort Wayne."
[time=2132] They may have a lot of ideas, but they're really not smart.
[time=2139] Transportation, access to court essential services, and where do the bulk of the homeless gather
[time=2149] in your downtown area?
[time=2153] The homeless aren't downtown, just to harass people.
[time=2162] They're downtown because that's what people do.
[time=2168] And so the rescue mission is downtown because that's where the homeless people are.
[time=2176] Did you get the difference?
[time=2179] And so my sisters and brothers, if we're going to be salt and light, we need to be where
[time=2189] the folks are so that they will see the manifest presence of God.
[time=2195] You can't hibernate or step back or allow individuals to relegate the church to the
[time=2203] sidelines.
[time=2205] We now ought to show up.
[time=2207] So let me quickly go through this.
[time=2209] You see, does the life of Christ flow through you?
[time=2213] Is there an awareness of God's presence?
[time=2215] Secondly, does the love of Christ flow through you?
[time=2219] Do I leave evidence of Christ in my engagement with others?
[time=2224] Is there evidence of salt?
[time=2227] Is there a palatable taste by your interaction?
[time=2231] Is there a pleasant taste, if you will?
[time=2237] Embrace your place and position in life and ministry.
[time=2240] Quickly, Matthew 5, 14 to 15, we see that there.
[time=2245] You're the light of the world, a town built on a hill cannot be hidden.
[time=2250] So back to my story, we decided to put a beautiful building downtown Fort Wayne and how American
[time=2259] can you get?
[time=2261] We painted it red, white, and blue.
[time=2268] In the second busiest intersection downtown, it's visible.
[time=2280] Blackhawk Ministries, I'm going to encourage you to step into your God-given role of visibility.
[time=2289] Back on the mantle that has come from God almighty and his kingdom to be manifested.
[time=2296] Don't look at your history, don't look at your past.
[time=2299] There's a new way that is being paved.
[time=2302] And I'm convinced that God is going to do something that you have never seen before.
[time=2308] It is called an infusion of the kingdom of God.
[time=2315] Step into your God-given role of visibility, step out of the shadows of obscurity.
[time=2320] Thirdly, we're talking about examine, embrace, expect God's glory to be the full expression
[time=2330] of everything that you are.
[time=2338] Shining before others means God is shining through you.
[time=2344] We are thankful for serving with such visibility.
[time=2352] We are out totally.
[time=2356] Jesus Christ is the very center, the Word of God.
[time=2361] There is no questioning the authority of Scripture where that is concerned because we are kingdom-minded people.
[time=2371] So how do you apply this?
[time=2373] May I invite you to accept God's invitation to examine your life.
[time=2379] See, it may be a call to salvation or a call to read education.
[time=2386] Secondly, affirm the need to be salt and light, retake your place.
[time=2394] You may be a recent high school graduate and as a recent high school graduate, for some reason they'll tell you that there's a strong possibility that when you get to college or
[time=2405] you get to some other place to pursue your career, 90-plus percent of you may potentially
[time=2411] walk away from the cross of Christ and no longer affirm the veracity, the truthfulness of God's
[time=2419] Word.
[time=2420] I'm here to tell you, when you develop a kingdom mindset and the rule and the reign of God is evident in your life, you will stand and you will remember all the things that you learned
[time=2435] through our brother Mark Hammond, the weath in youth ministry.
[time=2445] And so may I invite you to affirm the need to be salt and light, retake your place as
[time=2451] a child of God, and finally ask God to do a fresh work in this new season of retaining,
[time=2459] repositioning and reclaiming your identity, you are salt, you are light.
[time=2465] Jason is going to come since I run out of the time, I'll take some of his time.
[time=2468] Come on up, Jason.
[time=2469] He's going to wrap up, but I want to tell you a story.
[time=2475] I remember going to a jungle.
[time=2482] I went to a city, Manaus, it's the capital of the Amazon, Brazil.
[time=2492] And Jason, I was invited to go and to literally share the gospel.
[time=2498] I was going to be the preacher and then we had a lot of medical practitioners on board this boat and we traveled for days.
[time=2510] We got to this community, my job was to preach, they did the medical work, and people were
[time=2518] responding to Jesus, they were responding.
[time=2523] On the ship in the kitchen, there was this couple, this man, this woman, and these two beautiful girls, they were teenagers.
[time=2534] And I remember us talking about going to America and just having fun on that boat.
[time=2541] But as we wrapped up our time, and as we were leaving, and we're getting ready to push
[time=2549] away from the shore, there was this man and this woman and these two girls.
[time=2557] They grabbed their suitcases and they were heading back into the jungles.
[time=2567] I turned to the lead pastor and I said, "What's happening here?" And he said, "Prior to us leaving, a year or so ago, we asked our congregation for individuals
[time=2582] who are feeling called of God to do ministry and this couple and their daughters accepted
[time=2591] the call." I remember standing on deck and I watched them leave and I watched them until I couldn't
[time=2604] see them anymore.
[time=2606] I was broken.
[time=2611] Here's what this pastor also said to me, he said, "In our church, when we invite people
[time=2618] to do ministry, and I'm going to paraphrase now, to be salt and light." He didn't say those words, but that was the extent of what he was saying.
[time=2627] He says, "The problem that we have is we have too many." And I started reflecting on my own life, but as I saw the husband, the wife, the daughters,
[time=2645] I was broken by the things that broke the heart of God and broke their hearts, but they
[time=2655] would walk away and be salt and light.
[time=2660] And this calling, "Blackhawk," to walk through a season of change like you have never experienced
[time=2668] before.
[time=2671] And I'm going to say this and step off the stage.
[time=2675] The best is yet to come if you have a kingdom mindset and you are salt and you are light.
[time=2687] God bless you.
