[time=0] We're going to study the book of Philippians, but I made a discovery years ago as people don't know as much about the Bible as I think they know.
[time=9] And they're often discouraged from studying the Bible, or going to church, or even having a conversation about the Bible, because to them it's a foreign subject.
[time=18] I'm not sure all the reasons for that, but I know one of the reasons in my life for that was the first Bible I was given was a good Bible.
[time=25] It was a King James Bible, and I still love the King James, but it was hard work to read the King James Bible as a high school student.
[time=33] I mean, it was tough.
[time=34] I felt like I was an English literature class.
[time=37] And how many of you, just for fun last night, how many of you got out your smart device and downloaded some good Shakespearean literature to read?
[time=47] Anybody, there's got to be an English lit major here who loves the, I respect English literature.
[time=55] Shakespeare was powerful in his ability to communicate through life's issues, but he doesn't know the right English.
[time=62] Meaning we don't know the right English.
[time=65] And so many times the translation, the difficult of language, words that are used like sanctification and glorification, not used elsewhere, it's hard for people to step into that kind of environment.
[time=78] And then there's people who think it's worth fighting over.
[time=81] There's churches that advertise King James only.
[time=85] So if you brought your new international version or your English standard version, those are fighting words.
[time=90] They bring them into the house of the Lord, that new language.
[time=94] And it's very difficult for new people.
[time=97] And one of my heart's desires to say, how do we reach people who don't believe?
[time=101] How do we reach people who don't understand the Bible?
[time=104] So I'm gonna take five minutes, maybe a little more today, just to start off with Christianity 101.
[time=110] That's not because I think that's where the whole church is, but I think your heart's the same as mine.
[time=114] How do we help those new people come to church?
[time=116] How do we help them come to faith in Christ more than anything?
[time=120] So a little Bible 101.
[time=123] First of all, the word Bible is a little bit of a misnomer because the word Bible means book.
[time=128] And it is a book, but it's a book made out of it.
[time=131] How many other books?
[time=132] We say there are 66 books in the Bible.
[time=136] 39 of those are Old Testament.
[time=139] 27 of them are New Testament.
[time=141] And again, if you're new, you're probably going, I don't know what you mean by Testament.
[time=145] I don't know what's new.
[time=147] Testament just means a statement, a formal statement.
[time=151] Your last testimony, as you write out your will, it's your statement.
[time=156] It's a statement about how our relationship with God is to be handled.
[time=161] The old way is the Old Testament.
[time=163] The new way is the New Testament.
[time=165] Simply stated, the old way is everything God said and wanted us to remember about life before Jesus.
[time=173] The New Testament is just the opposite.
[time=175] It's everything God has said and has for us to know about life.
[time=178] Since Jesus came, the Old Testament does not cancel or be canceled by the New Testament.
[time=187] It's actually fulfilled by the New Testament.
[time=189] Then we get stuck with some simple details that there are very distinct different types of literature in the Bible.
[time=199] It reads one way and then you go to a different book and it reads another way.
[time=204] Let me give you what I mean.
[time=205] For example, even those of you who have been Christians for a long time, how many of you who are believers in Christ have, inelectively, willingly, conscientiously chosen to read the book of Leviticus this month?
[time=219] You may have been there because you were getting through the Bible in one year and that was where you were, but we just don't go to Leviticus.
[time=228] We don't get it, it's not our culture.
[time=230] And then there are songs like the song of Solomon.
[time=234] It's a song, we have the text, we just don't have the tune, but boy, I'm glad I'm not with a room full of junior high boys trying to explain some of the language in the book, song of Solomon.
[time=245] We tell them, oh, it's a parable, it's an illustration of the church, let's move on now.
[time=250] So studying the Bible is a little bit difficult because there are historical books like the book of Joshua and the book of Judges.
[time=259] And there are biographies, and I find it fascinating that two of the biographies of the Old Testament are biographies of women.
[time=266] And one of those is the book of Ruth, and the other one is the book of Esther.
[time=270] There's a type of literature we all understand called a biography, but there's a subset of biographies called a gospel.
[time=279] And we only know what a gospel is if we've been in church.
[time=282] If you went out in the street and asked people who've not been to church, what's a gospel?
[time=286] They have no idea what you're talking about.
[time=289] Then in addition to that, there's some difficulty in understanding that some of the books are largely symbolic, particularly the book of Revelation.
[time=300] And this is called apocalyptic literature.
[time=305] And you've got that apocalyptic literature, a modern scholar, Arnold Schwarzenegger, brought that back under the title End of Days.
[time=314] We call it eschatology, he calls it End of Days.
[time=317] And there's things in the book of Revelation.
[time=319] Nobody has an idea what they mean, but everybody makes a suggestion.
[time=323] That gives us something to fight about.
[time=324] Well, I don't think you're right.
[time=326] It's tough if you've never opened a book to understand the Bible.
[time=331] So we wanna be sensitive to that and make it as clear and as simple as we can be.
[time=336] So we're gonna start off with why Philippians?
[time=339] Why are we reading one particular book of the Bible called Philippians?
[time=344] And there's three reasons, and I'm gonna give you those reasons and back them up with just a little bit of detail.
[time=350] First reason that we're gonna study the book of Philippians is some of the most quoted and downloaded verses of the Bible are the verses in the book of Philippians.
[time=364] Since we now have online Bible services like your version,
[time=371] they're tracking which verses are most downloaded.
[time=375] And there are four or five verses in the book of Psalms.
[time=380] They're quoted in some lists, top 10, some lists, top 20.
[time=385] Let me share those with you because these are gonna become the heart of our study.
[time=389] Philippians 1, 21, for me to live is Christ and to die is gain.
[time=398] For me to live is Christ and to die is gain.
[time=403] Philippians 4, 6, and 7.
[time=406] Do not be anxious about anything, but with everything by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your request to God, and the peace of God which transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
[time=424] Philippians 4, 13, I can do anything or I can do everything through Him who gives me strength.
[time=431] These are verses that we go to frequently often.
[time=434] They help us, they're like a coach getting us through the tough days.
[time=439] The second reason why we're studying the book of Philippians is that Philippians was written to people like us who are going through tough times.
[time=450] The Apostle Paul was going through a tough time.
[time=453] Can I take just a moment and give you the biographical connection between the city of Philippi and the Apostle Paul.
[time=461] In the year 42 BC, roughly 100 years before the Apostle Paul,
[time=468] there was a battle, and the battle was the forces of Brutus and Cassius against the forces of Mark Anthony and Octavian.
[time=478] You're going, I think that was world history.
[time=482] I skipped that one.
[time=484] Well, let me tell you a little bit about it because it affects your life in a few ways.
[time=488] First of all, the forces of Mark Anthony are not the Mark Anthony and Jennifer Lopez.
[time=496] It's Mark Anthony and Cleopatra, okay?
[time=498] So if you thought, "Oh, I know who Mark Anthony is." He's a great Cuban singer.
[time=503] Well, this is a different Mark Anthony.
[time=506] And the battle was won by Octavian and Mark Anthony.
[time=510] You've never heard of, how many of you've heard of Octavian?
[time=513] Oh, well, that's good.
[time=515] Every one of you has because his name was changed to August one or August.
[time=524] And he had so much power in clout, he followed what his uncle did and he had a month named after him.
[time=532] The month of July is named for Julius Caesar and the month of August is named for the August one, or Octavian.
[time=538] Now here's where it gets really Nazi.
[time=541] The word for September is the word seven.
[time=544] The word for October is the number eight, but they're not number seven and eight.
[time=549] That really messes up a first year Latin teacher with students trying to explain why six, seven and eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, sometimes yes, sometimes no.
[time=561] Well, the calendar got shifted when Julius Caesar jammed his name in the middle and called it July and August was changed by his nephew Augustus.
[time=570] These are people who thought the world revolved around them.
[time=573] Some of you know people just like that.
[time=575] The Apostle Paul was a man who actually hated Jesus
[time=581] and set about to eliminate Christianity.
[time=584] Christianity at the moment was a small, exploding religion of the city of Jerusalem and the environs around it.
[time=593] And the Apostle Paul went out with authorization to, without explanation, to arrest and comprehend people, only for the name of Jesus as their fault.
[time=610] One of those was a man by the name of Stephen.
[time=612] Stephen is recorded as the first martyr in the Bible.
[time=615] And we are told that a man by the name of Saul, that's our character, Saul stood there and held their coats concerning unto the death of Stephen.
[time=625] But then a chapter later in the book of Acts, there's an apparition, more than an apparition, not a ghost.
[time=632] There is a man, but the man is not one of us, but he looked like a human being, but he's got a body and ability to appear and to disappear.
[time=640] And it was Jesus.
[time=643] Saul said, "Who are you?" And the guy said, "I am Jesus, "I am Jesus whom you persecute." And Paul went blind.
[time=652] And he was taken to a city nearby called Damascus, and there a guy held his hands against to the eyes of Paul
[time=661] and he saw again, and Paul became a believer.
[time=664] And no longer had his name as Saul, but as Paul.
[time=667] He then becomes a missionary, taking the gospel to the land that we would call Turkey.
[time=674] In fact, I think we have a map.
[time=675] Do we have a map?
[time=676] I've got us out of order.
[time=679] We have a map, but I'm not in sync with what they are.
[time=682] My fault, don't blame the tech guys.
[time=685] The land of Turkey, how many of you know were the land of Turkey as if you saw a map?
[time=688] That's where Paul made his first missionary journey.
[time=691] His second missionary journey was to revisit those same cities, but along the way, he wanted to go further into Turkey and God said no, and the spirit of God let him, instead, to look to the west, to the land we would call Greece or Macedonia.
[time=709] Then he has a dream and a man appears to him from the land of Macedonia and says, "Paul, come tell us the gospel." So God pulled Paul off of the continent of Asia and put him for the first time on the continent of Europe.
[time=727] And Paul goes to the major city there by the name of Philippi and presents the gospel.
[time=732] He was very effective in convincing people to follow Jesus.
[time=738] And then he was badgered and hassled by a young girl who followed him wherever he preached.
[time=744] And she said, "Listen to this man.
[time=746] "He's gonna tell you the way of salvation.
[time=748] "Listen to this man.
[time=749] "He's gonna tell you the way of salvation." It wasn't an on per part to confirm it.
[time=753] It was on her part to try to confuse it.
[time=756] And so Paul realized that he was never gonna get his message clear with this going on.
[time=761] So he speaks to her and says, "By the power of Jesus, "the demon that's causing you to disrupt my messages "is gone, and he healed her." But that suddenly divided people into two groups.
[time=774] One group said, "Isn't it powerful "that Jesus could take that woman and restore her sanity?" The other group of people who says, "No, it's not wonderful.
[time=783] "She was making us money by her short-term predictions." And they arranged for Paul and Silas to be beaten and imprisoned.
[time=794] That night that Paul is in prison, he shackled, probably arm and arm against the wall, ankle to ankle against the floor.
[time=803] And what do he and his buddy Silas doing?
[time=806] They're singing him's a praise.
[time=808] They're singing about the goodness of God.
[time=810] They're talking about the God who loved them and saved them from all the consequences of their life.
[time=815] And then shortly after midnight, there was almost an explosive sound, a disruption.
[time=823] And the whole earth began to shake and earthquake was upon them.
[time=826] And the building almost collapsed over the prison and the shackles fell off.
[time=832] They were free to run for it.
[time=834] The Roman jailer took out his sword and was about to kill himself.
[time=840] Because the Roman consequence for losing your prisoners was you served out their sentence.
[time=846] So if somebody escaped who had five years to go in their sentence, the jailer had five years to spend in his own jail.
[time=854] And if that prisoner was to be executed, then the jailer was to be executed.
[time=859] The shaking, the rumbling, the rattling, the man draws his sword and Paul says, "Stop, stop, we're all here." And the jailers' words aren't recounted but it becomes quite obvious what his mind went through.
[time=876] He says, "Who stays in jail when they can get out?
[time=879] "Who sings hymns at midnight?
[time=883] "What kind of people are these "and how do I get on their side?" And this jailer asked the greatest question of all history.
[time=892] The Philippian jailer said this, "What must I do to be saved?
[time=901] "What must I do to be saved?" Can I just take a breath for a moment and ask you to ask yourself, have you ever posed that question to your own heart?
[time=912] "What must I do to be saved?" And Paul tells him, he says, "Believe on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ "and you will be saved and your family." Now, don't misunderstand, Paul was not saying, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you and anyone who's in your house that night, automatically in.
[time=932] What he was saying is this, "Believe on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ "and you will be saved." And if your family believes in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, they too can be saved.
[time=942] It's not a, you only invitation, it's an invitation to everyone.
[time=945] And the church of Philippi was born, but now it's 12 years later.
[time=951] And Paul is in a different prison, shackled with a different set of chains.
[time=957] And he doesn't know what's going to happen to him.
[time=961] These are tough times for the Apostle Paul.
[time=966] He's been beaten and imprisoned in several cities.
[time=970] He's been stoned in other cities with rocks that a clarify thing sometimes.
[time=975] His friend who brought him the gifts from the city of Philippi, Aphroditis was so sick, Paul thought he was going to die.
[time=986] There were conflicts in the church and to quote Paul from another passage of the Bible, he felt the weight of all the churches resting upon him.
[time=994] These were tough times.
[time=996] Worst of all, there was a mad man by the name of Nero who threatened to destroy the world.
[time=1001] Hope and joy were in short supply.
[time=1004] But we're going through our own tough times.
[time=1008] 19 children and two teachers are gunned down by one person in Texas.
[time=1014] Four more medical workers are shot in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
[time=1017] We're afraid to turn on the news to find out where the next tragedy's coming from.
[time=1023] The economy is so volatile.
[time=1027] We're just beginning to learn about Bitcoins.
[time=1030] And the Bitcoins took off and Bitcoins collapsed.
[time=1033] Bitcoins are making a comeback.
[time=1034] She'll invest in them.
[time=1035] Should I flee from them?
[time=1037] We live in economically very uncertain times.
[time=1041] Russia has begun to threaten, to involve nuclear weapons, biological weapons, weapons of mass destruction.
[time=1050] Some of you here are struggling.
[time=1054] You're struggling to keep your marriage together.
[time=1056] Others you here are struggling with a teenager, a son who's a prodigal, a daughter who's a prodigal.
[time=1063] All they wanted from you is everything.
[time=1064] Just give me your money, get out of my way.
[time=1066] Give me my fortune, get out of my way.
[time=1068] Don't tell me what to do.
[time=1069] It's my life.
[time=1070] You're facing that chatter every day.
[time=1074] These are tough times for many families.
[time=1076] And a mad man named Putin just might destroy the world.
[time=1080] Joy and hope are in short supply.
[time=1086] But the book of Philippians is gonna overload us with joy.
[time=1091] Third reason why we're studying Philippians is the overflow of joy.
[time=1098] In this short book, the book is four chapters long.
[time=1100] It's 104 verses, but 17 times it says one of these verbs.
[time=1105] Rejoice, joy, or be glad.
[time=1111] It is the theme of the book of Philippians.
[time=1114] Let me read just a few of the joyful statements in it.
[time=1117] I thank my God every time I remember you and all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy.
[time=1125] From a prison, in chains, I pray with you with joy.
[time=1131] Verse 18, the important thing is this, that in every way, wherever, whether from false motives are true, Christ is preached and because of this, I rejoice.
[time=1143] Yes, and I will continue to rejoice.
[time=1147] One final verse, Philippians 4-4, rejoice in the Lord.
[time=1152] Always, I will say it again, rejoice.
[time=1155] This is Paul's crescendo.
[time=1159] He's been telling in all the circumstances and reasons why they might be discouraged and he comes up with this prescription.
[time=1166] Rejoice, always, not just on the days when the prison walls tumble down, always rejoice.
[time=1175] I will say it again, rejoice in the Lord.
[time=1178] Now that you've endured one of my history lessons, I will give you my English lessons.
[time=1184] They're not so good.
[time=1186] This statement, rejoice, is a verb.
[time=1194] Are you with me so verb?
[time=1196] But verbs are teenagers.
[time=1198] They come in a variety of moods.
[time=1201] Did you know that verbs have moods?
[time=1205] One of the most basic moods is called the indicative mood.
[time=1209] It indicates something, so it's called the indicative move.
[time=1212] I'm going to the store on the way home from church.
[time=1214] That's just a statement that indicates something.
[time=1217] Very common.
[time=1218] There's an interrogative, which is a professional way of saying a question.
[time=1222] An interrogger is a questioner.
[time=1225] There's the subjective mood.
[time=1227] The subjective mood is a move, one step removed from reality.
[time=1231] I'm going to the store, is indicative.
[time=1235] Subjunctis says, I might go to the store, or I should go to the store, or I could go to the store.
[time=1242] But the one we want to focus in on is the imperative.
[time=1245] The imperative move says, I'm not suggesting this.
[time=1248] I'm telling you to do this.
[time=1250] Rejoice.
[time=1252] I have no right to tell you to rejoice in the Lord.
[time=1255] I have not suffered greatly.
[time=1257] I have been blessed with a life of considerable ease and comfort.
[time=1262] But there are others around, and maybe you're one of them who has suffered.
[time=1267] You've gotten the diagnosis you prayed you would not get.
[time=1271] I'm not telling you to rejoice.
[time=1274] But the apostle Paul is.
[time=1276] He knows how you feel.
[time=1277] He has suffered like that.
[time=1279] And most of all, Jesus knows how you feel.
[time=1282] And both of them would say to you, rejoice.
[time=1286] I'll say it again.
[time=1287] Rejoice.
[time=1288] Paul says, 17 times, I'll say rejoice.
[time=1290] Be glad.
[time=1292] Adopt this mindset in you.
[time=1297] Here's the big point of the book of Philippians.
[time=1300] And I remember hearing it, and I had to go back and rethink the story.
[time=1304] I believe I was a grad student writing in a car with a friend who was a professor of psychology.
[time=1312] And he had just said to somebody in our hearing, you cannot control what happens to you.
[time=1320] You can only control how you respond.
[time=1323] And it took me a long time to process that.
[time=1325] And it's one of the big debates of modern behavioral sciences.
[time=1330] Can you even change?
[time=1333] Can you change other people?
[time=1335] Can you change yourself?
[time=1338] There's no consensus of wisdom.
[time=1340] But there is a biblical understanding that we cannot choose what happens to us.
[time=1348] But we can choose how we respond.
[time=1352] Conventional wisdom says, if I get what I want, then I will be happy.
[time=1358] If I get a date for the prom, then I'll be happy.
[time=1360] If I get a better job, then I'll be happy.
[time=1363] If I lose 15-- OK, if I lose 20 pounds, then I'll be happy.
[time=1368] If I'm accepted into college, then I'll be happy.
[time=1371] If she says, yes, I'll marry you, then I'll be happy.
[time=1374] If I get admittance to grad school, then I'll be happy.
[time=1377] If I get a big raise, then I'll be happy.
[time=1379] But all these things that we say to ourselves are outside of our self and they're outside of our control.
[time=1385] These are circumstances outside of our control.
[time=1387] Another thing that's outside of our control is genetics.
[time=1391] You did not get to choose which genes you have.
[time=1394] Abraham Lincoln proved that point.
[time=1397] He was once accused of being too faced.
[time=1400] And Lincoln said, if I had two faces, do you think I'd be wearing this one?
[time=1405] I'm five foot, seven and a half.
[time=1412] That's genetics.
[time=1414] I can't change that.
[time=1416] But I never drop the half.
[time=1417] I mean, when you're five, seven and a half, the half counts.
[time=1420] We can't change genetics.
[time=1425] We can't change our childhood.
[time=1427] We can't change some of our circumstances.
[time=1429] And that's led some people to become what has willingly become known as neuro-calvinists.
[time=1438] Neuro-calvinists are genetic determinism.
[time=1444] One of the leading proponents of this is an atheist by the name of my brain's fading here
[time=1452] for a minute, forgive me.
[time=1454] And I talk about this guy all the time.
[time=1456] A famous psychologist whose name I cannot remember
[time=1462] at the moment, is his picture up there?
[time=1469] I don't get the picture.
[time=1471] Who is it?
[time=1472] But the doctor's name, this is getting to be comical.
[time=1479] Professor-- Richard Dawkins, you can win the prize.
[time=1486] And this is nothing to do with the match game.
[time=1490] Richard Dawkins is a leading atheist evolutionist
[time=1498] who said these classic words, DNA doesn't care.
[time=1505] DNA just is.
[time=1507] And we are dancing to its music.
[time=1513] What he meant by that is, you are who you are, and you can't change you.
[time=1518] There's not one thing you can do to change you.
[time=1520] You're stuck with whatever you are.
[time=1522] And the Bible comes along and says, no, you can be different.
[time=1526] You can change.
[time=1528] And Paul's telling a group of people, you can have joy.
[time=1531] You don't have to be controlled by your circumstances.
[time=1533] You don't have to be controlled by the road and guard.
[time=1536] You don't have to be controlled by the fact that somebody you love named Aphroditis is near unto death, and you don't know where there's going to live, you can still have joy.
[time=1548] There's another name I'd like to introduce you to, and that's the name of Sean Acre.
[time=1553] And why I like Acre is he says, just the opposite of Dawkins.
[time=1557] He has been studying, speaking, and writing on the subject of happiness, and has come to the conclusion that happiness is not the belief that we don't need to change.
[time=1572] It's the realization that we can change.
[time=1580] You're not stuck, you're not locked in, you can be different.
[time=1583] What I love about Sean is he is saying today with a secular mind and a secular set of eyes.
[time=1591] He's seeing and saying today what Paul was saying 2,000 years ago.
[time=1595] And if you study the Bible for very long, you're going to find in it descriptions and prescriptions that are 2,000 years old to which you and I are saying, that's been in the Bible.
[time=1604] If we had just studied the Bible a little more carefully, we might have seen it.
[time=1609] Dawkins and secularism and popular culture says success leads to happiness.
[time=1618] But that's not really true.
[time=1620] What we find is just the opposite.
[time=1622] Joy leads to success.
[time=1625] If you have joy, you will do a better job when you go to work tomorrow.
[time=1629] If you have joy, you'll solve problems with people with whom you're in conflict.
[time=1634] If you have joy, you're not afraid of what's going to happen to you.
[time=1637] But how do you have that kind of joy?
[time=1640] It follows this way.
[time=1641] If you've decided for me to live is Christ and to die is gained,
[time=1647] you've got joy no matter what prison they lock you up in, because you belong to Christ.
[time=1652] And if you die, that's gain.
[time=1656] And if you live, it's more opportunities for Christ.
[time=1659] It's that mindset that allows us to adopt the spirit of joy in every circumstance, in every condition.
[time=1668] Now you've noticed quickly that I switched from joy to happiness.
[time=1672] And it wasn't just a preference of wording, but the difference between joy and happiness is very profound.
[time=1679] One is dependent upon, am I in a good place
[time=1685] where I like what's happening to me?
[time=1688] The other is unchanging no matter what happens.
[time=1691] Happiness has as its root the word happen.
[time=1695] And I'm happy because you came today.
[time=1698] But I can't control what people are going to do.
[time=1702] Someone way smarter than me said, happiness is a thermometer.
[time=1709] Happiness tells you what's happening, what the temperature is.
[time=1714] Joy is a thermostat.
[time=1716] It changes what it can.
[time=1720] It changes if you're too hot, you turn on the air conditioning.
[time=1724] How do you do that?
[time=1725] The thermostat.
[time=1727] Joy is the thermostat of our soul.
[time=1730] It comes from our relationship with God.
[time=1732] This is Galatians 522, same author, different audience.
[time=1737] But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
[time=1745] All of these are gifts and fruit of the productive Holy Spirit working in our life.
[time=1750] That when you receive Christ into your life, He comes with a character-changing ability to give us new fruit and to replace love, peace, and joy with bitterness, resentment, and strife.
[time=1764] It comes not from our circumstances.
[time=1767] It comes from the Spirit of God living on the inside.
[time=1772] Let me give you several contests between happiness and joy.
[time=1776] Happiness is reactive.
[time=1778] It's the thermostat.
[time=1781] Joy is proactive.
[time=1784] It's the thermostat.
[time=1787] Happiness is external.
[time=1789] Joy is internal.
[time=1791] Happiness comes from events.
[time=1793] Joy comes from God.
[time=1795] Happiness comes from an effect.
[time=1799] Joy comes from a cause.
[time=1802] Happiness comes from feelings.
[time=1805] Joy comes from values.
[time=1807] Happiness comes from expectations met.
[time=1810] Joy comes from expectations managed.
[time=1815] Happiness comes from having what I want.
[time=1818] Joy comes from wanting what I have.
[time=1823] Is this really possible that people can find joy in the most difficult of circumstances?
[time=1829] One final story for you.
[time=1831] There was a man by the name of Victor Frankel, who survived the Holocaust at Auschwitz, a Nazi concentration camp.
[time=1841] He went through that camp and survived.
[time=1844] But he lost his mother, his father, his sister, and his wife.
[time=1851] But somehow, he came through it and he analyzed himself.
[time=1854] He also said, I observed when we were in the concentration camp, there were some people who were so vicious they would steal the last piece of bread from a dying man.
[time=1865] But there were other people who would give up their last piece of bread when they were dying so that somebody else could live.
[time=1871] He said, what was the difference between those two men?
[time=1874] He concluded it was something that was inside them, not something that was external to them.
[time=1881] He went on to study and read and write.
[time=1883] And in his quoted book, So Off Man's Search for Meaning, he said this, the ones who made it through Auschwitz did not die because they had adequate food or provision.
[time=1895] They did not die because they had a reason to live greater than themselves.
[time=1901] They had a reason to live greater than themselves.
[time=1905] That's Philippians 1, 21.
[time=1908] For me to live is Christ and to die is gain.
[time=1912] I have something to live for greater than myself.
[time=1915] I would ask you this on this occasion.
[time=1919] Are you living for someone greater than yourself?
[time=1921] Are you living for the Lord Jesus Christ?
[time=1925] He is the source of joy in a world that's coming apart.
[time=1929] You'll stay glued together by His Spirit.
[time=1932] Let's pray.
[time=1934] Let me pray for you, and then I'll announce I'm praying with you.
[time=1939] Lord, I pray that your Holy Spirit would take my muddled messes and make sense out of them, that you would open up the eyes, open up the ears, that those who've seen and heard would understand and believe because you've enlightened them.
[time=1953] We pray that in a powerful way.
[time=1954] You'll transform them in Jesus' name.
[time=1959] Now I want to pray with you.
[time=1961] If you've never turned your life over to Christ, if you've not lived for something greater than yourself, Jesus, now is your opportunity to make the initial step.
[time=1971] I'd suggest you pray something like this, Lord Jesus.
[time=1975] I pray that you will forgive me of my sins, that you would come on the inside and change me from the inside out.
[time=1983] I acknowledge my sin.
[time=1985] I ask you to save me, amen.
