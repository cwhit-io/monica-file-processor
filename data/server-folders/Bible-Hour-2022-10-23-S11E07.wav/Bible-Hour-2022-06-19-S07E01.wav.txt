[time=0] We're going to talk to some fathers today, we're going to talk to some fathers.
[time=5] And ladies, you can join in on this because it applies to you too because you have a role to play in the lives of our children.
[time=12] But I want to talk especially to fathers because God has given us a special place in the household.
[time=18] He's given us an assignment and that's a threefold assignment.
[time=22] It's priest, protector, provider of your household and of the children that God has given you
[time=31] responsibility for, priest, protector, provider.
[time=40] The world will sell you a lie, men, fathers, that if you are providing for your household,
[time=49] your role is complete.
[time=52] The world will tell you, go out and make it as much money as you can if it pulls you out of your house.
[time=56] That's fine.
[time=57] As long as the money's going home, your family's being taken care of, everybody's driving a nice house, going to the best schools and so on, you're doing your job.
[time=65] But that's not what the word of God says.
[time=67] The word of God says your first obligation is to be the priest of your household, to
[time=73] be the pastor of your children, to point your kids to Christ.
[time=80] Secondly, it's protector and thoroughly it's provider.
[time=83] And please don't get them flipped.
[time=88] Please don't make the drastic mistake that I made at one time in my life of getting it flipped.
[time=94] Going to work every day, leaving before the kids got up, coming home after they've gone to bed, sometimes I always kept a suitcase with two or three days of clothing in my trunk.
[time=104] So in case I had to leave the office and get on a plane to be gone for a couple of days, it was no problem.
[time=108] I had it covered.
[time=112] But during that process, and get this guys, I was making over six figures at that time.
[time=118] I had an expense account, I had a car allowance, excuse me, I had a corporate American Express, I just threw it down, do whatever I wanted to do, go take care of business.
[time=127] But during that process, I stopped going to church.
[time=131] I stopped interacting with my children, I stopped being the priest of my household, and it almost cost me my family.
[time=141] It wasn't until I had enough, and I said I'm done with this, and I walked out of my office, I took everything that belonged to me out, I told them to mail my paycheck that was due me, I was not coming back.
[time=153] On my way home, I'm trying to figure out how in the world am I going to tell my wife that
[time=165] I just quit the job that's providing all this stuff for us, that's doing this, that allows
[time=171] us to do this, that allowed her and I to go to Hawaii for 10 days, working about a half
[time=177] a day, but on the expense account, I was able to stay there for 10 days.
[time=181] How am I going to tell her that I walked away from this job?
[time=185] Wasn't easy, so I walked in the door, and I said, "Sherry, we've got to talk." I said, "Come on in here, have a seat because you need to understand this, what just happened."
[time=197] First of all, I was home early, this was like two o'clock in the afternoon, which is unheard of for me to be coming in that time of day, so she knew something was up, and I told her, I just quit.
[time=207] She goes, "Really, yeah, Bruce and I had a blow up and I said, I'm gone, I'm done, I'm
[time=214] finished, I'm out." Do you know what this crazy woman did?
[time=218] She started praising God, and I'm going, "Wait, but you don't understand, Sherry, I just walked
[time=226] out on my job." She says, "Thank you." And she says, "Furthermore, you guys, this is her talking, not me."
[time=237] She says, "I was about to leave your ass."
[time=243] And I'm going, "What?" She says, "Yeah, I had gone and lined up an apartment.
[time=247] You were going to come home to an empty house.
[time=249] Why?
[time=250] Because you had put that job in front of your family, in front of your relationship with God and everything else, and I had had enough." She says, "As a matter of fact, I don't even want you to look for a job until the kids go back to school in September.
[time=263] This was in mid-July.
[time=264] I don't even want you, you need to reconnect with your babies, reconnect with your God, and then you go look for a job." So guys, be careful.
[time=276] Your first priority is priest, protector, provider.
[time=280] I guarantee you that if you cover the priest, part of it, the other two will fall in line.
[time=287] Because when you put the priest as your main priority, God promised that he would never
[time=294] leave you nor forsake you.
[time=296] God did.
[time=297] So the other two will fall in line.
[time=299] It's when you get it flipped and things get messed up.
[time=308] But there again, that's not here on my paper.
[time=311] That's not why I'm here today.
[time=316] In Psalm 139, starting at verse 13, "For you formed my inner parts.
[time=329] You knitted me together in my mother's womb.
[time=333] I will praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made, that my soul knoweth right
[time=341] well." When I see this verse, God put me together, God knitted me in my mother's womb.
[time=352] This is David talking, praising God for what he has done for him.
[time=358] And he's saying, "You knitted me together in my mother's womb.
[time=362] I will praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[time=366] Wonderful are your works that my soul knoweth right well." So when God puts you together, knitted each and every one of us together, he's put all the parts.
[time=375] Kevin went through this long about just the eyeball and all the connections, what it takes to make you see and how the brain talks with this and the nerves do this and that and that is what a God.
[time=387] But along with that, he gave each and every one of us, each and every one of our children dads, a gift.
[time=396] Everything that he wants them to do in their lives, that's why he put them together, it
[time=402] is our job to fan the flame of that gift.
[time=406] It is our job to stir it up.
[time=409] It's our job to make sure that our kids know that they are fearfully and wonderfully made.
[time=415] Because David writes with all that he encountered with God, he writes in the last part of that verse, he says, "And my soul knoweth right well." That means something inside of him is there churning and burning and rolling around saying,
[time=428] "My soul knows right well that I am fearfully and no matter what I'm facing, I'm fearfully
[time=435] and wonderfully made." Keep that in mind as we transition from songs over to Second Timothy.
[time=451] Here we find in Second Timothy chapter 1, we find Paul writing a letter to his young
[time=457] protege, Timothy, someone that he met on his second missionary journey in Lystra.
[time=463] Paul and Timothy were, Paul was a student of Timothy, he traveled with Timothy.
[time=470] Paul noticed Timothy, something strange about this guy.
[time=474] There was something in him that he felt he needed to nurture and he did.
[time=478] He nurtured Timothy to the point that he left him in charge of the church.
[time=484] There's a lot of lessons that I can learn from Paul because of his relationship with
[time=491] Timothy.
[time=492] Now, there is no record of Paul ever having any biological children.
[time=498] However, we know for sure that he had at least two sons, Timothy and Titus, because he took
[time=504] time to write letters to them.
[time=508] Paul was willing to step into the lives of two young men, at least two young men that
[time=515] the Scriptures record and feed into them, nurture them, give them encouragement, train
[time=522] them, walk alongside of them.
[time=525] I'm saying, "Wow, Phil, you've had some Paul's in your life because here's this kid from
[time=533] South Central Los Angeles whose dad was nowhere to be found when it came time for mom to
[time=540] birth him." I know where he was and everybody knows where he was, but that's the story for a different day.
[time=547] My uncle, Uncle James, had to take my mom to the hospital to birth me.
[time=552] My uncle, Uncle James, was who taught me about Christ.
[time=557] My uncle, Uncle James, my Paul, fed into my life, but he wasn't the only one.
[time=565] You see, there's this little church called Bethany in South Central Los Angeles.
[time=569] And in that church, I ran across some guys like Deacon Cook, Deacon Thomas, Ben Clark,
[time=575] my father-in-law, George Daggett, Charles Steppter.
[time=581] These are men that would feed into me as a father figure would, W.H.
[time=586] Wafford, our pastor.
[time=587] He would call me on, "Hey, baby." He was the only one that I would allow to get to call me boy.
[time=594] He said, "Boy, you better come on over here.
[time=597] Why?" And then Deacon Cook would call me, he'd say, "Boy, no, he would call me baby." He'd say, "Baby, I need your help.
[time=604] You need my help doing what?" He wanted me to come over there and count chairs.
[time=609] I'm going, "You needed me for that?" What he was doing was teaching me responsibility of a Deacon and an elder at a church.
[time=620] He was taking me under his wings.
[time=622] He was a Paul to me.
[time=624] And then there was this guy called Al Wilson, who I met when I was 11 years old at my first
[time=630] boy scout meeting.
[time=632] Dag, you can relate to this, meeting your scout master.
[time=637] He became one of the biggest influencers on my life.
[time=642] And really, next knock of James, he's probably the one that I would call out, has had the most influence on me.
[time=649] You see, when I was 11 years old, I got arrested for Jimmy and pay phones.
[time=656] Yes, Eli, Isaac, I got arrested.
[time=661] I got arrested for Jimmy and pay phones.
[time=664] Literally, I was out with a friend of mine.
[time=667] He was 13.
[time=668] I was 11, and we hadn't made a circuit around the neighborhood where we would get the money out of pay phones.
[time=673] Well, one night we were out doing our collections, and I noticed a police car ride by.
[time=678] And I said, "I'm out of here." And I ran home and I went and sat in my closet.
[time=682] For some reason, I thought my closet was a safe hiding place.
[time=685] A few minutes later, I hear a wrap on the door.
[time=688] And I hear my mom telling, "He's in there.
[time=690] Go get him.
[time=691] He's in there.
[time=692] Go." So I'm sitting there, I hear the door opens, and there's this 12-foot guy.
[time=702] So I come out.
[time=703] He takes me out.
[time=704] And as he's taking out, my mom says, "Take him on out of here.
[time=706] I ain't coming to get him.
[time=707] I told him I would never come and get him out of jail.
[time=710] I'm not doing it.
[time=711] I'm done with him.
[time=712] Take him on out of here." So I'm crying my eyes out as they put me in the car, take him down to the station.
[time=718] It's really not us.
[time=719] But it's important that I want you to understand what a Paul means in a kid's life.
[time=724] They got me down to the station and I spelled my guts.
[time=728] I told them, "Well, this one, this one, this one, well, why weren't you saying we didn't do anything?" I said, "Yes, we did." And I said, "Okay.
[time=734] We're going to let you go.
[time=735] We're going to let you go home, and this is the end of the story for you." I said, "Okay, great.
[time=740] But how am I going?
[time=742] How am I coming to get me?
[time=743] Where am I going to go?" I said, "I'm in the opening door and their mom stood.
[time=748] I still get chills thinking about it today.
[time=752] Mom stood there.
[time=753] She was waiting for me and she didn't say a word.
[time=757] So we get home and again, I'm pretty happy.
[time=760] I'm going home in the car.
[time=762] Oh boy.
[time=763] I got out of that one.
[time=764] I'm not going to get here." She says, "Boy, go in there and take off your pants and lay across the bed." Okay.
[time=771] She gave me the weapon that I'm still talking about today.
[time=773] I will never forget that weapon.
[time=776] But when she was done, she says, "I've got to find something else for you to do.
[time=780] I've got to find somebody that can influence your life." Tuesday night, you're going to scout meeting with Jodie.
[time=786] I said, "Okay." Because she made me go to scout meeting, I can't run across Al Wilson, who has been wonderful.
[time=794] He took me in his arms like a, like a Paul, took Timothy, trained me, taught me all kinds
[time=800] of things.
[time=801] From my relationship with him, I'm much the man that I am today.
[time=806] He engaged with me.
[time=807] In fact, after that, when I would get in trouble, my mom would say, "We're going to go see Mr. Wilson." I go, "No, no, no.
[time=813] Just spank me and get it over with because I don't want to go and disappoint Mr. Wilson." That's the kind of influence he had.
[time=820] Like Paul with Timothy, he took time with me.
[time=823] He would come pick me up.
[time=824] He would take me again.
[time=825] He would make sure that I got to the meetings outside of our scout meeting, see I was in the order of the arrow, I didn't want to explore.
[time=832] Mr. Wilson would come pick me up and take me.
[time=834] He and his wife, one of them, we're going to come and get me and make sure I needed to be where I, so I would get exposed to things.
[time=840] Then because of that exposure, I spent some time in Gerald Ford's office as a teenager.
[time=844] I got to represent Los Angeles in Washington, D.C.
[time=847] I was riding around with the president of major corporations as a kid that was in scouting in South Central Los Angeles.
[time=854] I got exposed to a lot of things I will never touch had I not been engaged with K.
[time=859] Now Wilson, Timothy's in my life.
[time=863] I set all that to say this, Timothy, Paul was a mentor and a teacher.
[time=869] In fact, Paul called Timothy his son.
[time=874] So dads, even if you don't have any young kids in the house, find someone that you can
[time=881] serve with, someone that can walk alongside, find someone that you can, that you can mentor, find someone that you can invest in.
[time=888] That's someone that you can pour into like Paul did with Timothy.
[time=893] So when we go into scriptures, and I'm finally getting to what I have here, here it is.
[time=903] Second Timothy, chapter one, verse three.
[time=906] I thank God for whom I serve as did my ancestors with a clear conscience.
[time=912] And I remember you constantly in my prayers day and night.
[time=917] I remember your tears.
[time=919] I long to see you that I may be filled with joy.
[time=923] I am reminded of your sincere faith that first dwelled in your grandmother and in your mother
[time=931] units.
[time=932] And now I'm sure dwells in you as well.
[time=937] For this reason, I am reminded to fan into flames, the gift of God which is in you through
[time=946] the laying on of hands.
[time=948] For God has gave us not a spirit of fear, but of power and love and self-control.
[time=957] Therefore do not be ashamed to testify about our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but share
[time=966] in the suffering for the gospel by the power of God, who has saved us and called us to
[time=972] this holy calling.
[time=976] Not because of our work, but because of his purpose and grace, which he gave us in Jesus
[time=982] Christ before the age in which now has been manifested through the appearance of our Savior,
[time=988] Jesus Christ, who abolished death and bought life and immortality to light through the gospel.
[time=997] For which I am appointed a preacher, an apostle and teacher, which is why I suffer as I do.
[time=1005] Do not be ashamed for I know whom I have believed and I am convinced that he is able
[time=1013] to guard me until that day, until the days which are entrusted to me.
[time=1019] So when I think about this verse, usually when I read the scripture especially in the ESV or King James, I like to go back and read him in a different translation, one that's
[time=1030] more modern language, maybe it will help me understand what's going on here.
[time=1033] So I found the message which kind of helps me to understand what Timothy, what Paul was saying to Timothy.
[time=1039] And the message reads in this manner, it says every time I say your name in prayer, which
[time=1048] is particularly practically all the time, I thank God for you.
[time=1053] The God I worshiped my whole life in the tradition of my ancestors.
[time=1059] I miss you a lot, especially I remember the last tearful goodbye, and I'm looking forward
[time=1066] to a joyful, packed reunion.
[time=1071] That precious memory triggers another, your honest faith, which the rich faith that was
[time=1079] handed down from your grandmother, Lois, to your mother, and now to you, a special gift
[time=1086] of ministry received when laying on the hands, I pray that you keep that ablaze.
[time=1095] God does not want us to be shy with his gifts, but to be bold, loving and sensible.
[time=1101] Do not be embarrassed to speak up for our master or for me, his prisoner.
[time=1107] Make your share of suffering for the message along with the rest of us.
[time=1111] We can only keep going, after all, by the power of God, who first saved us, then called
[time=1119] us to this holy work.
[time=1121] We had nothing to do with it.
[time=1124] It was all his idea.
[time=1126] A gift prepared for us, a gift prepared for us in Jesus Christ long before we knew anything
[time=1136] about it.
[time=1138] So what Paul is saying to young Timothy is that we need to make sure that we understand
[time=1146] what we're going through.
[time=1147] Now, when Paul wrote this letter to Timothy, this is another, another nugget that you can grab from Timothy's lives and dads, I hope you're hearing me here, Paul wrote this letter
[time=1159] to Timothy when he was imprisoned for the second time.
[time=1165] I think Pastor Hawk talked about his first imprisonment where he and Silas were imprisoned and they were singing songs in the guards, opened up, but this is Paul's second imprisonment.
[time=1177] Paul on this imprisonment was certain that he was going to be put to death.
[time=1182] Paul was locked up in a dungeon knowing that it's going to die, but he didn't go into a
[time=1188] pity party.
[time=1189] He didn't write Timothy a letter saying that I'm locked up for the gospel and I sure need your help.
[time=1195] Oh, oh, it's me.
[time=1196] I don't know why I'm here.
[time=1197] Please send me some money to put on my books.
[time=1200] Please help me.
[time=1200] Please come and figure out a way to get me out.
[time=1202] No, Paul didn't.
[time=1203] He didn't do any of that.
[time=1204] What he did was send a letter to Timothy to encourage him to keep moving forward.
[time=1212] How many of us would have that same tenacity, that same drive if we were down and out in trouble?
[time=1217] How many of us have said, oh, I'm too old?
[time=1221] I don't have time for that.
[time=1224] How many of us men have said, no, it's not over until God says it's over.
[time=1234] As long as you have breath in your life, take a lesson from Paul.
[time=1237] He's about to be put to death, but what does he do?
[time=1239] He pins a letter to Timothy to encourage him.
[time=1245] We're talking about, it's a strange thing to think that God took Paul out of the game
[time=1252] and put him in prison, but no, that's where he did his best work, was when he was locked up.
[time=1259] Paul encouraged Timothy.
[time=1261] Paul loved Timothy as a son, as a son.
[time=1266] He took him under his wing.
[time=1269] So when I look at what was happening to Timothy, he was dealing with false teachers.
[time=1273] He needed encouragement.
[time=1276] Timothy was dealing with false teachers.
[time=1278] They were jealous of his youth and his bigger, and they gave him the respect he needed, so
[time=1284] Paul needed to encourage his young protosac.
[time=1287] So as I look at this text, there are four things I want you to keep in mind.
[time=1292] The passion, the preparation, the persecution, and the proclamation.
[time=1301] Let's look at the passion, verses three and four.
[time=1305] I thank you.
[time=1307] I thank God for whom I serve as did my ancestors.
[time=1311] With a clear conscience, I remember you constantly in my prayers, day and night, dads, how many
[time=1319] of us pray for our kids constantly, day and night?
[time=1326] I don't know about you, but I got a call from my daughter, my oldest daughter, Rachel, a couple of days ago, and she's having some health issues, and I pray for her.
[time=1338] But I'm going to be a little bit transparent.
[time=1340] That's probably the first time that I pray for her in a while.
[time=1343] So this message is speaking to me.
[time=1346] I need to pray for my children daily.
[time=1348] You need to pray for your children daily, day and night.
[time=1351] Keep your children lifted in prayer.
[time=1353] You know why?
[time=1354] Because if we don't lift them up in prayer, if we don't, there's somebody out there that's got a different prayer that you don't want to hear.
[time=1361] If somebody else out there that will get into their mind and into their heart, like, yeah,
[time=1369] there's somebody else that's looking to gobble up your young men and your young women.
[time=1373] We have got to keep them lifted in prayer.
[time=1375] We have to got to keep the Word of God present before them.
[time=1380] As a dad, that is our responsibility.
[time=1383] And as I used to tell my children all the time, I'm going to do what God told me to do.
[time=1387] What you do with what I teach you once you're out of my house, that's on you.
[time=1395] So the passion here, praying for your children, day and night, praying with the same vigor
[time=1402] and clear conscience and drive and concern, the passion, you know what?
[time=1409] What greater gift is to introduce your kids to the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=1416] Pray with the passion and compassion that you have.
[time=1420] Persistent in prayer, pray without ceasing, Paul wanted to remember the times that they
[time=1426] were together.
[time=1427] He remembered Timothy's tears.
[time=1430] You're talking about a close relationship when you can remember somebody's tears as they're crying, as you're getting ready to leave, longing for you to stay.
[time=1437] There was passion for the Word, there was passion for the relationship, there was passion for their friendship, there was passion for the Father's son relationship.
[time=1446] The same type of passion that you and I should have for our fathers and our children.
[time=1455] Paul wrote to Timothy to encourage him, to warn him, to persuade him, to fan up the gifts.
[time=1464] Because in the fanning of the flames, and I'm getting ahead of myself, sorry, guys,
[time=1475] in verse five and through seven, it talks about, "I am reminded of the sincere faith
[time=1486] that was dwelt first in your grandmother, Lois, and in your mother Eunice, and now I'm sure dwelt in you as well.
[time=1493] For this reason, I am reminded to fan into flames the gift of God which is in use through
[time=1500] the laying on of hands.
[time=1502] For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and love and self-control."
[time=1508] So there's a preparation that goes along with this story.
[time=1511] There's the passion, there's the preparation.
[time=1514] The first thing was education.
[time=1516] It talks, Paul talks about what he had learned from his mother and grandmother.
[time=1522] And unfortunately, in this story, there is no mention of Timothy's father.
[time=1525] I couldn't find anything other than he was a Jewish Greek, he was the son of a Jew and
[time=1533] a Greek.
[time=1534] That's it.
[time=1535] So there's a big old gap there.
[time=1538] We should have been filling that gap.
[time=1541] Paul's dad should have been filling that gap, but thank God for his mother and his grandmother.
[time=1545] The teaching involved, Paul spent time with Timothy because Paul met Timothy on his second missionary journey in Lystra.
[time=1552] And they spent time together, Paul taught him, Paul encouraged him.
[time=1555] He watched Paul work, he watched, he listened to Paul's stories, he listened to Paul's life.
[time=1560] Paul and Timothy had a relationship.
[time=1564] And then they would talk about the endowment.
[time=1567] Well, fearfully and wonderfully made, things placed in your heart, God gave stuff to Timothy
[time=1573] that he knew he could, God wanted God.
[time=1575] He had a mission that God had planted in him.
[time=1577] And then Paul says, "And it came forth when we laid on hands.
[time=1580] And so Paul was saying, 'We laid hands on you of a gift that was given to you.'"
[time=1587] So Paul says, "We need to stir up the gift." And in verse, fan into flames in verse six.
[time=1599] Anaparacio in the Greek means to stir up, to inflame in one's mind, to strengthen, to
[time=1611] kindle up.
[time=1613] So it paints the picture of me, me being a scout.
[time=1617] I've built many of fires.
[time=1620] Many of fires.
[time=1621] I've watched many of fires go out.
[time=1623] But if you catch it in time before it goes completely out, you can move some of the stuff away and you'll find a little ember down in the fire that's still red.
[time=1632] And if you fan it a little bit or blow on it, it'll get a little hotter.
[time=1638] And if you keep blowing on it and you put a little grass on it, all of a sudden you've got a blaze that pops up.
[time=1644] That is what Paul's talking about, fanning the flame in flame, but wait a minute, hold on.
[time=1650] That's just a little fire.
[time=1651] How much power does that have?
[time=1653] It's a little fire.
[time=1654] I'm going to fan the flame.
[time=1655] And you know what?
[time=1656] It doesn't work.
[time=1657] You got to take off your hat and you've got to really fan that flame to get some good air going through there.
[time=1661] And it'll poof, but you've got to lay some stuff on there.
[time=1665] You've got to put some kindling on there, some small twigs.
[time=1668] Yes, Jesus loves you.
[time=1670] Your fearfully and wonderfully made.
[time=1672] And then you go back, you go back to that fire and that starts being consumed by the fire and it's starting to grow.
[time=1677] You've got to lay some logs on there.
[time=1678] You've got to put some big stuff on there.
[time=1680] You've got to re-encourage your kids.
[time=1682] You've got to say stuff like, "God, did not give us a spirit of fear, but of love and the sound of self-control, 2 Timothy 2.1." Take that log, put on the fire and watch it grow.
[time=1696] Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not only as your own understanding and all your ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct thy path, Proverbs 3.5.
[time=1705] Take that log and put on the fire and it's going to go a little bigger.
[time=1708] It's going to grow bigger and bigger and bigger.
[time=1710] And it says, "I know the plans I have for you set the Lord.
[time=1713] Things of welfare are not of evil, plans to give you a future and a hope." Take that log, put on the fire.
[time=1719] It's getting bigger.
[time=1722] Do not be conformed into this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may be test what is discerning, what is the good and perfect will of God.
[time=1732] Apps, acceptable and perfect will of God, Romans 12.
[time=1736] Take that log and it's growing up, it's getting higher, it's getting higher.
[time=1740] The Lord is my separate, I shall not want, Psalms 23.1.
[time=1745] For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believed in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[time=1752] Take that log and all of a sudden you've got a flame that's just blowing like crazy.
[time=1756] And I'm telling you, if you've got that kind of flame in your kiss, they won't be afraid
[time=1762] to tell the story of Jesus Christ because they know, because they've been nurtured, because they've been kindled.
[time=1767] They've been pumped up.
[time=1768] They understand the God that they serve.
[time=1773] That gives them the power to preach boldly, that gives them the courage to stand for it when the world starts to attack it.
[time=1780] Why are you doing that?
[time=1781] Because this is what my God expects me to do, this is what Jesus would do.
[time=1785] Didn't He just beat you up, but you're over there praying for Him?
[time=1789] Yes, because that's what God said for me to do.
[time=1791] I'm not going to do that because that's not pleasing to God's side because my fire is burning.
[time=1797] My gift is being churned.
[time=1800] Dad's, Mom's, we have an obligation to stir up the gift, to fan the flame that's put in
[time=1808] our children.
[time=1810] And we've got to do that with the Word of God, each and every day, each and every day, because
[time=1817] the next point is the persecution.
[time=1819] They're going to get persecuted, believe me.
[time=1826] The world is going to try to teach them things that are just totally contrary to the Word of God.
[time=1832] And they're going to get persecuted for trying to follow God's Word.
[time=1835] They're going to need something to rely on.
[time=1837] They're going to make sure they've got, you know, fearfully and wonderfully made that my soul knoweth, right?
[time=1843] Well, they've got to have some stuff on the inside in order to stand up to what's going to attack them from the outside.
[time=1852] We have to fan up the gifts of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=1857] We need to make sure that our children, our children, are convinced and firm and convicted
[time=1868] with the Word of God, that they will stand firm when the going gets tough and the tough
[time=1874] gets going because they are going to be persecuted.
[time=1880] And in that persecution, in verse 7, 8, 9, Paul reminds them to do it humbly.
[time=1886] It's not about you.
[time=1889] It's not because we can do nothing without God.
[time=1893] In fact, it wasn't his high did at all.
[time=1895] It wasn't your high did all.
[time=1896] It was his.
[time=1897] You had nothing to do with it, humility.
[time=1900] And when it hurts, and when you overcome, remain humble, remain humble.
[time=1912] The proclamation, this is where the rubber meets the road.
[time=1918] The power of salvation.
[time=1924] Once you have shown them the passion, once you have prepared them, once they've been
[time=1931] persecuted, the proclamation will come up.
[time=1936] You see, there's a song that says, "I was sinking deep in sin, far from the peace was
[time=1947] for, very stained within, seeking to rise more, but the master of the sea heard my despair
[time=1956] and cry from the waters lifted me." Now say, "Fam I," Jesus said, "God so loved the world that He gave His only to be out
[time=1967] in the sun so that I could be lifted out of the muck and the mire that I'm so naturally
[time=1975] thrown to get into." God said, "Look down there on earth.
[time=1984] It's messed up.
[time=1986] They've served sin down there, everywhere you turn, they're sinned.
[time=1989] I can't find one righteous, and I can imagine, if you will, Jesus is standing there, and
[time=1995] He says, "I need someone to go that is blameless so that I don't lose my relationship with those folks down there." Jesus says, "You know what, Dad, I'll go." I'm just imagining the conversation going on between God, but you're my only son, and you're going to go because I can't live with somebody who's got to pay that debt.
[time=2014] Somebody's got to be a sacrifice for those folks down there.
[time=2017] You see Phil down there, some 2,000 years later, somebody's got to pay a debt for the sins that he's got.
[time=2022] Somebody's got to be able to open up the door that allows him to get back to him, and Jesus says, "I'll go." So Jesus said, "I'm going to go down to earth." We're talking about the proclamation here, "Boys and girls, fathers, this is what you want to teach your kids to understand the gospel messages that, yes, you're a sinner in need of a Savior," that, yes, Jesus decided with the Father that he's going to come down
[time=2044] from heaven.
[time=2045] You see, heaven is this wonderful place, and can you imagine you're sitting there with the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit, and you're going to go from there to here, and what you've got, how much you have to lower yourself to come down to earth, Jesus willingly came.
[time=2059] And the story goes that he spent 33 years walking along this earth, 33 years teaching, preaching, healing, 33 years praying to his Father.
[time=2069] He did nothing without the Father's guidance.
[time=2074] But then came that Friday, where his mission was about to be complete.
[time=2081] Then came that Friday, when he prayed to his Father, "Father, please remove this cup."
[time=2088] And you know what, it could have happened just that way.
[time=2093] But then he said, "No, no, no, not my will, but your will be done." Because the Father has the power to come, send the leads and the angels to come pluck him out and take him back, and where would that leave us, separated from the Father?
[time=2105] But Jesus said, "No, no, no, not my will, but your will be done."
[time=2111] So he allowed them to arrest him.
[time=2114] He allowed them to place him in chains.
[time=2116] He allowed them to beat him.
[time=2119] He allowed them to nail his feet to a cross.
[time=2127] He allowed them to praise a crown of 72 thorns upon his head.
[time=2132] He allowed them to pierce him in the side.
[time=2137] He gave up the ghost.
[time=2143] He gave it up.
[time=2145] But I am so happy and excited and thrilled the flame is burning because that's not where
[time=2152] the story ends.
[time=2154] That's not where the story ends, because three days later he got up from that grave.
[time=2159] And he declared all power in heaven and earth is in my name.
[time=2165] No power, that's where the power and the resurrection is because he died, he paid my sin debt.
[time=2172] But because he lives, I have an advocate sitting at the right hand of the Father, making the intercessions for me on a daily basis.
[time=2180] Because he lives, I don't know about you, but I'm done with the church and still have
[time=2187] Jesus hanging on a cross.
[time=2190] Because he's not there.
[time=2192] My Lord and Savior, he's alive and well and sitting at the right hand of the Father, making intercessions for me.
[time=2201] On a daily basis, when I get all messed up and don't know how to pray, all I gotta say is have mercy, Lord, and he knows, hey, that's what Phil needs.
[time=2212] We've got to make sure that our children, dads have that indwelling in their heart, and
[time=2219] it doesn't mean just the babies.
[time=2221] It doesn't mean just the little ones.
[time=2223] We've got to make sure our adult children, because we have an obligation as a father
[time=2229] to instill in the lives of our children every single day of their lives.
[time=2237] I am absolutely thrilled to be a father for Rachel and Vanessa.
[time=2244] I am absolutely thrilled to be a father figure to several people.
[time=2249] I am absolutely thrilled to on a weekly basis be able to influence children's lives every day.
[time=2255] And I've been asked this question by Arlen.
[time=2257] He says, "Is scouting a Christian organization?" My answer is absolutely no.
[time=2264] Because scouting does not require a God, you say you have a duty to God.
[time=2268] But Arlen, let me tell you this.
[time=2270] Any kid that's with me in the scouting program is going to get a Christian feel to it.
[time=2274] They're going to learn about the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=2276] They're going to hear me preach and model those things.
[time=2279] Not only the scout-o-scout law, but the love of Jesus Christ.
[time=2287] We have got to feed our children.
[time=2291] We have got to take control of what's going on in our nation.
[time=2295] This was not in the first sermon, I'm sorry.
[time=2297] But it is.
[time=2298] But it's so true.
[time=2299] It's up to us.
[time=2301] It's up to us, the dads, the Christians to stand up and quit being so silent.
[time=2311] Sound mind, love, self-control, fan the flames of your children, but also fan that flame in your heart.
[time=2318] Light it up, set it on fire, boldly proclaim that Jesus is Lord.
[time=2327] When my Bible teaches me every knee shall bow and every tongue, not maybe, I just hope
[time=2336] it's not too late when they realize that Jesus is Lord.
[time=2345] And there's going to come a moment for each and every one of them.
[time=2347] But as long as you still have breath in your bones, as long as you can breathe in and breathe out, there's still time to accept the Lord's Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=2357] As your Savior.
[time=2361] And then you can also say, every knee, I'm one of those knees, I'm going to bow and I'm
[time=2367] going to confess that Jesus is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
[time=2374] I don't know about you, but I can't think of any better gift to give to a kid as a father
[time=2380] than to point them to the cross.
[time=2383] To point them to the cross where Jesus bled and died for that child.
[time=2391] And got up and is still making intercessions for them on a daily basis.
[time=2399] I don't know about you, but I'm excited.
[time=2403] I'm excited to be where I am today.
[time=2405] I'm excited to be standing on this stage sharing the gospel with you.
[time=2409] I can't think of anything else I'd rather do.
[time=2413] Kevin, when he was here, he had this saying, the answer is yes, now Lord, what's the question?
[time=2419] I made that part of my life.
[time=2422] And because I have, I'll be going to Uganda in August.
[time=2426] I got a call last.
[time=2428] That's another story.
[time=2429] I'll be going to be my goodness.
[time=2432] Yeah.
[time=2433] So the answer is yes.
[time=2435] Are you willing to make a step today?
[time=2437] Are you willing to invest in someone else's life today?
[time=2441] I believe that's an answer for every dad.
[time=2445] And it's never too late.
[time=2448] As long as you have breath, there is time for you to start feeling and fueling and pumping
[time=2454] the kids up, pumping your children up, fan the flame, set it ablaze, get it going, get
[time=2462] it going, fan that flame.
[time=2466] Can I pray for us?
[time=2467] Father God, I thank you for the time we've spent this morning.
[time=2471] I thank you for the words that have come.
[time=2476] I thank you for the story of Timothy and Paul, and I thank you for the Pauls that have been in my life.
[time=2481] And Lord, I pray that someone here has been convicted to step up and be appalled to someone else.
[time=2488] I pray that you go with us in the name of Jesus, I pray, amen.
