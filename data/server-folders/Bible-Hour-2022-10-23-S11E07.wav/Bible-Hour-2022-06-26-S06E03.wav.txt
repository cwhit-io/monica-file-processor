[time=0] Today, we're going to talk about the book of Philippians.
[time=3] We'll be doing Philippians for the summer, and we're doing Philippians because Philippians
[time=9] is a book for all time, but particularly our time.
[time=13] Philippians was written to a group of people who were down, who were discouraged, who felt like the cards were stacked against them.
[time=21] To use a phrase out of the Gospel, Mark, the wind was against them and they were straining at the oars.
[time=27] Life was tough for these people.
[time=29] And Paul was writing to them about the joy of the Lord, not about happiness, not about good times, but a hope and a peace and a joy that you can have in spite of what's happening.
[time=38] So we're going through this because we live in hard times.
[time=42] We live in very uncertain times, and today we're going to talk about the uncertain times
[time=48] of which Paul wrote.
[time=49] But before we do that, can I back up two weeks to where we left off?
[time=54] It is chapter 1 of Philippians in verse 12.
[time=60] And in chapter 11, excuse me, chapter 1 verse 12, Paul writes and he talks about the things
[time=68] that have happened to him, "I want you to know has really served to advance the Gospel."
[time=76] Let me read that for you one more time.
[time=78] "I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the Gospel." The understanding amongst the people of Philippi was things are bad, things are going the wrong way.
[time=90] If we don't know whether we can trust what we thought were promises from God or not, Paul is in jail.
[time=96] He's been in jail for over two years, and people are wondering, "How's this work?"
[time=102] I thought Jesus was coming back.
[time=103] I thought we were going to reign with Jesus.
[time=107] And right now we can't even get into the prison to visit Paul without the Romans' permission.
[time=113] We're living in uncertain times.
[time=116] You and I are living in uncertain times.
[time=119] We wonder if the virus will come back, or will there be another virus.
[time=122] We wonder about inflation.
[time=125] We wonder about prices.
[time=127] We wonder about changes in the economy.
[time=129] We were suffering from a worker shortage.
[time=132] And so there's a lot of questions, and most of us have a long list of what ifs.
[time=138] What if I don't make the team?
[time=140] What if the test comes back positive, and I do have cancer?
[time=144] What if we lose the contract?
[time=146] What if people aren't willing to drive far enough to get here with gasoline over $5 a
[time=152] gallon?
[time=153] What if I don't make the team?
[time=157] What if I can't get pregnant?
[time=159] What if we never have children?
[time=160] What if my dad's job moves us all to Chicago or some other place?
[time=164] All I know is I don't have any friends if I move.
[time=168] What if life turns against me?
[time=171] They were living in uncertain times just as you and I are living in uncertain times.
[time=176] Paul says the things that happened to me, what had happened to Paul was he had been arrested
[time=182] in Jerusalem and imprisoned in Jerusalem.
[time=186] His trial was before the Jewish High Court, also known as the Sanhedrin.
[time=192] There was an assassination plot that was detected by none other than Paul's own nephew who
[time=199] went to the right authority of the Romans and says, "Look, you're going to get a request from the religious ruling body.
[time=204] They're going to say they want you to move Paul from your prison to their prison so they can interrogate him further and they're really trying to get him out of your safe haven and kill him." The commander believed the young man put an army detachment together and they escaped to the coast and the place called Caesarea.
[time=224] There Paul met a man by the name of Felix.
[time=227] He was the commander, he was the governor and Felix had power of life and death and Paul
[time=234] is in Felix prison and Felix calls upon him to defend himself and Paul lays out all the
[time=240] things that have happened to him that he's not a traitor to Rome, that he is a follower of Jesus and a believer in the power of Jesus to resurrect from the dead.
[time=249] Felix was fascinated by all this but sent Paul back to prison and said, "We'll talk again someday." And then Paul was called back to Felix and this happened over and over again and finally Dr. Luke, the author of Acts, tells us, "Well, here's what happened.
[time=265] Felix was waiting for Paul to bribe his way out of jail." So he brings him back for another inquisition, sends him back to prison.
[time=272] The day that Paul shows up with money, it'll be a good day for everybody, the way Felix finds it, but Paul won't do it.
[time=278] Felix is then replaced by a different man by the name of Festus, nothing to do with gun smoke.
[time=286] Festus is going through the same thing, trying to get a bribe out of Paul, listening but not really caring and then he's replaced by a gripper.
[time=293] Now Paul is three trials into it, Felix Festus a gripper and he becomes decisive and Paul
[time=300] says, "I'm a Roman citizen, I exercise my right to appeal the Caesar."
[time=307] And so Paul has been taken by shipwreck, snake bit along the way to Rome, which had always
[time=315] been his dream.
[time=317] Paul had wanted to go to Rome.
[time=318] If you read the epistle called Romans, Paul wrote to these people whom he'd never met before and said, "I longed to see you face to face." He wanted to go to Rome, but he didn't have a plan to get him to Rome.
[time=330] But God did.
[time=331] God said, "Paul, I'm going to take you to Rome and you're not going to have to raise a dollar to do it, you're going to be a guest of the Roman Empire."
[time=341] That's what happened to Paul.
[time=343] He's shipwrecked, snake-bitten, in prison now for the fourth, maybe fifth time.
[time=350] So Paul says, "The things that have happened to me," now this is the great part, "the things that have happened to me have served to advance the gospel."
[time=360] We would think that when the leader is in prison, that's not a good thing.
[time=364] But Paul says, "It has served to advance the gospel in two ways." The first way it served to advance the gospel is Paul said, "Everyone in the palace guard," now it's going to sound strange, but the palace guards were like the secret service.
[time=382] And they had jurisdiction over the palace, the prisoners that were detained there, and Paul was at the mercy of the palace guard.
[time=393] But in reality, the palace guard was at the mercy of the Apostle Paul.
[time=399] Now if you're not a believer in Jesus Christ, how would you like to be chained hand to hand and foot to foot to the Apostle Paul?
[time=407] You think that guy heard about Jesus nonstop, and we're going to find out at the end of
[time=413] the book of Philippians that many of Caesar's household came to faith in Christ because
[time=420] Paul was a prisoner.
[time=421] The things that happened to him, he said, happened for the furtherance of the gospel.
[time=426] He also said, "And because of my chains, others are being more bold, more fearless,
[time=432] more courageous to tell their story about faith in Christ.
[time=436] And now we have multiplied the army of people.
[time=438] God's doing what only God can do.
[time=440] God takes our opposition and turns it into opportunity.
[time=446] Whatever the worst thing is that's happening in your life right now, may be the best opportunity you'll ever have to serve Christ.
[time=453] Even though you may be faced with difficulty and adversity, God can take the worst part
[time=459] of your life and turn it into the most powerful part of your life to serve him and to bring
[time=465] others to Christ.
[time=467] God turns our opposition into our opportunities." Then Paul's dealing with another matter, verse 15, "It is true that some preach Christ out
[time=478] of envy and rivalry, but others out of good will, the latter do so in love, knowing that
[time=484] I am put here," mark that in your notes, put here underline that, we're going to come back to it, "knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel." The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely supposing that they can stir
[time=501] up trouble for me while I am in chains.
[time=505] But what does it matter?
[time=506] The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached and because of this, I rejoice.
[time=517] Now this brings us back to the big theme of this book is to choose joy.
[time=522] Paul mentions the word joy, be glad, or rejoice, I think the number is 17 times in four short
[time=529] chapters.
[time=530] And what he's saying to us in each one of these is that we can choose joy.
[time=535] Joy is not passive, joy is active, joy is stable, happening is mercurial.
[time=543] It goes up and down based upon what's happening.
[time=546] Joy is steadfast.
[time=548] And Paul says throughout this letter, "You can choose joy." For this, you and I cannot control what happens to us.
[time=557] But we can control how we respond to what's happening to us.
[time=562] Paul faced a number of uncertainties.
[time=566] Here are four of them.
[time=568] Uncertainty number one, would he be released or remain in prison?
[time=573] Actually, there's a third option he'll come to in a moment.
[time=577] He could be executed.
[time=579] He thinks the options are, "Could I be released or will I be retained?"
[time=586] Verse 19, "For I know that through your prayers and help given by the Spirit of Christ Jesus,
[time=595] what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance.
[time=598] I know that I will be released." That was his hope.
[time=604] That was his confidence.
[time=605] And as we read through this, we'll see he had some certainty.
[time=609] But then again, we'll see where he has uncertainty about what his future holds.
[time=613] But he wonders will he remain in prison or will he be released?
[time=618] We have in our legal system what is called a rid of habeas corpus.
[time=623] Simple terms, it means present the body.
[time=625] More complex terms, it's a legal standing where if you're in prison, our government cannot hold you in prison without claiming what the charges are and what the evidence
[time=636] is against you.
[time=638] And every lawyer is able to get a prisoner out of jail who's being held in jail if they can't show cause why they need to be retained.
[time=647] They didn't have that.
[time=649] Paul had no outs other than God and that is more than enough.
[time=655] Secondly, he would wonder with certainty some days and uncertainty other days, would he
[time=662] live or die?
[time=664] Here's verse 20, "I eagerly expect and hope that I will no way be ashamed but with all
[time=670] sufficient courage so that now, as always, Christ will be exalted in my body, whether
[time=677] by my life or by my death.
[time=681] For me to live is Christ and to die is gain." Now, if you don't believe that statement, nothing else that Paul says is going to make any sense.
[time=692] If you believe that Jesus is Lord, that he is risen from the dead, that he inhabits a
[time=699] real place called heaven and he has a home for you and you were made for her eternity and you were made for God, if you believe that, this statement makes sense.
[time=709] To live is Christ, to die is gain.
[time=712] But if you don't believe those things, then you worry and you wonder and you're uncertain and you have a lifetime of what ifs.
[time=720] Paul was uncertain what he would do if the choice was up to him.
[time=725] Meaning, I don't know what I would do if I had control over being detained or released.
[time=731] I'm not sure, I'm not sure which I would prefer dying or being with Christ.
[time=739] I'm not sure which is better.
[time=741] It's not that Paul had a death wish, he was not suicidal, he was not depressed.
[time=745] He believed to live was to serve Christ and to die would be better.
[time=751] Most of you know Linda Wright, she's a great lady of this church.
[time=755] When her husband Jeff died, I came to this very lobby to say my words of condolences.
[time=762] My first words were these, Linda, I'm so sorry that you lost Jeff.
[time=767] She put her hands on my shoulder and turned her head like, what did you just say?
[time=773] And I looked at her and she said, Rick, I didn't lose him.
[time=776] I know exactly where he is.
[time=781] So if you lose a loved one and you know exactly where they are, it's still a very real loss.
[time=787] It's not a permanent loss.
[time=790] And you can live by this axiom to live as Christ and to die as gain.
[time=795] Third, Paul would wonder, will I see them again or only write to them again?
[time=803] Will I ever get face to face time with these people that I led to Christ and love his brothers and sisters?
[time=809] Here's verse 27, whatever happens, uncertainty, we don't know, whatever happens, Paul says,
[time=817] whatever happens, you conduct yourselves in a matter worthy of the gospel.
[time=824] You may be suffering, you may be persecuted, you may be living under a pile of what ifs, Paul says, don't let that change where you are.
[time=833] Live your life in a matter worthy of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=840] Whatever happens, live your life in a matter worthy of the gospel from whether I come home
[time=846] and see you or only hear about you in my absence.
[time=850] I will know that you stand firm in one spirit, contending as one man for the faith of the gospel without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you.
[time=861] Why would he say don't be frightened because he knows God can take opposition and turn it into opportunity without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you?
[time=871] This is a sign to them that they are destroyed but that you will be saved and that by God.
[time=880] Number four, would they be required to suffer for Christ?
[time=885] We live in a culture where we are so blessed, we are so prosperous.
[time=889] We think our birthright is wealth.
[time=891] We think our birthright is freedom.
[time=892] We think our birthright is prosperity.
[time=895] We believe that we are the greatest nation in the history.
[time=898] And whether we are or whether we aren't, we are not great in and of ourselves.
[time=903] God says in Psalms, leaders I lift one up and I bring another one down.
[time=909] God governs in the affairs of men.
[time=911] God's in control even when it looks like Rome has all the control, God is still in control.
[time=918] So the question is will they have to suffer or not and Paul is not altogether certain.
[time=925] He says this, it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe on him
[time=931] but also to suffer for him.
[time=934] Now let me take a moment and focus your attention on the word granted.
[time=939] Paul saying it is a grant to suffer for Christ.
[time=944] Now here I am a novice, I am a rookie, I have never suffered in my life.
[time=948] I mean I skinned my knee, big deal.
[time=951] I have never suffered, I have not had cancer, I have not had the death of a loved one at a premature point in life.
[time=957] Our life has been blessed beyond measure but that is not normal.
[time=964] Suffering is normal.
[time=965] We are going to come back to that in a moment but look at the word granted.
[time=969] It means to be gifted, not you will be conscripted, not that you will be forced, you will willingly
[time=976] come to faith in Christ and it will be granted, it will be given to you the opportunity to
[time=983] suffer for Christ's sake.
[time=987] So how do we maintain joy in days of uncertainty?
[time=992] I want to suggest five things to you that I believe Paul is saying to us here.
[time=997] More than that I believe God is saying to us here through Paul.
[time=1001] Number one, remember joy is independent of what is happening.
[time=1006] Joy is independent of what is happening.
[time=1009] We cannot control what is happening but we can control how we respond.
[time=1015] Notice that the word happiness is a complex form of the word happening.
[time=1021] Same word, different ending.
[time=1023] Happiness is determined by what is happening.
[time=1026] If they release Paul, we will be happy.
[time=1028] If they don't persecute us, we will be happy.
[time=1031] Paul is talking about something deeper than that.
[time=1033] He will use this phrase in chapter four, a peace that passes understanding.
[time=1042] God gives a peace that is independent of what is happening to us.
[time=1048] Don't let anyone steal your joy.
[time=1050] They may make you unhappy but don't give up your joy.
[time=1054] Number two, remember that God works in our uncertainties.
[time=1062] Verse 19, knowing this, that I am being put here for the defense of the gospel.
[time=1069] The words put here struck me.
[time=1072] They're not here as prisoners of Caesar.
[time=1077] They're here as servants of God.
[time=1079] They were put here, not by Rome, not by lawyers.
[time=1082] They were put here, not by the Jewish Sanhedrin.
[time=1086] They were put here by the hand of God to give a defense of the gospel.
[time=1093] What do we mean by the give a defense of the gospel?
[time=1097] It means that they are to have a mature faith in Christ that is able to reason with others
[time=1105] about our faith in Christ.
[time=1107] It means in Peter's words, 1 Peter 30, 15, to always be ready to give an answer.
[time=1115] Here it talks about a defense of the gospel, same word, answer and make a defense.
[time=1123] Where has God put you?
[time=1127] Has God put you in general motors?
[time=1129] If he did, he didn't do that so you could make cars.
[time=1135] He did that so you could live a life worthy of Christ and front of the others who are building cars.
[time=1143] God's put you in a neighborhood.
[time=1145] God may have put you on a football team.
[time=1148] God may have given you cancer or Parkinson's disease.
[time=1151] Either way, it's God who did that.
[time=1153] You are under a lousy boss.
[time=1156] God put you there and treat him with respect.
[time=1159] Work for your boss as though you're working for the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1163] Paul's instruction in Colossians chapter 3.
[time=1166] You are put where you're put because God has a purpose for you.
[time=1170] How many of you, and I'm hope there are a few, but there may not be any who know the name Nell Collins.
[time=1177] Anybody know the name Nell Collins?
[time=1180] Nell Collins was a nurse who contracted cancer and she so courageously faced cancer that
[time=1187] she spent most of her times being injected with chemotherapy, witnessing to the person that she uttered next to her.
[time=1195] She became so well known as somebody to talk to if you're battling cancer that she could hardly keep her job for all of the brands in pressure to help somebody battle their cancer.
[time=1206] She became a missionary to cancer patients in the state of Indiana, and I believe the first church to support her was a place called Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=1217] And she was a powerful witness because she knew she was granted the privilege of suffering for Christ.
[time=1223] I want you to know I'm not signing up volunteering for cancer, but if God calls us there, we're
[time=1231] to live in a way worthy of Him because He has put us there.
[time=1234] We've been put there by Christ.
[time=1237] Number three, God uses oppositions to turn into opportunity.
[time=1242] We've talked about it abundantly today, but when you go through the what-ifs of uncertainty,
[time=1249] remember that whatever you're facing that seems negative or powerful against you, God can turn that into your greatest opportunity.
[time=1257] So many times, the person who is hostile to Christ is hostile to Christ because they're under the most conviction from Christ.
[time=1266] And those are the people who God has called us to wrestle with, not physically, not arguably,
[time=1272] but we are to present the gospel with Peter said it best, with gentleness and respect.
[time=1278] Even though they may be hostile and aggressive, we maintain gentleness and respect.
[time=1284] That's really the story of Paul.
[time=1285] We keep talking about Paul the apostle, Paul the servant, Paul the good one, Paul the author of the book of Philippians.
[time=1291] All right, but the deeper truth is this guy's name is Saul and he is a murderer of Christ.
[time=1299] One of the leaders of the church in its earliest days was a man by the name of Stephen.
[time=1304] And Stephen was stoned to death and Saul was standing right there saying, I'll hold your coat.
[time=1309] I'll hold your cloak so that they could get a full back pivot and throw their rock and
[time=1315] kill Stephen.
[time=1317] That was who this guy is.
[time=1320] He was a co-conspirator to murder and he's now our hero because he gave his heart and
[time=1326] faith to Christ whom he once hated and rejected.
[time=1330] Many of you will know the story of John Newton.
[time=1334] John Newton was a slave trader.
[time=1335] His primary slave route was Africa to the Americas, Africa to the Americas.
[time=1341] And he captured people, bought them from people, loaded up his ship, filthy conditions.
[time=1347] Many of them died before they made it to America.
[time=1350] That's the only thing that they awaited was slavery.
[time=1353] He was a wicked man.
[time=1354] He was cruel.
[time=1355] He was vile and he was a man who knew about Christ.
[time=1361] His mother told him about Christ, but he blew it off.
[time=1365] To one of his crossings of the Atlantic, a horrible storm blew in.
[time=1369] His ship was nearly capsized.
[time=1370] He thought for sure he would die.
[time=1372] And John Newton, the tough guy, cried out, oh God, if you would save me, I will serve you.
[time=1377] God saved him.
[time=1379] Be careful what you promised God.
[time=1382] God saved him.
[time=1384] He went back to England, studied theology, became an Anglican priest and became a strong
[time=1390] man in the pulpit, but he also wrote a few songs.
[time=1394] One of his songs goes like this, amazing grace.
[time=1400] How sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[time=1405] I once was lost, but now I'm found, twas blind, but now I see, it's grace that taught
[time=1412] my heart to sing and grace my fears relieved.
[time=1416] How precious did that sound first appear to me.
[time=1420] Amazing grace was written by a slave trader who gave his life to Christ.
[time=1426] He was the worst of the worst until God got a hold of his life and God takes our opposition
[time=1434] and turns it into our opportunity.
[time=1436] Number four, remember, yes, suffering is a part of God's normal plan.
[time=1444] It is normal for Christians to suffer.
[time=1447] The fact that I have not suffered is an anomaly, not a probability.
[time=1452] If you are like me and have had minimal suffering in your life, remember you're the exception and thank God for that.
[time=1459] But most of us will suffer.
[time=1461] We'll suffer the natural suffering of living in a fallen world.
[time=1466] We may suffer at the hands of someone who is evil and plotted against us, but the normal Christianity includes suffering.
[time=1475] Isaac Watts, who was the Chris Tomlin of his day, wrote, "Am I a soldier of the cross,
[time=1482] a follower of the Lamb, and shall I fear to own his cause or blush to speak his name?
[time=1488] Must I be carried to the skies on flowery beds of ease, while others fought to win the price and sealed the bloody seas?
[time=1496] Are there no foes for me to face?
[time=1498] Must I stem the flood?
[time=1500] Is this vile world a friend to grace, to help me unto God?
[time=1504] Surely, I must fight if I would reign.
[time=1507] Increase my courage, Lord, I'll bear the toil, endure the pain supported by that word."
[time=1514] God's called us to defend the gospel.
[time=1517] God's called us to be prepared to share the gospel.
[time=1521] We're not likely to have to defend the gospel in some physical conflict, but you and I are in a major intellectual conflict of our day.
[time=1530] That's what the late Rodney Zacharass would call the four big questions of life.
[time=1536] Who am I?
[time=1538] Meaning, am I a specific creation of God?
[time=1540] Are I the product of chance and evolution, time, plus the whole cycle of evolution?
[time=1550] Are my God's child?
[time=1553] Second question is, why am I here?
[time=1556] What am I supposed to do with this life?
[time=1558] If it's given to me by chance or if it's given to me by God, who can tell me what I should be doing with my life?
[time=1565] Third is morality.
[time=1570] How should I live?
[time=1572] And the final question is destiny.
[time=1575] How will all this end?
[time=1576] Those are the questions we need to be prepared to answer.
[time=1579] That's the fight we're going to fight.
[time=1581] We're going to do war with the Richard Dawkins of our days who says, "Well, we're nothing but DNA, DNA has no feeling, DNA does not care, it just is, and we dance to it."
[time=1594] Or is there a God who says, "I've made you and I've made you for a purpose?
[time=1598] I've designed you to be you with all of your strengths and all of your shortcomings and I have a purpose and a plan for your life and you may not know it on this planet." Job did not know on this planet that he was in the middle of a war between God and Satan,
[time=1614] but he was faithful.
[time=1616] Will you be faithful during these uncertain days?
[time=1619] Then finally, fifth and finally, remember that we are willing servants of the Lord Jesus
[time=1625] Christ, willing servants.
[time=1628] If we go back to Philippians chapter 1 verse 1, Paul identifies himself as a servant of
[time=1635] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1637] Two weeks ago we talked about the fact that many of these slaves were what we would title in our culture indentured servants.
[time=1644] Many of them were taken hostage and forced into slavery, but many of them were indentured servants, meaning they might make and agree with a craftsman, a silversmith, that I will
[time=1654] sell myself to you for seven years, I'll clean the floors, I'll dump the toilet buckets, I will do anything for seven years that you tell me to do.
[time=1663] If you'll train me to be a silversmith, that's an indentured servant.
[time=1667] Many of these people were indentured servants, Paul considered himself an indentured servant to Christ.
[time=1673] He loved that word do-loss because it meant that he was a slave of his own choosing, and
[time=1680] you and I are called to be slaves of our own choosing.
[time=1687] We sang a powerful song today, I'm so thankful for it.
[time=1691] Christ be the center of my church, Christ be the center of my life.
[time=1698] Let me ask you a deeply personal question, who or what is it the center of your life?
[time=1704] If you're like most of us, the big letter "I" is at the center of our life.
[time=1709] Many of us have asked Christ to take over the care and control of our life, and the cross of Christ is at the center of our life.
[time=1716] What normal Christianity is, we need to up our score once again.
[time=1721] Paul said this, that we are to give ourselves as living sacrifices to Christ.
[time=1729] We're going to have to do that more than one time.
[time=1732] He'll never leave you, he'll never forsake you, but as you drift through the uncertainties of life, if you drift away, he's always welcoming you back.
[time=1740] He'll never let go of you.
[time=1743] You are held, as Max Lucator would say, in the grip of grace, but if you strayed from the Lord, renew your life to him.
[time=1751] Put Christ at the center of your life.
[time=1756] Would you pray with me?
[time=1758] Lord Jesus, we ask you by your spirit to come and to seal your words on our hearts and
[time=1764] in our heads.
[time=1765] Give us a certainty that Christ is our Savior.
[time=1769] Give us a confidence in days that are filled with, or what ifs, that we don't have any doubts, that you're with us, that you love us.
[time=1777] Now we ask you to draw those who have never given their life to Christ to you.
[time=1783] Your grace is irresistible.
[time=1785] We ask you to call them in a gentle voice that is so strong they can't resist it.
[time=1790] And if that's you today, my words don't matter, God hears your heart, I'm just playing the
[time=1798] role of a coach.
[time=1800] You ought to pray something like this, Lord Jesus, I've lived my life for myself, I want
[time=1807] to live for you.
[time=1810] I ask you to forgive me of my sins and grant me a life of following Christ.
[time=1816] In His name we pray, amen.
