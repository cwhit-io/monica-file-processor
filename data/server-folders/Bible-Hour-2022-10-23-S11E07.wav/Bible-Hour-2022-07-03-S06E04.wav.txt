[time=0] Well, if you have your Bible, we're working our way through the book of Philippians.
[time=4] I'm going to talk at times as though you don't know anything and I do that because there are people who are coming to us for the first time and they don't know anything. They don't know who Paul is and that's not a fault of theirs. It's just our opportunity to start at the beginning
[time=20] from time to time. There was a man by the name of Jesus who performed extraordinary miracles
[time=28] and made outrageous claims. This Jesus said, "If you can imagine it, I am the Son of God.
[time=35] I am the Savior of the world." Andy Stanley put it this way, "What would your brother have to do
[time=42] to convince you that he was God?" There was a better chance that my sister convinced me that she was God than I convinced her. My sister was one of those who got all A's through school.
[time=53] I was one of those people that did not get all A's, but I didn't gym. You have to picture Jesus
[time=62] sitting at a table with his brothers and sisters and saying, "I'm the Son of God." How could he be
[time=69] that outrageous? Unless he was the Son of God. Repeatedly, Jesus made these claims. Repeatedly,
[time=76] people said, "Show me some evidence. Show me some proof." Jesus did a variety of miracles.
[time=83] He walked on water. He fed 5,000 people from one little boy's lunch. It's called the multiplication
[time=90] of the fish and the loaves, and he did that a second time for 4,000 people. They all became
[time=96] believers, but what really got their attention is when Lazarus died and he was buried rather
[time=103] entombed for four days and Jesus came. He stood outside the tomb and said, "Lazarus,
[time=110] come forth." And the dead man came back to life and walked out of that tomb. That Jesus had,
[time=119] as we sang earlier, the power to turn graves into gardens. And so the question then became,
[time=126] "How can we prove that this is true?" And Jesus said, "Destroy this temple," meaning his body,
[time=134] and in three days I will rise again. And that's exactly the story of Good Friday and Easter.
[time=140] Christ died on a cross executed by professionals, verified as dead by professionals,
[time=147] reported to the commanding officer that he was dead. To make sure they trusted a
[time=155] spirit into his side, just to make sure that he was dead. And he arose. He rose from the dead
[time=162] on Easter Sunday morning. That is so powerful because that is the proof that we should believe
[time=168] on him. He said he would rise from the dead. His enemies tried to stop them from having any reason to think that Jesus was nothing other than dead. And he showed up in the capital of Jerusalem and 500 people saw him at one time. He rose from the dead. But not everybody accepted,
[time=187] not everybody believed. And there were people who were determined to kill all Christians. One of those was a guy by the name of Saul, S-A-U-L. Saul made it his professional job to hunt down
[time=199] and kill Christians. A famous Christian by the name of Stephen was stone to death,
[time=205] and Paul was there orchestrating it, holding the coats of the men who would throw the stones.
[time=211] And Saul hated Jesus. Never believed that Jesus was God until one day he was on his way to a
[time=218] foreign city by the name of Damascus. And his purpose for going was to find more Christians,
[time=224] to arrest more Christians, to bring them back to Jerusalem and to see them executed. While he's on his way, he is struck by a bright light, knocked to the ground. And the voice said,
[time=235] Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? And Saul said, who are you? And he said, I am Jesus whom you persecute. And at that moment, Saul became a believer. Change his name to Paul,
[time=249] and by title or office he's known as Paul the Apostle. And he went around the country building
[time=256] churches, not buildings, bodies of believer. What's important here today is not this building,
[time=262] it's not the church. What's the church is you? You are the body of Christ in this world.
[time=272] He's put you here to tell his story so that others will come to faith in Christ. And the person who
[time=279] most hated Christ is now the most faithful follower of Christ under the name of Paul.
[time=288] He's written 13 letters to 13 different churches or individuals telling them how the Christian life
[time=297] works. One of those was to a city in Philippi, which we would say Turkey or Macedonia today,
[time=303] and he wrote them a letter that we call the letter to the Philippines. In that, he has an
[time=313] over-reoccurring over again and again term called "choose joy," meaning no matter what's happening,
[time=321] you can choose joy. There is a personality type that cannot stand conflict big or small. They
[time=331] will go out of their way to avoid the slightest possibility of conflict. This is called avoidance
[time=339] in psychological terms, but we call it grocery shopping. Have you ever been to the grocery
[time=345] store? You're looking for the spaghetti sauce and you're looking to say, "Right there, it says spaghetti," and you go, "Oh no, I just saw him. He's here." That person you most wanted to avoid
[time=354] showed up in your Scott's grocery store, and what do you do? You back the card up and you get out of it. You don't want to see him because there could be a conflict. There could be words that were exchanged. People who think this way, and it's very common, and I would include myself,
[time=370] we agree with a theologian by the name of Charlie Brown who said, "There is no problem in life so big
[time=378] that it cannot be run away from." In more professional terms, we are called people pleasers.
[time=386] We make bad decisions because we have weak boundaries. We too often say yes when every soul
[time=395] in our body is saying, "No, don't do it." But because we want to please everybody,
[time=401] including this person, we say, "Sure, I'll be glad to do it," and we wonder why they keep coming back
[time=408] to us. It's because we always say yes. They think we're such nice people for saying yes.
[time=415] We know on the inside we're weak people, and we meant to say no. We wish we had the courage to say no.
[time=421] There's an opposite group of people who are different than the people pleasers.
[time=426] These are the people who love conflict. It's their way of communication.
[time=432] They are the original Oscar the Grouch. It's the spouse who's always unhappy,
[time=439] nothing to be thankful for, and his only way of communicating is to complain.
[time=447] It's the toddler who throws a tantrum every time he receives an instruction he does not like.
[time=452] It's the one who's always playing one co-worker against another, one family member against another.
[time=461] We see that in families not just today, but in days of the Old Testament there are stories like this.
[time=470] There was a man who had two sons. One son was named Jacob. The other son was named Esau.
[time=477] Esau was dad's favorite. He was a hunter. He was an outdoorsman. He was a fisherman.
[time=484] He was a man with rough skin and tough hands, calloused where he needed to be.
[time=488] His brother Jacob in his eyes was a wimp. He was a mama's boy, and what he did was he used mama
[time=498] to get the dad. He wanted his inheritance from his brother. So he went to his mother and says,
[time=507] "I don't think it's right just because Esau was born a few minutes before me that he gets twice the inheritance I do." Mommy said, "You're right." What are we going to do about that, honey?
[time=518] And the two of them get together to conspire against the father and make up this whole story
[time=526] about, "You're not treating me fairly." And when the man got older he couldn't recognize the faces
[time=532] and he couldn't recognize the skin and the brother's switch places. Mom had a beautiful plan and they
[time=538] worked together against that. There is a name for that. It's called triangulation and it's often
[time=547] done between co-workers and family members to manipulate one person against another.
[time=553] These are the people who will steal our joy if we let them. The theme of Paul's letter
[time=559] to the church in Philippi is not to let them, but to choose joy no matter what happens.
[time=565] Paul had joy in prison. It was such overwhelming joy that it overflowed to the churches that he had
[time=573] started. Let me give you two principles today about dealing with conflict. The first is this,
[time=580] conflict is inevitable. You can walk away from the grocery line to avoid somebody. You can go
[time=587] three hours, four hours, five hours. It doesn't matter how many hours you go down. You can still
[time=593] end up in a conflict. Maybe not with that person, maybe with someone else, but you're going to go through life. You're going to be the nicest person you can be and you're still going to have conflicts.
[time=603] Conflicts are inevitable. Dealing with conflicts is one of the reasons why Paul wrote this letter.
[time=611] Let me just show you some of the conflict that's in the background of this story. In chapter 1,
[time=617] verse 15, we studied last week, Paul said some preachers are preaching Christ, but their motivation
[time=625] is out of envy and rivalry. They're thrilled that Paul is in jail because now they can take
[time=631] his place. They can be the person who makes the decisions. They can be the power broker of the day.
[time=636] And rivalry marked the heart of the people who were supposed to tell others about Christ.
[time=642] Verse 17 said, "Some preach Christ out of selfish ambition." Not sincerely,
[time=649] supposing that they can stir up trouble for Paul. Conflict. You cannot avoid conflict.
[time=659] In chapter 2, verse 1, he lists through a number of qualities, but in the end of it he says,
[time=665] be of one mind. Meaning they weren't of one mind. There was conflict there. You can have conflict
[time=676] when no one is even there. I remember a heated argument I got into with my mother-in-law.
[time=683] I know exactly where it happened. I was in my car in the corner of a Boit Center road and Homestead
[time=690] road, and my mother-in-law and I got into it. The odd thing is she had been dead for 20 years at that
[time=696] time. Does anybody else talk to dead people? So we have this habit as humans to do what was
[time=708] called self-talk. And what other people say to you is important, but what you say to you is what you really become. So really guard your self-talk in this passage. Paul's talking about being
[time=721] of one mind and doing nothing out of selfish, ambitious, vain conceit, but in humility, consider
[time=727] others better than yourselves. And then towards the end of the book he brings up another conflict.
[time=735] I plead with Eodia and Cinta Key to agree with each other in the Lord. Now we don't know these two
[time=742] women. We don't know the backstory. We don't know what the disagreement was. But somehow word got to the apostle Paul. They're living in Macedonia. He's about 800 miles away in Rome and somehow word
[time=754] got to Rome. Remember there's no mail. There's no internet. There's no texting. How did word get
[time=761] all the way to Paul that these women were quarreling and squabbling? We don't know the answer to it, but Paul says, "Get along in the Lord." What we want you to see is Philippians was filled with
[time=774] conflict. Don't be overwhelmed or broken disbelief because somebody has a conflict. It's inevitable
[time=783] in life that we'll have conflicts. Let me tell you about two more conflicts. Remember Saul,
[time=790] the persecutor? He shows up in church one Sunday and people don't know about his conversion to
[time=797] Christ. Some who do know about his conversion to Christ are suspicious about the whole thing.
[time=802] Is he now coming here to work underground? Is he going to betray all of us? So people kept their distance from Saul of Tarsus. They wanted nothing to do with him. But a guy went to the name of Joseph
[time=813] befriends Saul. And the two of them do a life group together. The Bible studied together. And in a
[time=819] word, Barnabas is born because Barnabas means son of encouragement. It's a nickname. His son of
[time=831] encouragement, meaning that Joseph reached out to Paul, took him under his arm, discipled him,
[time=838] and led him to a growing faith in Christ. His name, Joseph became Barnabas. So Barnabas and Paul
[time=848] get together and say, let's hit the road. Let's go to other places, other cities, and tell them about Christ. And they go on what we call the first missionary journey. It's successful. They
[time=860] start churches in many cities like Ephesus and Derby and Listera and Iconia. And they are resting
[time=866] in Antioch. And one of them says, let's go visit the churches we started. Let's go see how they're
[time=872] doing. So they plan missionary journey number two. And in the planning, Barnabas says, I'll get John
[time=879] Mark and he can go with us. Paul said, no, that is not going to happen. You see, John Mark was on
[time=886] the first trip and he went home. He didn't finish the trip. We don't know why, but we know that Paul
[time=892] held it against him. And Joseph, Barnabas, pleaded with Paul, let's take him with us and then became
[time=900] such a sharp dispute. I'm quoting Luke. There was such a star-sharched blue, sharp dispute
[time=907] that they separated and went two different directions. Barnabas took John Mark. Paul picked
[time=915] up a new name to us, Silas. Paul had a conflict with John Mark. Paul had a conflict with Peter.
[time=925] These are the two most influential people in Christianity. It's like the Pope and Billy Graham
[time=932] getting into an argument. These are the two most influential Christians in the history of Christianity,
[time=941] Peter and Paul. And there was a dispute. Peter was wrong. Peter had received from God an incredible
[time=951] vision. God had sent a message that he was to go to the Gentiles to preach the gospel. And he said,
[time=960] no, I'm not going to the Gentiles. I'm Jewish. So God gave him this dream. The dream was that a
[time=969] tablecloth came floating down out of heaven. And on the tablecloth was every kind of food imaginable,
[time=976] including things that Jewish people considered unclean. Don't eat it. Don't touch it. And don't
[time=982] eat with anybody who does eat it. And then the dream said, take and eat. And Peter said,
[time=991] Lord, I'm Jewish. I don't eat that stuff. It's unclean. And God said to him, key phrase here,
[time=997] don't call unclean. What I have made clean. And Peter got the message and he went to a Jewish
[time=1005] man, went to a Gentile man's house. Not only did a Jewish man go to a Gentile man's house,
[time=1011] he went to a Roman soldier's house, a Roman centurion, an officer's house, a captain's house,
[time=1017] and told him about Christ and led into faith in Christ. That's Peter's biography. Peter's got it
[time=1023] right. He's got this dream. He's got this vision. He fulfills his purpose. This was the time to
[time=1029] celebrate. But then some more Jewish people who were Christians came and said, I don't think this is right. I think you need to become Jewish before you become Christian. So that meant you've
[time=1041] got to agree to the Jewish giant. You've got to agree to their circumcision. You've got to agree to all of their rules and traditions. And if you believe in all that, then you can become a Christian.
[time=1051] And Paul said, no way. We never were able to keep those laws. Why in the world would we ask the Gentiles to do that? But there was a conflict. Paul hears about Peter because Peter's invited
[time=1066] all these Gentiles to church and then says, I'm not sitting with you. You sit over there.
[time=1072] The Jewish Christians sit over here. And Paul said, I confronted him to his face. Peter was wrong.
[time=1081] Wow. You want to talk about a conflict? Those are some powerful people colliding.
[time=1087] And here's the point. Conflict is inevitable. So don't be discouraged. Don't give up if you're
[time=1094] in a conflict. Try to resolve it. In fact, the second point we want to make today is conflict
[time=1102] is inevitable, but conflict is not invincible. Conflict doesn't have to rule your life.
[time=1108] And that's what Paul's going to teach us in chapter two verses one through 11. First point
[time=1114] he's going to make is remember what you have been given. Remember what you have been given.
[time=1119] Look at verse one of chapter two. If, now let me take a moment and talk about the little word,
[time=1125] if. If sometimes means if and it's in the realm of possibilities. If it doesn't rain tomorrow,
[time=1132] we will go golfing. That's in the realm of possibilities. But there's other times,
[time=1138] particularly in the language of the New Testament, Koine Greek, where if means something is true
[time=1145] and you're being reminded of it. And that's what Paul's using here. He's going to use four ifphrases and they're all true. There's not a moment of uncertainty about them. He says, if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ. The answer is of course they've had encouragement.
[time=1160] It changed their life to have Christ come in. I'm so thankful we sang breaks every chain because
[time=1167] Christ breaks the chain of addiction. He breaks the chain of bitterness. He breaks the chain of
[time=1173] people pleasing. He breaks every chain. So he's saying here, Paul's saying, if you have any
[time=1181] encouragement for being united in Christ, yes. I remember as a high school student more than 50 years ago giving my life to Christ and immediately I felt this encouragement because his spirit was
[time=1192] now living within me. He says, if you have any comfort from his love, doesn't bring you any
[time=1199] comfort to know this Jesus loves me. This I know for the Bible tells me so. I don't know of a
[time=1208] greater source of comfort in life than to know that Christ loves you. So Paul says, if you have
[time=1214] any encouragement or if you have any comfort from his love or if you have any fellowship with his spirit, when you are away from faith believing people for a period of time and you get reconnected
[time=1228] with people of faith, it's an incredible experience. I go back to my hometown of Akron, Ohio and
[time=1236] occasionally bump into an old friend and we talk about being in high school together and playing
[time=1242] sports together and fun things we did together and it's great going down memory lane but there's a handful of friends I have who walked with Christ in high school and they led me to faith in Christ
[time=1254] and they befriended me and when I see them I can hardly control the joy of my emotions because I have
[time=1262] that joy of being one in spirit with them. If you have experienced any tenderness and any compassion,
[time=1270] Paul says, if any of that is true, remember it and treat others that way. Number two, seek to win
[time=1279] the person, not the issue. Paul did not make any of these conflicts about the conflict. He made it
[time=1289] about the people. Did you notice he never named who were the teachers that were teaching out of
[time=1295] jealousy and envy and selfish ambition? He never once called them out by name. Did you notice that
[time=1301] he didn't say what the squabble between you, Odie and Cindy, we have no idea we can sit here
[time=1308] and guess and that's all we'd be doing is guessing. We'd be just as accurate if we put 50 suggested
[time=1314] faults in a barrel and a lot of monkey pulling out and say that's the answer. We have no idea
[time=1320] because Paul knew this. If you make it about the person winning the person you have a chance of
[time=1328] winning the argument but if you make it about winning the argument you can bet, you can bet
[time=1335] you're never going to win it because the person will be lost. There's an old joke, I hope you take
[time=1342] it as humor, that men you will never get the last word in in an argument with your wife and if you
[time=1350] think you did you just got the first words in the second round. The best answer you can give your
[time=1358] wife are two words, yes dear. See how brave I am when Kathy's at another church 35 minutes away.
[time=1365] None of you will ever mention this to her. I bet you'll find out before church is over.
[time=1372] Some of you have her text message and you can tell what's going on. Have you ever heard a family
[time=1379] squabble like this? The mother says to the son who's home from college, I saw your friend Jim
[time=1385] last week at Taco Bell and the husband says no it wasn't Taco Bell it was Elmo's. No it was
[time=1392] a Taco Bell, no it wasn't Elmo's and they squabble over where it was and they find, never mind go ahead with your story. Well I saw your friend Jim at Taco Bell on Tuesday, no it was
[time=1402] Wednesday and they have to be right. There are people in this world who have to be right and they
[time=1410] quarrel and they argue over things that do not matter. I've got good news for you and it's going
[time=1417] to sound like bad news but it's really good news. The leading secular experts on a marriage in
[time=1423] them our country today is a man by the name of John Gottman. Gottman has done what are called longitudinal studies meaning he didn't see a family for three months and say good luck goodbye.
[time=1435] He's seeing people for three months and then saying I'll see you next year and he's been following them for over 25 years and he has made this observation. This is going to shock you but it's
[time=1445] really good news. Gottman says that 20, 69% of all marriage arguments go unresolved.
[time=1456] Doesn't that sound discouraging? Gottman said it's a good thing. What it means is along the way
[time=1462] they realized it doesn't matter. Who cares? Let it go. I'm going to tell you about a great
[time=1470] man who lived in our city. His name was Bud Meeks. He was the sheriff. He ended up leading the
[time=1478] National Sheriffs Association. He came to faith in Christ here at Blackhawk back in 1980 something
[time=1485] and we became good friends. He spoke at the installation service when I became the pastor.
[time=1492] I always thought it was the odd term installed but anyway he spoke at that and as the sheriff he
[time=1499] sent out a memo to churches saying from now on each church can only have two people credentialed
[time=1506] to visit in the jail and I thought that's not fair. Some little church of 15 people gets two
[time=1513] passes. We're a church of 1500. We ought to get more than two passes. So one day I said Bud I don't
[time=1519] like this policy of yours. He said what's wrong with it. I said what's not fair and I ran through all that and he said I've got bigger problems. Deal with it. Isn't that good? Now I know I'm not
[time=1531] suggesting you say you're spout. I've got bigger problems. Deal with it. But his point was right we got to forget it and move on. Don't stay stuck. If you seek to win the argument you're going to
[time=1544] stay stuck. If you seek to win the person you're going to find freedom for both of you. Solomon and
[time=1550] all of his wisdom and I mean that most sincerely and all of his wisdom said this. It is to a man's
[time=1557] glory to overlook an offense. We think it's to a man's glory to show himself tough. It's to a man's
[time=1564] glory to win the argument. And Solomon said it's your true glory to overlook an offense.
[time=1571] Corey Tenbohm was once asked if she managed to forgive someone. She said I purposely remember
[time=1578] forgetting. Meaning yes she'd forgiven and she'd forgotten. If she was done rehashing the past.
[time=1587] If you seek to win the argument you'll never win the person. If you seek to win the person
[time=1593] you have a really good chance of winning both. Jesus never said blessed are the peacemakers
[time=1599] for they will become the winners. He said blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called the
[time=1605] children of God. Next principle I've divided into two I wish I had just left it at one. Humility is
[time=1613] the key to unity. Paul's advice is do nothing out of selfish ambition meaning it's not about you
[time=1620] or vain conceit you want to elevate your own name but do it in humility considering others better
[time=1626] than yourselves. Do nothing out of selfish ambition. You know there were people who viewed
[time=1634] ministry as an opportunity for self glorification. There's a whole book in the Bible but it's only
[time=1641] one chapter long called Third John. And it's about a guy by the name of diatrophies. And John describes diatrophies as he loved to be first. He loved to be first. Jesus told a story about
[time=1655] people who loved to be first. They go to a banquet and they position themselves at the head of the table. And the host has to come to them and say I'm sorry you're in the wrong seat would you go
[time=1665] down here to this end of the table. And you know how you tell the head of the table from the foot of
[time=1671] the table who gets served first. The diatrophies love to be first. Jesus said a man threw a banquet
[time=1680] and somebody came to the banquet and positioned themselves at a position of honor and had to be asked to be moved down to the foot of the table and the man at the foot of the table who was so self-effacing that's where he put himself, was escorted by the banquet holder to the very top
[time=1695] of the table to be served first. A secular author has taken Jesus' story whether he knew it or not
[time=1704] and given it new life. He titled his book This Leaders Eat Last. That's good advice. Leaders Eat Last.
[time=1719] Readers Digest tells a story of a reception being held in the honor of Ulysses S. Grant. He
[time=1726] got caught in his shower and offered to share his umbrella with a stranger walking in the same direction. The man said he was going to Grant's reception but only out of curiosity he never
[time=1738] has seen the general before and went on to say I always thought that Grant was much overrated
[time=1746] and Grant said me too. Number four, think about ourselves less and others more.
[time=1757] Verse four of chapter two. Each of you should not only look on your own interest but also look on
[time=1765] the interest of others. Rick Warren put this so well it's catchy you have to follow it carefully.
[time=1773] Humility is not thinking less of myself. Humility is thinking about myself less.
[time=1780] It's not thinking less of myself that I'm no good, I'm not qualified, I'm not capable,
[time=1787] I'm not loved, I'm not likable, I'm nobody. That putting yourself down is not what he's talking about thinking less of yourself. He's thinking about yourself less. There's a problem
[time=1798] that we all think it's all about me. I love the story who Guy said to his friend, oh enough about me. We've talked about me way too long. Let's talk about you. What do you like best
[time=1809] about me? It always comes back to me. Paul's advice is think about others less or think about
[time=1818] ourselves less and others more. Here are the words of Jesus. Whoever would exalt himself
[time=1827] will be humbled but whoever humbles himself will be exalted. That's called a paradox,
[time=1833] it's just the opposite of what you would think and so much of God's wisdom is paradoxical.
[time=1839] The world says this but Jesus said that. This is a case where not only did Jesus say it,
[time=1845] Solomon said it, Peter said it, James said it, and Paul said it. Five different authors of books of
[time=1851] the Bible have all quoted this statement. Humble yourselves and you will be exalted, exalt yourself and you'll be humbled. One writer put it this way. In the scriptures, the lesson is this, the fastest way up is down. Humble yourself on the side of the Lord and he
[time=1869] will lift you up. Fifth and finally, adopt Jesus as your role model. Adopt Jesus as your role model.
[time=1880] I saw a bumper sticker I liked. It said if Jesus is your co-pilot because there were bumper stickers around going, Jesus is my co-pilot or God is my co-pilot. Somebody came out with a great bumper
[time=1891] sticker that said, if Jesus is your co-pilot, you're in the wrong seat. Get out of that seat,
[time=1900] let Jesus be the pilot and you be the co-pilot. Here's what it says. Let this mind be in you
[time=1907] which was also in Christ Jesus or you should adopt the same attitude of that of Jesus Christ.
[time=1913] What was his attitude? Being in the very nature of God did not consider equality with God
[time=1920] something to be grasped. What's that phrase mean? It means that Jesus, who they knew to be fully
[time=1929] human, was also God. He was in the nature of God and in the nature of God, he didn't have to hold
[time=1937] on to his deed. He didn't have to grab it as though it could be lost. He said, Paul, I'm quoting here,
[time=1945] he did not consider equality with God something to be grasped but made himself nothing.
[time=1954] God didn't make him nothing. Pilate didn't make him nothing. Chiaphas didn't make him nothing.
[time=1960] The soldier, the crucified him, didn't make him nothing. He did that to himself.
[time=1966] Making himself nothing, he took on the very nature of a servant. We've talked about that for weeks now. A servant, in some cases, was a captive and forced into labor.
[time=1976] Sometimes a servant was a willing servant. It was an indentured servitude where they would say
[time=1982] something in the way of an agreement. If you will teach me the trade smith of a silver smith, I will work for you for seven years and there's an agreement that is made there.
[time=1992] But the important thing about that type of agreement is the individual chooses to become a servant.
[time=1998] That's Jesus. He's choosing to become a servant. No one is doing this to him. It is his church.
[time=2004] And being found in the appearance as a man, he humbled himself. Nobody humbled him.
[time=2010] He humbled himself and became obedient to death, even the death on a cross.
[time=2022] One of the words that we've created in English to describe the worst of pains is a pain that is
[time=2029] excruciating. Interesting to note that those are two Latin words put together.
[time=2035] X-E-X means from "crux cross." It's the pain of the cross. It's excruciating.
[time=2043] Not only did Jesus die, he died the most humiliating death, the most painful death,
[time=2049] and he died not because somebody came upon him and forced it. He was willing to die of his own accord.
[time=2056] About a generation ago, someone read this story of Jesus and wrote a poem that goes like this.
[time=2062] He could have called 10,000 angels, destroyed the world, and set him free, but he died on a cross
[time=2071] for you and for me. Here's a great word, "Therefore, because Jesus humbled himself,
[time=2080] because Jesus went to the cross, God has exalted him to the highest place and given him a name
[time=2088] that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on earth
[time=2095] and under the earth, and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the
[time=2102] Father. Jesus is the name that is above every name, and at the name of Jesus every knee will bow,
[time=2111] every tongue will confess. I don't want to seem harsh or aggressive, forgive me if I come across
[time=2118] that way, but I'm convinced that every living being someday will kneel before Jesus and confess
[time=2126] with their tongue that he is Lord." That can happen in one of two ways. That can happen willingly
[time=2133] when you choose of your free will to acknowledge that you need a Savior. My hand is up on that one.
[time=2140] I need a Savior. I need a forgiver. I need a liberator. I need somebody to break my change of habits and hurts and hang-ups, and when you recognize that and say, "Christ, I ask you to forgive me.
[time=2153] He gives you forgiveness because you have made him the Lord of your life."
[time=2159] Or it could happen a second time. When you pass from this world and there's a moment in the future
[time=2166] of history where God will bring everyone to a judgment seat and those that have never confessed
[time=2172] Christ as Lord will be forced to at that time. So you can come willingly to Christ or you can come
[time=2179] one willingly to Christ, but you're going to come to Christ. The most important decision you can make
[time=2187] in your life is to receive Christ, not just as your forgiver, but as the captain of your life.
[time=2194] Would you pray with me? I hope today has encouraged you to know that conflicts
[time=2201] are inevitable, but they're not invincible. And the best way to win a conflict is to love the other
[time=2209] person irresistibly. That's exactly what Christ has done for us. If you've never done that,
[time=2216] I'd like to lead you in a simple prayer. My words have no more weight than yours.
[time=2222] I'm just playing the role of a coach at this moment. Lord Jesus, I need a Savior. I need a healer. I need a forgiver. And I ask you to forgive me of my sins
[time=2238] and to take over my life. I confess that your Lord.
[time=2243] Let me close with the prayer of St. Francis. O divine master,
[time=2250] grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console, to be understood as to understand.
[time=2258] Not seek to be loved as much as to love. For it is in giving that we receive.
[time=2266] It is in pardoning that we are pardoned, and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Amen.
