[time=0] I would invite you if you would take your Bibles, please, and turn with me to Romans the 15th chapter of Romans, and I want to direct your attention to verse 13 in particular.
[time=15] Romans chapter 15 and verse 13 that reads as follows, "May the God of hope fill you
[time=21] with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the
[time=28] power of the Holy Spirit." Let us have a moment of prayer.
[time=35] Oh, God, our loving Heavenly Father, we thank you for the opportunities that you give to
[time=41] us to worship together, to fellowship together, and to come together for the study and the
[time=47] application of your word.
[time=48] And I pray today that the words of my mouth, as well as the meditation of our hearts, will
[time=55] be found to be acceptable in your sight, O Lord, our strength and our Redeemer, for
[time=61] the sake of Jesus Christ, in whose name we pray, amen.
[time=67] I want to speak to you this morning on the subject of the God of hope, and you can see that this title is taken from this verse.
[time=78] You are, to some extent, some of you are equated in a more deep way with the teaching of the
[time=87] New Testament pertaining to Christian character and Christian growth, and you know that the
[time=93] New Testament emphasizes a number of what we would call Christian virtues that are necessary
[time=100] for character and for growth.
[time=103] You might be thinking this morning for instance of gentleness, humility, patience, forbearance,
[time=110] mercy, and so on.
[time=111] There's a variety of Christian virtues that we are encouraged from the New Testament to
[time=118] incorporate into our lives contributing towards the growth of character and Christian discipleship.
[time=128] But I think most of us would agree this morning that of all of the virtues that are mentioned in the New Testament, there are three that are predominant, three that are in a class by themselves, three that stand out, and you, I'm sure, can identify those virtues that
[time=143] they are faith, love, and hope.
[time=148] They belong together, and they're found together quite often in the New Testament, but what is interesting is that it seems that hope is overshadowed by faith and love in many ways.
[time=163] For instance, if you look at the first four gospels in the New Testament, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, you'll find that the word hope, the noun, is not mentioned even once,
[time=174] it's lacking in those four gospels.
[time=176] I grant you that the verb is found there, but it's only used rarely.
[time=182] The word hope is not there, and it's not found in many other writings of the New Testament, but what is interesting is when we think of Paul, most of us think immediately, first of all, of faith, that he's the great expositor of justification by faith here in Romans in
[time=199] first Corinthians, in Galatians, in Philippians, and those four epistles, and that he is the author of that hymn on love in first Corinthians, chapter 13, a chapter, I'm sure that we're
[time=212] all familiar with in that wonderful song or that wonderful hymn of love, a British expositor
[time=218] of a bygone era by the name of Campbell Morgan summarized Paul's teaching in first Corinthians
[time=225] chapter 13 and said that Paul is showing us that love alone counts, love alone conquers
[time=235] and love alone continues.
[time=238] I'm sure there's some of you here today, and you're wedding ceremony, you probably had
[time=244] some verses taken from first Corinthians chapter 13 that you incorporated into your wedding
[time=251] ceremony.
[time=252] So, as I say, we think of faith associated with Paul, and we think of love associated with Paul, but do you know that there's no author in all of the New Testament that has more references to hope than Paul in his writings, and there's no book in the Old Testament
[time=269] that has more references to hope than Romans.
[time=274] There are 13 distinct references to hope in this epistle, and let me if I may just take
[time=280] you back a little distance in Romans as a preparation for verse 13 with regards to some
[time=286] of the passages that Paul deals with focusing on hope back in chapter 4 verse 18, Paul makes
[time=295] a statement with regards to Abraham that Abraham against hope, in hope, believed, believed
[time=303] God.
[time=305] That's an awkward statement, isn't it?
[time=307] It's hope in hope, believe that's what's called an oxymoron.
[time=311] It's like a contradictory statement on the surface, but as you re-examine it, you find
[time=318] that there are some essential truths there.
[time=320] For instance, some people are described, as you know, as having a living death.
[time=328] What in the world is a living death?
[time=330] Well, that's an oxymoron.
[time=332] That's just referring to people who are merely existing, but there's no sense of vitality
[time=339] in their lives.
[time=341] But oxymorons are used to startle us, or to get our attention, to realize that there is something significant, something profound that is being communicated.
[time=353] That reference in chapter 4 verse 18 is in regards to the fact that when Abraham was a hundred years of age and Sarah was 90 years of age and she was barren, God said to Abraham
[time=363] and Sarah, "I'm going to give you a son in your old age."
[time=370] And humanly speaking, it looked impossible against hope, against human hope.
[time=376] But in terms of divine hope, Abraham believed.
[time=381] And the reason he believed is given to us in verse 21 in that fourth chapter where we're told that Abraham was fully persuaded, fully persuaded that what God had promised, God
[time=391] was able to perform.
[time=393] And you find behind the promises of God you have the resources of God and that God's resources
[time=399] are inexhaustible and behind his resources you've got the faithfulness and the veracity
[time=405] of God who stands by his word.
[time=409] And then secondly, if you move forward to Romans 5, Paul says in verse 1, verse I think you're
[time=415] all familiar with, that being justified by faith, one of the results is we have peace
[time=421] with God.
[time=422] That's true of all of you today.
[time=424] We have peace with God because we've been justified by faith.
[time=427] But he also tells us another result in verse 2 and he says, "We rejoice in hope of a glory
[time=435] of God." You rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.
[time=440] Because of our justification, we are destined for glory and that's our hope.
[time=447] That's our hope.
[time=448] We are thankful for what's included in our salvation, justification, redemption, reconciliation.
[time=457] But listen my friends, our salvation as yet has not been consummated.
[time=463] God has destined us for glory based on his promise and in that context of Romans 5,
[time=471] you find in verse 5 that Paul says, "Our hope will not disappoint us."
[time=477] We're not going to be left high and dry.
[time=479] This is not a pipe dream because this is God's promise to us.
[time=484] Then in chapter 8, verses 24 and 25, you've got a very, very interesting description of
[time=490] how hope operates.
[time=494] In that context, Paul says that hope that is seen is not hope.
[time=502] Why does anyone hope for what is seen?
[time=506] Why does anyone hope for what they already have?
[time=508] But if we hope for that which is unseen, then with patience, we wait for it.
[time=515] Now those passages are all leading up towards this 13th verse in chapter 15, and I want
[time=526] you to notice the text that's before us here this morning.
[time=529] Look at it carefully with me if you will.
[time=531] Notice at the very beginning, there's a reference to God.
[time=534] Notice at the end, there's a reference to the Holy Spirit.
[time=536] So there's a reference to the first person of the Trinity and the reference to the third person of the Trinity.
[time=542] Then when you look internally in the text itself, you'll find that Paul employs four
[time=548] significant terms or concepts that are used fairly frequently in the New Testament pertaining
[time=555] to the Christian life.
[time=556] You've got a reference to hope.
[time=558] You've got a reference to joy, a reference to peace, and a reference to power.
[time=565] But then in addition to that, in the text itself, describing the Christian life, Paul has three verbs that are favorite verses, verbs for him to use.
[time=575] You've got the verb to fill.
[time=577] You've got the verb to believe, and you've got the verb to abound.
[time=583] So consider with me this morning, if you will, the outline for the message.
[time=588] First of all, we're going to be looking at the prayer of Paul, secondly at the purpose
[time=594] of God, and then thirdly at the power of the Holy Spirit.
[time=598] Here's the prayer, secondly at the purpose, and then thirdly at the power.
[time=604] The prayer of Paul.
[time=605] Notice that this verse is in the form of a prayer, and it's a prayer that's addressed
[time=611] to the God of hope, and you're familiar enough with the Bible to know that God has many names
[time=619] by which he describes himself, by which he reveals himself, his nature, his character,
[time=626] his attributes.
[time=628] They're revelatory, that is, they're a revelation of God, and I don't doubt for one moment.
[time=636] Now whatever your situation may be this morning, that there is some name, some title, some
[time=643] designation that God employs to describe himself that is appropriate to you or relevant to you this very day, and sometimes God reveals himself as the God of love.
[time=657] Or as the God of grace or the God of mercy, sometimes the God of wisdom, sometimes the
[time=663] God of power, sometimes the God of holiness.
[time=667] Notice right here in this chapter, there are three names given to God in verse 5, depending
[time=673] on what translation you're using, there's a reference to the God of encouragement.
[time=677] Well that's encouraging, isn't it?
[time=680] Notice the very end of the chapter, verse 33, there's a reference to the God of peace, and now the verse we're looking at, verse 13, the God of hope.
[time=692] In all of the Bible, Old Testament, New Testament, this is the only time, the only time that
[time=698] you have this title, the God of hope.
[time=702] It's only used one time in Scripture, Romans chapter 15, verse 13, why does God call himself
[time=708] the God of hope?
[time=711] He calls himself the God of hope because he's the author of hope, he's the source of hope, he's the giver of hope, he's the provider of hope, he's the God who delights to inspire hope in his people, and he's the God who renews our hope, especially when we are discouraged
[time=730] or when we're overcome with the heavy burdens of life.
[time=736] I think it's important for us this morning to realize that there's a difference in the
[time=742] way that we use the word hope in everyday language or in everyday conversation and the
[time=748] way that the Bible uses the word hope.
[time=751] For instance, you might say if you have a friend who has a serious sickness and you're visiting
[time=757] him or her, you might say I hope that you get well soon, you know, you can see that but
[time=766] there's no guarantee is there, or you might have some travel plans, and you might say I hope someday to visit Switzerland, one of the most beautiful countries in all the world,
[time=777] or I hope someday that I can visit Bermuda, one of the most beautiful islands in the world,
[time=783] you may not have the time, or you may not have the resources, or you may not have the
[time=789] health to travel overseas, it could be that maybe you're saying that as a family you've
[time=795] got a wedding that's planned for August, and it's an outdoor wedding, and it's going
[time=801] to be an outdoor ceremony, an outdoor celebration, and you're hoping it will not rain.
[time=808] Well I hope your hope comes to pass, but my friend says no guarantee is there, there's no guarantee, but when you turn to the Bible and you look at how the word hope is huge,
[time=818] you always find it's associated with assurance, with certainty, and with confidence.
[time=828] Paul for instance in Philippians chapter 1 verse 6 says being confident of this very thing that he who has begun a good work in you will complete it at the day of Christ's
[time=841] return.
[time=842] In other words, Paul is saying listen, when God is commenced in your life, God will continue
[time=848] that work, and when God commences and when God continues he will complete at the day
[time=855] of Jesus Christ, and so Hebrews chapter 11 verse 6 reminds us that faith is the assurance
[time=862] of things hoped for.
[time=866] It could be that today you're with us and it could be that your hope is diminishing as
[time=874] time goes on, you know, that the word that stands out that you hear so often these days
[time=881] about the situations in life and so forth, the negative situations that are somewhat alarming
[time=890] and disturbing is the word uncertainty or the word unpredictability.
[time=897] Like if I were to ask you, where were you on the evening of December the 31st, 2019?
[time=909] New Year's Eve.
[time=910] What were you thinking about?
[time=913] Could you make any predictions?
[time=914] Did any of us at that particular point, did any of us have any inkling that in a couple
[time=920] of months' time in 2020 there would be COVID-19 with its devastating effects in this country
[time=928] and other countries of the world?
[time=930] Yes, we're living with uncertainty and unpredictability and it's causing unrestfulness for numerous
[time=938] people and they're finding themselves disillusioned and that may be you today, and if that is
[time=944] the case you might be saying to us that, you know, the sky has cast a dark shadow of your
[time=951] life and you look up and there are no stars left in your sky and your mind is baffled
[time=958] with unanswered questions and your mind is not at rest and you're on the verge of crying
[time=964] out with a psalmist and Psalm 11 and saying, "When the foundations are destroyed and they
[time=972] are being destroyed, aren't they today?" You know, the foundations of society are eroding and they're crumbling and you cry out and say, "What will the righteous do?" Maybe that's your sentiment today and Paul would say to you, "Listen, turn to God.
[time=992] Turn to the God of hope.
[time=994] And realize that your God is the authorful, the source of hope."
[time=1001] It's Warren Wardsby who tells us that for the Christian, for the believer, you know,
[time=1008] the future is our friend, the future is our friend, the best is yet to come.
[time=1015] Faith teaches us to look upward, love teaches us to look outward, but hope teaches us to
[time=1022] look forward and we hear a voice of God speaking through Jeremiah the prophet in Jeremiah chapter
[time=1029] 29 verse 11 when he says, "I know the thoughts that I have for you, thoughts to help you
[time=1036] and not hurt you, to give you a future and to give you a hope." It's wonderful, isn't it, to think that God's thoughts are always preceding us, that God's
[time=1047] thoughts are always in advance of us and God's plans are to give you a hope and to give you
[time=1057] a future.
[time=1059] Then secondly, notice with me here the purpose of God, the purpose of God in this prayer.
[time=1067] Paul was praying that the God of hope will give to us all joy and peace in believing
[time=1074] that we may abound in hope.
[time=1078] First of all, he speaks about joy and with regard to joy, will you consider with me to begin with the source of joy and then secondly, the power of joy, the source of joy?
[time=1090] I want to tell you, concisely, Jesus is our joy.
[time=1098] That's the source of our joy.
[time=1099] Paul says in Philippians chapter 4 verse 4, "Rejoice in the Lord always and again I say
[time=1106] rejoice." When you look at that text and you reflect upon it, there's something that stands out, two things that stand out that get your attention.
[time=1115] The first thing is, it's an imperative, it's a command.
[time=1120] Now, most of us are familiar with the fact that the Bible commands love, but very few
[time=1127] of us are familiar with the fact that the Bible commands joy, commands joy.
[time=1134] So that sort of startles us.
[time=1137] But secondly, if you look at the text, Paul says, "Rejoice in the Lord always."
[time=1143] That's the word, you know, that troubles some of us.
[time=1146] We could say, "Well, I can rejoice in the Lord some of the time," or maybe most of the time, but boy, that's pretty difficult to rejoice in the Lord.
[time=1157] The Lord always, well, I want to tell you something, when Paul wrote, and you know,
[time=1163] you've been hearing about this the last few weeks here in the ministry of the church about Philippians, you know that Paul was in prison, and he wasn't in prison for two days, or for
[time=1174] two weeks, or for two months, but he was in prison for two years.
[time=1182] And any man who can say to me, "Rejoice always," and he's been in prison for two years, he gets
[time=1189] my attention, gets my time willing to listen to him.
[time=1194] Now, how can Paul say, "Rejoice in the Lord always?" And lest I be misunderstood, again, I repeat myself, rejoice, well, it's because of what
[time=1206] he says in verse 12, in that context, Paul says, "I have learned the secret, I've learned
[time=1215] the secret." Well, have you learned the secret?
[time=1219] Have I learned the secret?
[time=1221] You might say, "Well, what is the secret?" Well, the secret is given to us in the 13th verse, when Paul says that Jesus Christ is
[time=1229] the one who continually strengthens me, in other words, he is saying, "I have discovered
[time=1236] that Jesus is not only my Savior, wonderful as that is, but he is my strengthener, he's
[time=1242] the one who strengthens me, he's the one who sustains me, he's my sufficiency so that I can cope with whatever life throws at me, all of the vicissitudes and the contingencies,
[time=1253] the good times, the bad times, the glad times, the sad times, the times of plenty, the times
[time=1261] of me, I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." And that's the basis for why he can say, "Rejoice in the Lord always." Now, secondly, with regard to joy, not only the source of joy, but the power of joy.
[time=1277] We don't normally associate power and joy together, do we?
[time=1282] But listen to what it says in Proverbs chapter 15, verse 22, that "A joyful heart is good
[time=1293] medicine." It's good medicine.
[time=1295] A joyful heart has healing properties.
[time=1298] A joyful heart can change a person's attitude, their disposition can change their perspective,
[time=1309] it can change their countenance and it can give to them a new spark in life, a new sense
[time=1315] of energy.
[time=1317] That's the power of joy.
[time=1319] Nehemiah chapter 8, verse 10, Nehemiah says, "That the joy of the Lord is your strength."
[time=1329] I've looked at that verse many, many times and I've said to myself, sort of in a conversation
[time=1335] with Nehemiah, "Are you sure, Nehemiah, you've got that right?
[time=1339] Shouldn't it be the other way around?
[time=1341] Shouldn't you have written the strength of the Lord?
[time=1346] Is your joy?" Nehemiah says, "No, no, no, no.
[time=1349] I've got it right.
[time=1351] It's the joy of the Lord that is your strength.
[time=1353] It's the joy of the Lord that gives you that impetus, that energy you need for life, for
[time=1361] the fulfilling of God's will." And then in 2 Corinthians chapter 6, verse 10, a remarkable statement that comes from the pen of Paul out of his experiences of suffering and tribulation and affliction,
[time=1376] he says, "Surfful, yet always rejoicing."
[time=1383] It's amazing, isn't it?
[time=1384] It's an amazing statement.
[time=1385] You know, that's what Christianity can do for you.
[time=1390] Christianity can teach us that we can have those two emotions simultaneously and they don't cancel out each other.
[time=1396] You can be sorrowful and joyful at the same time and the joy that we have in Christ is
[time=1405] powerful enough that sorrow doesn't cancel it out.
[time=1408] But I know some of you know that from experience, going through sorrowful experiences and yet
[time=1415] having the joy of the Lord never the less.
[time=1421] And then in the second place, after joy we have peace, made it a God of hope fill you
[time=1428] with joy and peace.
[time=1431] I want you to realize with me that, just as I said a few moments ago, Jesus is our joy.
[time=1439] So I'm going to say to you, Jesus is our peace, he's the person of peace, he's the embodiment
[time=1447] of peace.
[time=1448] Ephesians 2, 14, doesn't just say, "Jesus is our peace," but it says, "Jesus himself
[time=1455] but only Jesus and no one else is our peace."
[time=1461] You remember at the time of the cross all the disciples, all they fled from the Lord, they scattered out of fear, they ran away and they didn't stay in there to the end.
[time=1474] And then on Resurrection Sunday they were gathered together in a room in Jerusalem and they were overcome with fear and consternation and they were saying to themselves, "What in the world is the resurrection Jesus?" What is Jesus going to say to us?
[time=1488] We have disappointed him.
[time=1490] He was counting on us, but we weren't there when he needed us most.
[time=1496] And when Jesus appeared before those troubled disciples, his first words were, his first words were, "Peace beyond to you, peace beyond you."
[time=1508] The peace of pardon, the peace of assurance, the peace of security.
[time=1515] Jesus is our peace, the person of peace.
[time=1518] But secondly, he's also the preacher of peace.
[time=1522] That's found in the same context.
[time=1523] If you look at Ephesians chapter 2, just three verses later, verse 17, Ephesians chapter
[time=1529] 1, verse 17, Paul tells us that when Jesus left heaven and came to this earth, he came
[time=1538] with a mission.
[time=1540] He was a preacher.
[time=1541] He loved to preach.
[time=1542] He had lied into preaching and he preached peace to those who were near and to those who
[time=1549] were far off.
[time=1550] Who are the ones who are near?
[time=1551] That's the Jews.
[time=1552] Who are those who are far off?
[time=1554] That's the Gentiles.
[time=1555] Jesus came with the same message for both Jew and Gentile, the message of peace and reconciliation,
[time=1562] to form together one new body and one new family.
[time=1568] He's the preacher of peace.
[time=1570] He's also, thirdly, the prince of peace.
[time=1573] You're all familiar with this.
[time=1575] We hear this quite often during the Christmas season from Isaiah the prophet 700 years before
[time=1581] Jesus was born, Isaiah said that unto us a child will be born, unto us a son will be
[time=1588] given and his name will be called the prince of peace.
[time=1594] He's the prince of peace.
[time=1596] Prince means he's a king.
[time=1598] Prince means he's a governor.
[time=1599] Prince means he's an administrator and because he's a king, because he's a prince, he has a kingdom and you're part of that kingdom today because of your new birth.
[time=1610] He says in the context that the kingdom of Jesus rests upon his shoulders.
[time=1620] He's got big enough shoulders, broad enough shoulders, that he himself can administer his
[time=1626] kingdom.
[time=1627] It's a kingdom of everlasting peace.
[time=1632] Even in the fourth place, Jesus is the provider of peace, the provider of peace.
[time=1642] It's Matthew Henry who points out to us that at the cross, Jesus committed himself to
[time=1648] his father.
[time=1650] He committed his mother to the apostle John, to his loving and compassionate care to take
[time=1656] care of Mary.
[time=1658] He committed his clothes to the Roman soldiers.
[time=1661] He committed his body to Joseph of Armathea.
[time=1665] What did he do for his disciples?
[time=1667] In terms of his legacy, just the night before, Thursday evening, in the Upper Room, in Jerusalem,
[time=1673] John 14, verse 27, Jesus said to the disciples, "Peace I leave with you.
[time=1680] My peace I give unto you, not as the world gives, give I unto you, let not your hearts
[time=1686] be troubled, neither let them be afraid." The peace that this world, indeed the world, speaks about peace.
[time=1694] But the peace that the world gives us is a surface peace, it's a superficial peace, it's a temporal peace, it's a fragile peace.
[time=1703] I don't know if you've ever studied the First World War in any detail, if you go back
[time=1710] on your studied modern European history.
[time=1714] But in that First World War, it is absolutely shocking if you realize how many nations
[time=1721] were involved in that war.
[time=1724] It's amazing.
[time=1726] And so the First War and the whole span of history that was called a world war, historians
[time=1734] also call it the Great War because there's so many nations.
[time=1738] But when that war was concluded, there was a peace treaty.
[time=1742] It was the Treaty of Versailles, in the city of Versailles, just south and west of Paris.
[time=1748] And I was supposed to end all wars, but that treaty did not have the internal mechanism
[time=1755] to maintain peace, and tragically, that peace treaty wasn't the only cause, I'm not saying
[time=1763] that.
[time=1764] But historians will verify this, that it was one of the causes among others to bring about
[time=1770] a second world war.
[time=1772] It just collapsed.
[time=1773] It was fragile.
[time=1774] It was surface.
[time=1776] But Jesus says, I give peace, not as the world gives.
[time=1779] The peace that Jesus gives is a deep, it's an abiding, it's an enriching, and it's an
[time=1786] eternal peace.
[time=1790] As Paul moves on in this text, he says, "May the God of hope give you joy and peace through
[time=1798] believing, through trusting." So you might be saying, how does this become something that I can realize in my own life,
[time=1806] this hope?
[time=1807] Because it's hope that produces the joy, and it's hope that produces the peace.
[time=1812] But how can I become aware of what this hope contains?
[time=1818] And Paul says, it's through the exercise of your faith, through a growing faith, a developing faith.
[time=1824] And faith, if it's a valid faith, must always have the right object.
[time=1830] And Paul in Colossians 1 verse 27 says, that Jesus Christ is the hope of our glory.
[time=1838] We don't have faith in faith, but we have faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=1844] What is the difference between faith and hope?
[time=1850] Faith and hope, someone who said that faith is that which accepts, accepts the Word of
[time=1856] God, accepts the promises of God, hope is that which expects.
[time=1862] Faith is that which appropriates, and hope is that which anticipates.
[time=1869] Faith is the mother of hope, and hope is the child of faith.
[time=1875] They can be distinguished, but they are inseparable.
[time=1879] And then Paul says, it's through this faith that you not only come to a deeper realization of the hope we have in Christ, but that enables you to notice now in the text, it says, to
[time=1891] a bound in hope.
[time=1894] Well, that's another favorite word that Paul uses in his writings about the Christian life.
[time=1900] I wonder how many of us are bounding, how many of us are excelling.
[time=1904] We can talk about a bounding in knowledge, a bounding in faith, a bounding in love, a
[time=1910] bounding in diligence, a bounding in good works, and now he says a bounding in hope.
[time=1917] If you take this whole idea of hope and then consider it, I think you can come to a conclusion
[time=1927] that there are three broad categories or classifications of people in regards to hope.
[time=1934] The first category are people that you could describe as that they are without hope.
[time=1942] Comes from Ephesians chapter 2, verse 12, doesn't it when Paul said in his day and age
[time=1948] that there were those who were without God and they were without hope.
[time=1954] Not only true in Paul's day and age but also in ours, people who have a vacuum in their lives and emptiness in their, avoid, there's meaningless, there's no sense of purpose
[time=1965] and no sense of direction and they are in a state of confusion, state of doubt.
[time=1972] Secondly, there are people in a whole history of humanity, it's not that they're without
[time=1979] hope but it's that they have a false hope, a false hope.
[time=1985] You know, some people say, "Well, whatever the emergency may be, whatever the contingency may be, I've got my resources or I've got my family, my friends."
[time=1996] But that doesn't always work out, does it?
[time=1999] Sometimes you put your hope in those resources and find that they're crumbling or there are some people who have a false hope in regards to religion and they're on what's called
[time=2009] the religious treadmill and they're huffing and they're puffing and they're trying to
[time=2015] earn merit with God through self-righteousness but it all ends up with futility, all ends
[time=2023] up with futility, false hope.
[time=2026] But thankfully, thankfully there's a third category and I trust you're in that category today.
[time=2032] There are those who have a biblical hope.
[time=2036] That's what's most important is a biblical hope and that's described two ways in the New Testament.
[time=2041] In first Peter chapter one verse three, Peter says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our
[time=2047] Lord Jesus Christ who by his great mercy says, 'cause there's a big born again and has given to us a living hope based on the resurrection of Jesus Christ." What is a living hope?
[time=2057] A living hope is a durable hope, eregarders of what the circumstances may be.
[time=2063] A durable hope, it's living, nothing can extinguish it in your life, in my life.
[time=2070] Secondly, Titus 2, 13 tells us that we have a blessed hope, a blessed hope.
[time=2076] What is that blessed hope?
[time=2077] Looking for the blessed hope Paul says, "For the glorious appearing and the coming of our
[time=2084] Lord Jesus Christ," that's the second advent, the second coming of Christ.
[time=2089] That is the center, that's the focus of our hope that we have today.
[time=2093] You know what Jesus said to his disciples, "Didn't He?
[time=2096] I will come again and receive you to myself."
[time=2102] And in the very last chapter of the Bible, three times, three times for emphasis Jesus says, "I'm coming again, I'm coming again, I'm coming again," and when He comes, He's
[time=2115] going to come personally. He's not going to send a deputy as a substitute. Not going to send an
[time=2122] ambassador. He's coming personally. He's coming visibly. He's coming gloriously. He's coming triumphantly. And we will see him as we've never seen him before. Today we see him with the eyes of
[time=2132] faith. But we're going to see him, my friends, in his beauty, in his majesty, in his sovereignty,
[time=2140] in his supremacy, in his deity, in his glorified humanity. And that gaze that we have has a
[time=2148] transforming effect because associated with the second advent as a part of our hope is the
[time=2154] resurrection of the body of believers, resurrection of your body, resurrection of my body. I look at
[time=2160] my body. I'm sure that some of you do too. And I see that my body is progressively getting weaker,
[time=2167] more subject to weariness. My body is subject as your body is too to sickness,
[time=2174] to see, decay, this integration, ultimately to death. But Philippians chapter 3 verses
[time=2182] 20 and 21, Paul says, "Our citizenship as Christians is in heaven." What does he mean by that?
[time=2192] Oh, he means by that is really our homeland is heaven itself. And it's from heaven
[time=2199] that Jesus is coming again. And when he comes by his unlimited power, he's going to change
[time=2207] our bodies, our lowly bodies, our weak bodies, so that they will become transformed into a body
[time=2217] like the glorified body of Jesus Christ. In terms of his resurrection body and the body he had before
[time=2224] his resurrection, there's continuity and there's discontinuity. And after his resurrection,
[time=2230] he came to his disciples and he says, "Listen, it is I. He could identify him. He had a human body,
[time=2239] a real human body of flesh and blood. And with that body, with the disciples, he walked with them,
[time=2247] he talked with them, he ate with them, he showed them the rooms in his hands and said, "Touch me." And my friends, the body you're going to receive, the body I'm going to receive,
[time=2258] will be a real body, flesh and blood. It will be a corporal body, a body that no longer
[time=2269] is susceptible to the debilitating and corrupting influences of sin. And that's part of the hope
[time=2278] that we have in Christ. Thirdly and finally in the text, we come to the power of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2285] And you might be saying to me this morning, "How in the world is all of this possible?"
[time=2293] Everything you've been talking about and explaining and expounding in verse that,
[time=2299] "How does this become practical? How can I realize this? How does this become relevant in my life?"
[time=2305] Well Paul answers that question and at the end of the text he says it is through the power of the Holy Spirit. It's good for us every once in a while to remind ourselves of the
[time=2317] person of the Holy Spirit and what the Holy Spirit has done in each of our lives as Christians. You
[time=2324] know, equally all of us, without exception, we're sharing the fact that we've been called
[time=2330] efficaciously by the Spirit of God. We've been regenerated by the Spirit and dwell with the Spirit
[time=2338] and we're sealed with the Spirit. And the Spirit, the Holy Spirit, has numerous ministries by which
[time=2347] He works in your life, works in my life. He is our great illuminator, our teacher, our guide. He's
[time=2354] the one who sanctifies us, strengthens us. He's the one who comforts us. He's the one who renews us and he's the one who gives to us reassurance. But relevant to our discussion today in this context,
[time=2368] there's the Holy Spirit who is God's pledge to you and to me in Ephesians 1 and 14. Paul says,
[time=2376] "The indwelling Spirit is God's pledge. It's God's assurance that the inheritance that God has given to you and to all of us, as believers,
[time=2388] a promise inheritance will come to pass and it's not pie in the sky, religion. It's an inheritance
[time=2397] that we'll enter into and enjoy fully, that the fruits of that inheritance," which Peter described
[time=2407] as you know in 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 4, "as an inheritance that can never be destroyed, it doesn't decay, it will never fade away because it's reserved in heaven,
[time=2419] reserved in heaven for us, heaven, that place where there's no conflict, that place where there's
[time=2425] no tension, that place where there's no injustice, that place where there's no fear,
[time=2431] where there's no sickness, where there's no sorrow, and there's no death, where there's unperturbed peace and uninterrupted joy." I want to say to you in conclusion this morning,
[time=2444] my friends, that God has the final word. He's the God of hope and he has the final word,
[time=2452] not the devil, not the demons, not evil, and not death. But the God of hope is the God who can
[time=2461] bring life out of death and he can bring light out of darkness, joy out of sorrow, healing
[time=2470] out of brokenness, and he can bring hope out of despair, shall we pray.
[time=2482] O God, our loving Heavenly Father, we acknowledge that you are indeed the God of all grace,
[time=2491] you're the God of all comfort, and truly you are the God of hope. And we thank you that you have
[time=2498] established this hope for us on the basis of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[time=2504] And we pray today if there's anyone with us in this assembly, in this congregation who does not
[time=2510] know Christ and they're without hope that they might be led by the Spirit, quickened by the Spirit,
[time=2517] illuminated by the Spirit to realize that in Christ is found new life, new joy, and new peace. And we
[time=2526] pray for others in this congregation who today might have heavy hearts that they're crushed by
[time=2533] disappointing circumstances in life. We pray that you administer to them and not only renew their
[time=2541] strength but rekindle their hope and that they, together with all of us, through faith this day
[time=2548] would come to that place like Abraham where we are fully persuaded, fully persuaded in our hearts
[time=2556] that what God has promised God is able to perform. And may Jesus Christ in whose name we pray be
[time=2565] glorified. Amen.
