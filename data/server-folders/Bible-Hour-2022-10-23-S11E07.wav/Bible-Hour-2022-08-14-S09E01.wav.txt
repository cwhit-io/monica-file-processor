[time=0] I had the privilege of serving here as the go team pastor, which is for missions.
[time=7] And Kevin Rivers talked about the go team back in May and just going, and then he went.
[time=15] I mean, but yeah.
[time=17] But how important go is, and then I'm also head of school here at Black Hawk.
[time=22] So they gave me the mic, so I'm gonna talk about both things, you know, 'cause they're really important.
[time=27] But it's really about being on mission here in Black Hawk.
[time=30] I do have to say, you guys promise not to tell Rick Hawks, but I had to adjust the music stand up a half an inch for me to use it.
[time=40] I've never had to adjust anything up.
[time=42] It's always brought way down.
[time=44] But I kind of feel like I'm tall, you know.
[time=47] You know, speaking of Rick Hawks, he made the comment last week on, he came from a very reserved church, you know, where people would just give a nod.
[time=61] That's about as excited as they got is, they'd acknowledge you and just give you a nod.
[time=66] Okay, and so I couldn't help it when he said that, because one of my favorite comedians is a Christian comedian, Tim Hawkins.
[time=74] And he's just so funny, and he makes fun of everybody, so bear with me.
[time=81] I want to preface that I've worked over 40 years with children.
[time=85] So that allows me to almost do anything, right?
[time=88] So he kind of talks about different ways people worship.
[time=94] Nothing's wrong, but you've got the arm shake people, you know, they're just not gonna pull the hands out of the pocket.
[time=102] You know, you've got the hold the TV, right?
[time=106] Hold the big screen, catch the fish.
[time=110] Fish got bigger, right?
[time=113] We've got victory, we've got gold posts, we've got touchdown, we've got, you know, tap the ceiling, wash the window.
[time=121] And my favorite, Mufasa, right?
[time=126] But, you know, you laugh at that, but it's so true.
[time=130] God accepts any form of worship.
[time=133] He just wants us to come and come to his feet.
[time=138] And, you know, I've been sharing with church staff just lately too, that we can't be doing stuff and be a Martha until we're a Mary.
[time=151] And if we're not seeing that the Lord's feet and getting fed, all that other stuff is meaningless.
[time=158] We have to come and worship the Lord.
[time=161] And I'm so thankful for Chip coming and leading today, missed him and just bringing that energy.
[time=168] And for the girls, you know, to share, it's so important that parents see, you know, kids walk on the coattails of their parents and sometimes grandparents.
[time=181] And when you see them hop off and begin their own journey, their own walk.
[time=186] And there's no formula, there's no timing.
[time=189] It's all a God thing and I'm so glad.
[time=192] We just have to be obedient and invest.
[time=195] And I'm gonna talk about a lot of that today is just the investment on being on mission 'cause Black Hawk is so on mission.
[time=203] Both externally with missions beyond our borders, outside our building and then internally what we do with the people that call Black Hawk their home.
[time=215] And so let's go to the Lord.
[time=217] Father, we just thank you so much, Lord, for the opportunity to gather here this morning.
[time=224] You know, in August, first week of school and we're excited for that, Lord, which always represents new beginnings and just new things that you desire to do.
[time=236] And so Lord, we ask that you go before us in our time together here this morning.
[time=241] We ask in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=244] So here at Black Hawk, when I was looking to come to Black Hawk and go in through a rigorous hiring process, that our PDT is diligently doing under coach there,
[time=261] (chuckles) and so I was so struck by the mission DNA that was here.
[time=268] And it still blows me away on how much we support,
[time=278] we send and we go and we're really about it.
[time=282] And it's in for Wayne, it's throughout this country and it's throughout the world.
[time=289] And that's humbling.
[time=290] So don't quit.
[time=295] Stay on mission.
[time=299] We have a cheat sheet that you can get at the go table if you're interested that has, we have 60 plus missionary partners.
[time=307] And we even have missionaries that have retired that we still support in some capacity.
[time=313] But there's a lot of local ministries that you could be part of just volunteering.
[time=318] We obviously raise things for those partners.
[time=322] And then of course there's missionaries here in the United States and throughout the world.
[time=327] And we happen to have some with us today from Uganda.
[time=332] So I want the Mitchells to come up and Caleb and Alair and their son off the look up with an N, right?
[time=341] They're all with N.
[time=342] So I've seen Nancy in there right there.
[time=344] She's never known, he'll tell me this 'cause he's gonna speak.
[time=349] And they are doing a great work in Uganda.
[time=353] Kimberly White, we just sent there, as you know, and she works with them, same organization.
[time=360] And there's just a lot of neat things going on in that country.
[time=363] And then how they're impacting countries around them in central Africa.
[time=369] So you got the mic, buddy.
[time=372] - Hello, my name is Nate Mitchell.
[time=375] I am a MK, a missionary kid.
[time=379] To Uganda, Stafrica.
[time=381] This is my dad, Caleb, my mom, Alair.
[time=386] My sister, my older brother, Nico, is in DS3.
[time=390] And my two younger sisters are in Sunday school.
[time=394] And one thing I love about being a missionary is being able to meet new people from all over the world.
[time=403] I just think that's really cool.
[time=405] - So this morning, Nate, you were coming up to share.
[time=409] And he said, "Dad, can I come up to share?" I said, "I had no idea what he's gonna say." Thank you for not sharing any family secrets.
[time=416] (audience laughs) But it was an opportunity I didn't wanna say no to.
[time=419] Anytime my child would wanna get up and talk to everybody on their own free will, I said, "Let's go for it." So thank you, Nate.
[time=426] (audience applauds) And real quick with that, he said missionary kid, but he actually, we turned around, he's a kid missionary.
[time=436] He's not just a missionary, he's a kid.
[time=438] And I can't tell you the amount of opportunities we've had to share with other people what we're doing in Uganda and the gospel, because of our kids, our neighbors.
[time=448] You know, our neighbors aren't asking us to come over, but when they have kids and we have kids, they get the invite.
[time=454] So, and there's a lot of stories about that.
[time=456] We don't have time for this morning, but it's really cool to see him up here and sharing.
[time=461] So I wanna say thank you.
[time=464] As Block Hark, as partnering with us, we were sent out from this church in 2008.
[time=470] And I can't tell you how many people, just in the last two weeks and this morning, have come up and said, "Have you been praying for you?" And I can't say how much of encouragement that is, not only that, and then financially as well.
[time=482] It's a huge encouragement to be part of this body and to be sent out by you all.
[time=486] I wanna share two quick highlights of some things that happened in Uganda this last year.
[time=492] Number one, one of our main focuses is pastors training or church strengthening.
[time=497] And just this last year, we were able to graduate 40 pastors from our program.
[time=502] And if you know anything about Africa, or even in Uganda in particular, most pastors serving in Uganda are not getting paid.
[time=510] It's a bi-vocation job.
[time=513] And most of them have no training whatsoever.
[time=515] They get their training from turning on the radio and listening to a pastor, and that's not the best place necessarily to get your theology.
[time=523] So we come in and we do the three month program with these pastors and we train them, and they go back to the congregations and then train their people.
[time=532] It's the second Timothy 2-2, trained faithful men so they can go and also train others.
[time=537] Second, and I think this is probably one of the things I'm most excited about, is we have a partnership in Northern Uganda with an organization called Reaching Africa's Unreached.
[time=547] And there's one people group in Uganda that's still considered unreached.
[time=551] They're 98% Muslim.
[time=553] And just this last year, we became in partnership with this organization.
[time=557] And by God's grace, we have two new families joining our team and they're going to be going to Northern Uganda and serving in that area.
[time=564] And so we'll be taking teams there and doing outreaches.
[time=567] And so we're very excited about being able to be part of Reaching Africa's Unreach.
[time=572] There's going to share a little bit about how you could be praying for us these next few months and maybe what God's going to be doing there.
[time=578] (audience applauds) - I can't stand up here without saying thank you as well because this really is home to us.
[time=588] We celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary this summer.
[time=592] You guys can clap for that here.
[time=594] (audience applauds) I think it's a big joke.
[time=595] But it got us thinking, we've been here at Black Hawk and called this place home for almost 20 years now.
[time=603] And so we're excited to be here.
[time=606] And we have been nurtured by this place.
[time=609] And so pastoral ministry, although it sounds something here, it's really close to our hearts because we want churches to do what we see this place doing.
[time=619] We want to see churches in Uganda strengthen their people in their churches to go and make disciples.
[time=627] And that's what we see happening here.
[time=630] That's what has happened with us.
[time=632] That's what's happening with our kids.
[time=634] And we want to see that happen in the churches that we work with in Uganda as well.
[time=639] So you can be praying for us that God would continue to equip us to lead our team.
[time=644] We talked about Kimberly is part of our team, Kimberly White and her son.
[time=648] We also have 11 others with these new families that are going to be joining us.
[time=653] And we'll have 11 other missionaries in Uganda and one of Caleb's responsibilities is to lead that team.
[time=659] So we're praying for God to continue working to equip us in that way.
[time=663] And also as we look forward to this next time, few years of being in Uganda, we're being prayerful about a community center.
[time=672] And so we would love it if you would pray with us about a platform for churches to ministry or to do ministry as well as places that majority Muslim based community where we live, people could come into those doors and receive training, a multitude of different types of training from people who have the gospel readily on their lips.
[time=697] And so that's our heart and our desire for this next moving forward stage to Uganda when we go back.
[time=705] We thank you again and we'd love to chat with you later if you wanna see us after church, if you wanna hear more.
[time=711] - And before you go, let's pray for the Mitchells right now.
[time=716] Father, we just thank you so much for the Mitchells and their faithfulness, Lord, to go to the uttermost parts of the world.
[time=724] And to country, they don't know the language, they don't know so many different things, Lord, but you show up and you're faithful.
[time=736] God, give them rest while here in the States, help them just continue to communicate their mission and being in the mission field and what that looks like, help them to continue to raise support and just Lord continue to get prayer partners.
[time=752] And we just ask you, send the people that you want to come alongside them in the upcoming months and years.
[time=759] We ask these things in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=761] Yeah, good job.
[time=765] (audience applauds) And one other mission comment is coming up
[time=775] in a couple of weeks, we're gonna commission the Egypt team and we have 39 people going, so about 40 less one, right?
[time=788] That's like lashings, that's what it is, but our trip's not like lashings.
[time=797] Even though 11 junior hires are going on the trip, which is a great thing.
[time=803] I'm so excited for that that Cheryl Pover and DS3, we've got some students going and it's gonna be impactful.
[time=811] They're gonna be able to reach out to Sudanese refugees in Cairo.
[time=816] They're gonna be reaching out to the poor throughout the country.
[time=819] They're gonna be doing outreaches in her gada, coming alongside churches in many ways as will the adults.
[time=825] So we'll be talking more about that.
[time=827] If you want to get on the mission prayer signup, it's on this form as well.
[time=832] Just encourage you to check that out.
[time=836] So that's kind of externally, so many different mission things going outside our walls, but I really want to focus the remainder of the time internally where we are being on mission.
[time=847] And it starts right away with preschool, our nursery here, Sunday school, DS3 with Cheryl,
[time=856] the movement with wheeze, we got young adults,
[time=862] we got adult ministries going on here, and of course we have church service.
[time=866] All those things are really important and they're all about discipleship.
[time=871] The biggest ministry here at Blackhawk is one I'm directly connected with is the school and we're blessed to have almost 1,100 students this year at Blackhawk.
[time=885] I'm not here to sell anybody on it 'cause we have waiting lists in almost every grade, which is a good problem to have, but God is definitely guiding us to be intentional on being a discipleship school and how important that is.
[time=902] And this year, we are celebrating our 50th school year.
[time=905] So that's our birthday, right?
[time=907] Whoo, and yeah.
[time=909] (audience applauding) I'm excited to, we got two new playgrounds, we got two new bigger buses, we got two chaplains here now that are really gonna be intentional spiritually.
[time=922] We have two football teams this year, I know, Blackhawk's got football.
[time=928] Took 50 years, but it's here.
[time=931] I don't even get any claps, come on.
[time=933] I know it's a Hoosier state, (audience applauding) but this year for our 50th birthday, we're gonna do 50 service projects.
[time=943] And we wanna be thankful for what God has done in and through this school, with the legacy started by Dr. David Jeremiah, Happy in IEDA, we got Bill in the room, a great leader and administrator here at Blackhawk, and there's just some great legacy that has gone on here, we wanna continue that.
[time=965] So we're gonna do 50 community outreach projects just so we can give back and love on Fort Wayne.
[time=973] So I mentioned Blackhawk's intentional about a discipleship model.
[time=979] Christian schools in America fall in one or two categories.
[time=983] They're typically evangelical, where they have open enrollment or their discipleship, covenant, partnering with families, which in our case we require one of the parents to have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=1000] And so that kind of narrows the entry, but it's on purpose, and especially this day and age, when everything that's out there is being forced upon, not just Christian schools, but churches, religious organizations to change who you are, where outside convictions are being forced upon entities and their inside convictions.
[time=1024] It's more important today than ever to be on mission and know who you are.
[time=1030] So I'm gonna start off, why do children need to be discipled?
[time=1034] First of all, because they're not recognized as being spiritually mature yet.
[time=1041] 2 Peter 1.20 says, "Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of scripture came about by the prophets own interpretation.
[time=1051] For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit." So this is talking about the writing of the Bible, the inerrant word of God, the truth that we have, that we get to hold and study.
[time=1068] It is written by 40 men, roughly, not children.
[time=1073] The Holy Spirit spoke through these men, they wrote it.
[time=1078] Why not any children?
[time=1079] Because there's that maturation.
[time=1081] They need to prepare, they need to be equipped.
[time=1084] They need to be brought up in the ways of the Lord and have that confidence and be able to do the work of the Lord.
[time=1091] My children need to be salt and light.
[time=1096] This is by far one of the most often reasons why Christian parents continue to send their children to secular schools.
[time=1104] They usually quote Jesus' admonition to Matthew 5, 13 through 14, where he declares, "You are salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored?
[time=1117] It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled upon under people's feet.
[time=1124] You are light of the world, a city on a hill, cannot be hidden." Parents use this verse to support their decision to educate their children in secular programs.
[time=1134] After all, this is what Jesus commanded every Christian to be, right?
[time=1139] With that being said, the debate usually ends.
[time=1142] So how should we address salt and light issues when it comes to educating our children?
[time=1149] Whenever I've heard someone teach on how to correctly interpret the Bible, they always emphasize the importance of context.
[time=1158] Peter wrote, "No portion of Scripture is open to private interpretation.
[time=1163] We must view any portion of God's word in light of other portions of the Bible and what it says about it.
[time=1171] Context is so important." So when we look at context, Matthew wrote that Jesus was going all over Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, healing every disease and sickness among the people.
[time=1188] This resulted in large crowds in Galileo, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan River.
[time=1198] With this backdrop, the writer opens up chapter five by telling us when Jesus saw the crowds, he withdrew and went up on a mountain.
[time=1209] Now Curtis Smith talked about chapter five a couple weeks ago, talking about all the riches in it, which we know as a sermon on the Mount, right?
[time=1220] The beatitudes and all these great things.
[time=1222] But chapter five, verse one says, "Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain and when he sat down, his disciples came to him.
[time=1231] We also know from similar occurrences, whenever Jesus saw large crowds, he looked on them with compassion.
[time=1239] One gospel writer stated that Jesus saw the masses as sheep wandering without a shepherd.
[time=1245] They were lost and had no hope.
[time=1248] On this occasion, a group of people saw him withdraw on the hillside and they went to him.
[time=1255] This is important point because when this group came to Jesus, he sat down and began teaching them.
[time=1263] It is to this group of people that he told them they were to be salt and light of the world.
[time=1270] Who was this group of individuals that Jesus addressed?
[time=1274] Matthew five one identifies them as his disciples.
[time=1278] The loss did not come to him.
[time=1280] Children didn't come to him.
[time=1281] It even appears new believers didn't come to him.
[time=1285] Children, excuse me, his disciples came to him.
[time=1289] It was these people that he delivered the sermon on the Mount too.
[time=1294] Now, obviously, the sermon on the Mount is meant for everybody and today we enjoy the instruction it has on life skills.
[time=1302] But at that point, it was only meant for his disciples to be salt and light in the world.
[time=1309] Christ strong charged to be salt of the earth and light of the world was given to his disciples.
[time=1317] It takes a disciple of Christ to be salt and light in this dark and lost world.
[time=1323] When we take this charge and apply it to others, who are not disciples of Christ yet, we are taking it out of context.
[time=1331] So who would be a disciple of Jesus to whom we would give this charge?
[time=1338] Well, again, we need to look at Scripture.
[time=1340] We need to look at the Bible and what it says about being a disciple.
[time=1345] Disciples are Christians who are obeying all that God has commanded.
[time=1350] Matthew 28, 20 says, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you and behold, I am with you always to the end of the age.
[time=1359] Disciples are people who daily deny themselves, take up their cross and follow him.
[time=1366] Luke 9, 23 says, if anyone would come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, daily and follow me.
[time=1375] True disciples are those who continue in his word, no truth and are set free from captivity of false philosophies.
[time=1386] John 8, 31 and 32 says, so Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him, if you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples and you will know the truth
[time=1401] and the truth will set you free.
[time=1403] A disciple must be a workman who is able to rightly divide,
[time=1409] handle and interpret God's word.
[time=1412] We see in 2 Timothy 2, 15, do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.
[time=1425] And disciples are ones who can endure hardship like a soldier and are not entangled in the things of the world.
[time=1434] 2 Timothy 2, 3, share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
[time=1441] You see, Jesus is our example of this type of person.
[time=1445] This is what a disciple must be able to do if he or she is going to be salt and light in the world.
[time=1452] It will require him or her to be well trained and equipped for spiritual warfare.
[time=1459] When parents send their children into secular, postmodern, anti-Christian environments as salt and light, they're declaring their children or disciples of Jesus who know the truth can rightly divide and apply God's word, have denied themselves and can endure hardships of being a soldier who avoids the things of the world.
[time=1480] That's a pretty tall order for a Christian adult, yet alone a child.
[time=1486] You see, we're in the mode where we got to train and prepare them.
[time=1491] That's what we're doing here.
[time=1493] Wednesday, we started school here at Blackhawk, but Monday we met in here with all faculty and staff, and I had them all stand so we could commission them because they have a calling and a purpose and a role, and it's to be on mission with what we're doing to prepare hearts and minds to serve Christ.
[time=1513] And we have to own that more than ever today because our world is darker than it's ever been without a doubt.
[time=1521] That's what we're about.
[time=1524] Can we expect a child to do this?
[time=1526] I want to look at this passage from another perspective.
[time=1531] To do this, I will need to go back to the days when I taught high school chemistry.
[time=1536] That one's for you, Grant, if he's in there.
[time=1538] Salt is one of the most abundant compounds
[time=1545] found in the earth.
[time=1546] I remember standing at the archeological dig of Sodom in the country of Jordan, and you could see the burn layer there, and flies everywhere was really a despicable place.
[time=1561] As is mentioned, it won't be rebuilt.
[time=1564] Who would rebuild there?
[time=1567] And tombs all over the place, and salt was everywhere, and there was a pillar off in the distance, but we're not gonna talk about earth.
[time=1574] But you could see way in the distance, the Dead Sea, and we went to the Dead Sea, obviously.
[time=1582] It's got nine times the density of salt than our oceans.
[time=1587] So if you bend to the Dead Sea, you can't swim in a Harley at all, and when you sit down and it's like sitting in the bean bag chair, you just kinda like stick.
[time=1599] It's really crazy.
[time=1600] But salt has so many uses in our world.
[time=1607] So we're thankful that it's abundant.
[time=1613] Consider the following.
[time=1615] The first one I wanna mention is salt preserves.
[time=1619] This is probably the most common use of salt that is applied to Jesus' admonition for disciples to be salt of the earth, is you need to go preserve Christianity.
[time=1632] You'll see salt like in a ham house, if you've ever walked in one, where they're hanging the ham, and they cake it with the salt, and it helps the ham, the meat, most meats, cure faster, but also helps them in the curing process that they won't spoil in the midst of that.
[time=1655] When a Christian tries to be salt in the world, he or she must cake an anti-Christian environment, a postmodern culture with the distinctiveness of Christianity.
[time=1669] To do this, salt must keep its saltiness so it can preserve the culture.
[time=1674] The second one I wanna point out is salt flavors.
[time=1679] It's one of my favorite, my wife will disagree, 'cause I probably used too much.
[time=1683] When one sprinkles salt on a grilled steak, you don't do it then to preserve it.
[time=1688] There you do it to bring out flavor.
[time=1691] Christians are to flavor this world with Christ-like character.
[time=1696] It takes time for a Christian to develop godly character needed to add this distinctive flavor to a lost world.
[time=1703] Third one is salt creates thirst.
[time=1707] The old adage that says you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make a drink is true for those that have been around horses.
[time=1716] However, if you put a salt block there, the horse licks the salt and starts drinking the water.
[time=1722] We do the same thing in restaurants and bars where they'll put free snacks and they're all salty, right?
[time=1732] Free popcorn, peanuts, pretzels.
[time=1737] They don't do that because they're being kind.
[time=1740] They do that because they know you'll eat 'em and you'll get thirsty and you'll order more beverages and your bill will go up and they'll make more, right?
[time=1749] Christians who are equipped with salt must have the ability to cause lost people to thirst for God and his salvation.
[time=1758] Few children have this ability.
[time=1762] They'll get there, but they don't have that ability yet.
[time=1765] We have to train them to have that ability.
[time=1769] The next one, salt cleanses.
[time=1772] It may not be something you wanna do nowadays is if you get a fresh cut and you pour salty water over it, right?
[time=1780] It will heal it.
[time=1782] It will clean it out, but it will burn, right?
[time=1785] I'd much rather use a soothing ointment today, but if it's not available, salt can provide the protection
[time=1796] for from infection.
[time=1798] Again, this is a very difficult thing for an immature Christian to do, yet alone a child.
[time=1806] My mom was the youngest in nine growing up in Washington State on a berry farm and they got a knock on the door and there were three men there and she thought they were in policemen 'cause they had uniforms on and they began kissing her mom, my grandma, and hugging her and one lifted her up in the air and then they turned to my mom who was like seven or eight years old and they said, "Come here, meet your brothers." She'd never met her brothers that just got back from World War II and they were fighting and one of them was flying a fighter and he got shot down and he crashed on a Japanese headquarters, wiped out the whole headquarters and then walked out of the plane, you know?
[time=1853] So that was kind of fitting, but then they obviously got him and he went in a POW camp and then another brother was on the Yorktown and it sunk, he sunk with it at Midway and but swam, they finally got picked up from the enemy and so he was a POW too, but they both served for one of them three and a half years as a POW but working in the mines, the nickel mines but especially the salt mines kept so many of the POWs healthy and they didn't get to the diseases and they were kept clean because it cleans, you know?
[time=1893] So it was fortunate that they were in those environments and obviously after the war, they got to go to LA and they tried those generals, those Japanese generals just like the Nuremberg trials who treated them poorly 'cause they were tortured as well and got to testify.
[time=1915] Another one is salt heals.
[time=1918] When I was growing up, probably some of you were like this too, my mom, when I get canker sores on my lips or in my mouth, I would have to put saltwater in there, you know, hold it a long time and I'd wanna spit it out 'cause it tastes terrible but she'd make me keep it for a duration to make sure those sores were healing and eventually they would heal up.
[time=1942] I cannot imagine sending a child out into the world to try and heal the wounds caused by sin.
[time=1948] Salt also melts coldness, right?
[time=1953] Living in Indiana, we know that.
[time=1955] We have icy roads and what do we do?
[time=1959] We put down salt on the roads or a path that you walk on or your sidewalk.
[time=1963] What happens is it lowers the freezing point of the ice and melts it, melts the coldness.
[time=1972] To be salt, Christians have to have maturity to go into a dark, lost world that is cold to the gospel.
[time=1979] We have to have the character and maturity to melt the cold hardness of a lost person's heart.
[time=1985] This is hardly something children are capable of doing.
[time=1990] Once again, adults have a hard time doing this but God has called this to be salt and the last one I wanna point out is salt raises boiling points.
[time=2002] We live in a violent world, chaotic if you ask me, right?
[time=2006] Tragic accounts all the time.
[time=2009] People reaching their boiling point and they go berserk.
[time=2013] The results are disastrous sometimes.
[time=2016] When you add salt to water, it actually raises the boiling point so that the water will get hotter before it boils.
[time=2027] And you can do this with like cooking potatoes or spaghetti and it actually makes them tastier which I like, tastier food, right?
[time=2037] It shows.
[time=2038] And as salt, Christians must raise the boiling point in society with difficult conversations as we live our lives as peacemakers.
[time=2050] We're gonna raise that boiling point and it takes a mature, godly Christian to be able to do this.
[time=2057] So as you can see, salt has a lot of very useful purposes and I share those things with you 'cause when we're asked to be salt, we need to be able to count the cost and what does that really look like for a Christian to be salt in this world today?
[time=2073] To do any of these functions, salt must first make contact with whatever it is trying to influence.
[time=2082] When we send a young child or teen into this dark, sinful world, we are expecting them to be able to make contact with the world around them and be a powerful force to restrain and affect the effects of sin.
[time=2097] Now they can't, I'm not saying they can't go do that but often we can be setting them up for great failure.
[time=2106] It can put them in dangerous situation.
[time=2109] As we educate our children and youth, we must be diligent to protect them from dangerous philosophies of this world while we prepare to develop the character in their lives to one day be salt of the world.
[time=2124] Children are not equipped to do that in the state they're in.
[time=2128] I could talk about light at length but it would take another sermon, so maybe next time but when is a disciple ready to be salt?
[time=2140] When were the disciples that Jesus spoke this to, ready to be salt?
[time=2146] I have a little graph here to pop up that I just threw together with years.
[time=2151] So let's just take Black Hawk Christian School, a student in school.
[time=2155] We have them about 180 days out of the school year.
[time=2159] We got three days done.
[time=2161] So we only have 177 more days to disciple them.
[time=2166] Jesus had the disciples 365 days in a year.
[time=2171] So compared to a school year, he was twice as long that he had them in his care to disciple them, right?
[time=2178] So we're gonna double the three years that he was with them to six years.
[time=2185] And then let's take the hours.
[time=2186] We get a student for about seven hours a day.
[time=2190] Take lunch and recess out.
[time=2194] PE, no offense cliff, that's good discipleship.
[time=2198] But we really get them about six hours to disciple into their lives.
[time=2202] Jesus had them 24/7, but you know what?
[time=2207] I'm gonna take sleep out 'cause he wasn't discipling during the sleep.
[time=2211] Maybe they had some good dreams.
[time=2212] We'll take the weekend out.
[time=2214] We'll take their extra time for getting wood and extra s'mores, but they live together.
[time=2221] They camp together, they ate together, they discipled, he spoke into their life.
[time=2228] So we're gonna say 12 hours, that's pretty fair.
[time=2231] There again, that's double the amount of time in a day.
[time=2234] So now we gotta take those six years and now it's 12 years.
[time=2238] Kind of a coincidence that it takes that long to get the disciples.
[time=2243] He did it in a crash course.
[time=2245] We do it over a period of time.
[time=2248] But really, that's the amount of time that it needs to get a disciple ready.
[time=2254] Now, were the disciples actually ready?
[time=2258] Let's say graduation was the crucifixion and the resurrection, were they ready at that time?
[time=2265] I'll say the valedictorian, he denied Christ.
[time=2271] Not once, not twice, three times.
[time=2278] And if you look at the disciples after the resurrection, they were in fear, they were disillusioned.
[time=2285] Some were doubting like Thomas.
[time=2289] They were not ready to be disciples.
[time=2293] It wasn't for 50 days later at Pentecost, Acts chapter two, the Holy Spirit came upon them, they filled them.
[time=2302] That was the first time they took what they had learned and they began to apply it into the world.
[time=2310] And we know from that point on, it changed the world.
[time=2314] But we need to prepare, we need to equip this generation
[time=2321] to be ready to become disciples.
[time=2324] So we need to get it right.
[time=2326] We need to know that Jesus taught in Matthew 5, 12 through 16, he taught to the disciples to be salt.
[time=2334] Salt has many uses, but all of them require us to come in direct contact with whatever it's trying to influence.
[time=2342] For a Christian to be salt, it requires him or her to have a very strong grasp of God's word.
[time=2350] And we must have the maturity to refute air in biblical truth.
[time=2354] I think you will agree that it's extremely challenging assignment for a Christian to be salt of the earth.
[time=2362] In fact, I believe one must be willing and able to enter into spiritual warfare if he truly wants to make a difference.
[time=2371] I encourage you to go to passages like 2 Corinthians 10, 3 through 5, or Ephesians 6 and read about spiritual warfare, what we're gonna battle against, what we need to be prepared to battle against and understand the severity of entering in to spiritual warfare.
[time=2391] Second Timothy, three, 12 through 17 says.
[time=2396] This is Paul writing to Timothy.
[time=2399] Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
[time=2405] While evil people and imposters will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.
[time=2411] But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
[time=2428] All scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction and for training and righteousness that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.
[time=2443] Paul is telling Timothy, hey, you're gonna be persecuted.
[time=2447] Get ready.
[time=2448] Hey, there's gonna be evil people that are gonna come against you, that are gonna get worse, not better.
[time=2456] You need to listen to what we're instructing you with.
[time=2460] You need to take God's word and you need to absorb it.
[time=2463] You need to apply.
[time=2464] You need to make sure it sticks.
[time=2466] So then you can be ready to become the righteous man of God that you can become equipped for every good work.
[time=2477] And Timothy took that to heart as a young man and to be that disciple.
[time=2482] With this in mind, we need to realize that our children and you should not be sent out into spiritual warfare without being fully prepared for battle, that they will definitely face.
[time=2495] When I've shared this with parents and pastors, I frequently hear the person justify why they are sending their children to secular education programs with these words.
[time=2505] Well, I don't wanna shelter my children from the real world.
[time=2509] I find it interesting that we don't wanna shelter our children when it comes to education, but we shelter them everywhere else.
[time=2519] Would we take our kids to a church
[time=2525] that was teaching out of the Book of Mormon or the Koran?
[time=2528] Would we let our kids go down the street and stay out of neighbor for two weeks that we know their morals and convictions don't line up with us?
[time=2539] When I've shared that with parents, of course the answer is no, we would never do that.
[time=2544] Parents know their children need to be protected
[time=2550] from bad influences in some areas of life, but are not willing to be consistent in their theology, especially when it comes to where they send them to school.
[time=2561] Jesus always taught the importance of protecting one's children from ungodly influences.
[time=2568] We find several New Testament writers warning Christians about the importance of avoiding false teachers.
[time=2574] So should we try to shelter our kids from the real world?
[time=2578] First of all, it's impossible to shelter our children
[time=2584] from the real world.
[time=2585] That's hard to say, that's a tongue twister, real world.
[time=2589] However, we must still protect our children from false philosophies and ideas that are aimed at taking them captive.
[time=2596] Here are two statements that have believed to be a most important for parents, church leaders and educators when it comes to protecting our children from false ideas of this world.
[time=2608] The goal of protection must not be to shelter our children from the world.
[time=2613] The goal of protection must be to prepare our children for battle with the world.
[time=2620] Protecting our children is not the problem.
[time=2622] The problem is with the goal we use for protecting them.
[time=2626] If it is merely to shelter them, we are setting them up for failure.
[time=2632] And when they leave our care and go into the world world, they will be destroyed.
[time=2637] As we protect our children from the influences of the world,
[time=2643] we must always be preparing them for battle.
[time=2647] They will one day enter into.
[time=2649] In other words, the education we give our children at home, church, school, must prepare them for spiritual war that God expects them to fight as an adult.
[time=2661] They must be fit for battle.
[time=2664] Kevin Swanson states this very well in his book, Upgrade.
[time=2669] For a child to be fit for battle and be salt and light,
[time=2675] he must be prepared to confront the world, to wrestle with principalities and powers, to cast down imaginations that oppose the knowledge of God and to bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.
[time=2690] These are powerful words.
[time=2692] Not a lot of adults can do that yet until they mature in their walk with the Lord.
[time=2700] Definitely not a baby Christian.
[time=2703] Doesn't matter what the age is, it's where they are in their spiritual growth.
[time=2708] He goes on to mention areas that they're gonna need to tackle.
[time=2715] And so think about this as I mentioned these areas that they're being confronted with in our culture right now.
[time=2724] Are they prepared?
[time=2726] Is a young person prepared for egalitarianism?
[time=2730] God eliminating evolution.
[time=2732] Materialistic socialism.
[time=2735] Relativism.
[time=2736] Environmentalism.
[time=2738] Atheism.
[time=2739] Pluralism.
[time=2740] Sexual freedom.
[time=2741] Gender identity.
[time=2743] On and on and on.
[time=2744] That's the world we're throwing him into.
[time=2750] We gotta get him ready.
[time=2762] I found it interesting in the book of Numbers, God asked Israel to number the people, take a census.
[time=2771] And we find that when they numbered, they counted the men 20 years and older who were fit for battle.
[time=2780] Even though the young men could physically fight, they were trained at an early age.
[time=2788] The enemies of Israel also served pagan gods.
[time=2793] And God knew that they had to be at a level to not only defeat the enemy, but to wipe out the idols.
[time=2801] The false gods.
[time=2806] He wanted to eliminate the surrounding enemies
[time=2814] in their false gods and to accomplish this, they had to be 20 years old, physically, mentally, and spiritually prepared and fit for battle.
[time=2825] That's what we're here for.
[time=2829] Deuteronomy six, six through eight, it's on the parents.
[time=2835] In some cases, grandparents.
[time=2837] You're to be disciplining your children.
[time=2840] It's not the church's responsibility or the Christian school that was given to you.
[time=2847] It says talk to them in the morning at night.
[time=2850] Write down the doorpost to your home.
[time=2852] The church and school will come alongside you.
[time=2855] Proverbs 22, six, train up a child in a way she go.
[time=2861] And when he's old, he'll not part to part from it.
[time=2866] That's a promise.
[time=2869] We're in this together.
[time=2874] Let's join forces and prepare our children.
[time=2877] Make sure they're fit for battle.
[time=2881] Lord,
[time=2892] you've given all of us the great commission, Lord.
[time=2898] I like to call it kid mission, as you know, God.
[time=2905] It starts at home.
[time=2907] And Lord, I just pray that you help us to recognize the gift and the calling and the responsibility
[time=2918] we have to raise up this generation.
[time=2921] To truly know, to know you, to know truth, and to follow you.
[time=2935] And Father, for those here today, watching online or in the room, Lord, who have not started that discipleship journey, they're not even in a place to be discipled.
[time=2947] If that's you and you want a relationship with Jesus, you want to begin that walk.
[time=2953] You want to step out of the boat, so to speak, and be absorbed in the grace and the mercy of our Lord and our Creator.
[time=2964] If that's you, today is the day of salvation.
[time=2967] I want to acknowledge it, but just you raise it up your hand.
[time=2970] Just raise up your hand that you want to accept Jesus.
[time=2972] You want it to be real in your life.
[time=2976] You don't want to go through the motions.
[time=2979] All right, I see you want the Lord in your life more than ever.
[time=2985] Anybody else?
[time=2986] Anybody online, God sees you.
[time=2994] Also, I want to give a challenge out there to parents and grandparents, and even if you're not connected, you are connected with children, with a generation here that is really our future.
[time=3007] And if God is challenging you to press in, to realize that time is so important,
[time=3017] our investment is so important.
[time=3019] And the legacy we imprint upon these young people is the difference.
[time=3026] And if God is pushing you kind out of the boat in that area as well, and you want to just be more.
[time=3033] You want to be more at home.
[time=3034] You want to be more about devotions and having those conversations.
[time=3039] You want to be more here at church, and you want to come alongside all the ministries here in some capacity, or you want to be more about being involved more in the school, and what discipleship all about.
[time=3054] If God's speaking to you here in the room or online and you're being challenged today, I want you to just slip your hand up as well, to acknowledge that.
[time=3062] Just slip it up and say, yeah, if I want to do more, anybody else, God bless us here, anybody else.
[time=3068] Fill in that urge.
[time=3070] Yeah, I see you guys.
[time=3072] Awesome.
[time=3072] Lord, I pray right now, God, for those that have asked you into their heart, Lord, that truly began that relationship with you, Lord, that began at the cross, and through the resurrection, Lord, and how amazing, Lord, your love is.
[time=3092] And Lord, that you will just show them everything you have in store for them, everything you want to do in and through them, and how you want them to be discipled, and to be your chosen.
[time=3105] Just thank you for that, Lord, and Lord, for those that need to press in more, Lord, and just their emphasis.
[time=3112] Lord, you know their hearts, you know where they're at, on just reaching out and raising up their children, their grandchildren, speaking truth, and guiding them and providing those nuggets of truth that are so essential in just growth, Lord.
[time=3134] I just ask that you just do that work, Lord, right now, here, and people watching online, Lord, we just ask for that work to happen, Lord, and to be real about being on mission, not just to go through the motion, but to really, truly go and step out.
[time=3152] We just thank you so much, Father, for just the opportunity this morning to be in your word.
[time=3158] Go before us now, we pray.
[time=3162] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3164] (gentle music)
