[time=0] This week and next week, we'll finish our study in the book of Philippians.
[time=4] But I wanted to point out to you that there's a ministry called U Version, Y-O-U Version.
[time=10] And it's a Bible resource online.
[time=12] I use it all the time.
[time=14] You can look up, don't worry, don't be anxious for anything out of Philippians.
[time=19] And it'll come up with about 50 English translations.
[time=23] You ought to like one of them.
[time=25] And the two verses in chapter four are verses six and seven.
[time=33] And in verse 13, we're both in the top 10 verses that were underlined on their computer's ability to track what we're doing, which they can track what we're doing.
[time=45] I think every moment of our life.
[time=47] But if they want to track where we're studying the Bible, good, we're glad to have that data.
[time=53] And we're going to be talking this week and next about some of the most popular verses in all of scripture.
[time=58] Here's chapter four verses six and seven.
[time=62] Don't be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your request to God, and the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
[time=80] What great comfort and assurance.
[time=83] And then in addition to that, Philippians 4, 13, I can do everything through him who gives me this strength.
[time=92] We're going to be talking today about anxiety and worry, really they're synonymous.
[time=98] One of the emotion that comes along with worry is fear.
[time=102] There's an organization called the Anxiety and Depression Association of America reports that anxiety disorders and anxiety disorder is just worry at its worst.
[time=115] That anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses in the United States, affecting 40 million adults age 18 and over or 18% of the United States population is now suffering from an anxiety disorder.
[time=131] When we say agni disorder, we're saying that you're having a worry to the point where you can't function normal in life.
[time=139] A worry that debilitates you, cripples you, it weakens your immune system to fight off a disease.
[time=145] And we'll talk more about that in a moment.
[time=147] But just know that 40 million people are not worrying, 40 million people are not worrying to the point where they can't function normally in life.
[time=157] A different website called Safe Home tracked the 2,000 people, serving them what was their most difficult thing to deal with in their life.
[time=168] What did they worry and fear the most?
[time=171] Here's the top 10, see if you excite yourself in any of these.
[time=175] The number one point of anxiety was loved ones dying.
[time=180] And I don't know if it struck you, but I had a loved one die during the great pandemic.
[time=185] Secondly, loved ones becoming seriously ill.
[time=189] Well, probably you were seriously ill right before you became a statistic of somebody who died.
[time=195] Third thing we worried about the most was mass shootings.
[time=200] Fourth thing we worried about was enough money to retire.
[time=204] Fifth was terrorism.
[time=207] Sixth, government corruption.
[time=210] Seventh, terminal illness.
[time=213] Eight, hate crimes.
[time=215] Nine, medical bills.
[time=217] Ten, widespread civil disorder.
[time=221] What causes this level of anxiety?
[time=225] Why do we have such a hard time coping with life?
[time=230] The experts tell us from the medical news daily that anxiety disorders have a complicated network of causes and including environmental areas, meaning stress in your work, stress at your school, relationships, jobs, finances, that the normal cares of life, the environment in which you live combines with perhaps your genetics.
[time=253] Your worrying isn't your fault, by the way it's in your genes.
[time=256] So you can blame your parents.
[time=259] Don't have to take responsibility.
[time=262] Third factor is medical factors, such as side effects of medicine, underlying medical conditions.
[time=270] Always found it funny in the worst of the depression and the pandemic.
[time=275] They said if you are age 60 or older or have a preexisting condition, do this.
[time=282] If you're 60 years or older, you have a preexisting condition.
[time=288] So don't look for a way out of that one.
[time=293] Brain chemistry, what we mean is how does your brain function?
[time=299] Is it prone to be worrisome or is it prone to be more stoic?
[time=303] We'll talk more about that in a moment.
[time=306] And another cause is one who's withdrawing from an addictive substance or using an addictive substance.
[time=314] And to summarize it, here's what they said.
[time=316] "Excessive anxiety is most commonly triggered by the stresses of day-to-day living and a combination of the above.
[time=325] It's usually a response to outside forces, but it is possible that anxious feelings can emerge from a person telling himself or herself the worst will probably happen." There's a sociological, psychological term for people who are always afraid the worst is going to happen.
[time=346] It's called awfulism.
[time=349] They think everything's going to be the worst it can be.
[time=351] It's just going to be awful.
[time=353] They look at the weather and say, "Oh, it's partly cloudy." The next person said, "It's mostly sunny," but they took the worst condition it could be.
[time=361] Did any of you have overly protective parents?
[time=364] I think my mother would have preferred it if I were in a helmet in our own house.
[time=369] We're worrisome, and that emerges from within us.
[time=374] And if we had nothing left to worry about, we've had nothing left to worry about, because it becomes a mode of operation.
[time=382] It becomes a dominant force shaping our personality that we are worrisome person or we're an adventurous person.
[time=389] We're a person that trusts God quite naturally when we're a person that says, "That's hard for me to do because worrisomeness goes along with control and control is a big issue in life.
[time=400] At least it's a big issue in my life." The anatomy of anxiety is fascinating to me, and I'm certainly not a neurologist.
[time=410] But fear activates the fight or flight mechanism that's in each one of us.
[time=416] And that's found in what is called amygdala.
[time=419] Interpart of your brain gives you that startle reflex when somebody comes up behind my wife and says, "Boo, about that loud." She jumps out of her skin, and some people have this instant
[time=434] response to fight or flight.
[time=438] I have another friend.
[time=439] I try to sneak up in his office, and I scream in his ear, and he goes, "Nothing happened." The amygdala is what controls that, and it competes with another part of the brain known for the critical thinking that it takes place, and that's called the cerebral cortex.
[time=459] Those two pieces of our brain get information at the same time, but the way we're neurologically wired, the amygdala hears it first, the cerebral cortex hears it second.
[time=470] So the impulse to react is faster than the impulse to say, "Think about it before you do that." That's why worry is so natural to us, because it's the first instinct we have is to fight or deflate.
[time=487] We're going to look at how God offers to give us rest, because when we go through this stress of hormones, norepinephrine, adrenaline, cortisol, all of those natural hormones are great if you're going to do something bold and adventuresome.
[time=507] If you're about to go skiing for the very first time, it's good to have that adrenaline surge, because what it does is it increases our heart rate and our blood pressure.
[time=516] It increases the sugar in our bloodstream.
[time=519] It opens up our lungs to take in more oxygen and make us all jacked up.
[time=523] We're ready for that mountain.
[time=526] It's great if you're about to take your first piano recital to be courageous.
[time=530] If it's your first football game, you want to be all jacked up.
[time=533] But that also takes a toll on our bodies, leading to digestive problems, heart disease, impaired autoimmune system.
[time=542] Chronic fear reduces the effect of neurotransmitters that make us happy, leaving us to be depressed.
[time=552] How do we get away from all this?
[time=553] Well, God says, I will give you rest.
[time=557] Not rest is in a baby forced to take a nap when she doesn't want to.
[time=561] Not resting that we're going to get out of four or 10 minutes early.
[time=564] A deep abiding rest in your soul that no matter what happens, you're at rest.
[time=570] We're gonna follow this little outline of R-E-S-T rest.
[time=575] So the R stands for rejoice.
[time=579] Of course it does, this is Philippians.
[time=581] This is the Apostle Paul.
[time=583] 17 times in four chapters, he's either gonna say rejoice, be joyful or be glad.
[time=589] This is the apostle of the good news, good news.
[time=593] And this abundance of emphasis is on the fact that we choose how we respond to what hits us in life.
[time=602] We can't choose what happens to us, but we can choose how we respond to what happens to us.
[time=608] The word rejoice has a mood.
[time=612] Verbs have moods.
[time=616] You thought only old people had moods, but verbs have moods.
[time=620] For example, I'm going to the store is a statement, simple statement, and are you going to the store?
[time=629] Is a question, the first was indicative, the second's an interrogative.
[time=634] And the third way is to say get to the store, that's a command.
[time=638] This word rejoice is in the mood of the imperative command.
[time=646] It says do it and do it now.
[time=650] But if you didn't get that from the mood, you would get it from the repetition.
[time=652] He says rejoice in the Lord, always, I will say it again, rejoice.
[time=658] Paul wants us to know that joy is not in controlled by what's happening to us.
[time=666] We are controlling what's happening to us because our default mechanism is set to joy.
[time=673] We're gonna dig into this more in just a moment.
[time=675] But notice it doesn't say rejoice in circumstances, rejoice in your wealth, rejoice in your health.
[time=680] It says rejoice in the Lord.
[time=682] The only thing that you have that's guaranteed to be with you and love you tomorrow is the Lord.
[time=688] Something tragic can take the life of your spouse before this church service is over.
[time=694] None of us knows when we're gonna die or how we're gonna die.
[time=697] And if we did, we wouldn't wanna be there when it happened.
[time=700] But the Lord will be there when that happens.
[time=705] And go through life with hurts and habits and hang-ups, the Lord's there.
[time=709] Go through the life with hope, healing, God's there.
[time=713] He is with us.
[time=714] He even expands on this and he tells us to rejoice, meaning take control of your emotions.
[time=724] Now our emotions are tied to that amygdala that thinks faster than the cerebral cortex, which says let's think about that.
[time=733] So there's always this tension to open mouth, stick in foot.
[time=738] There's always this temptation to let your mind go faster than rather let your mouth grow faster than your mind.
[time=746] I'm having that happen right now.
[time=749] But we are expected by God to control our emotions.
[time=755] Doesn't mean we're to be unfeeling.
[time=757] It means we're to say when I don't feel right, I don't feel good about another person.
[time=762] I don't feel like I like my circumstances.
[time=765] We don't stop there.
[time=766] We say, but God is in control.
[time=769] God is with me.
[time=770] He adds this statement.
[time=772] Again, I will say it, rejoice.
[time=774] Let your gentleness be evident to all.
[time=779] That sounds like a whole new subject, doesn't it?
[time=781] We're talking about worry.
[time=782] We're talking about anxiety.
[time=784] We're talking about joy and all of a sudden he says something out there about gentleness.
[time=790] Why would he say that?
[time=791] Well, because gentleness is brought about by joyfulness.
[time=796] That joyfulness produces gentleness.
[time=800] And how do you have this kind, gentle spirit?
[time=804] It's because the Lord is near.
[time=807] He's with you.
[time=807] His spirit is in you.
[time=809] His word is in your hand and between his word and his spirit and his people.
[time=813] Those three things come together to show us how to control our emotions like this.
[time=820] Paul said to the church in Thessalonica, knowing that they were worried about loved ones who died, he wrote to them, he said, I'm writing to you about those who have fallen asleep in Christ so that you do not sorrow as others who have no hope.
[time=835] He doesn't say you're so emotionally stoic, you don't sorrow.
[time=839] He's saying you don't sorrow as others who have no hope.
[time=844] And when people have hope that's greater than their sorrow, they can keep their emotions under control.
[time=851] The funeral I mentioned I did yesterday.
[time=854] I don't remember it, but I did a funeral yesterday.
[time=857] And the family had been rejoicing for two days.
[time=864] Their loved one died suddenly and unexpectedly of cardiac arrest.
[time=869] The family members tried to resuscitate him.
[time=872] The EMTs did their best.
[time=874] They took him to the hospital.
[time=875] He did not survive.
[time=877] They mourned, but they had a good time mourning.
[time=880] They had seven grandchildren and each of the seven grandchildren got up and spoke at Grandpa's funeral.
[time=888] And they had seven of them and the word grandpa has seven letters so they coordinated what they said with the letter and there was just joy in the house of the Lord because they knew their father or grandfather who had died was absent from his body and he was present of the Lord Jesus Christ for all of eternity.
[time=909] They had a confidence they'll see him again and they had joy and we are so convinced that heaven is real that we're experiencing nothing greater than a graduation party.
[time=920] That is the our rejoice in the Lord.
[time=927] By the way, there's only two things that ultimately motivate us in life.
[time=933] One is love, the other is fear.
[time=936] In the name of love, people will do extraordinary things.
[time=939] They'll make unbelievable sacrifices.
[time=941] They'll be generous to a fault.
[time=943] They'll take the side of their loved one no matter what is happening.
[time=946] They'll be there.
[time=947] Love is the ultimate motivator in life.
[time=950] But the second motivator in life is not far behind.
[time=952] It's the motivator of fear.
[time=954] I'm the worst person possible when I'm in the mood of fear.
[time=959] I'm reasonably bearable when I'm in the mood of love, but when the mood of fear comes in, I become irritable, short-tempered.
[time=967] I don't like me.
[time=968] And it's simple little things like this.
[time=972] If I know I've got a good first line for this weekend's message, don't worry, kill you.
[time=982] Let the church help.
[time=983] If I've got that good first start, I'm pretty relaxed.
[time=988] But if I don't know what I'm gonna say, I'm irritable and my wife will ask me something.
[time=992] I say, I don't know.
[time=993] And that was my mood.
[time=996] Why?
[time=998] Because I was afraid.
[time=999] I don't wanna fail in front of people.
[time=1001] God says, perfect love casts out fear.
[time=1008] Proverbs told us years ago, centuries ago,
[time=1015] millennia ago, a soft answer turns away wrath.
[time=1020] I'm gonna jam in one of my favorite stories.
[time=1026] We went on a one weekend vacation getaway to Indianapolis, Indiana.
[time=1031] We had this card and the card gave us some absorbent number off, 50% off.
[time=1038] So we made our reservation, said something about the card and they said, just show it when you check in.
[time=1044] Well as I was checking in, a guy was checking in right ahead of me and he presented a card, just like my card.
[time=1051] He said, I have this card and she says, oh yes, we are under new management.
[time=1056] That card's not good anymore.
[time=1058] His amygdala was working.
[time=1061] He responded quickly and decisively and told her what was going to happen, including the end of the world if she didn't accept that coupon.
[time=1072] And the more he pressed, the more she dug her feet in and stood the ground and he would say this and she would respond it and he said, well fine, I'll just go somewhere else and she gestured to the door.
[time=1083] I'm looking at her, I'm looking at my card and my response was called cowardice.
[time=1091] I wasn't gonna mess with her.
[time=1093] I just said, I understand your situation.
[time=1095] I have the same card as that other gentleman.
[time=1098] I don't expect anything.
[time=1099] She said, wait a minute.
[time=1102] Look to see if the other guy left.
[time=1104] She said, that card's no good, but the manager's discount is.
[time=1108] (audience laughing) Whew, here's the difference.
[time=1116] That guy didn't have time for his cerebral cortex to go to work.
[time=1120] I got a living display of what happens when you're amygdala's in function and I wasn't about to mess with her.
[time=1126] Rejoice in the Lord, always.
[time=1133] I'll say it, rejoice in the Lord.
[time=1137] Number two, the E in rest.
[time=1139] Rejoice in the Lord is our R.
[time=1142] Our E is express your heart to God.
[time=1145] I'm gonna quote from the new living Bible.
[time=1148] I know it's a paraphrase, but it's so good, I couldn't resist it.
[time=1152] Don't worry about anything.
[time=1154] Instead, pray about everything.
[time=1158] This is God's invitation to express our heart to him.
[time=1163] You may feel like you've got burdens and nobody knows and nobody cares and nobody cares to know.
[time=1168] God knows, God cares.
[time=1171] Isn't it remarkable that God knows you by name?
[time=1174] He's gonna knows you by need.
[time=1176] Anything that's going through your head and your heart right now, God's completely aware of it.
[time=1182] He knows how you feel.
[time=1184] And he says, pour out your heart to me.
[time=1188] Don't worry about anything.
[time=1190] Instead, pray about everything.
[time=1193] How do you not worry about everything when you're laid off?
[time=1197] When you've been served your divorce papers.
[time=1201] When you're waiting for the biopsy results.
[time=1205] When your financial plan is being chewed up by the bears of Wall Street.
[time=1211] Prayer is the transfer of our worries to God.
[time=1221] Peter put it this way.
[time=1226] Cast all of your care upon him for he cares for you.
[time=1231] And what we do when we pray and we ask God for help, we ask God for intervention, we are casting all of our cares on him.
[time=1241] And God's response is this, I love you.
[time=1244] I'll take care of it.
[time=1246] So it's unnecessary for you or me to ever worry again if we have truly cast our cares to the Lord.
[time=1254] If we cast our cares to the Lord, it's redundant for us to worry.
[time=1261] It would be strange for me to come home and see Kathy mowing the grass, putting the mower back in the garage, to open up the garage, to take out the mower, to cut the grass.
[time=1273] Didn't need cut in that 15 seconds between when she quit and I started.
[time=1278] It's redundant.
[time=1279] We have a situation that we both have busy days and we often forget to feed the dog.
[time=1285] So we're often in communication going, "Did you feed the dog?
[time=1289] I'll feed the dog.
[time=1289] I can swing by the house." Because if you ask our dog, he said he never ate.
[time=1293] Can't trust that guy at all.
[time=1299] But he sat by his bowl.
[time=1302] If Kathy fed him and I came home, he'd go point to the bowl.
[time=1305] He wouldn't tell me I haven't been fed already.
[time=1309] It's redundant.
[time=1310] You don't feed your dog twice.
[time=1312] You don't need to worry twice about the same thing.
[time=1314] Let God do the worrying.
[time=1315] He's better at it than you are.
[time=1317] And what does God offer for the worries?
[time=1325] God's offer is for peace.
[time=1329] We'll come to that in a moment.
[time=1331] He also calls us the Thanksgiving.
[time=1333] Thanksgiving is a game changer.
[time=1337] If you are hurt, you are frustrated, you are panic driven, you're an awfulizer.
[time=1345] God knows that.
[time=1346] And one of the cures he has is Thanksgiving.
[time=1350] I heard somebody say back when I was pastoring this church, if you are fearful and worrisome about something that's about to happen, take and identify 10 things that's positive in your life.
[time=1367] And I remember it was in the middle of the living Christmas tree.
[time=1372] How many of you remember the living Christmas tree?
[time=1375] I met a guy who said he's been in every one of them, not just every year, every one, every year.
[time=1383] There's an award for him in heaven, I'm sure.
[time=1386] But back in the days of the living Christmas tree, we had a hot water tank go out.
[time=1393] We're working morning, noon and night.
[time=1395] We've got three little kids.
[time=1396] We're in the middle of the Christmas season.
[time=1398] We're having concerts.
[time=1399] We come home exhausted, turned on the shower and nothing but cold water in December.
[time=1404] I did more of my share complaining in that one night than I had coming to me for the next year.
[time=1412] And somebody had said, "Count your thankful items." And so that was put on my mind.
[time=1419] I assumed by the Holy Spirit, so I started thinking, "Well, the hot water tank went out, "but I called Sutherland's.
[time=1427] "That was a while ago." And they had one in stock.
[time=1431] I had a station wagon.
[time=1433] That was a while ago.
[time=1435] And I could fit the hot water tank into the station wagon so I could deliver it home.
[time=1441] A friend by the name of Cecil Lawson, you remember Cecil.
[time=1446] Cecil was one of the guys that said, "If you ever need me, I'll be glad to help." And you knew by the way he said it, he'd be glad to help.
[time=1452] So I called Cecil.
[time=1454] He said he'd be right over to help me install this.
[time=1456] I didn't get to 10 before I was overwhelmed by the goodness of God.
[time=1464] This is part of the disease, I'm sorry.
[time=1469] God calls us to express our heart to him, to pour out our hearts and tell him what worries our soul, and then let him take it, and nothing will help you the more than being thankful.
[time=1481] Give thanks and everything, first Thessalonians, five.
[time=1486] God's promise is peace.
[time=1491] God's promise is not that you'll get a job or your marriage will be resolved with its conflicts or that the Bobs who will come back negative or your son will willingly go to recovery or the bulls will take over Wall Street.
[time=1506] The promises of God is he will give you peace.
[time=1510] Now remember who you're hearing from.
[time=1515] He's a man who's been flogged and stoned, locked up and driven out, shipwrecked and snake bit.
[time=1522] All for his faith in Christ.
[time=1526] He's not a guy who's going to fall for the gospel prosperity, the name and claim at theology or the believe and receive it, that God's going to make everybody healthy and wealthy.
[time=1538] God never promised that.
[time=1539] What God did promise is this, in this life you will have tribulations.
[time=1545] But don't be afraid, Jesus that I've overcome the world.
[time=1549] Anything that happens to you first passes through the hand of God.
[time=1557] God's promise is peace.
[time=1560] The S stands for set your mind on Christ.
[time=1565] That came up earlier in the book of Philippians in chapter two, verse five, which may be the hardest challenge in life.
[time=1571] It says, set your mind on the things and the attitude of Christ Jesus.
[time=1577] To ask yourself, am I thinking the way Jesus would think?
[time=1582] I love those, what would Jesus do, bracelets, aren't they great?
[time=1585] But somebody needs to make one as well says, how would Jesus think?
[time=1589] Because how you think determines how you act and how you act will ultimately determine how you feel.
[time=1595] We'll get into that next week.
[time=1597] But Jesus is going to hold all of our heart, our heart's worries and concerns.
[time=1603] Paul said he's going to keep your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
[time=1607] So we're setting our minds among Christ.
[time=1611] This is verse eight of Philippians four.
[time=1614] Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable.
[time=1625] If there is anything excellent or praiseworthy, now look at this, think about such things.
[time=1632] One of the most important things he's telling us here is to think about what you're thinking about.
[time=1636] And we're not good at that.
[time=1639] We just take a road and go down it as fast and as hard as we can.
[time=1644] And he's saying, if you want to control your behavior and you want to control your emotions, you've got to think about what you're thinking about.
[time=1650] And if you spend all day awfulizing, you're going to have an awful attitude at the dinner table.
[time=1655] If you spend the day rejoicing in the Lord, people are going to flock to be around you.
[time=1660] Jesus said, my peace I give to you,
[time=1666] not as the world give I unto you, but my peace will be with you always.
[time=1671] We set our mind on Christ and we're taking control of what behavioral scientists call our self talk.
[time=1678] The things that you tell me are one thing, the things that I tell me are another.
[time=1682] And I don't have to take what you think, but if I think it, then it has control of my life.
[time=1688] So we have to think about what we think about.
[time=1691] Second Corinthians, same author, the Apostle Paul wrote, "We take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ." So here's what he's saying.
[time=1701] Stop thinking about your pain and your problems.
[time=1704] Start thinking about God's promises and God's power.
[time=1708] Whatever you think about will be what determines the decisions that you'll make in life.
[time=1712] There's a wonderful old song titled, "Count Your Many Blessings." How many of you know that song?
[time=1719] If you know that song, you may be like me.
[time=1723] I love the message, the tune's a little dated for me.
[time=1728] And I don't sing anyway.
[time=1730] But let me quote part of it for you.
[time=1732] When upon's life billows, you are tempest tossed.
[time=1737] When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost.
[time=1740] Count your blessings, name them one by one, and you will be surprised what the Lord has done.
[time=1749] Are you ever burdened with a heavy load of care?
[time=1753] Does the crossing heavy you are called to bear?
[time=1756] Count your blessings, name them one by one, and you will be surprised at what God has done.
[time=1762] When you look at others and their lands in gold,
[time=1768] think that Christ has promised you his wealth untold.
[time=1772] Count your blessings, name them one by one.
[time=1775] One final quote.
[time=1776] So amid the conflicts whether great or small do not be discouraged, God is over all.
[time=1785] Now a secular songwriter shortened all this down to this statement, don't worry, be happy.
[time=1792] He said, couldn't you have said that nine weeks ago and we'd be done?
[time=1797] R-E-S-T, we'll cover most of T next week.
[time=1803] It's trust the Lord through it all.
[time=1806] But I want to read you what he said.
[time=1808] Paul said, I rejoice, what a surprise.
[time=1813] I rejoice greatly in the Lord that at last you have renewed your concern for me.
[time=1821] Indeed, you had been concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it.
[time=1826] I'm not saying this because I'm in need for I have learned to be content, whatever the circumstances, I know what it's like to be in need and I know what it's like to have plenty.
[time=1837] I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.
[time=1848] I can do everything through him who gives me strength.
[time=1852] What Paul said is, I trust the Lord and he also made this his thank you letter.
[time=1861] What we piece together from what we've learned biographically in this book, that Paul was in Rome and prison.
[time=1867] Philippi was 800 miles away and a guy by the name of Epaphroditist walked to Paul to bring him what we would call a love offering that the church had collected and Epaphroditist was delivering it.
[time=1880] And Paul said, I can live in want, I can live in abundance.
[time=1885] Thank you for your generosity, but either way I'm content.
[time=1891] Why?
[time=1892] Because I do it through him who gives me the strength.
[time=1896] Rest.
[time=1899] R E S T.
[time=1903] Rejoice in the Lord.
[time=1904] Express your heart to God.
[time=1906] Set your mind on Christ.
[time=1908] Trust the Lord through it all.
[time=1910] Would you pray with me?
[time=1911] God, we're thankful that your voice is so clear as we read the pages of scripture.
[time=1916] It's so profound.
[time=1918] It's served the world for 2,000 years.
[time=1922] So simple as child understands it.
[time=1925] It is marvelous grace that you have poured upon us.
[time=1930] And we thank you.
[time=1932] [AMEN] Before I take to the floor, I just wanna leave you with one final question.
[time=1940] Do you have Christ in your life?
[time=1944] We love it that you come here on weekend services.
[time=1948] We welcome you to the picnic and not any activity that will strengthen your family.
[time=1953] But well, most of all, we don't have anything really to offer you except for Jesus.
[time=1959] And if you have Jesus, Paul would say, you have it all.
[time=1965] If you don't have Jesus, you don't have anything.
[time=1970] Anything that's gonna last beyond your days and your days are numbered, so are mine.
[time=1976] God said that we should ask him to give us wisdom to order our days.
[time=1981] But you can have more days.
[time=1983] You can have a re-contract negotiation.
[time=1986] God's put an offer on the table.
[time=1988] The table is this.
[time=1990] If you will believe the care and control of your life to me, I will be your savior and give you a home in heaven.
[time=1998] I wanna invite you to pray today to begin that walk with Christ.
[time=2003] Lord Jesus, I ask you to take over my life.
[time=2010] I ask you to take control of my life.
[time=2013] I need forgiveness, but I also need a purpose.
[time=2019] I now call my purpose to follow you, amen.
