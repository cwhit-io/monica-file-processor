[time=0] You know, a lot of us wake up in the morning, maybe for some of us every morning, and the
[time=8] day rolls out in front of us.
[time=10] We think about all that we have to do, how it lines up with our priorities, our responsibilities,
[time=18] trying to make the right decisions, and we say to ourselves, "I got to figure this out."
[time=24] And we have one of these.
[time=25] You know, we've got one of these things.
[time=30] And we have news feeds that tell us just what happened.
[time=34] We have phoned pings that tell us what's about to happen, and we have those fit bits
[time=41] that tell us what should be happening.
[time=43] How many got their 10,000 steps in, anyway?
[time=49] But you know, as Christians, we need to know what's in this.
[time=54] And somehow we have to merge all the time we spend with this, with this, because everything
[time=62] in this book, the Bible, is the enduring truth of God.
[time=67] It transcends millions of lives, people living in thousands of places over centuries of time.
[time=78] It tells us who God is, it tells us who we are, tells us what we should be.
[time=86] So everything we need is here, sounds easy, doesn't it?
[time=91] But it's not.
[time=94] Sometimes there's a disconnect, and I talk to people, I've been teaching the Bible for a long time, and you'll have people say, "I just don't quite understand it.
[time=102] It doesn't relate to me." It sounds so archaic.
[time=108] That's when I say you've got to study.
[time=110] You've got to understand.
[time=112] You've got to study it.
[time=113] You don't learn these things just through osmosis.
[time=117] Just because it's in English doesn't mean you're going to understand everything that's there.
[time=125] Understanding differences is a real thing.
[time=129] It's a discipline, and we come across it all the time.
[time=135] We have to understand people of other cultures, people from other lands.
[time=141] It's always difficult to communicate when there's those types of barriers, isn't there?
[time=145] But we learn.
[time=149] It can be tempting to import our more modern notions of the words that are in the Bible
[time=157] because they're in English.
[time=163] Instead of understanding the audience to whom the New Testament was written and understanding
[time=170] how they saw it, and better yet what did the author mean when he said what he said?
[time=178] Just because it's in English doesn't mean we automatically understand it.
[time=185] There's nuances, and we need to get in there and study it, and we're going to look at some
[time=191] today.
[time=192] Now, have you ever noticed how his believers were always vitally interested in the will
[time=198] of God?
[time=200] We seem to say, "I'm interested in the will of God.
[time=204] What is it?
[time=205] I need to know the will of God for my life." And sometimes we're looking for the big picture, and the little things just pass us by every day.
[time=215] We miss all the little wills of God, because another word for will of God is the desire
[time=221] of God.
[time=222] What is the desire of God for you?
[time=226] What does he desire to see you do?
[time=229] Well, there's a myriad of things, and we walk by him all the time.
[time=237] There's all kinds of people he wants us to impact, but we just float on by.
[time=244] There's all types of times where he would say, "Talk to that person or sign up for that or do this because I have you there for a purpose and we sort of miss it because we're looking for this big W will of God and we miss all the little W's that are in front of
[time=260] us every day." This morning we're going to look at one aspect within the scope of God's will.
[time=270] It's an admonishment clearly laid out for us in Scripture, and if we pay attention to it, it will greatly affect our lives, and hopefully many lives around us.
[time=280] But before we do that, I want us to take a little trip, not to Egypt, but close.
[time=286] We're going to go to Ephesus.
[time=289] It's on the far side of the Mediterranean, on the east side.
[time=294] Ephesus was the largest city, third largest city in the Roman world at the time that Paul
[time=300] wrote.
[time=301] It was officially exceeded by Alexandria down in Egypt and Rome itself.
[time=306] They both had about a million population.
[time=309] Ephesus had about 500,000.
[time=313] It was a big city.
[time=318] It was known for one of the largest temples in the world, and I might add banks.
[time=322] The temples held a lot of money, so they were the banks in that day as well.
[time=327] One of the biggest banks and temples in the world was right there in Ephesus.
[time=332] It was called the Temple of Artemis, or as the Romans called their Diana.
[time=339] People from around the world would go there and worship Artemis or Diana, and the size
[time=348] and the grandeur of that building alone gained the reputation of being one of the seven wonders
[time=355] of the world in antiquity.
[time=360] And according to a multitude of historians, all types of historians, when you start studying the land at the city of Ephesus, it was a dark place.
[time=372] It was full of mysticism.
[time=376] It was from the far east came in there.
[time=378] That was called the Near East, and they had magic.
[time=382] It wasn't uncommon for a butcher to go hire a curse on his fellow competitive butchers.
[time=392] You had that type of world going on.
[time=393] You were afraid of curses.
[time=395] You were afraid of demons.
[time=398] There were the dark arts proliferated Ephesus.
[time=403] And even the Bible talks about it, if you recall in Acts, after Paul had a big evangelistic
[time=409] campaign, a whole bunch of people came to Christ, and it said that those followers gathered
[time=416] up all their paraphernalia, all their magic paraphernalia, their sorcery, all of these,
[time=422] they put them together and they had a big fire.
[time=424] And it said that the value came to so many Cisteria, but today in our economy, that would
[time=431] be $4 million worth of stuff.
[time=436] That's a big pile.
[time=439] That's a lot of magic paraphernalia.
[time=443] That's a lot of people, and it was a great missionary effort on Paul's part.
[time=450] And this upset a lot of people, it upset the silversmiths, it was affecting their economy.
[time=457] All of a sudden, no one's buying the amulets.
[time=459] No one's buying little Diana statues, and they were mad.
[time=466] And they took Paul to the Colosseum, they wanted to kill him.
[time=471] And the authorities stepped in and stopped that.
[time=478] Most of Paul's life as a follower of Christ, he traveled.
[time=483] Some scholars believe he walked between 12 and 15,000 miles in his time.
[time=490] That's a lot of steps.
[time=491] You'd go through a few Fitbits with that, wouldn't you?
[time=494] I'd be having to fit, or a bit, or something.
[time=497] I don't think I'd make it that far.
[time=501] 15,000 miles that dude walked.
[time=505] But he spent a large portion of time in Ephesus about two and a half years, and he spent a lot of time, maybe a year or so, in Corinth, and he would go between Corinth and Ephesus,
[time=516] either across the water in a boat or up around Mesopotamia and come down.
[time=521] But he spent a lot of time in that area.
[time=522] Why?
[time=523] Because it was the crossroads of good and evil.
[time=529] There were things happening in Ephesus that permeated the entire Roman world, and by the
[time=535] end of the first century, they even moved to headquarters there, and Domitian was reigning
[time=541] from Ephesus.
[time=547] As I said earlier, I'd like to review one aspect within the scope of God's will, and
[time=553] it's something that we overlook or take granted.
[time=557] And that is this, we are to be good.
[time=560] And you go, "Okay, Rod, you brought me all the way out here.
[time=564] I had to get up.
[time=565] I had to get dressed.
[time=566] I'd come to church for you to tell me to be good.
[time=567] I've heard that all my life.
[time=570] Johnny be good.
[time=571] We even have songs about it.
[time=572] We sing about it.
[time=573] We talk about be good.
[time=574] Be good.
[time=576] Actually, what we're going to be looking at this morning is do good, do good, but we need
[time=585] to put some context to it." I'd like to look at this specific verse.
[time=593] In Ephesians 2-10, it says this, "For we are God's handiwork.
[time=601] We are God's handiwork created in Christ Jesus to do good works which God prepared
[time=612] in advance for us to do." You want to know the will of God?
[time=618] Do good works.
[time=620] What's that mean?
[time=623] To fully appreciate the verse, I want to put it into context with the two preceding verses.
[time=628] And you know this by heart, Ephesians 2-8-9, "For it is by grace, you have been saved
[time=635] through faith, and this not of yourselves.
[time=639] It is the gift of God, not by works, so no end can boast."
[time=647] We know that.
[time=648] We hang our salvation on that verse.
[time=653] But often we isolate it and we don't read that third part.
[time=662] The primary key word in this passage is saved.
[time=665] The Greek word is so-so.
[time=667] It's much like Shalom in Hebrew.
[time=672] Saved.
[time=673] We are saved.
[time=675] We lose some of it.
[time=676] Saved sounds archaic.
[time=677] You go up to someone, "Are you saved?" And they look at, "What are you talking about?" And we hear slurs that Jesus saves and they put whatever.
[time=688] And it's lost some of its edge.
[time=690] People don't understand why because in many ways we don't think we need saving.
[time=698] So there are some presuppositions as believers that we need to hang on to.
[time=703] And everyone here, if you call yourself a believer, you need to know the presuppositions of what you believe.
[time=709] And I'll give you the first one.
[time=710] It's very easy.
[time=711] There is a God.
[time=715] That's a must.
[time=718] You can't go anywhere without that, right?
[time=720] Isn't that number one on our presuppositions?
[time=724] We have to believe that there is a God.
[time=726] A God exists.
[time=730] The second one, "God created us in His image to fellowship with Him." The garden shows us that.
[time=736] The third one.
[time=737] If you wrote some down on my own, you can find your own, figure it out, but I'll give
[time=743] you what I wrote down.
[time=746] Because of sin, willful disobedience, that fellowship was broken and the entire world changed into the fallen state we find ourselves in now.
[time=755] The fourth one.
[time=756] God has always wanted a people, a people of His own, and He's made efforts to achieve
[time=762] that.
[time=763] Five, it took some time for man to develop, and by the time David and Solomon came along, abstract thought finally began.
[time=772] Prior to that, there wasn't a lot of abstracts, I was sort of uggabugge just straightforward.
[time=777] Even the Hebrew language is pretty block, you know, it's just sort of boom, it sits there.
[time=782] The Greek language is much more fluent, it's much more abstract.
[time=786] We can discuss things, much clearer in the Greek language.
[time=796] We have human bodies, okay, that's a given, okay, that's a presupposition.
[time=802] We have to identify as humans anyway, although I think there's some people going around saying they identify as, they're called furbies or something, they identify as anyway.
[time=814] But we need to presupposition that even though we have human bodies, there's something more,
[time=820] there's something supernatural, it's soullish, we call it the spiritual part of man.
[time=825] The next one is that very soul or spirit, that is the essence of man, and that's the
[time=831] part that will live forever and communicate with God.
[time=835] But number eight is this, the spirit was cut off with sin, and in order to have the relationship
[time=841] God wants, we have to do that in a spiritual context.
[time=847] Well, that brings about number nine, man needs redemption in order to restore that fellowship
[time=854] with man.
[time=860] Number ten, God saw that need and He did something about it.
[time=864] 11, God came to us in the form of Jesus Christ, lived here in order to show us how to live
[time=870] and then died and resurrected as an atonement for our sins.
[time=875] Number twelve, when we receive Christ as Savior, the spirit portion of our being is quickened
[time=883] and made alive and connected to God and the regeneration process begins.
[time=891] Number thirteen, part of the restorative process is being salt and light to the world and join
[time=899] God in being a blessing to others.
[time=901] Now, those are just things that are wrote down.
[time=903] You need to understand what your presuppositions are.
[time=907] They should be very similar to those.
[time=912] It's what you anchor your life in.
[time=914] Someone looks at you.
[time=915] What do you believe?
[time=916] You better know what you believe.
[time=920] In one, the Bible sums up that we believe that God is and what He's the reorder of those
[time=928] that diligently seek Him.
[time=933] That should be our mantra.
[time=936] In Galatians 4, 4 through 7, we read, "But when the time had fully come, God sent His
[time=942] Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those under the law that we might
[time=948] receive the adoption to sonship.
[time=952] As you are sons, God set the spirit of His Son into our hearts so we can say, "Abba, Father."
[time=961] Very important verse.
[time=964] Jesus came into the world in which salvation was the universal and deepest desire in the
[time=972] hearts of men.
[time=975] The Roman historian Seneca, he put it this way, "The world was looking towards salvation."
[time=983] Samuel Angus in his book, The Mystery, Religions and Christianity, he said that the two centuries preceding the Christian era had been a period of uninterrupted misery.
[time=995] Religion was rapidly changing, you see.
[time=997] It wasn't a case of the men becoming so depraved that they abandoned their gods, but the gods
[time=1003] were becoming so depraved that they abandoned man.
[time=1010] And just before Christ came, we saw the pantheon start to fall apart, Zeus, the rest of them,
[time=1017] they were clowns, they were immoral.
[time=1022] How could you believe anything they say?
[time=1027] And they weren't believing it anymore.
[time=1029] They were going to the mystery religion, some were going to Judaism.
[time=1034] They wanted something solid that they could stand on.
[time=1039] And that's when God sent His Son into the world because everyone was looking for salvation.
[time=1046] Any ruler who could bring any peace to a city or a land, they called Him Savior.
[time=1052] They were so desperate.
[time=1053] Even if it looked like you were going to be a new sheriff in town, they called you Savior.
[time=1058] They called Augustus Mundes Salvador, you know, the Savior of the world.
[time=1063] And Jesus came in and said, "I am the Savior of the world." He had to fight.
[time=1067] Jesus had to fight a lot of things.
[time=1070] You know, Nike, the little swoosh we have.
[time=1073] Nikeos, Nike, was a goddess.
[time=1077] She was a goddess of victory.
[time=1082] That's why Nike, the shoe company, borrowed the name and the swoosh.
[time=1085] And angels, when she looked like a little angel, and people worshiped Nikeos because she would
[time=1094] bring victory in the courts, victory in war, victory in the Olympic games.
[time=1101] But interesting, one day Jesus is looking over everything and He says, "In this world you will have fibblis.
[time=1107] In this world you will have pressure.
[time=1109] In this world you will have problems." But fear not.
[time=1112] And He says two Greek words, "Nikeos cosmos.
[time=1117] I am the Nike of the world." Can I hear an amen to that?
[time=1123] It's not the shoe company, there should be Jesus' shoes.
[time=1129] Maybe we could start a company, Jesus' shoes, I've got Jesus' shoes, walk in his shoes.
[time=1133] That's it.
[time=1134] Maybe get in there somewhere.
[time=1137] "Nikeos cosmos," He says, "I am the Nike of the world.
[time=1142] I am the Savior, not a justice.
[time=1149] I am the Savior." The second key word is grace, chorus.
[time=1156] Paul had a preaching ministry in Ephesus, he saw miraculous things happen, all kinds of miracles were going on there because he was in the middle of the battle.
[time=1166] And we know there was a battle because in chapter 6 of Ephesus, one of my favorite chapters, it's the armor of God.
[time=1172] And he talks all about the armor, he says, "Put it on." And you know when he first starts, he says, "Put on the armor of God," and he uses a rather mundane word called enduo.
[time=1183] And what that means is you just sort of put it on.
[time=1185] It's like sitting at home in your pajamas and someone knocks at the door and says, "Oh, you better put on your robe, we have company." Just put it on.
[time=1195] Then Paul says, after put on the armor of God, he says, "Okay, but you know we don't
[time=1202] war against flesh and blood, we war against principalities and powers and he goes on with
[time=1208] this whole list of scary stuff, mystical, otherworldly things that we are involved
[time=1216] with daily and we don't even know about it." And he says, "Therefore," and in the English it says, "Put on the armor of God again." And we go, "Oh, okay, not that." No, you know what he says in the Greek?
[time=1228] He changes the word.
[time=1229] He doesn't use enduo.
[time=1230] He says, "Cada lambam, labano." And that is a military term and there's tenses there.
[time=1238] And the tense is basically to translate it.
[time=1240] He's saying, "Look, bend over, pick up the armor, put it on and keep it on."
[time=1247] Whoa.
[time=1249] Whole different thing this time.
[time=1251] Why?
[time=1252] Because he just told us about the world we're living in, that it's evil and we need to
[time=1259] be prepared and we need to have that armor on.
[time=1266] Everyone was looking for salvation.
[time=1268] Well, God sees us.
[time=1269] That's grace.
[time=1270] Grace is a key word here.
[time=1273] What is grace?
[time=1274] Well, we use words like unmerited favor, you know, that's fine.
[time=1277] We sing songs about grace.
[time=1280] We talk about grace, but I like to think of grace as being God sees us.
[time=1287] He sees us.
[time=1289] The magnificent God of the universe sees you.
[time=1293] He sees me.
[time=1295] And we have his favor.
[time=1297] That is grace.
[time=1301] He sees us.
[time=1302] The third key word in the passage is faith, pistis.
[time=1307] The words through faith speak of the instrument or means whereby the center avails himself
[time=1314] of this salvation, which God offers by his grace.
[time=1318] One expositor says, "Paul never says through the faith." There's no article there.
[time=1323] He's not saying you're saved through the faith.
[time=1325] Faith doesn't save us.
[time=1328] Grace saves us.
[time=1330] The blood of Jesus saves us.
[time=1333] Our faith is accepting that.
[time=1335] Our faith is believing that.
[time=1337] That's the vehicle in which we acquire salvation.
[time=1343] We apprehend God's grace by face.
[time=1350] Now let's put it all in context.
[time=1354] The premise of this passage is found historically in the Mediterranean culture of reciprocity.
[time=1361] It existed in around Ephesus, in fact, throughout the whole Roman world.
[time=1366] It was a patronage society.
[time=1369] This is key.
[time=1372] When this Bible was written, when Paul were writing these words, he was writing to people that lived in a patronage society, a benefactor society.
[time=1381] There were halves.
[time=1382] Very few mostly have nots.
[time=1388] One-two-thousandth of a percent of the world population were senators.
[time=1394] They were the wealthiest.
[time=1397] One-tenth of one percent of the world's population were equestrians, called so because they could
[time=1404] own horses.
[time=1408] Everyone else were plebeians or plebs, poor.
[time=1415] You had to work every day to have enough to eat for the next day.
[time=1419] Everyone in the world, 99 percent.
[time=1423] And everyone depended upon a benefactor for their livelihood.
[time=1430] These benefactors would give gifts.
[time=1435] They would do things.
[time=1436] And you, in turn, had to respond with thankfulness and boy them up.
[time=1444] It was common to have a benefactor.
[time=1448] The client owed his loyalty to these guys.
[time=1453] And above all else, you were to be thankful for a client not to reciprocate with thanks
[time=1460] was an utmost social offense and disgrace.
[time=1463] Listen to this passage.
[time=1466] See if this jumps into context.
[time=1468] When Jesus had finished saying all this to the people who were listening, he entered Capernaum.
[time=1474] There was a centurion servant whose master valued highly.
[time=1479] He was sick and about to die.
[time=1481] The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to Jesus asking him to come and heal his servant.
[time=1488] When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, "Jesus, this man deserves to have you do this because he loves our nation, has built our synagogue."
[time=1499] And you go, "Hold it, what's up?" Jews singing the praise of Romans, a soldier, an occupier, a centurion, no less.
[time=1511] What is going on?
[time=1514] That's unheard of.
[time=1515] Especially in Capernaum that was up in Galilee.
[time=1517] That's where the sakari was.
[time=1518] That's where all of the zealots were.
[time=1520] They were killing Romans left and right.
[time=1523] Rome occupied Jerusalem.
[time=1526] Most Jews thought God abandoned them because there were foreigners in their midst.
[time=1531] They were all around the temple.
[time=1532] Get the Romans out of here.
[time=1535] So why are these guys going to Jesus saying, "Oh, please, you've got to help this guy.
[time=1540] He's awesome.
[time=1541] He's helped us.
[time=1542] He built us a synagogue.
[time=1544] He was what?
[time=1546] Their benefactor.
[time=1551] They had no choice.
[time=1552] They have to give thanks to this guy.
[time=1554] They have to build him up.
[time=1556] They have to praise him." It's an unwritten law.
[time=1563] Do you ever wonder why that story was in there?
[time=1569] In the Greco-Roman world, there was an intricate system of patrons and benefactors.
[time=1574] The unmerited favor, now get this, this is a system that everyone knew.
[time=1579] Paul borrowed these words that we read in Ephesians.
[time=1581] He borrowed them from a secular context.
[time=1585] He didn't make up the word grace or saved or faith.
[time=1591] Paul didn't make those words up.
[time=1593] He borrowed them to communicate to us what was going on.
[time=1598] Because in that society, Charis, that unmerited favor, that a benefactor would show you, they
[time=1606] called it grace, Charis.
[time=1611] And when you received it and you went on and participated and started thanking him and did your part of the deal, that was called "pistus" or "faith."
[time=1623] So Paul says, "Look, by God's grace, who is the big benefactor, God.
[time=1632] By His grace, you are saved through pistus, through faith, just like what's going on
[time=1640] all around us in that culture." He took something everyone knew and experienced daily and he said, "God is your benefactor.
[time=1651] You need to be thankful to Him.
[time=1654] You owe it all to Him." It was a moral category gratitude.
[time=1661] You ever wonder, you know, Seneca, again, the historian, he was a contemporary of Paul.
[time=1670] He was pretty ashamed, but he was the secretary of the narrow.
[time=1673] He wasn't real proud of that, but anyway, he said this about benefaction and thankfulness.
[time=1679] He said, "Nothing is more disgraceful than the fact that we do not know either how to
[time=1685] give or receive benefits." He denounced in gratitude by saying homicide, that's murders, tyrants, thieves, adulterers,
[time=1695] robbers, sacrilegious men, traitors, there will always be.
[time=1700] But worse than all of these is the crime of ingratitude.
[time=1703] Now he's a contemporary of Paul and he wrote that.
[time=1708] So is it any wonder that in Luke 17, Jesus asked, "We're not all ten cleansed?
[time=1716] Where are the other nine?" Has no one returned to give praise to God except this foreigner?
[time=1722] And when you read the language there, when you get into the tenses and you really get it in the mood of what's being written there, Jesus is more or less saying, "Were there
[time=1732] not ten of you guys that stood by me here a few minutes ago and were cured of this dreadful
[time=1739] disease?" Where'd you go?
[time=1745] Anyone with your gift with no spark of thankfulness except for this foreigner?
[time=1751] See, that was a reciprocating culture.
[time=1757] Jesus expected that they would come back and say, "Thanks." And he would say, "Thank God." But they didn't.
[time=1766] So back to our three verses together.
[time=1768] When we put these three verses together, there seems to be a little confusing, a little bit of what they, I guess William Barkley called it, "The Pauline Paradox," because all of
[time=1779] a sudden you have Paul saying, "Look, your good works are nothing but polluted rags.
[time=1785] We're not saved by good works." And yet he says, "God has foreordained you to do good works."
[time=1795] So which is it?
[time=1798] Where it is by grace, you are saved through faith, this not from yourselves, it's the gift of God, not by works that no one can boast, for we are God's handiwork created in Christ
[time=1809] Jesus to do good works.
[time=1811] Now when he says that to do good works, he uses a Greek word "epi," which means go into.
[time=1818] And there's two words for going in in the Greek New Testament.
[time=1822] One is called "en," which means you walk into a sphere of something.
[time=1827] But this word "epi," it's like a gate.
[time=1831] And he's saying, "I want you to go into good works."
[time=1837] Jesus used it when he healed the woman with the issue of blood.
[time=1840] He says, "Your sins have been forgiven, you are completely healed and used to tense, permanently healed." Now he says, "Go in, grace to her." He means open the door and go into your whole new life of being whole.
[time=1857] And what he's saying here, Paul is saying here, look, you have been saved by grace through faith.
[time=1862] Nothing you've done about it, but now I want you to open that gate and you need to walk through and join God in what he for ordained you to do, and that's heal this world.
[time=1877] We are to be participants in healing this world through good works that's being neighborly,
[time=1885] that's being kind, that's going, stopping at half the people we walk by, that's joining
[time=1891] associations that help, that's getting involved with neighbors, letting the community know that as believers we care about people, too.
[time=1901] God has wanted us to help be salt and light in the dark world.
[time=1913] So God wants an army of men and women whose hearts have been changed and transformed by
[time=1924] the Holy Spirit, changing the world for good and being his representatives.
[time=1932] Salvation is the constant reminder for us to do good works.
[time=1940] He says, I want you to live a life worthy, and there's about nine verses that I could, I don't have time, I could read them to you.
[time=1948] And they interchange from do good or be good and walk worthy.
[time=1955] And there's numerous verses, you know them, where he says, I want you to walk worthy, let us do good to all people, share with others, be about doing good and healing, you know,
[time=1967] on and on it goes.
[time=1969] And this word, walk worthy is from two Greek words, peripatale oxios, and basically peripatale
[time=1975] means walking about, it was a Jewish term, and it meant your whole life was a walk, was
[time=1981] a journey.
[time=1982] And on your journey of walking peripatale, you're to oxios, that's where we get the
[time=1988] word axel, you're to balance it out, you're to take the salvation that God has given you and start working like you've been saved, put a little something in this basket, not
[time=1998] to earn your salvation, but because you should, because if God saved you, you need to be about
[time=2004] serving him, balance the load, peripatale oxios.
[time=2011] So here we are today, we've looked at the past and we see how most of the world used
[time=2017] to live, and you know much of the world still lives that way, only 17% of the world's population
[time=2025] is middle class.
[time=2030] See we walk in here and we're in a nice sanctuary, a nice building, we, most of us here are middle class, some a little lower, some much higher, and that's fine.
[time=2043] Not so when Jesus was here, not so when Paul was here, they needed a savior, they needed
[time=2049] a benefactor, and it fights against us to be so busy with this and so busy with our occupations
[time=2058] and our middle class values that we don't hear God, we're distracted by all this.
[time=2067] I want you to think back to a time that you were desperate, I mean really desperate, it
[time=2076] could have been health, it could be relational, it could be financial.
[time=2085] What did you think of grace at that point?
[time=2089] Did you cry out to God at that point?
[time=2093] Were you talking to God quite a bit in those days?
[time=2097] Sure, a Christian in Paul's era, every day he had to look for food, so yes he was talking
[time=2109] to God quite often.
[time=2111] Our bellies don't tell us that, therefore our brains get lazy, but we need to keep our
[time=2121] salvation on our frontlets, just like the Jews were, the phylacteries.
[time=2128] We have to keep what God has done for us, his grace in the front of our mind so we will
[time=2134] be his servants and we will live for him daily.
[time=2142] The truth is we have to work harder at appreciating God's gift to us.
[time=2150] We need to peel away all those accruitments of our lifestyle and examine our soul.
[time=2158] How thankful are we really?
[time=2164] What does being born again mean to us?
[time=2171] Today more than ever, we would hear Paul pray for us much like he did for those in Colossae,
[time=2179] which was a neighboring city to Ephesus.
[time=2184] Long ago he said this, and I believe he's saying it for us today.
[time=2190] He prays that we would be filled with the knowledge of God's desire through all the
[time=2197] wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives, so that we would live a life-worthy parapetioaxios
[time=2208] of the Lord and please him in every way bearing fruit in every good work growing in the epinosis,
[time=2222] the experiential knowledge of God.
[time=2227] Is that our desire this morning?
[time=2231] I know I need a wake-up call.
[time=2234] When I get up in the morning, I need to say, "Okay, God, thank you.
[time=2240] What can I do for you today?" Let's pray.
[time=2246] Father, we thank you.
[time=2250] We thank you for your matchless gift.
[time=2256] We thank you for your grace that's been poured out on the cross.
[time=2263] We thank you that you have allowed us by faith to accept that gift and to be saved.
[time=2271] Saved eternally and saved while we're here.
[time=2278] Saved from the evil about us.
[time=2281] Saved so we can have a life of fellowship with you and with others.
[time=2288] So Father, help us to keep this on the front of our mind.
[time=2294] Help us see Jesus in everyday life.
[time=2301] Help us help you in repairing this world until Jesus comes.
[time=2308] And we pray this in His name, amen.
