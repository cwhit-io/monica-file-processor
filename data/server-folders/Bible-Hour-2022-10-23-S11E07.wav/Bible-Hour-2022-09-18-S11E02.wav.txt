[time=0] Good morning.
[time=4] Please open your Bibles to the Gospel of Matthew.
[time=8] I know we're in Mark, but Mark only gives us two verses regarding the temptation of Jesus.
[time=20] But Matthew gives us some more details that we need.
[time=27] For those of you who are new, we started a new series in the Gospel of Mark, titled "Jesus,
[time=34] Servant and Savior." And the title of the series comes from the main verse of the Gospel of Matthew, which is Mark 1045.
[time=45] For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.
[time=52] So Jesus is servant, but He's also the Savior.
[time=58] Sometimes we see how He teaches us how to serve.
[time=61] At the end of the book, we'll see how He dies on the cross for our sins.
[time=66] Today, He actually gives us an example of how to overcome temptation.
[time=73] And again, Mark only gives us two verses, verses 12 and 13 of chapter 1, which reads
[time=82] "The Spirit immediately drove Him out into the wilderness, and He was in the wilderness
[time=88] forty days being tempted by Satan, and He was with the wild animals and the angels were
[time=94] ministering to Him." We learn very quickly that you can be tempted anywhere at any time.
[time=106] And really, it doesn't matter who you are.
[time=108] I mean, if Jesus is tempted, imagine how much more we will be tempted.
[time=116] So the first thing that we need to understand is not if we are tempted, the question is what we do when we are tempted.
[time=127] And here, Mark actually helps us because he says, "Being tempted by Satan."
[time=133] The way that's phrased in the original Greek is, "He was on Him every single day."
[time=141] This was not, oh, forty days of fasting, and then Jesus, no, no, no.
[time=147] He was being constantly, constantly being tempted by Satan during these forty days.
[time=160] Now turn to Gospel of Matthew, and Matthew gives us some important details.
[time=166] The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones
[time=172] to become loaves of bread." The first thing we need to learn is that Satan attacks our bodies.
[time=180] Notice, please, the language Satan is using if you are the Son of God.
[time=186] What is Satan actually doing?
[time=189] He is questioning Jesus' divinity, and he is tempting Jesus to prove his divinity by
[time=197] turning stones into bread.
[time=201] Now if you would have witnessed that event, if someone would turn bread or stone into
[time=207] bread, would you believe?
[time=210] Maybe some of you would.
[time=212] Some of you would say, "Well, that's nice, David Copperfield."
[time=219] But again, please notice what Satan is doing here, because we need to understand who our
[time=225] enemy is, my dear brothers and sisters.
[time=228] Only number one is Satan, who's not just trying to hurt us, he's trying to kill us.
[time=236] And the way he does it is through temptation.
[time=244] He's telling Jesus, "Jesus, prove your divinity by turning stones into bread."
[time=252] And remember, this was an everyday occurrence for Jesus.
[time=259] One scholar puts it like this, "We imagine the wilderness temptation as three isolated events scattered over a 40-day period.
[time=267] In reality, Jesus' time of testing was non-stop, the devil tempted Jesus for 40 days."
[time=277] See, if you do this, you will prove that you are God.
[time=285] But Jesus answers by quoting from the Old Testament, the Deuteronomy chapter 8 verse
[time=292] 3, "Jesus says, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'" See what Satan basically telling Jesus, and what Satan is telling us today, "Hey, guys, get the word of God, just go with what you feel." Hey, 40 days of not eating, I mean, bread will feel really good right now, right?
[time=314] Isn't that what's happening in our society today?
[time=316] Hey, forget about what the Bible says, just go with what you feel, right?
[time=322] Just go with what you identify, just go with whatever, fill in the blank.
[time=326] We cannot do that, my dear brothers and sisters, because we need to look at what the Bible
[time=332] says, because that's what Jesus does.
[time=337] Jesus does not forget the word.
[time=339] He quotes from the whole word, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word
[time=345] that comes from the mouth of God." Another lesson we need to learn, my dear brothers and sisters, is that Satan attacks us at our weakest point.
[time=358] Why is Satan attacking Jesus with food?
[time=362] Well, he just fasted for 40 days.
[time=366] Someone once said, "If you're hungry, that's how Satan operates.
[time=370] If you're hungry, he will offer you his food.
[time=373] If you're thirsty, he will offer you his drink, and if you're tired, he will offer you his bed." But with every temptation, what we need to do is to say, "No, the Bible says resist
[time=386] the devil, and he will flee from you." We also learned that our bodies are weak.
[time=394] Jesus himself said to the disciples, "Watch and pray they may not enter into temptation.
[time=399] The Spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is." I mean, I don't know about you, but the flesh is weak.
[time=406] I mean, Jesus got hungry after 40 days.
[time=412] I get hungry after 40 minutes of nigh eating, but I need to know what my weakest point is.
[time=421] Where is my weakness?
[time=422] And that's what I need to shore up and strengthen.
[time=425] Well, we need to remember the first thing that Satan attacks our bodies.
[time=431] That's the first thing.
[time=432] Second, Satan attacks our will, verses 5 through 7, "Then the devil took him to the holy city
[time=440] and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, 'If you are the son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, he will command his angels concerning you, and on their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.
[time=455] Jesus said to him, 'Again it is written, you shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
[time=462] Same words if you are the son of God.
[time=468] Now what should surprise us is that Satan actually now is quoting Scripture, or maybe should not surprise us.
[time=476] Does the devil know the Bible?
[time=478] Yes.
[time=479] The Bible says even the demons believe when they shudder.
[time=482] It's not about head knowledge, but notice, please, that he's quoting from Scripture.
[time=488] He's actually quoting from Psalm 91.
[time=492] Those words are true, but he's taking them out of the context.
[time=497] Remember, when you take a passage, a text out of its proper context, it becomes a pretext.
[time=504] You can actually make the Bible say whatever you want, if you take it outside of its context.
[time=509] We all know people, people who do that.
[time=513] He's quoting from Psalm 91, but listen to the Psalm 91 context.
[time=519] Listen how Psalm 91 starts, "He who dwells in the shelter of the most high will abide
[time=526] in the shadow of the Almighty." Did you see who that is for, who that promises for?
[time=532] The promise is for the one who dwells in the shelter of the most high.
[time=540] What Satan wanted to do is to take Jesus out from under that shelter, and wanted Jesus
[time=546] to commit a grave sin by going against the will of the Father.
[time=554] And again, Jesus responds, like he did before, by quoting Scripture, the economy is 616.
[time=561] Again it is written, "You shall not put the Lord your God to the test." For those of you who have been to Israel, probably remember the Temple Mount.
[time=571] This is the highest point, because it says the pinnacle of the temple, always the highest point.
[time=576] As you know, the temple was not that high, but the highest point on the Temple Mount was
[time=582] probably from here, all the way down to the first century road, which actually you can
[time=588] see today, 300 feet.
[time=592] Would you consider that a miracle if someone survives a 300 foot fall?
[time=598] Yeah.
[time=600] But again, Satan wants Jesus to come from under the shadow of the Almighty, and to act
[time=608] in accordance to Satan's will, not God's will.
[time=614] My dear brothers and sisters, Satan will attack our bodies, he will attack our will, and he
[time=621] will attack our worship.
[time=626] Again the devil took him to a very high mountain, verses 8-10, and showed him all the kingdoms
[time=632] of the world and their glory, and he said to him, "All this I will give you, if you'll
[time=638] fall down and worship me." Then again Jesus said, "Be gone, Satan, for it is written, you shall worship the Lord, your God, and him only shall you serve." First of all, Satan is the father of lies.
[time=656] Those things that he promised were not his to give, first of all.
[time=660] That's very much like Satan, he promised you things that he cannot deliver.
[time=666] He is promising something, first of all that does not belong to him.
[time=671] But notice please the price, if you'll fall down and worship me.
[time=677] Instant exaltation, that's what Satan promises.
[time=680] Jesus, you can have it all right now.
[time=683] No crucifixion, no shedding of blood, instant gratification, instant exaltation.
[time=694] That's what Satan is promising.
[time=696] Jesus, and again Jesus, quotes from the pteronomy 6-13, "You shall worship the Lord, your God,
[time=702] and him only you will serve."
[time=709] How does temptation work?
[time=713] James 1, 13, James writes, "Let no one say when he is tempted I am being tempted by God.
[time=721] For God cannot be tempted with evil and he himself tempts no one.
[time=725] But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire.
[time=731] Then desire when he is conceived gives word to sin and sin when it's fully grown brings forth." Now, did you catch the spiral?
[time=741] Temptation, sin, what's next?
[time=745] Death.
[time=747] Temptation, sin, death.
[time=749] And I want to emphasize here, my dear brothers and sisters, do not feel guilty when you're
[time=758] tempted.
[time=759] Sometimes we feel guilty, oh, I cannot believe I got tempted with that thought.
[time=765] Temptation is not sin.
[time=769] Jesus got tempted.
[time=771] The question is not, if you're tempted, the question is what are you going to do with that temptation?
[time=778] And James says, "If you yield to that temptation, then you commit sin and the wages of sin is
[time=785] death." James is not the first one who said that.
[time=788] We see that in the entire scripture.
[time=792] So do not feel guilty if you're tempted.
[time=798] Temptation is just Satan's tool through which he's trying to commit you the sin.
[time=803] He's trying to make you to commit the sin.
[time=807] Temptation is not sin, it is the bait that's trying to hook you into sin.
[time=814] We have, I assume, we have fishermen here, people who like to fish, anybody else like to waste time, okay, they are great.
[time=821] Oh, no, I love fishing.
[time=825] I've been fishing one time.
[time=829] The most boring five hours of my life, a deacon took me fishing, I think he was trying to
[time=837] make me quit the church or something, I don't know.
[time=841] But when you fish, you've got to put, what do you got to put in the hook?
[time=847] Bait, huh?
[time=848] Bait.
[time=849] I don't know, if you, when you drive through maybe you see that sign, live bait, huh?
[time=854] Isn't that what Satan does with us?
[time=859] It's live bait in front of us.
[time=862] But see, the bait is not going to kill you, it's the hook that's going to kill you.
[time=868] It's the, that's why you've got to identify the temptation, but it's not, the temptation is just trying to kill, to bring you to death.
[time=875] It's, temptation is not the sin.
[time=879] It's what you do with that temptation, either you're going to give into that temptation or you're going to resist that temptation.
[time=891] In his book, "Knowing God's Secrets," John Hunter tells when he was young, he, he wanted
[time=897] to live for God and he was distressed by the problem of temptation because he was always tempted and he, he, he, he, he was saying to himself, oh, I, I want to get older because
[time=907] when I'm older, I'm not going to have to deal with temptation anymore like this.
[time=912] And then here's, here's what he writes.
[time=915] I imagine that when I grew older, I would assume a tangible form of holy respect, respectability,
[time=922] which would solve all problems of temptation.
[time=925] And eventually, I would arrive at a state where I'd be free from temptation.
[time=932] As the years had passed by, he says, I learned two basic realities.
[time=937] One temptation was just as strong and subtle as he was years ago.
[time=946] Temptation has nothing to do with age.
[time=949] Second, that he was just as weak as he ever was and just prone to failure.
[time=956] That's why my dear brothers and sisters, we have to make that song that we just sing a reality and to say to God all the time, I need you, oh, I need you.
[time=966] How often every hour I need you.
[time=972] When you think you don't need him, that's when you need him the most.
[time=976] And we cannot resist temptation unless we have God on our side.
[time=983] My dear brothers and sisters, Satan will attack our body, he'll attack our will, he'll
[time=989] attack our worship, so we need to learn from Jesus how to overcome that temptation.
[time=996] First of all, through the Word of God.
[time=999] Notice, please what happens.
[time=1001] Each time Jesus is tempted, he says, it is written.
[time=1007] It is written.
[time=1009] I like the King James Version in James 1, 12, "Blessed is the man that endures temptation.
[time=1016] For when he is tried, he shall receive the count of life which the Lord has promised to them the love, him.
[time=1023] Blessed is the one that endures temptation, not who gives in to temptation, but who endures.
[time=1030] That means there is some resistance that we need to put.
[time=1036] Resist the devil and he will flee from you.
[time=1039] What can we show this week from resisting the devil?
[time=1043] Can we at least show a scraped knee or something?
[time=1046] At least, hey, we tried or we don't know the joy of resisting temptation because we just
[time=1052] give in all the time.
[time=1057] How much of the word do we know?
[time=1060] Jesus said it is written, it is written, it is written.
[time=1063] My dear brothers and sisters, do we know what is written?
[time=1067] So when the tempter comes, can we say it is written, do we know what is written?
[time=1072] That is the question.
[time=1073] That is why it is important not just to, you know, hearing the word and coming to church one hour a week, listen, will not do.
[time=1082] One hour a week will not do it.
[time=1087] We have to be in the word all the time reading every day, meditating on it, memorizing it.
[time=1095] It has got to be part of our DNA, who we are.
[time=1098] So when I am tempted, I need to be able to say right away.
[time=1101] I know it is the same, it is written, it is written, it is written.
[time=1115] There is a way out, 1 Corinthians 10, 13.
[time=1120] We need to understand that temptation can be overcome.
[time=1124] Paul writes to the Corinthians, "No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man, that God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with
[time=1135] the temptation he will also provide a way of escape that you may be able to endure it." In other words, we can never say, "Oh, the temptation was too great." The peer pressure was too great, you know, everybody did it, you know, I had to do it.
[time=1148] No, no, no.
[time=1149] Listen, the Bible says, "Every time we are tempted, there is a way out." Every time.
[time=1155] Every time there is a way out.
[time=1159] We need to know what the Bible says, so we can say it is written.
[time=1162] Second of all, the second way to resist temptation, to overcome temptation, is to prayer.
[time=1167] Jesus himself says to the disciples, "Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation.
[time=1173] The Spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
[time=1179] Someone wise one said, "It is very hard to lose your footing when you're on your knees."
[time=1185] Think about that.
[time=1187] It is very hard to lose your footing when you're on your knees.
[time=1193] Prayer is a great way to overcome temptation.
[time=1198] Think about Jesus.
[time=1199] If Jesus had a life of prayer and he was the Son of God, how much more do we need to have
[time=1205] a life of prayer?
[time=1207] Think about how the Gospels describe Jesus and Matthew 12, Matthew 14, "After you dismissed
[time=1214] the crowds, you end up on the mountain by himself to pray." I said, "Tabias, I don't like to pray in the evening because I'm falling asleep fine." Hey, Mark 1.35, listen, rising very early in the morning, you can do it in the morning.
[time=1232] You're not a morning person, "Okay, pray in the evening." Actually, you know, Paul says, "Pray continually, pray continually, play all the time."
[time=1241] Jesus would withdraw to desolate places and pray.
[time=1246] And if Jesus needs prayer, how much more do I need to pray?
[time=1252] And by the way, temptation is not late breaking news in heaven.
[time=1258] God knows what you're going through.
[time=1260] Hebrews 4, 15, and 16, "For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize around weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin."
[time=1272] Let us then, with confidence, draw near to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
[time=1279] Jesus knows what we're going through.
[time=1283] He's been tempted like us in everything, yet without sin.
[time=1289] So we can go to the throne of grace.
[time=1293] Even if we have sinned, we can come to the throne of grace and we find forgiveness.
[time=1298] Isn't that great news?
[time=1299] But while we need to learn my dearest brothers and sisters how to experience the joy of victory,
[time=1307] the joy of victory, because there is joy in victory.
[time=1311] And we can resist temptation.
[time=1312] We can overcome temptation by the word of God through prayer and, lastly, by fleeing.
[time=1319] Everything the best thing you can do is to leave the room.
[time=1324] Paul writes to young Timothy, flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith,
[time=1330] love and peace along with those who call on the name from a pure heart.
[time=1336] When you're tempted, sometimes the best thing you can do is to run.
[time=1341] Now look back and someone says when you run, do not leave a forwarding address.
[time=1351] Sometimes the best thing you can do is to leave your job.
[time=1360] If your job puts you in a compromising situation all the time and always makes you sin, you
[time=1369] might have to leave that job.
[time=1370] I had a guy who told me that one time.
[time=1373] But what can I do?
[time=1377] My question is what's more important to you, your relationship with God, your relationship with your wife or your job.
[time=1384] If you put yourself in a compromising situation day after day, day after day, please don't say God put me there because probably he didn't.
[time=1393] Sometimes you might have to flee and leave, that might be the best thing you can do.
[time=1402] Not like the guy, I know it's kind of bad before lunch but it's okay.
[time=1411] Thank God Chick-fil-A is closed today.
[time=1417] Sometimes we need to flee.
[time=1418] Not like this guy who said okay I want to lose some pounds and actually he did a very good thing.
[time=1424] He said I'm not even going to drive by my favorite bakery.
[time=1426] I'm going to actually go around and not even go by it because I don't want to be tempted.
[time=1432] He did the right thing.
[time=1434] Until one day he shows up at work with this big humongous coffee cake and his buddies
[time=1441] at work were making fun of him.
[time=1443] Hey I thought you were on a diet, what happened?
[time=1447] And he said oh no this is a very special cake.
[time=1452] I accidentally drove by my bakery accidentally and I felt he was no accident so I prayed
[time=1463] to the Lord.
[time=1464] I said Lord if you want me to have one of those delicious coffee cakes let there be
[time=1470] a parking spot open right in front.
[time=1476] Now listen, if you want to go ahead and sing but don't bring God into it, I'm being serious.
[time=1486] Don't bring God into it.
[time=1488] No say oh God told me, listen he didn't tell you that but this guy literally used God's
[time=1495] name in vain because that's what happens when we do that by the way.
[time=1501] So again I prayed, Lord if you want me to have one of those delicious coffee cakes let there be a parking spot open right in front and sure enough, a time around the block.
[time=1516] There was an open spot.
[time=1525] A sermon title comes from a poem written in 1895 by Joseph Malins.
[time=1535] The sermon title is a fence or an ambulance and give us something to think about how we're
[time=1543] going to deal with temptation.
[time=1548] Some of us will put a fence.
[time=1551] Some of us will just call the ambulance.
[time=1556] Here's what the poem says, it was a dangerous cliff as they freely confessed though to walk
[time=1563] near its crest was so pleasant but over its terrible edge there had slipped a duke and
[time=1570] full many a peasant.
[time=1572] So the people said something would have to be done but their projects did not add all tally some said put a fence around the edge of the cliff some an ambulance down in the valley but the cry for the ambulance carried the day.
[time=1588] For it spread through the neighboring city a fence may be useful or not it is true but each heart became full of pity for those who slipped over the dangerous cliff and the dwellers
[time=1599] in highway and alley gave pounce and gave pence not to put up a fence but an ambulance down in the valley.
[time=1607] For the cliff is alright if you're careful they said and if folks even slip and are dropping
[time=1613] it isn't the slipping that hurts them so much as the shark down below and they're stopping.
[time=1620] So day after day as these mishaps occurred quick forth with those rescuers Sally to pick
[time=1626] up the victims who fell off the cliff with an ambulance down in the valley.
[time=1632] Even an old sage remarked it's a marvel to me that people give far more attention to
[time=1640] repairing results than to stopping the cause when the much better aim at prevention let
[time=1648] us stop at its source all this mischief cried he calm neighbors and friends let us rally
[time=1654] if the cliff we will fence will almost dispense with the ambulance down in the valley better
[time=1662] guide them when young then reclaim them when old for the voice of true wisdom is calling
[time=1671] to rescue the fallen is good but it's best to prevent other people from falling better
[time=1677] close up the source of temptation and crime then deliver from dungeon or galley better
[time=1683] put a strong fence around the top of the cliff than an ambulance down in the valley.
[time=1691] So my dear brothers and sisters that's what I want to call us to this morning to think about what fences do we need to build in today's language it's called boundaries what boundaries
[time=1703] do we need to put in our lives and again think about your weakest point think about where
[time=1711] Satan attacks you the most because where he attacks you he might not attack me and the other way around if your problem is drinking don't buy alcohol at home and when you when
[time=1726] you drink beer with someone who can keep you accountable that's not my problem someone tried to give me worm Romanian beer when I was 13 I never had the desire to drink alcohol
[time=1737] ever in my life so that's not my issue maybe your problem is is food if your problem is
[time=1749] food when you go out of here do not go to an all you can eat buffet by the way I think
[time=1757] the all you can eat buffet is an invention of the devil in my humble but correct opinion
[time=1763] it's okay it's okay one of the best thing that happened in Warsaw Indiana when the Golden Corral got closed if your problem is the computer put a filter on your computer guard
[time=1783] yourself against looking at pornography if your parents probably it would be wise for
[time=1789] you to put a computer in the living room not in the bedroom by the way their parents who
[time=1796] are doing for doing this well so learn from other parents what they do I was reading in
[time=1804] preaching magazine I know what you're thinking there's a preaching magazine look if there's
[time=1810] a bow and hunter magazine why not a preaching magazine I mean how do you think I get my my sermons come on I key that key preaching magazine listen internet pornography is big
[time=1823] business every week more than 2,500 new pornographic websites come online sadly the largest group
[time=1830] of yours is between 12 and 17 and the average age of a first exposure to internet pornography
[time=1836] is 11 by the way that detail is in preaching magazine because do you think pastors have
[time=1844] a problem with that yeah we all know probably tragic events of pastors who their ministry
[time=1852] is killed because they did not practice that accountability and they they they were authoritarian
[time=1862] and charismatic and whatever but nobody kept them accountable one of the worst things you can do as a pastor is just to surround yourselves with yes men who don't keep you accountable for what you're doing a lot of pastors fall because of immorality because of pride because
[time=1882] they don't have boundaries they don't have fences they don't have people who keep them accountable don't be like that you don't have to be a pastor by the way some people tell
[time=1893] me what have you is but David David sinned and God forgave him yes God forgave him but
[time=1899] the consequences of sin remained David paid the penalty in his family he paid the penalty
[time=1906] in the kingdom he paid the penalty for for his sin if you want an example of purity uncompromising
[time=1913] life Joseph that's the example for me his boss's wife came day after day day after day
[time=1921] and he said no no no how can I do such a wicked thing and sin against God for the men here
[time=1935] I have a verse for me for the book of Job Job teaches us to make a covenant he says I have
[time=1942] made a covenant with my eyes how then should I gaze at a virgin think about what happened
[time=1950] to the men in our church if we made that covenant and by the way men those I'm talking
[time=1958] to those of you who are married there is no reason to look at a woman except from the neck up imagine how what would happen with men who are so disciplined that they would
[time=1971] make a covenant to their eyes and I'm just gonna look at a woman from the neck up there's no business for me to look at her from the neck down unless she's my wife see that's
[time=1983] a fence that's a boundary but I gotta do it I gotta do it myself and you gotta do it for
[time=1991] yourself I don't know what fences you have to build okay I don't know you know yourself
[time=1997] you know what the weakest point is where Satan attacks you but you need to build that fence
[time=2004] up at the top of the cliff and you know what there is joy in victory you're gonna close
[time=2011] with Romans chapter 14 verses 7 verse 17 it says for the kingdom of God is not a matter
[time=2020] of eating and drinking but righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Spirit that's what God
[time=2029] wants us to have see that's what we're missing when we give into temptation we're missing and we don't get the thing that the Holy Spirit gives us righteousness peace and joy there
[time=2040] is good news there's good news and God wants us to experience that victory amen let's stand
[time=2052] together and sing that refrain that we actually sang before the sermon just in a different
[time=2058] arrangement that we we need Jesus we cannot do this apart from him
[time=2088] [MUSIC - 113 seconds]
[time=2205] Dear Father, we thank you for Jesus.
[time=2213] We thank you for the Holy Spirit who guides us and fills us and helps us to say no to sin, helps us to resist the devil.
[time=2224] Thank you for the righteousness, peace, and joy we have through the Holy Spirit as a result of Jesus being our Lord and Savior.
[time=2233] Forgive us for the many times when we said yes to temptation.
[time=2238] Forgive us for the many times instead of putting up fences and boundaries we called the ambulance.
[time=2248] We thank you for your grace and for your forgiveness.
[time=2250] Thank you for the fact that when we do fall, you are there to pick us up and we thank you for your grace and mercy.
[time=2257] Forgive us for the many times when we can't even show a scraped knee in the battle against sin.
[time=2265] Help us to be filled with your Holy Spirit to be men and women of prayer.
[time=2272] Men and women who love your word, who learn it, who read it, who memorize it, who meditate on it and who live it out in such a way that your name is glorified, your church will be edified, and many people will come to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[time=2292] In his name we pray, amen.
[time=2294] Please be seated.
