[time=0] Please open your Bibles to Mark chapter 1.
[time=3] We continue our series through Gospel of Mark.
[time=6] It's a special day.
[time=7] My family is here.
[time=9] The entire family is here with me today, so grateful.
[time=13] They don't know it, but it's my birthday today.
[time=15] (congregation laughing) It's my spiritual birthday, actually.
[time=21] October 2nd, 1983, I gave my life to the Lord, and so I'm 39 years old.
[time=29] I know sometimes I act like I'm two, but I am 39.
[time=34] I will give you more details about how I came to Christ because actually the evangelist that preached that day preached from the Gospel of Mark, chapter 5.
[time=45] So when we get there, hopefully I get to share that with you.
[time=50] For those of you who are visiting, we're doing a series in the Gospel of Mark titled, "Jesus, Servant and Savior," and the title comes from the key verse, which is Mark 10.45, "For even the Son of the Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many." And today we're talking about taking Jesus' home so appropriate because while these parents have done by bringing the children to be dedicated to the Lord, they wanna say, "Jesus, we want you to come in our home, and we need you to be the Lord of our home." Isn't that beautiful?
[time=86] That's what we're doing through the baby dedication.
[time=90] And in this particular episode, Peter is taking Jesus' home because there is an issue at his house as we will see.
[time=100] But the passage that Chip already read from Mark chapter one
[time=106] sets the story and tells us it happens in Capernaum.
[time=111] I mentioned to you in previous Sundays that Capernaum, which is a village by the Sea of Galilee, becomes the headquarters of Jesus' ministry when he's around the Sea of Galilee, which will be for the first eight chapters in the Gospel of Mark.
[time=131] A small town of 1,500 people from our perspective will be a small town, right?
[time=140] But big enough that he had a Roman garrison in it, remember, we'll see later there's a Roman garrison there because again, we know that Jesus will deal
[time=155] with Roman soldiers in the town.
[time=159] You know about the Centurion, right?
[time=161] That's where it's coming from.
[time=162] Unfortunately, what's happening here is that sometimes
[time=169] when people discover archeological, important archeological places, they build churches on top and that's exactly what happened here.
[time=178] So the round building that you see there, that's actually a church built on top of what scholars believe it's Peter's house.
[time=190] And in the Gospel of Mark, sometimes it will say that Jesus was in the house.
[time=198] You never specify it's whose house, why?
[time=201] Well, because everybody knows he was Peter's house.
[time=204] So it seems that Peter's house becomes the headquarters of Jesus' ministry in Capernaum.
[time=211] And a very important place says that the first thing that Jesus does here, they went into Capernaum and immediately on the Sabbath, he entered the synagogue.
[time=223] This is the remnants of the synagogue that you'll see in Capernaum.
[time=231] This is not the synagogue during Jesus' time.
[time=234] This is the rebuilt synagogue from about the fourth century or so.
[time=239] But actually, if you go there, you'll see underneath, they're actually the remnants, archeological remnants of the first century synagogue that basically Jesus visited.
[time=251] Basically, the synagogue is just a place of meeting.
[time=255] That's what you're supposed to be.
[time=257] If you notice all around, you actually have things that look like benches, basically places where people sat.
[time=265] See, in the temple, there were no places to sit.
[time=269] Why?
[time=270] Because in the temple, priests were always doing a work.
[time=273] They always said, there's no sitting arrangement in the temple, in the tabernacle or the temple.
[time=280] But in the synagogue, there were places to sit because that's how people did.
[time=283] They went to sit and then someone would be teaching.
[time=289] What is interesting that they invite Jesus to teach.
[time=293] Again, there would be someone in the synagogue who was supposed to teach, but usually they would have other people from other towns preaching.
[time=301] In this case, it looks like Jesus is given the task of teaching.
[time=306] But it says here, something very interesting is that Jesus was teaching with authority.
[time=316] You would say, well, why didn't everybody teach with authority?
[time=320] If they're teaching the word, isn't that what they're doing?
[time=323] They were astonished that he's teaching for he taught them as one who had authority, not as the scribes.
[time=330] So why did the scribes, the teachers of the law, lose their authority?
[time=336] Well, first of all, they lost their authority because they liked to be called the rabbi.
[time=340] And Jesus says, don't call yourselves a rabbi.
[time=345] See, the word rabbi comes from the word in Hebrew, it means great one.
[time=349] Who's the great one?
[time=351] God is the great one.
[time=354] Yeah, 1st Chronicles 16, 25, Psalm 41, 48, 1, 96, 4, 1, 45, 3, for great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.
[time=364] But the rabbis like to be called rabbis, or great one.
[time=369] You know, rabbis so and so, rabbis so and so.
[time=372] And by doing that, they lost their authority.
[time=375] The other reason that they lost their authority is because they turned the synagogue into something it was never meant to be.
[time=383] The synagogue was supposed to be a miniature temple in the sense that this is where work for God was supposed to be done, teaching of the word.
[time=393] But what they have done over the years, they have turned the synagogue into places for bar mitzvahs, bat mitzvahs, luncheons, social events, banquents in honor of so and so, carnivals.
[time=408] And they turned up the synagogue into something it was never meant to be.
[time=412] And when they did that, they lost their authority.
[time=418] The synagogue, by the way, did not appear in the 1st century.
[time=423] The synagogue appeared actually all over the world after 587 when the temple was destroyed by the Babylonians and the Jews were dispersed all over the world.
[time=434] So because they are dispersed all over the world, where are they gonna worship?
[time=437] Well, they had to build synagogues, and that's why they did.
[time=440] And the synagogue simply means a place of meeting.
[time=443] And that's why you can go anywhere in this world and you'll find a synagogue.
[time=449] But the problem is they turned the synagogue into something it was never meant to be.
[time=454] And these tribes lost their authority.
[time=457] And we see them in the Gospel of Mark always being against Jesus.
[time=462] They're never with Jesus.
[time=464] And whenever you're against Jesus, you're gonna lose your authority.
[time=468] Mark chapter two, verse seven, describes accused Jesus of blasphemy.
[time=473] Chapter two, 16, they judge Jesus because he spends too much time with sinful people.
[time=479] In Mark three, 22, they suggest that Jesus is demon possessed.
[time=483] In Mark seven, five, describes condemned Jesus' disciples because they don't follow the ritual of washing their hands.
[time=489] In Mark 11, 18, describes our plotting how to kill Jesus.
[time=494] And in Mark 14 and 15, we see the scribes present at Jesus' arrest, mocking, and crucifixion.
[time=503] My dear brothers and sisters, I wanna argue that we too will lose our authority if we turn the church into something it was never meant to be.
[time=511] The church is supposed to be a place where believers gather and where the Word of God is preached.
[time=519] And when we're seeing God's praises, then we have to stick to what the Bible says no matter what.
[time=525] I read an article about a big church in America in Houston.
[time=530] I'm not gonna tell you the name Lakewood Church.
[time=532] I'm not gonna tell you the pastor or Joel Osteen.
[time=536] I read an article that said, preached to 25,000 people each week and sin is not on the menu.
[time=545] Osteen said that his goal is to give people a boost for the week, quote, "I think for years, "there's been a lot of hell fire and damnation.
[time=553] "You go to church to figure out what you're doing wrong "and you're feeling bad, like you're not going to make it." Joel Osteen said, "We believe in focusing "on the goodness of God." Actually, I remember the first time I heard Joel Osteen on TV, I was watching.
[time=569] And I tell you, I was mesmerized.
[time=572] And I said, "This sounds good." And then I kept listening and I kept listening like this sounds too good.
[time=581] See, when you only present the good news without the bad news, you don't understand what the good news is.
[time=588] But the good news is that Jesus came to die for sinners such as us.
[time=594] Remember, Jesus didn't come to make bad people good.
[time=601] He came to make dead people alive.
[time=604] And we need to understand there were nothing but sinners in need of a savior and we need to surrender our life to him.
[time=611] When we make the church into something it was never meant to be, we become like the scribes and we lose our authority.
[time=618] We see Jesus teaches with authority and Jesus is exercising evil spirits with authority.
[time=627] We see his authority, not just in his teaching, we see his authority and his actions.
[time=633] And interestingly in the synagogue, there are people, there's this person that has an unclean spirit.
[time=644] Imagine Jesus teaching and all of a sudden there's a commotion and immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit and he cried out, "What have you to do with us, "Jesus of Nazareth?
[time=657] "Have you come to destroy us?
[time=659] "I know who you are, the holy one of God." But Jesus rebuked him saying, "Be silent and come out of him." And the unclean spirit convulsing him and crying out to the loud voice came out of him and they were all amazed.
[time=676] Five times in the gospel of Mark, we will see Jesus encountering people that are possessed by evil spirits.
[time=685] What's interesting again, the demon possessed man goes to the synagogue.
[time=690] Can the devil make his presence in a church?
[time=696] The answer is yes.
[time=699] Remember, 1 Peter 5, 8, be sober minded, be watchful.
[time=702] You're adversary, the devil prowls around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.
[time=708] And he's probably not gonna go through the bar, he's gonna go to church.
[time=712] And we also learn here that the evil spirits know who Jesus is.
[time=715] Notice they recognize that Jesus is God by calling him the holy one of God, Job, David, Isaiah.
[time=723] They all use the word holy one to refer to God.
[time=727] They recognize Jesus' divinity.
[time=731] Think about that in the gospel of Mark.
[time=734] The evil spirits are faster to recognize Jesus' divinity than people are.
[time=741] Even disciples, they don't get it.
[time=743] It takes them a long time to get it.
[time=745] And here the evil spirits know who Jesus is.
[time=748] That he is God.
[time=750] And listen to my dear brothers and sisters, we need to get that as a foundation of, and we need to know who Jesus is.
[time=757] And that he is God, 1 John 5, 20.
[time=760] We know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we may know him who is true, and we are in him who is true in his Son Jesus Christ.
[time=769] He is the true God and eternal life.
[time=772] My dear brothers and sisters, this is foundational for what we believe.
[time=777] We need to be aware of false religions that teach a different view of Jesus.
[time=783] Like Mormonism, the Mormons believe that Jesus is the result of a physical union between God the Father and God the Holy Spirit.
[time=794] They further profess that Jesus is the elder brother of Lucifer, Jesus and Satan are brothers.
[time=801] He was, Jesus was sinful and imperfect, but over time he earned his own salvation and exalted himself to the level of God.
[time=811] That's false, that's a false religion.
[time=814] We need to know who Jesus is.
[time=817] The Jehovah Witnesses believe that Jesus was a spirit creature, Michael the Archangel who was created by God and became Messiah at his baptism.
[time=826] You see that Jesus was not from everlasting to everlasting.
[time=829] He becomes Messiah at his baptism, that is false.
[time=833] And we need to know that when we interact with people, they teach that Jesus was and it always will be beneath Jehovah and Christ and God are not co-equal.
[time=844] And yet evil spirits know who Jesus is.
[time=847] As A.W. Tozer said, the devil is a better theologian than any of us and he's still the devil.
[time=854] See, 'cause it's not just a matter of intellectual faith.
[time=859] James tells us the demons believe and they what?
[time=862] They shattered, they tremble.
[time=865] So it's not just a matter of intellectual knowledge.
[time=868] It has to be a matter of surrender with the whole life.
[time=871] As some people say, some people will miss heaven by 18 inches from here to here.
[time=876] They know it here, but they never give their life to Christ.
[time=880] And by the way, nowhere in the Bible will you see, oh, you give your life to, give your, invite Jesus in your heart.
[time=887] No, you know what the Bible says?
[time=888] Repent and believe, repent and believe.
[time=891] That's what God wants.
[time=893] Repent and believe.
[time=895] That's how salvation comes.
[time=898] It's very interesting 'cause these guys know a lot and in their question is something very beautiful.
[time=904] Have you come to destroy us?
[time=905] What's the answer?
[time=906] Yes, yes.
[time=910] We know that from 1 John 3.8, if you take notes, this is a verse that you want to have in your arsenal.
[time=917] 1 John 3.8, why did Jesus come?
[time=921] The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.
[time=926] 1 John 3.8, it is clear why Jesus came.
[time=931] And we see that by exercising evil spirits.
[time=935] He came to destroy them.
[time=938] Some people ask, well, Tiberius, why don't we see more exorcisms today?
[time=947] Why don't we see more people being possessed by the devil or things like that?
[time=953] Well, first of all, very important, something very important happened was the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ and the defeat of Satan 'cause that's very important.
[time=964] And David Garland, I'll read your quote from David Garland in a second.
[time=970] But also I believe that the reason we don't see this a lot more is because apparently the devil doesn't need to do that, he can fool us with easy little things like sex, materialism, power and prestige.
[time=982] He doesn't need all these other deceitful things.
[time=988] He does it outwardly and people buy it without having to be demon possessed.
[time=993] But David Garland writes, he's a professor of New Testament and I quote, "Mark's account of an ordinary exorcism shows that something extraordinary is happening.
[time=1002] Satan is being restrained until his final defeat.
[time=1006] The advent of the kingdom of God is the beginning of the end of the throne, them of Satan.
[time=1011] And one he not feared the molesting unclean spirits if God is acting in one's behalf.
[time=1017] The New Testament contains a dramatic drop in the fear of demons when compared with Atelierger from this era.
[time=1024] It results from faith that God has won a decisive victory over Satan in the cross and the more powerful one who baptizes who the Holy Spirit protects his followers." So we see Jesus, one who teaches his authority, he exercises spirits with authority and then he heals with authority.
[time=1046] The sermon title comes from this episode, taking Jesus home, Peter, knows there's a problem at home and he takes Jesus home.
[time=1054] That's what we are told here that Jesus goes
[time=1060] into the house.
[time=1062] Immediately he left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John.
[time=1067] Now Simon's mother-in-law lay ill with a fever and immediately they told him about her and he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up and the fever left her and she began to serve them.
[time=1080] The first thing I want us to do is that Jesus does ministry, it says immediately immediately.
[time=1086] He goes from this place to this place.
[time=1087] It looks like that he has no time to rest and I want to remind you that ministry is always done in a difficult context and sometimes your pastor, I know some of you only see your pastor one hour a week on Sunday morning after he shaved and took a shower and he looks good but you don't see him on day to Saturday and what he's doing during that time.
[time=1112] But I want you to listen to this, the results of this survey that says that a study of over 300 clergy
[time=1123] revealed that 66% of pastors feel lonely and isolated.
[time=1128] Your pastor is human.
[time=1135] When you don't see him on day to Saturday,
[time=1141] he's praying for you, he's studying the word, he visits the sick, he does other things that you probably don't see but think about this, 66% of them feel lonely and isolated, 80% of them feel feelings of futility.
[time=1158] They think, why am I doing this?
[time=1161] It's for nothing.
[time=1162] 90% suffer stress because of problems with parishioners.
[time=1167] Now you, you guys are saints.
[time=1172] I'm talking about other churches.
[time=1173] But I like what Peter does.
[time=1178] Peter knows there's a problem at home so he brings Jesus home.
[time=1184] And Mark only tells us that she had a fever but Luke uses a very important word when he's talking about what Jesus does.
[time=1195] So in Luke, in chapter, Luke chapter four, when Jesus heals Peter's mother-in-law, the Bible says he rebuked the spirit.
[time=1204] He rebuked, sorry, he rebuked the fever.
[time=1206] And the same word, rebuke, is used in Luke chapter four
[time=1213] when Jesus exercises the demon from the demon possession
[time=1221] and he look 435, says Jesus rebuked him, meaning the spirit saying be silent and come out of him.
[time=1230] And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst, he came out of him having done him no harm.
[time=1236] In Luke 439, in detailing the healing of Peter's mother-in-law, he writes, and he stood over her and rebuked the fever and he left her.
[time=1244] Same word.
[time=1245] I'm not saying Peter's mother-in-law was demon possessed.
[time=1249] I don't know, some of you think about that about your mother-in-law.
[time=1252] Oh, not too soon, mother-in-law jokes, no good, okay.
[time=1257] Here's my point.
[time=1261] It was more than just a fever.
[time=1263] It was just a more, oh, it was just a cold, no.
[time=1267] It was more than that because Jesus has to rebuke it out of Peter's mother-in-law.
[time=1273] But the point of application is this.
[time=1276] If you have a problem at home, if you have someone who's not saved, if you have someone who may be addicted to something, maybe they need spiritual healing, maybe they need physical healing, take Jesus home.
[time=1288] He's the one who can still heal, and he's still the one who still has authority.
[time=1294] So how can we put in practice what we have learned?
[time=1297] The next 10 minutes, I wanna focus on application.
[time=1301] So first of all, appeal to Jesus' authority.
[time=1305] As I said before, is there a problem?
[time=1307] Maybe it's at home, maybe it's at work, where you teach whatever, where you go to school.
[time=1313] If there's a problem, appeal to Jesus' authority.
[time=1318] Pray for people and declare that Jesus can still save, that Jesus can still heal.
[time=1326] Obviously, Peter becomes a great spiritual leader, but he needs to take Jesus, Jesus' home.
[time=1336] Remember, Jesus doesn't just wanna be a guest in your home.
[time=1340] He wants to be your Lord and Savior.
[time=1343] Jesus doesn't just wanna corner of your house.
[time=1347] He wants to be the Lord of your house.
[time=1349] And after you become saved, after you give your life to Christ, and after you experience his blessing and his salvation, you need to appeal, we need to appeal to Jesus' authority all the time.
[time=1363] And after we do that, we need to serve him.
[time=1368] I like what happens here.
[time=1369] Basically, Peter's modern law is presented as a model of servanthood.
[time=1374] He came and took her by the hand, lifted her up, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them.
[time=1381] Immediately, she becomes a servant.
[time=1386] Remember, Jesus, for even the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve.
[time=1393] So can I ask you, how do you serve the Lord?
[time=1398] I'm not talking about Sunday morning.
[time=1402] I'm talking about Monday through Saturday.
[time=1404] How do you serve the Lord?
[time=1406] The Bible says that each of us have at least one gift.
[time=1409] Are we using that gift for his glory Monday through Saturday?
[time=1415] Or maybe you're using his Sunday, that's fine.
[time=1418] But how are you serving the Lord?
[time=1420] If Jesus saved us, we need to respond by serving him,
[time=1426] not like the lady I read about
[time=1432] who was in a course for first aid.
[time=1434] She was taking a course on first aid, and she had it before, and she says, "I have a testimony.
[time=1440] "The other day, in front of my house, "there was an automobile accident, "an old man driving his car, lost control, "and went over the curb, and he hit an oak tree head on.
[time=1453] "He was thrown out into the street, "and she then proceeded to explain all the gross details, "and she then says, "But then I remembered "what I learned in the first aid class.
[time=1465] "I remembered that if I put my head between my knees, "I wouldn't faint."
[time=1475] That's not the kind of Christianity God wants of us.
[time=1479] A lot of us, when we see things like that, we put our head between our knees, so we don't faint.
[time=1485] We don't like feeling uncomfortable, but that's not the Christian God wants of us.
[time=1491] He wants us, people who serve him.
[time=1494] After we are saved, we need to start serving.
[time=1497] I don't know how old you are spiritually.
[time=1503] Think about your birth date spiritually.
[time=1507] How old are you?
[time=1509] Are you still just wanting to be served, or are you actually serving?
[time=1512] Are you using your gift?
[time=1514] Forgot there are many gifts in the Bible, teaching, administration, evangelism, hospitality, giving leadership, helps.
[time=1521] You have at least one gift.
[time=1524] How are you using it for God's glory?
[time=1527] Because he needs to be there.
[time=1529] We need to appeal to his authority, but we need then to start serving after we are saved, and also we need to develop even if theology.
[time=1540] In the Bible we see Jesus healing a lot.
[time=1546] A lot of people were healed.
[time=1548] Did Jesus heal everybody?
[time=1550] No.
[time=1554] Jesus didn't heal everybody.
[time=1556] Have you prayed for people and they were not healed?
[time=1560] I have.
[time=1562] My father passed away earlier this year.
[time=1564] Don't you think we prayed for him?
[time=1567] Oh, we prayed for him.
[time=1569] We prayed for healing.
[time=1571] We prayed, other people prayed in the United States.
[time=1573] People from all over the world prayed for him.
[time=1575] You know what?
[time=1577] God chose not to heal him on this side of heaven.
[time=1581] He's healed now.
[time=1583] No more pain, no more sorrow, no more illness.
[time=1587] But he chose not to heal him for here.
[time=1589] So I need to develop a trusting God, even if he doesn't heal.
[time=1594] Do you have that?
[time=1595] Even if the healing doesn't come.
[time=1599] Can you still trust him?
[time=1602] That's the question.
[time=1602] 'Cause if you don't have that kind of trust, your trust is not in Jesus.
[time=1608] He's in a makeup Jesus.
[time=1610] I wanna close with an illustration about Musa Asaki.
[time=1617] Musa Asaki was the leader in a church in Africa.
[time=1621] Actually, he was a pastor of over, a church of over 2,500 people.
[time=1625] And came to grace to get a degree many years ago.
[time=1629] This is before everybody had a computer.
[time=1632] He didn't even know what a computer was.
[time=1634] But he came and got a doctorate in theology.
[time=1637] And then later decided to go back to his native country where he was the head of over 4,000 churches in his country.
[time=1647] But while he was still here finishing his doctorate, his wife gave birth to their fourth child who was born blind, deaf, and immobile.
[time=1658] The doctor told them that the child would not survive more than a couple of months.
[time=1663] Two years passed by.
[time=1666] He graduated with his doctorate and then they said that we had to make a decision.
[time=1672] Do we go back to Africa where medical care is almost non-existent?
[time=1679] Or do we stay here where we'll have medical care?
[time=1682] They decided to follow God's calling and to go back to their country.
[time=1686] And a few years later Musa came back and told the story about how they changed their prayer
[time=1698] from Lord please heal our daughter to God help us to learn how to live with this outcome.
[time=1706] They had to develop this even if theology.
[time=1711] And then he explains one day when he was gone to visit other churches, seven radical extremists armed to the teeth, knocked at their door.
[time=1723] And when his wife answered, they pushed her in
[time=1730] and asked, where is Musa?
[time=1731] He's not here, his wife replied.
[time=1734] Where's Musa?
[time=1736] He's not here, he's traveling.
[time=1738] Then the line of questioning changed.
[time=1741] Where's your money?
[time=1742] We don't have any.
[time=1743] You're lying, the terrorist said, while they pushed Musa's wife into the bedroom.
[time=1749] And he explains that in a typical situation like that, usually rape and murder would follow.
[time=1757] But the bedroom into which his wife was forced was the bedroom where their daughter was lying.
[time=1764] Remember the daughter who wasn't supposed to live more than two months, remember?
[time=1768] She was 15 now.
[time=1770] But she was still blind, deaf and immobile.
[time=1776] And as the terrorist pushed Musa's wife into the bedroom
[time=1784] saw the girl, I said, what's wrong with her?
[time=1788] Why can't she move?
[time=1789] She cannot.
[time=1790] Why can't she talk?
[time=1793] She cannot.
[time=1794] And then all Musa's wife could do was kneel down and pray.
[time=1799] And the gunman backed away and left.
[time=1806] And when Musa came to tell us the story,
[time=1813] he said this, on that day we learned something.
[time=1818] We don't know why all the reasons, why our daughter is the way she is.
[time=1826] We don't know all the reasons why God allowed that to happen.
[time=1830] But he said, who would have thought in the powerful work
[time=1836] of God that our daughter would be used in God's design to spare the life of my wife?
[time=1843] I know that God has amazing power to do the unbelievable thing,
[time=1852] but he will do it in a way that is for his glory.
[time=1857] Can you have that type of faith?
[time=1860] Do you have that even if theology, even if the healing doesn't come?
[time=1865] Can you trust that God will still do it for his glory?
[time=1871] I hope that you do, because sometimes Jesus will not heal on this side of heaven, but he has his reasons why he doesn't do it.
[time=1881] It could be for a greater purpose that you don't see right now.
[time=1886] Let's stand and sing this song together that was composed by a man who lost his daughters.
[time=1897] And yet, he was able to write it as well with my soul.
[time=1903] He had an even if theology.
[time=1918] When peace like a river attended my way,
[time=1928] when sorrows like sea below's roar,
[time=1936] whatever my lot thou hast thought me to say,
[time=1946] it is well, it is well with my soul,
[time=1956] it is well with my soul,
[time=1967] it is well, it is well with my soul,
[time=1979] though Satan should buffer, no trial should come, let his flesh thou sure as control,
[time=1996] let Christ have regarded my helpless state,
[time=2006] and had shelled his own blood for my soul,
[time=2016] it is well with my soul,
[time=2027] it is well, it is well with my soul,
[time=2038] my sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought,
[time=2049] my sin not in part but the whole,
[time=2056] his mail to the cross, and I bear it no more, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, oh my soul, it is well with my soul,
[time=2087] it is well, it is well with
[time=2094] my soul, and Lord hast the day, when the faith shall be sighed,
[time=2109] my clouds be rolled back as a stroll, the throng shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
[time=2127] even so, it is well with my soul,
[time=2137] it is well,
[time=2143] with my soul,
[time=2149] it is well, it is well with my soul,
[time=2162] dear father we thank you for Jesus, thank you that he took our sin upon himself, thank you that he's still teaching with authority, he's still healing with authority, I pray they will touch our hearts that we will surrender our lives to you, that we will start serving, thank you for the gift you have given us,
[time=2187] help us to put him in practice and to serve you, teach us what it means to have a trust in you even if you don't heal,
[time=2197] even if we get fired, even if we don't get the news that we want,
[time=2205] teach us to be able to say it is well, in Christ's name I pray amen please be seated.
