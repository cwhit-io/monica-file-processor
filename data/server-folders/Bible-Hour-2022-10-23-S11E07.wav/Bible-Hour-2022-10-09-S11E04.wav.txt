[time=0] I am blessed to continue our series in Mark, so if you would please hold up your Bibles
[time=7] to Mark chapter 1 verse 35.
[time=9] Tiberius is leading a men's choir in Chicago this morning.
[time=13] He leads a Romanian church, men's choir.
[time=17] So he is serving there using his gifts and talents.
[time=19] So I am a poor substitute for him, I'm sure.
[time=23] He left me 10 verses that tell two stories with no link between them.
[time=30] So an outline, there was no six T's, five P's, there was no acrostic or something I could have used, I didn't go to seminary to learn those tricks.
[time=37] And so when I speak today, I'm going to make nine observations from the text in my study and you'll see them on the screen.
[time=43] So if you're taking notes or use the Blackhawk app to take notes, that's what you'll see today.
[time=49] I went to a Christian high school in Indianapolis, much like BCS.
[time=54] And I had, for Freshman Bible, a wonderful teacher named Mr. McEwen.
[time=58] Mr. McEwen was Australian and so he had this delightful accent and everything he said sounded wonderful and so it made you pay attention.
[time=65] And one of the things that he taught us in Freshman year was a great tool I've been using ever since I was 14, doing the math that's 26 years, to summarize a passage of Scripture.
[time=75] It's a tool I've used, taught it to my kids, used it in other settings, hopefully you'll find it useful as well.
[time=81] You ask yourself two questions.
[time=84] Question one.
[time=85] Is the hero of the story?
[time=89] Question two.
[time=90] What's the big idea?
[time=91] This is not earth shattering, but these have been really helpful.
[time=94] Question one is not a trick question.
[time=96] The answer is always God.
[time=100] It might be Jesus.
[time=101] It might be the Holy Spirit.
[time=102] It might be the Lord.
[time=103] It is always God.
[time=104] God is the hero of every story in the Bible.
[time=110] Question two is just your first gut reaction to a passage, whatever the Holy Spirit prompts
[time=116] in your heart, whether it's a deep theology, reading of Romans, whether it's a chronology of names, a genealogy list from the gospels, whether it's a historical narrative in the Old Testament.
[time=126] Sometimes you read these passages like what am I supposed to get out of this?
[time=130] That's the big idea, that first thing that strikes you.
[time=133] When I read this passage, I thought the big idea is that Jesus performed miracles to validate
[time=141] his authority and demonstrate his divine nature.
[time=147] This is absolutely true, but that's not the big idea the Lord had for me.
[time=153] On the second read and the third read and fourth read and fifth read, I kept going back to the same part of the passage.
[time=161] The lepers request in verse 40, "If you will, Jesus, you can make me clean."
[time=170] For me, that's the big idea of this passage.
[time=173] This morning, we are going to unpack the truth that we come to Jesus to be made clean.
[time=181] In verse 35, we find Jesus rising early in the morning and leaving for a quiet place to
[time=188] pray.
[time=189] While this does seem to be a regular practice of Jesus, we see it elsewhere in the New Testament.
[time=194] We need to go back and consider verses 21 to 34 to get the full picture.
[time=200] Jesus had just had a very long busy day.
[time=204] He had started his previous morning in the synagogue, Bible says, "Teaching with authority."
[time=210] While teaching, he cast out a demon.
[time=212] Verse 29 tells us that Jesus then went to Peter's house for lunch and while there, healed Peter's sick mother-in-law.
[time=219] And then at sundown, those who were sick or demon-possessed throughout Capernaum were brought to the house for healing.
[time=225] Verse 33 says, "The whole city of Capernaum was at the door watching." Jesus was probably there very late into the night.
[time=234] He had a long day.
[time=238] Yet verse 35 tells us early the next morning, "Before the disciples could relive all the
[time=244] memories of the night before over breakfast, before other neighboring cities and towns could bring their own sick to be healed, Jesus gets up quietly and he leaves and he finds
[time=254] a desolate place to pray." I assume he needed to recharge and reconnect with God the Father.
[time=262] Remember, Jesus has two natures.
[time=264] He is fully God, but he is also fully man.
[time=269] Him being in children's ministry for twelve straight hours, if you'd like to join them
[time=277] now, I'm sure they'd be happy to take you as volunteers.
[time=281] You'd be exhausted.
[time=283] But Jesus had not been corralling toddlers.
[time=286] He had been healing the sick and doing battle with demons for hours and hours.
[time=294] We know Jesus slept in eight, felt pain, wept and had emotions.
[time=298] To be his most effective in ministry, Jesus needed to get away and spend time with God.
[time=305] He needed to be refueled.
[time=308] Now Jesus connects with God the Father on a whole different level than we ever will.
[time=313] But the principle is still true.
[time=315] For us to be most effective in service to the Lord, we need to take care of ourselves,
[time=321] physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[time=325] I know for me, I am not a morning person I never have, I never will be.
[time=330] I would say it's impossible.
[time=332] But my most free and available time is early in the morning.
[time=337] Unfortunately, I don't go to bed on time.
[time=340] I'm a night owl.
[time=341] And so if I try to get up early, I'm tired, I'm grumpy.
[time=346] I don't know if you've ever tried reading your Bible and praying when tired and grumpy.
[time=351] But it does not go well.
[time=353] It is not effective use of time.
[time=355] If we want to be fully available to the Lord, we need to put ourselves in the best posture
[time=361] possible to be fully available.
[time=365] Being tired and grumpy is not my best posture.
[time=371] My challenge for you and for me is to pick a behavior or tendency to change that would enable you to take better care of yourself and be more connected to the Father.
[time=382] Maybe it's getting enough sleep like me.
[time=384] Maybe it's better diet and exercise.
[time=386] Maybe it's regular coffee with an encouraging friend who pours life into you.
[time=392] Maybe it's a daily date with God and prayer.
[time=394] Maybe it's journaling.
[time=395] Maybe it's listening to worship music on the way to and from work.
[time=398] I'm sure something came to mind.
[time=400] Let's commit together to make progress in whatever area the Lord laid upon your heart.
[time=406] That connection with God, the Father, is critical.
[time=411] So Jesus is out praying in a quiet, private place.
[time=414] Meanwhile, back in Capernaum, folks are looking for him.
[time=419] This is not in the Bible, but this is how I imagine the scene goes.
[time=423] Peter sitting at the breakfast table, eating some eggs, here's a knock on the door.
[time=428] It's Tom, next door.
[time=430] Arthritic knees acting up was hoping Jesus could, you know, take care of it.
[time=435] Peter, I don't know where Jesus is, sends him away.
[time=439] Knock on the door.
[time=440] It's Gladys down the street.
[time=442] Her toddler won't put on his sandals, assumes he is possessed by a demon of disobedience.
[time=448] Would love Jesus to do his work.
[time=451] Peter, I don't know where he is.
[time=453] Choose him away.
[time=454] This happens over and over and over again.
[time=457] Peter and the boys, they get exasperated and they go looking for him.
[time=460] Again, not in the Bible.
[time=461] That's just in my head how I see that playing out.
[time=464] So they're out searching.
[time=465] He's in a decent place.
[time=466] So, you know, it's private.
[time=467] They find him.
[time=468] Eventually find him.
[time=470] What happens next I think tells us a lot about Jesus.
[time=473] Verse 38, "And he said to them, 'Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach.
[time=479] They're also.
[time=480] For that is why I came out.' And he went throughout all Galilee preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.
[time=488] This would not have been my response.
[time=492] I would have grumbled, kicked the dirt, and gone back to Capernaum because I have a hard time disappointing people.
[time=499] I have a hard time telling people, 'No, I'm a bit of a people pleaser.'
[time=505] And I would have gone back and kept healing people, whether I liked it or not, whether I had the strength or not.
[time=511] But Jesus was on a mission.
[time=514] Jesus had a purpose.
[time=516] Jesus Christ is not a vending machine.
[time=519] He did not come to dispense miracles at our request.
[time=525] The miracles of Jesus certainly drew the attention of the crowd.
[time=529] They validated his authority as someone special, someone intimately connected to God.
[time=536] But if God had just wanted miracles performed, he could have empowered us.
[time=541] But God knows the heart of man.
[time=543] You see, a person with that kind of power and authority gets an audience.
[time=547] A person with that kind of power and authority gets worship.
[time=551] When handed the microphone, Jesus did not speak of his own personal greatness, like I would be tempted to do.
[time=556] No.
[time=557] Jesus said, 'The kingdom of God is at hand, repent, and believe.'
[time=563] That's how he used his platform.
[time=566] The miracles of Jesus served to validate the authority of his gospel message.
[time=576] I think we see this most clearly in the gospel of Matthew.
[time=581] And he went throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every affliction among the people.
[time=592] So his fame spread throughout all Syria, and they brought him all the sick, those afflicted with various diseases and pains, those oppressed by demons, those having seizures and paralytics,
[time=603] and he healed them.
[time=604] The great crowds followed him from Galilee and the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Judea and from beyond the Jordan.
[time=612] Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him, and he opened his mouth and taught them.
[time=621] What follows next is the sermon on the mountain, the greatest sermon ever preached.
[time=626] All of the miracles and amazing things that Jesus has had done were to tee up the most amazing sermon ever preached.
[time=636] The miracles of Jesus were a means to an end.
[time=638] The miracles validated the authoritative words of Jesus.
[time=642] He starts off blessed are the poor in spirit, blessed are those who mourn, blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness.
[time=651] Jesus did not come to this earth and put on human flesh just to heal the sick and cast out demons.
[time=656] Certainly the Old Testament prophets put those out there as signs for us to identify the coming Messiah.
[time=663] The miracles were meaningful, but the message of Jesus is what would really change lives.
[time=673] Jesus was untying a thousand years, the knots of religion, and helping them see what it
[time=679] really meant to love the Lord, their God, with all their hearts, soul, mind, and strength, what it really meant to obey, what it really meant to be righteous.
[time=689] He wanted to spread his gospel message to anyone who would hear it, Jesus was on a mission.
[time=699] The closing verses of Mark chapter 1 tell of Jesus' interaction with a man suffering
[time=705] from a skin disease.
[time=708] And a leper came to him, imploring him, and kneeling said to him, "If you will, you can
[time=714] make me clean." And with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, "I will be clean."
[time=723] And immediately the leprosy left him and he was made clean.
[time=729] When the Bible talks of leprosy, it isn't just referring to the disease that we know of as leprosy.
[time=736] The Bible uses this as a catch-all for any skin disease.
[time=740] Leviticus 13 discusses several skin conditions under the category of leprosy in very graphic
[time=746] detail, and I do mean graphic detail.
[time=750] It talks about different color rashes causing different afflictions, some with hair, some without.
[time=756] It's all quite disgusting.
[time=757] It's like the Old Testament version of WebMD, that place you go to make sure that thing on your skin isn't serious.
[time=765] The people in those times, they didn't have access to great medicine, they didn't have a great understanding of the human body, and so these mosaic laws relating to skin disease in the Old Testament were partly for their physical protection.
[time=778] God is a gracious God, he knew better.
[time=780] So if someone had a skin disease, a priest would go and examine them.
[time=784] If they found a skin issue as described in Leviticus 13, the person was to be declared unclean.
[time=792] The leprosy person who has the disease shall wear torn clothes and let the hair of his head hang loose, and he shall cover his upper lip and cry out, unclean, unclean.
[time=803] He shall remain unclean as long as he has the disease.
[time=807] He is unclean, he shall live alone, his dwelling shall be outside the camp.
[time=815] Regardless of the medical benefits to our modern ears, this punishment sounds severe.
[time=822] If they had the dress and torn clothes, announce themselves unclean to anyone who came near and live alone outside the camp, all that for a nasty rash.
[time=833] But these Old Testament ceremonial laws declaring things to be clean and unclean aren't about
[time=839] us.
[time=840] They are about God.
[time=843] When the law was given to Moses, the presence of God was traveling with Israel in the desert.
[time=848] They would set up camp surrounding the tabernacle.
[time=851] The tabernacle is the place where God's presence dwelt with them on earth.
[time=857] Yahweh is holy and pure and righteous.
[time=860] An unclean person could not dwell in the same camp as God Almighty.
[time=866] This was a matter of holiness.
[time=870] Sacrificial lambs had to be blemish free.
[time=872] The priest attire was carefully crafted from God's instructions.
[time=876] The ark of the covenant was carried by Poles because it could not be touched by man.
[time=879] There was an intentionality about purity and cleanness.
[time=884] So to be unclean was to be excluded from the camp surrounding the tabernacle containing
[time=891] the presence of God.
[time=893] To be unclean was to be separated from God.
[time=898] But God in His grace and mercy as He so often does provided a path back to cleanliness
[time=904] and purity for those with skin disease.
[time=908] This is fully explained in Leviticus 14, but here's the summary.
[time=914] So a priest would come to you and make sure that the skin condition had cleared up.
[time=917] And if it had, you would bring him two live birds.
[time=922] I apologize to all the birders out there.
[time=925] But one of these birds would be sacrificed.
[time=928] And it's blood mixed with water.
[time=931] The live bird would be dipped in the blood water mixed and then released.
[time=935] Then the priest would take a branch of hyssop, put it in the blood and water, and sprinkle you seven times.
[time=941] And he would declare you ceremonially clean.
[time=949] Now you were able to come back into the camp, but not to your tent.
[time=953] You had to bathe, shave off all your hair, and sleep outside your tent for seven more days.
[time=960] On the seventh day, you shaved and cleaned again.
[time=964] On the eighth day, you would bring lambs without blemish to the priest.
[time=969] The lambs would be sacrificed, and the blood put on your right ear lobe, your right thumb, and your right big toe, symbolically covering you from head to toe, your whole person.
[time=981] In doing these steps, Leviticus 14, 20 tells us, "Thus the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean." Atonement, it's a really key word for us.
[time=994] There was a price to be paid for making someone clean.
[time=1000] For covering over their impurity, the price was blood, the price was death.
[time=1007] The blood of the sacrificed birds sprinkled seven times made the person ceremonially clean, and the blood of the sacrificed lamb placed in the body made atonement for them.
[time=1016] The unclean were made clean by the blood of the animal sacrifice.
[time=1021] Unfortunately, this was temporary.
[time=1024] They could get a skin disease the next year, the next month, the next week, and do it all over again.
[time=1030] Or they could break any of the other moral ceremonial or dietary laws.
[time=1034] The people of Israel weren't sinless.
[time=1037] They would make mistakes, and this would necessitate even more animal sacrifices.
[time=1042] The whole sacrificial system in the Old Testament is built upon the continual need of the unclean
[time=1048] to be made clean again before God.
[time=1051] For sinners to return to right-standing again with God.
[time=1055] For the unrighteous to again be made righteous.
[time=1061] Returning back to our passage in Mark, "I love the faith of the leper.
[time=1066] Jesus, if you will, you can make me clean." I find it interesting that he did not ask for physical healing of his skin disease.
[time=1077] He asked to be made clean.
[time=1081] To be clean meant, he could move back into the city.
[time=1084] To be clean meant, he could worship at the temple.
[time=1087] To be clean meant, he could bring sacrifices to the priest.
[time=1090] To be clean meant he was included again among God's people.
[time=1095] He did not ask for physical healing.
[time=1098] He asked to be in right-standing with God.
[time=1103] It's a simple request with profound insight and profound understanding of Jesus.
[time=1112] This is not post-resurrection Jesus.
[time=1114] This is not post-feeding of the five thousand Jesus.
[time=1117] This is not post-walking on water Jesus.
[time=1119] This is Jesus early in his ministry, but he had seen Jesus speak with authority, cast
[time=1125] out demons and heal the sick, and he knew this was no ordinary man.
[time=1132] But he knew the law of Moses.
[time=1135] He knew exactly what he was asking of Jesus.
[time=1138] Jesus, if you will, you can make me clean.
[time=1141] Jesus, if you will, you can be my atonement.
[time=1147] Church, before Jesus Christ extended his grace to you in salvation, you were a spiritual
[time=1154] leper.
[time=1157] Your disease wasn't rashes and boils on your skin, but sin and depravity and your heart.
[time=1162] You were cut off and living alone outside the camp.
[time=1166] You may have hid it from others, but when confronted by the holiness of God, your unsaved
[time=1172] soul cried out, "Unclean, unclean." Dr. Ligon Duncan puts it this way, "Why does a person come to salvation?
[time=1182] Because by the mercy of God, he opens their eyes to see both their sin and their Savior
[time=1188] and so trust him." God in his grace and mercy provided the ultimate sacrifice to make you clean and restore you
[time=1199] to right standing with him.
[time=1203] Not an animal commanded by the law of Moses, but Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God.
[time=1209] And not for the temporary atonement of one sin, but the eternal atonement of all your
[time=1216] sins.
[time=1217] The blood of Jesus covers you from head to toe and washes you clean.
[time=1225] If someone comes to Jesus and falls on their knees and implores him to make them clean, he will respond just as he did to the leper.
[time=1234] He will stretch out his hand, touch them, and say, "I will be clean."
[time=1240] This isn't an outward cleanness, but an inward spiritual cleanness.
[time=1244] The literal righteousness of Christ is imputed to those who repent and believe.
[time=1250] Upon salvation, we wear the righteousness of Christ like a robe.
[time=1255] And whatever our shortcomings in life, when we stand before the throne of God and death, we have nothing to fear.
[time=1262] The robe of righteousness is not a trick or a disguise.
[time=1265] It's not spiritual camouflage.
[time=1268] God knows exactly who we are and what we've done because he knows exactly who we are and
[time=1275] what he has done.
[time=1279] We won't approach the throne of God with our resume.
[time=1283] We will approach the throne of God with the Holy Spirit as our sign, seal, and guarantee
[time=1289] and the righteousness of Christ clothing us.
[time=1293] As we sang this morning, dressed in his righteousness alone, faultless to stand before the throne.
[time=1302] Church, we will approach the throne of God in boldness with worship and praise.
[time=1310] We sang it as well with my soul at the end of service last week.
[time=1313] This is my favorite hymn.
[time=1315] I rarely get through it without crying.
[time=1318] Verse 3 is what gets me every time.
[time=1320] My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought.
[time=1325] My sin, not in part, but the whole.
[time=1331] Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more, praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
[time=1340] This is such good news.
[time=1343] This is the gospel.
[time=1346] And for some Christians, including me after a while, we can forget the good news.
[time=1350] As I mentioned earlier, I grew up in a Christian home.
[time=1352] I came to faith as a younger person, and unfortunately my faith was more head than heart.
[time=1360] Though I knew in my head I had been made clean, I lived with the anchor of past sins around
[time=1366] my neck.
[time=1368] I asked the Lord for forgiveness but still carried around the guilt and shame of the sin I knew intellectually had been forgiven.
[time=1377] This went on for years.
[time=1380] The sin may have been forgiven, but I kept the guilt.
[time=1383] But then one day, my head and my heart connected, and I felt freedom that I had never known
[time=1390] before.
[time=1392] A few years after moving to Fort Wayne, but before we had kids, my wife and I weren't always great about getting up early on Sunday mornings.
[time=1399] On particular Sunday, we were running a little late for church.
[time=1403] I'm an introvert.
[time=1404] I prefer to be in the back or the balcony.
[time=1406] Shout out to my fellow people back there.
[time=1409] And unfortunately, we had to do the walk of shame past the entire church to sit in the third row.
[time=1416] For some of you, that's a place to be.
[time=1417] For me, it's not.
[time=1418] I'm very unsettled, didn't like it.
[time=1421] The Lord used that.
[time=1425] Our worship pastor sang a song about justification, and then read Romans 8-1.
[time=1429] For whatever reason, the light bulb went off, the Holy Spirit smacked me across the face,
[time=1435] and I finally understood the true freedom that comes from being in Christ.
[time=1442] There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[time=1452] And we've been made clean by the blood of Christ, our sins no longer condemn us.
[time=1460] They no longer separate us from the presence of God.
[time=1465] They are still sins.
[time=1466] They need to be repented of and addressed, but we have an assurance of forgiveness.
[time=1472] First John 1 9 says, "If we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us our
[time=1478] sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." That is a promise I personally cling to daily.
[time=1488] We need not carry around the guilt or shame of past sins.
[time=1491] We need not worry that we will be found out, and like the leper be forced out of the camp
[time=1497] to live alone.
[time=1498] The only person whose opinion really matters already knows we've sinned, and he has promised
[time=1505] to forgive us.
[time=1507] We are not perfect.
[time=1508] We will still make mistakes, but through the sanctification process of over time becoming more and more like Christ through the work of the Holy Spirit, old habits can be changed.
[time=1519] And recurring sins can become less pronounced and even overcome.
[time=1523] We can be renewed day by day into a new creation in Christ because his mercies are new every
[time=1529] morning.
[time=1531] Second Chronicles 16, 9 tells us that the eyes of the Lord reigns throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him.
[time=1541] With this strength we can heed Paul's words in Philippians 3 to forget what is behind and strain towards what is ahead.
[time=1551] Ephesians 6, 12 says, "For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places." The enemy wants you to feel bound and shackled to past sin.
[time=1572] The enemy wants you to feel unworthy of God's love and forgiveness.
[time=1577] The enemy wants you to feel dirty and shameful about your sins.
[time=1583] The enemy wants you to keep crying out, unclean, long after you've been made clean.
[time=1590] Brothers and sisters, these are lies.
[time=1595] Do not listen to them.
[time=1598] No matter how loud the enemy speaks, the voice of Jesus speaks louder.
[time=1604] Be clean.
[time=1607] He has clothed us in his righteousness and these robes are covered in spiritual teflon.
[time=1615] Nothing Satan throws at you can stick.
[time=1624] The opening verse of Romans 8 has always been precious to me, but so of the closing verses.
[time=1632] If God is for us, who can be against us?
[time=1636] He who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us as all.
[time=1640] How will he not also with him graciously give us all things?
[time=1643] Who shall bring any charge against God's elect?
[time=1648] It is God who justifies.
[time=1650] Who is to condemn?
[time=1652] Jesus Christ is the one who died, more than that who was raised, who is at the right hand
[time=1658] of God, who indeed is interceding for us.
[time=1663] Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[time=1667] Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?
[time=1674] As it is written for your sake, we are being killed all the day long.
[time=1677] We are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.
[time=1679] No.
[time=1681] In all these things, we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
[time=1685] For I am sure that neither death nor life nor angels nor rulers nor things present nor
[time=1693] things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor anything else in all creation will be able
[time=1701] to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[time=1708] Just when you belong to Jesus, nothing can take you away from him.
[time=1714] You are his and he loves you, warts and all.
[time=1720] If you came here this morning, unsure if Jesus would ever accept a sinner like you.
[time=1729] If your soul cries out within you, unclean, unclean, I ask you to follow the example of
[time=1737] the leper and humbly implore Jesus.
[time=1741] If you will, you can make me clean.
[time=1745] He longs to stretch out his hand and touch you and make you clean.
[time=1751] If you are a Christian who came here this morning burdened by past sin, still holding on to the guilt of a past mistake, I ask you to listen to the words of Jesus.
[time=1760] Be clean and remember the promise of forgiveness afforded to you.
[time=1768] Close your ears to the lies of Satan and rest in the finished work of Christ on your behalf.
[time=1777] If you are a Christian who has been made clean, who has experienced the true freedom only found in Christ, I ask you to take the leper's advice and not keep it to yourself.
[time=1790] Name the good news to a world in need.
[time=1794] Everywhere we look today, we hear and see people crying out unclean.
[time=1802] Let us shine the light of Jesus brightly and point the unclean world to the outstretched
[time=1810] hands of Jesus.
[time=1814] Let's pray.
[time=1821] God you are so good to us.
[time=1826] We deserve punishment and you have given us Jesus.
[time=1835] God I praise you for the atoning work of Christ on the cross, covering the from head
[time=1844] to toe.
[time=1846] Father I praise you that in your sovereignty, you knew exactly what you were doing.
[time=1854] Father I praise you that no matter how many mistakes I make that you take me back.
[time=1862] I don't have to come back again and sacrifice or make penance or apologize a thousand times
[time=1868] or do good works to make up for it.
[time=1872] You've declared me clean.
[time=1875] You have given me the righteousness of Christ.
[time=1879] May I rest in this.
[time=1885] Father for those here wondering if you will take them, I pray that their hearts are open
[time=1894] to your call, that they will feel your hand reach out to touch them and make them clean.
[time=1905] For those here today burdened by past mistakes, I pray that you would help them feel the freedom
[time=1912] that only comes from Christ.
[time=1915] There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[time=1921] May the burden and shackles of past sin be released.
[time=1926] May they live in true freedom.
[time=1931] May they close their ears to the lies of the enemy.
[time=1935] And may we all proclaim this good news to a world in need.
[time=1942] You pray all this in the precious name of Jesus, amen.
