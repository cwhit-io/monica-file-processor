[time=0] and we're doing a series in the Gospel of Mark titled, "Jesus, Servant and Savior." And the title of the series comes from the main verse, which is Mark 10, 45.
[time=12] When Jesus says, "For even the Son of Men "did not come to be served, but to serve, "and to give His life as a ransom for many." And last week, in chapter two verse one, we started a series of five episodes in Jesus' life in which Jesus is in direct conflict with the religious leaders of the day.
[time=34] So the first conflict last week was, Jesus healing the paralytic, and they're asking, who do you think you are?
[time=41] Who do you think you are to say that you can forgive sins?
[time=46] And the second week, the second conflict is also with the religious leaders of the day because now he befriends sinners.
[time=56] So let's look at the passage, starting in verse 13.
[time=61] He went out beside, again beside the sea, and all the crowd was coming to him and he was teaching them.
[time=70] We learned that a very important ministry of Jesus was the ministry of teaching.
[time=75] Sometimes he was healing, but sometimes he was teaching.
[time=79] And we learned that a very important ministry of the church should always be the ministry of teaching, the verb to teach that's used here, it's the same verb used in Matthew chapter five when Jesus teaches the crowds during what we call the sermon on the mount.
[time=101] And again, the ministry of teaching is crucial.
[time=105] I love the ministry of singing, and there are many different ministries in the church, but the ministry of teaching needs to be primary.
[time=115] If there's no teaching occurring, something is wrong.
[time=119] So I want us to think about this morning, what am I?
[time=123] Am I a student?
[time=125] Am I a teacher?
[time=126] Or am I both?
[time=128] Because if you're part of the church, you need to be one or the other or both.
[time=133] All of us should be students of the word.
[time=136] All of us should be opening the Bible and studying the word for ourselves.
[time=139] And I don't just mean on Sunday morning.
[time=141] That's why I wanna tell you that this church offers opportunity for growth through teaching on Wednesday nights, on Sunday mornings.
[time=150] It's not just this one hour.
[time=152] If you're not part of a small group or part of an ABF, some of you call them Sunday schools, depending where you're from, adult Bible fellowships, whatever it is, you need to get involved in a ministry of teaching, either as a student or as a teacher.
[time=169] If God has blessed you with the gift of teaching, you need to be using that.
[time=172] And it doesn't mean that you're gonna start on Sunday morning up here.
[time=177] Maybe you're gonna start like I did with the children's ministry.
[time=182] As my children were growing up, I went through a wanna with them.
[time=186] So I started all the way when they were young and I went all the way up when they were in high school.
[time=193] I lasted for one year in high school ministry.
[time=196] Again, I don't have all the gifts and you don't either, but you gotta look and see what your gifts are and where you need to use your gifts.
[time=205] Maybe you said, I don't have any of those gifts.
[time=208] Okay, you can still be involved in ministry.
[time=210] Maybe you can hold a baby.
[time=212] You have nursery.
[time=214] We have many, many ways you can serve, but as a student or as a teacher, we all need to be involved because the teaching ministry is still primary.
[time=224] It was primary in Jesus' time and it's still primary today.
[time=228] Ephesians 4.11 says that God gave some as apostles, some prophets and some evangelists, some pastors and teachers.
[time=236] So if you have a good teacher in ABF or maybe your kids have a good teacher in their program,
[time=245] be thankful for them.
[time=246] Maybe write them a note and say, thank you.
[time=249] Thank you for serving.
[time=250] A lot of times we overlook these ministries.
[time=253] We think that things are just happening in the morning while we're here.
[time=256] Listen, they're not just happening.
[time=259] There are people who have prepared and are teaching your children and are doing other ministry.
[time=263] So let's be grateful for the great ministry of the church.
[time=267] Jesus was a teacher and we need to be involved in that ministry as well.
[time=273] But Jesus is not just teaching.
[time=276] He's also evangelizing and making disciples, verse 14.
[time=281] As he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaus sitting at the tax booth and he said to him, follow me and he rose and followed him.
[time=292] Earlier we saw how Jesus stops by the fishing village by the Sea of Galilee and the first recruits were for fishermen.
[time=304] Remember Peter and Andrew, John and James.
[time=308] But now he continues recruiting, but now he goes to a tax booth.
[time=316] I know some people wanna make the correlation between the tax booth and the IRS.
[time=322] It's not the same thing, and as we all know, again, I'm not saying there can be corruption in both of them.
[time=328] I'm not saying that, but we cannot make a direct analogy between the two.
[time=333] Although we sometimes might be tempted to do so.
[time=337] Why?
[time=338] Because the tax booth was a very interesting place and I'll explain in a second.
[time=344] But when Matthew explains this call in the Gospel of Matthew, he gives us firsthand account because this Levi that Mark explains is the same one as Matthew, the evangelist and the Gospel writer.
[time=362] Mark gives us his Hebrew name, Levi.
[time=365] Matthew gives us his Hellenized name, Matthew.
[time=372] So what we need to understand here that Jesus sees in Levi, the tax collector, Matthew, the Gospel writer.
[time=381] And one of the first lessons we need to learn my dear brothers and sisters, we need to look at people differently.
[time=387] We need to look at people the way Jesus looks at people.
[time=392] Because these people, the tax collectors were not looked upon very favorably.
[time=398] One scholar puts it like there's these tax collectors who were collectors of taxes of the Roman government and they were ever on this account obnoxious to the Jews who sat uneasy under a foreign yoke and disliked whatever brought this unpleasantly before them.
[time=416] But the extortion practice by this class made them hateful to the community who in their current speech ranked them with harlots.
[time=425] That's why you see a lot of times in the gospels you have sinners and tax collectors.
[time=430] You have that expression.
[time=431] Sinners and tax collectors.
[time=434] Another translation would be like prostitutes and tax collectors, harlots and tax collectors.
[time=440] They would be basically in the same area.
[time=444] Again, according to the society.
[time=447] See, there was a taxation system in place.
[time=453] For example, you were taxed by simply being alive.
[time=460] 10% of your taxes went on all your grain.
[time=463] If you had grain, 10% would be taxed.
[time=467] 20% of all your oil and wine products would be taxed.
[time=472] There was even an income tax.
[time=474] You think your rate is high.
[time=478] Their tax was 1%.
[time=481] Income tax was 1%.
[time=483] Everybody want to move back 22,000 years ago?
[time=487] I don't think you do.
[time=489] But see, in this system there was no room for extortion.
[time=493] But listen, besides that, they had taxes for using roads and docking in harbors.
[time=500] They had a sales tax for certain items and even they taxed their carts.
[time=505] They taxed each wheel.
[time=507] So the system fostered exploitation by the arbitrary power of the tax collectors.
[time=515] See, a couple of weeks ago we looked at a man who was a leper.
[time=520] He had physical leprosy.
[time=523] Last week we saw a man with spiritual leprosy.
[time=526] But today we're looking at a man with societal leprosy.
[time=529] Nobody wanted to touch this guy because he was considered corrupt.
[time=534] He was a Jew working for the Roman government and he was extorting his own brothers and sisters.
[time=542] And yet Jesus asked to him what?
[time=545] Follow me.
[time=548] We gotta love this story because it's my story and it's your story.
[time=552] Jesus found us in our sin and said to us, "Follow me." He didn't point us with the finger and said, "You, sinner and tax collector." He said, "No, follow me." Is that good news?
[time=565] That's great news.
[time=567] That's why we gotta learn how to look at people, how Jesus looks at people.
[time=570] I was tempted to think, you know, what's the lowest class of society today?
[time=576] We can compare the tax collector with, but I didn't realize, you know what I need to do?
[time=581] All I need to do is to look inside my heart.
[time=583] And that's what we need to do.
[time=586] We gotta stop pointing people and God, that guy is more sinner than that guy.
[time=590] Look, we need to look in our hearts and see what Jesus saved us from.
[time=593] 'Cause we were the sinners and the tax collectors.
[time=598] But Jesus approached us and said, "Follow me." That's what Jesus wants to do to follow him, by the way, in the Gospels.
[time=607] This word follow is always used of his disciples.
[time=610] It's never used of his opponents.
[time=613] The Pharisees and the scribes and the seduces and those who oppose Jesus never follow him.
[time=619] But the sinners and the tax collectors do follow him.
[time=623] In the Gospel of Mark, a disciple of Jesus is one who follows Jesus on the way.
[time=630] That is the follower of Jesus Christ.
[time=633] In the first century, if you saw a fellow brother or sister at Kroger, you would ask him or her, "Are you on the way?
[time=642] Are you on the way?" Basically, you would ask him, "Are you following Jesus on the way?
[time=651] Are you a disciple of Jesus Christ?
[time=653] Are you walking every day?" It's not just a one-time thing, it's a discipleship.
[time=658] It's something that happens every day.
[time=660] And I love Levi's response.
[time=662] It's very simple, he rose and followed him.
[time=666] Levi doesn't need convincing to the means of theology, philosophy, or anything else, although that's great.
[time=674] Levi simply gets up and follows Jesus.
[time=681] And Levi wants to show gratitude to Jesus by welcoming to his home to a home-cooked meal.
[time=693] And we see that after, he says, "Follow me." The next scene, we move from the tax booth to Levi's home.
[time=702] And as he reclined a table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.
[time=715] Jesus, to use today's language, was dining with a scum of the earth.
[time=723] But it was this scum that followed Jesus.
[time=726] The others were not following Jesus.
[time=730] That's why I love the old hymn.
[time=732] Jesus was a friend for, doesn't say Jesus was a friend for Pharisees.
[time=738] Jesus was a friend for scribes.
[time=742] He says, "Jesus was a friend for sinners.
[time=745] Jesus, lover of my soul.
[time=747] Friends may fail me, for the sale me.
[time=749] He my Savior makes me whole." Jesus doesn't just preach to them, doesn't just teach them.
[time=756] He befriends them.
[time=757] He sits down with them and talks to them.
[time=760] You see, scribes came to enlighten.
[time=763] Jesus came to redeem.
[time=766] What are we here for?
[time=770] We are here to serve my dear brothers and sisters.
[time=773] We are here to do the same thing that Jesus did to befriend sinners and to point them to Jesus Christ, to invite them to follow Jesus on the way.
[time=786] If you use your sanctified imagination, imagine the conversation around the Pharisees as they're looking at Jesus dining with the sinners and the tax collectors.
[time=797] They're probably asking themselves, "Oh, is this conversion genuine?
[time=801] Will it last?
[time=803] How can such a person really be changed?" You know the questions, right?
[time=808] Because sometimes we ask them, we ask them too.
[time=812] But if we do that, we need to be reminded what God saved us from.
[time=819] As Paul says in Romans 5, 8, "But God shows His love for us and while we get sinners, Christ died for us." See, Jesus didn't wait for us to correct our mess, yet straight, no.
[time=833] While we are yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[time=836] Do you remember that time?
[time=838] If you remember that time, it's easy to be filled with gratitude and then to go tell a lost world of Levi's that Jesus can turn them into Matthew, the evangelist.
[time=849] We need to look at people like Jesus sees people.
[time=853] How are we doing that?
[time=855] Maybe we need an eye exam today.
[time=859] How do we look at people?
[time=861] I read a story about many centuries ago in Florence, Italy,
[time=868] where a number of workmen were dragging through the streets a great marble block.
[time=875] And that marble block was used by the great sculpture Donatello
[time=881] because he wanted to make out of it a great Old Testament prophet, a statue of an Old Testament prophet.
[time=886] But as Donatello looked at the marble, he saw some imperfections and told the workers, "I don't want to throw it away." The same piece of marble was seen by another sculptor, by another artist.
[time=905] He took it, he didn't look at the imperfections, he looked at the potential.
[time=910] And that piece of marble became Michelangelo's David.
[time=915] See, we got to learn to look at people the way Jesus looks at people, not see their imperfections, but see what Jesus can do with them.
[time=924] Jesus, how Jesus can transform them from an imperfection to Michelangelo.
[time=936] God does that.
[time=937] He looks at us and doesn't see who we were or even how we are.
[time=941] He looks at us how we can become.
[time=945] Remember, he changed David from a shepherd into a king,
[time=951] Joseph from a teenager to a prime minister, Rahab from a prostitute to one who would save the Jewish people.
[time=961] Pagan Ruth was transformed in a forerunner of Christ.
[time=966] Why are we blinded, my dear brothers and sisters?
[time=970] If we do an eye exam today, could we be that we're blinded because of legalism,
[time=976] racism, liberalism, whatever ism you want to be accused of, I don't know.
[time=983] Max volcano, imagine the conversion like this, says Matthew, if you remember, was converted at work.
[time=990] According to his resume, he was a revenue consultant for the government.
[time=994] According to his neighbors, he was a crook.
[time=997] He kept a tax booth and a hand extended at a street corner.
[time=1002] That's where he was the day he saw Jesus.
[time=1005] Follow me, the master said, and Matthew did.
[time=1008] And in the next verse, we find Jesus sitting at Matthew's dining room table.
[time=1013] Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house.
[time=1016] A curbside conversion couldn't satisfy his heart.
[time=1020] So Matthew took Jesus home.
[time=1022] Something happens over a dinner table that doesn't happen over an office desk.
[time=1026] Take off the tie, heat up the grill, break out the sodas, and spend the evening with the suspenders of the stars.
[time=1034] You know, Jesus forgave me, but I always wanted to ask you, da, da, da.
[time=1041] And again, though the giving of the invitation is impressive, the acceptance is more so.
[time=1046] Didn't matter to Jesus that Matthew was a thief.
[time=1049] Didn't matter to Jesus that Matthew had built a split-level house with the proceeds of extortion.
[time=1055] What did matter was Matthew wanted to know Jesus, and since God rewards those who truly want to find him, Matthew was rewarded with the presence of Christ in his home.
[time=1066] And everybody was happy, right?
[time=1070] Wrong.
[time=1072] We see the conflict, the second conflict in a series of five and the scribes of the Pharisees of the Pharisees, when they saw he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, set to his disciples.
[time=1085] Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?
[time=1090] Now, the answer to that question can be very simple.
[time=1093] You ready for this?
[time=1095] He was hungry.
[time=1098] Did you ever consider that Jesus eats with them because he's hungry?
[time=1104] They never think about that, right?
[time=1107] But that's not what they're asking.
[time=1110] He's not asking, why is Jesus eating with them?
[time=1115] What they're asking is, why is Jesus eating with all these sinners when he shouldn't be?
[time=1120] That's why they're asking.
[time=1122] He shouldn't be doing that.
[time=1125] By the way, there was nothing in the law that prohibited Jesus from eating with them.
[time=1131] You can read the whole Old Testament.
[time=1133] There's no prohibition, but the Pharisees and the scribes and the rabbis added to the law.
[time=1141] And that's what legalism is, my dear brothers and sisters.
[time=1144] When you put a circle around the law, a fence around the law, that's legalism.
[time=1150] And that's what they did.
[time=1152] The law never said, don't eat with sinners.
[time=1157] But that's exactly what they did.
[time=1159] They put it in their man-made laws.
[time=1161] They said, listen, they said this, let not a man associate with sinners even to bring them near to the law.
[time=1168] Don't even bring them near to the Torah.
[time=1170] They're too sinful.
[time=1176] Jesus is a friend of sinners because Jesus loves sinners because Jesus came for sinners.
[time=1184] Jesus came for sinners such as you and I.
[time=1190] Let's again stop a little bit and ask ourselves, my dear brothers and sisters, how many unbelieving friends do we have
[time=1198] that we can take to Jesus?
[time=1202] Because sometimes we like to hang out with Christians.
[time=1208] Even our doctors, our dentists, our plumbers, everybody's a Christian.
[time=1214] Sometimes we just pick them because they're Christian. Some even have Christian dogs, right?
[time=1221] Not cats because cats cannot be Christian. We know that.
[time=1225] We know that.
[time=1229] But how can we be reaching out to the Levi's of the world if we don't hang out with them?
[time=1237] How can we reach out to the sinners of the world if all we have is Christian everything?
[time=1246] Many years ago in Great Britain when Oliver Cromwell ruled England, they had a financial crisis.
[time=1255] They didn't have any more coins to mint and they couldn't pay stuff because they ran out of coins.
[time=1262] So Cromwell sent his people and said, "I want you guys to go to every cathedral and see if you can find any coins.
[time=1270] Any silver?" So we can put in circulation.
[time=1275] And they came back and said, "The only silver we found was statues of saints in cathedrals."
[time=1287] And Cromwell said, "Great. Melt down the saints and put them in circulation."
[time=1298] See, sometimes we look very good here on Sunday morning.
[time=1303] But what God wants of us is to melt us down and to be in circulation, Monday through Saturday.
[time=1311] That's what God wants of us.
[time=1314] It's great when we're all here together, but we need to be melted down and put in circulation.
[time=1321] So we go reach out a lost world of Levi's, who Jesus can transform into Matthew's, the Gospel writers.
[time=1334] But Jesus heard what the Pharisees were saying.
[time=1338] And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.
[time=1347] I came not to call the righteous, but sinners." Jesus gives them an ironic answer and a straightforward answer.
[time=1357] Those who are well have no need of a physician.
[time=1361] But then the calling, "I came not to call the righteous, but sinners."
[time=1369] So we cannot be of the world, but God is calling us to be in the world.
[time=1376] Not assimilated by the world, but we need to go in the world and reach out to sinners.
[time=1382] As Jesus prays in John 1715, "I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one."
[time=1390] See, Jesus was not assimilated into the culture.
[time=1394] When we say that Jesus hung out with sinners, he was not going down to the pub and getting drunk with them.
[time=1400] That's not what it means.
[time=1402] Some people misunderstand that.
[time=1403] That's what we got to do.
[time=1404] Go to the pubs and get drunk with the sinners.
[time=1407] No, that's not what he did.
[time=1408] Jesus didn't do that.
[time=1410] He went to be with the sinners to call them to salvation, to offer them forgiveness of sin.
[time=1416] He was not assimilated into the culture, and we cannot be either, but we need to be out there and serve,
[time=1423] and go get and talk to the sinners, because every sinner can be a saint.
[time=1431] Every saint used to be a sinner, and every sinner can be a saint.
[time=1438] Jesus can change them, but we need to tell them about them.
[time=1444] Chuck Sundall says, "Could it be that we're not doing that because there's a little Pharisee in all of us?"
[time=1452] Harmful, though it is, we find a lot of security in our iron bars and solid walls.
[time=1458] Tragically, this ball and chain mentality keeps us from giving ourselves in a fresh, innovative ways.
[time=1467] When we lived in Birmingham, we learned about this comedian.
[time=1474] His name is Jeff Foxworthy. You know of him, because he's famous for, "You might be a redneck if jokes."
[time=1482] You guys know those jokes.
[time=1483] You might be a redneck if you mow the lawn and find a car, you know.
[time=1488] What about, "You might be a Pharisee if..."
[time=1497] These are not jokes. These are serious matters.
[time=1501] You might be a Pharisee if you feel worse.
[time=1505] When you're utilizing in church, you're sitting in church, and someone took your favorite spot.
[time=1519] And you're not feeling that badly when you pass up the opportunity to help someone in need.
[time=1528] Christmas is coming.
[time=1530] And usually around Christmas, we think about people who are less fortunate than us.
[time=1536] Operation Christmas Child, and maybe God will be speaking to you.
[time=1542] You might be a Pharisee if you're faster to criticize those who are singing for hitting a few sour notes.
[time=1554] Then if you are for not being up here singing, you might be a Pharisee if the thing you like most about your church is your softball team.
[time=1570] While you don't care about the missionaries who feel alone doing the work of the gospel.
[time=1580] My good friend, Professor of Preaching is now with the Lord Calvin Miller,
[time=1586] wrote, "The Pharisees, a Levi's house, loved talking theology, but rarely made friends of people who couldn't. They knew the Book of Leviticus backwards and forwards,
[time=1598] but they rarely stopped to talk to the poor.
[time=1601] But in Jesus, the tax-gatherers had a rabbi who met them spirit first.
[time=1607] The high, unyielding rules of the scribes and Pharisees never came between Levi and Jesus.
[time=1613] The tax-gatherer Levi would ultimately write one of the books of the New Testament.
[time=1618] Would he have written it if Jesus had met him with stern, religiousity instead of worms' spirituality?
[time=1625] I think not.
[time=1630] If Jesus Christ is not your Lord and Savior, you need to surrender your life to Him.
[time=1635] But for those of us who have accepted Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior, we need to be like Jesus.
[time=1642] We need, first of all, to follow Him.
[time=1645] I'm not asking us to follow people. Some of us follow pastors and, you know, these guys on TV or on the news or whatever.
[time=1656] We are not called to follow people. We are called to follow Jesus.
[time=1661] If you see each other at Kroger or a Samscob or a Costco, ask yourselves, "Are you on the way?"
[time=1670] Meaning, "Are you following Jesus on the way?" And then, let's ask God to change our vision to see people like He sees people.
[time=1681] To see in Levi, the tax-collector Matthew, the gospel writer.
[time=1688] To see that drunken neighbor who can become a missionary, I know we can't make that happen, but Jesus can.
[time=1696] We got to take them to Jesus. Let's ask God to change our vision, how we see things, to see people not for who they are,
[time=1706] but who can Jesus change them into being.
[time=1710] Think about yourself. How did God change you?
[time=1714] How He changed you from who you were, where you are now.
[time=1718] And Jesus can still do that, but we have to do that. We have to change.
[time=1723] By the way, we see things. Amen?
[time=1728] Let's stand up and sing this wonderful, old hymn.
[time=1732] Jesus, what a friend for sinners, Jesus lover of my soul.
[time=1768] Friends, my family, forza, tell me, hear my say, for me, makes me more.
[time=1780] Hallelujah, what a Savior, hallelujah, what a friend.
[time=1792] Serving, helping, keeping, loving, is with me to be him.
[time=1805] Jesus, what a friend in which he can share, guide myself in thee.
[time=1818] Time to travel sometimes, failing, in my strength, my victory will.
[time=1830] Hallelujah, what a Savior, hallelujah, what a friend.
[time=1842] Serving, helping, keeping, loving, is with me to be him.
[time=1856] Jesus, what a friend, he can share, guide myself in thee.
[time=1869] Even when my heart is breaking me, my comfort lends my soul.
[time=1881] Hallelujah, what a Savior, hallelujah, what a friend.
[time=1894] Serving, helping, keeping, loving, is with me to be him.
[time=1910] Dear Father, we thank you that while we are yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[time=1917] He turned us from sinners to saints because of who we are or what we have done because of what he has done.
[time=1926] I pray that you will change our hearts and our minds about those around us.
[time=1931] Melt us down and put us in circulation in such a way that many people will come to the saving lodge of Christ.
[time=1939] It is in his name that we pray, amen.
