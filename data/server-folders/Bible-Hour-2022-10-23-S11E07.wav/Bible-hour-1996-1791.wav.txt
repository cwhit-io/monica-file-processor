[time=30] Well, it's true that when you are locked behind the wall of sin that separates you from God,
[time=49] you are separated from the growth and the vitality and the life and the energy of living a life in relationship with God.
[time=64] This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=68] Thank you for joining us.
[time=70] For many years the Berlin Wall separated east and west Germany.
[time=74] Then in 1989 it fell uniting a people divided for 28 years.
[time=79] Today as we continue our study of Ephesians, Pastor Moore looks at the wall of sin that separates us from a relationship with God and how it was conquered by Jesus Christ the peacemaker.
[time=89] Now let's join our service.
[time=113] [MUSIC - 358 seconds]
[time=493] If one of those shepherds from the hillside or with us today there's no doubt in my mind that they would tell us that
[time=499] that that night was a memorable night and like no other it was a moment that changed their lives forever.
[time=509] And probably many of us in this room could talk about moments in our lives when something occurred that changed us made a difference that was lasting.
[time=518] And that's what God is in the business of doing, of changing, of doing things and it can happen in a moment.
[time=525] It can happen overnight as this song that Lynn wrote talks about it can happen overnight.
[time=531] [MUSIC - 17 seconds]
[time=573] Their hearts will never be the same.
[time=579] Oh, it can happen all the night.
[time=586] It doesn't take a lifetime for good to change a life.
[time=593] He's never limited by time or space.
[time=600] You can believe him no matter what the circumstances say.
[time=608] Don't be amazed if you should fight.
[time=614] It can happen overnight.
[time=621] [MUSIC]
[time=631] Early in the morning the women bring their spies to another Lord, the great Messiah crucified.
[time=644] But at the tomb the stone is rolled away.
[time=649] The angel say he lives again.
[time=654] And the women tell their friends to save your left and into grain.
[time=662] Oh, it can happen overnight.
[time=670] It doesn't take a lifetime for good to change a life.
[time=677] He's never limited by time or space.
[time=684] You can believe him no matter what the circumstances say.
[time=691] Don't be amazed if you should fight.
[time=698] It can happen overnight.
[time=705] [MUSIC]
[time=708] If you believe that nothing can change for someone like you.
[time=719] [MUSIC]
[time=729] There's nothing farther from the truth.
[time=739] It can happen overnight.
[time=751] He's never limited by time or space.
[time=758] You can believe him no matter what the circumstances say.
[time=765] Don't be amazed if you should fight.
[time=772] It can happen overnight.
[time=778] [MUSIC]
[time=796] [APPLAUSE]
[time=803] Oh, come on, you can't do this to me, but my brother in law knows somebody who has a cousin who's fianc√© works at the gas station where the chauffeur fills up the mayor's limo.
[time=813] Boy, are you going to be in trouble?
[time=818] Free us, free us, let my people go.
[time=822] Wait, I get it.
[time=824] Moses, right?
[time=825] What?
[time=826] You're supposed to be Moses.
[time=828] No, no, I'm not supposed to be Moses.
[time=832] I'm supposed to be Joseph, the living nativity over at First Community Church.
[time=837] The one down there on summer set in 10th?
[time=839] Yeah, you guys do that every year, don't you? That's quite some display.
[time=843] You use live animals and everything.
[time=846] We used to use live animals up until a couple of hours ago before the stampede.
[time=853] Stampede?
[time=856] Apparently, one of the shepherds abiding in the field surprised one of the lowing cattle with his staff.
[time=863] Next thing you know, we've got an entire stampede on our hands.
[time=866] Cow, sheep, everything, bust them through the pin.
[time=868] Oh, we finally round them up on the 17th fairway over at the summer set golf club behind the church.
[time=874] What, you got arrested for not paying green fees?
[time=877] No.
[time=878] Oh, Barney Fife over here arrest me and put me in jail because I don't want to pay a fine for not having a permit to keep farm animals within the city limits.
[time=885] That can't be much of a fine. Why don't you just pay it?
[time=888] It's the principle of a thing.
[time=890] I mean, after all, we're under grace, not under the law.
[time=895] If you people wanted to keep a separation of church and state, you shouldn't be throwing a living nativity in jail.
[time=901] You probably have an APB out on Frosty the Snowman, too, don't you?
[time=906] Well, he did. All the evidence just evaporated.
[time=910] Next thing you know, you'll probably be arresting Santa Claus.
[time=914] Bingo.
[time=918] No.
[time=920] You arrested Santa?
[time=922] Can you believe it?
[time=923] Have we stooped so low as the jail jolly old St. Nick?
[time=927] I mean, come on. Is there not one else of compassion or pity left in the world?
[time=932] So, uh, what did they get you for?
[time=937] Impersonating a sidewalk, Santa, and pocketing the cash.
[time=941] Ohh.
[time=943] From him, I want a different self.
[time=945] Hey, wait a minute. It was all a mistake.
[time=947] Yeah, rough.
[time=950] Hey, I've seen you before at Kmart. Yeah, I remember you.
[time=956] I gave you quite a large donation.
[time=958] And I recognize you, too.
[time=961] What? You want your quarterback?
[time=964] No.
[time=965] But, I mean, come on. Pretending to be Santa Claus?
[time=968] Well, it's not what it looks like.
[time=971] Yeah, right. At least I was trying to show the true meaning of Christmas.
[time=976] And it was all going so well, too.
[time=979] Sure, it's 30 degrees below zero with the wind chill.
[time=982] And my wife who plays Mary steals the swaddling clothes right out of the manger for extra warmth.
[time=987] She says if she gets hypothermia, she's going to give the whole story to a current affair.
[time=992] I've got two feuding heavenly hosts who won't sing another note without background tracks and more monitor.
[time=997] I've got a shepherd who's allergic to hay, and I've only got two wise men.
[time=1000] The third one's at home passing a kidney stone.
[time=1003] Sounds like the first dysfunctional nativity.
[time=1006] Aw, come on. Don't knock it, man. This is a tradition in my church.
[time=1011] I've been wearing this robe for years.
[time=1013] Well, at least I wasn't hauled in for disturbing the peace when I was supposed to be celebrating the birth of the Prince of Peace.
[time=1020] You're right. You're absolutely right.
[time=1022] You deserve to be here.
[time=1024] I was just trying to make ends meet by pretending to be Santa Claus and pocketing the cash.
[time=1030] Come on, what would make you do something like that?
[time=1033] Because I've got a wife and kid who are going to have another lousy Christmas.
[time=1039] Company Layoff has a way of doing that.
[time=1043] Unemployment checks stopped coming three months ago.
[time=1046] Oh, everyone says they'll start hiring again just as soon as this recession the president says we're not having is over.
[time=1053] I know it was stupid. What I did.
[time=1057] I just couldn't think of any other way to get a few bucks for a gift for my kid.
[time=1062] What must your wife think?
[time=1065] She doesn't know. And I don't intend to have her find out.
[time=1070] So you're just going to stay here in jail on Christmas instead of spending the holiday with your family?
[time=1075] Look, if I have 500 bucks, you think I'm going to waste it posting bail?
[time=1080] That wasn't going to be much of a Christmas anyway.
[time=1084] Look, I'm real sorry, all right, but I mean, come on, pretending to be somebody you're not.
[time=1088] Oh, well look at you. You're supposed to be portraying the Christmas story, right?
[time=1093] Yes, that's right. I'm certainly trying to.
[time=1095] Well, I thought it had something to do with peace. A peacemaker, you know, good will to men on earth.
[time=1100] There's a baby in a manger.
[time=1101] Greatest story ever told, that's right.
[time=1103] Yeah, it's so great. How come you let a two-bit find keep you from telling it.
[time=1111] I don't know. I don't know. I guess I just get caught up in all of this.
[time=1116] It's easy to forget the real meaning of Christmas. I don't know.
[time=1122] But maybe that's it.
[time=1126] Maybe the Lord wants us to come to the manger just as we are without the fake beards and red suits and Bible robes.
[time=1136] Just be who we are.
[time=1140] People in search of peace.
[time=1146] You know, you and I, maybe we're not so different after all.
[time=1155] I guess I got to pay that fine now. I can't really point people to the manger from inside of a jail cell.
[time=1163] Don't be so sure.
[time=1165] What with the way things have been going for me, I've kind of lost the message of Christmas.
[time=1171] It seems so long ago, but you reminded me. Thanks.
[time=1181] He is still the Prince of Peace.
[time=1183] These days, that's goodness.
[time=1186] Hey, Officer. I think I'll pay that fine now.
[time=1192] Why don't you throw his bail in there as well? We'll pay you in checkles.
[time=1198] Oh, come on. It was a joke. It was funny.
[time=1204] Why don't you come by the manger with me tonight?
[time=1206] Why are you doing this?
[time=1208] 'Tis the season. Peace on Earth, right?
[time=1211] I can't pay you back.
[time=1213] I don't care about that.
[time=1215] Consider it a gift.
[time=1217] Kind of like the baby in the manger.
[time=1221] Come on. We're short a wise man. I think you qualify.
[time=1229] Our hope this morning is that as you listen to the message that Russell will give us,
[time=1235] that you will be refreshed and renewed in your understanding of what it meant
[time=1242] and what it means to us now to have Christ as our peacemaker.
[time=1246] Would you pray with me?
[time=1248] Father, we simply ask this morning that as we hear the truth, that go beyond simply the understanding of our mind but that it reach into our heart.
[time=1257] And God, for those who are here today that have a real need of a peacemaker in their life
[time=1264] because they are not at peace with you. May the message drive even deeper still
[time=1272] and may it provide a sense of hope that satisfies their longing to be right with you.
[time=1279] In Christ's name we ask. Amen.
[time=1284] Let me invite you to take your Bible and come to Ephesians chapter 2.
[time=1290] We're studying this book and we come to this great theme of peace this morning.
[time=1295] Ephesians chapter 2, and if you don't have a Bible with you, that's okay.
[time=1298] We'll try to put the appropriate verses up on the screen as we get to those.
[time=1304] I want to talk to you at the beginning of this message about fences and about barriers and about dividing walls that really typify the absence of peace and kind of our monuments of the animosity that exist between people.
[time=1317] In fact, it's part of human nature to build barriers that shut other people out.
[time=1323] And the passage we're going to study this morning is about how God removes or breaks down the barrier of the dividing wall primarily between people and himself
[time=1333] but in so doing between people and other people.
[time=1336] Tiger Woods knows a little bit about barriers.
[time=1339] He's run into a race barrier from the earliest days of his life.
[time=1344] He was raised in southeast Los Angeles and by the accomplishments of his father who served in the Navy, their family had rights for their family to play at the Navy golf course in southeast Los Angeles.
[time=1356] But racial slurs against his father and selective enforcement of the rules as to how little kids could play their children under the age of 10 effectively pushed them completely out and off that golf course.
[time=1369] Tiger had to learn to play golf at a little public course down the street.
[time=1374] You've probably noticed if you watch much about golf at all, you've noticed that Tiger's endorsement with Nike, the first commercial that ever aired was a statement about his concern over the racial barriers that still exist where black people are not welcome on certain courses even to this day.
[time=1394] And apparently the wounds have not scarred over completely.
[time=1398] Tiger's dad says about the golf, the Navy golf course in Los Angeles there that it's really their loss that they pushed Tiger away because, quote, "Tiger won't go near the place anymore." And so as a young boy he experienced the barriers and it hurt him and he had to grow up and play somewhere else.
[time=1417] And now that he's famous and could bring all kinds of good things back to that very Navy golf course, he won't go back there anymore.
[time=1424] So he's kind of built his own wall now against them.
[time=1428] And maybe with time he'll reconsider that decision.
[time=1432] There are gender barriers, restrictions and limitations not because of color, IQ, education or ability just because you happen to be a woman, a time when you couldn't vote and still to this day, difficulty finding equality in the marketplace, you know, equal pay, equal opportunity. And then of course there was the wall.
[time=1452] The wall was made of concrete and steel and barbed wire.
[time=1457] It ran for 28 miles through the heart of one of the greatest cities in the world.
[time=1462] On the eastern side a barren 200 yard wide no man's land bordered the wall, making it easier for guards armed with their machine guns and patrolling with German shepherds to prevent escapes.
[time=1474] For 28 years the Berlin Wall kept people in and it kept other people out.
[time=1480] It separated family and friends. It divided a nation, a continent, a world.
[time=1485] The wall stood as a symbol of the Cold War, a physical embodiment of the Iron Curtain.
[time=1491] For 28 years 16.5 million East Germans were cut off from the life, growth and prosperity of the West by the barrier of the dividing wall.
[time=1501] During that period of time 5,000 of them successfully escaped the freedom and 80 of them died trying.
[time=1508] But then suddenly and unexpectedly history moved with blinding speed and the wall came tumbling down.
[time=1515] A new wind swept across Eastern Europe in 1989 and the Soviet block system collapsed imploding under the weight of its own internal contradictions.
[time=1524] The decision was announced that on November 9 at the stroke of midnight the wall would come down. Before midnight crowds gathered on both sides for the historic moment, cheers rang out when the first East Berliners strode through the wall waving their identity papers. West Berliners reached out to their neighbors in the East and pulled them up to join them.
[time=1545] It was a dream come true. Strangers embraced, families were united, tears flowed, champagne corks popped, the wall was down, Berlin was whole again.
[time=1557] Joyous crowds poured into the streets screaming yelling, tooting trumpets.
[time=1563] People brought chisels and screwdrivers and hammers and began to smash away at the slabs of concrete that had kept them divided for three decades.
[time=1573] They wanted to tear it down. They wanted to pulverize it.
[time=1577] They wanted to turn it to dust.
[time=1580] This morning from our text in Ephesians chapter 2 will speak of a different kind of dividing wall, not one of race, not one of gender, not one of political ideology, but the dividing wall of sin, the sin barrier, the sin that separates
[time=1594] family and friends, the sin that divides nations and continents, the iron curtain of sin that separates people from relationship with the true and living God. This text bears witness to several things,
[time=1609] but I'll draw three things out of it for our learning this morning.
[time=1613] First of all, what is life like behind the wall of sin?
[time=1618] Secondly, what is it? What power? What force is strong enough to tear down this great wall of sin? And then thirdly, what is life like without the wall?
[time=1627] Once it's down, once the sin wall has been dealt with, what exactly constitutes life?
[time=1633] First of all, life behind the wall. Look at Ephesians chapter 2, verse 12, and these are remarkably powerful and descriptive terms. It says in verse 12, remember that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise.
[time=1653] And hear these hunting words having no hope and without God in the world.
[time=1659] The parallel is striking, isn't it? Much like the East Germans who have been cut off from the growth and the life and the prosperity and the developments that were occurring in the West and that others had freedom to interact with, not so the East Germans, they were cut off, they were separated.
[time=1675] They had nothing to do with all of that because of the great wall that kept them from all of those goings on. People who have not dealt with the sin
[time=1684] wall in their lives, the great separation of sin that removes them from the presence and fellowship with a true and living God, separated from Christ,
[time=1694] whatever having made him their personal Lord and Savior. The consequences are enumerated here. Verse 12, it says, first of all, excluded from the common wealth of Israel. You say, what does that mean? Israel were the people of God.
[time=1707] And God had set over them His government, the principles that guide and lead them through life. Have you ever gone into a particular business environment, whatever business it might have been, and you noticed an obvious attitude, the government of sorts, principles that guide and lead those people and the technology and the equipment and there's an esprit de corps and there's an energy and there's a dynamic and it's a happy, wonderful, thriving place to be.
[time=1733] They are under the common wealth, if you will, of their employer who is wise and shrewd and a successful dynamic leader and things begin to happen there that are right. They achieve great goals. Go into another business, maybe selling the exact same product, but it's a different common wealth. It's a different leader and different rules governed there and different principles work there and you can see that the place is dying. There's no energy. There's no life.
[time=1759] There's no movement. No new hills are being conquered.
[time=1763] They're just kind of living out the slow inevitable death of the common wealth in which they live.
[time=1771] Well, there are families who are separated from Christ and they are
[time=1777] excluded from the common wealth of the people of God.
[time=1781] They do not have the governing principles. They do not have the methodologies and the rules and the life-giving principles of God's word
[time=1791] and where there could have been a marriage that was vital and healthy and growing and satisfying and uplifting and where there could have been children who were being nurtured in the admonition of the Lord and learning his principles to sing his songs, being trained in his truth families that are strong and vibrant and healthy without the common wealth of Israel, without the common wealth of God, without his prevailing governing principles, attitudes and directives that very family begins to sink and will mire of disintegration and it's a slow death process and the spouse relationship begins to deteriorate and the children begin to show evidence of that and they don't know where to go and how to live and the guiding lights and the principles that should guide their steps through difficult choices are not there because they are separated from Christ and excluded from the common wealth of God.
[time=1843] There are principles in the word of God, the common wealth, the governing principles that should say how to handle one's finances and how to build strong and vibrant relationships but there are families that are separated from that and so they don't have that guidance and that light and that's what it means to be excluded from the common wealth of the people of God.
[time=1863] It says also there and this is an enormous statement in verse 12 you'll notice it says strangers, strangers to the covenants of promise. Do you realize the promises that God holds in his word for those who have given their life to Christ and do you realize the stark naked contrast, the absence of promises that God has made to people who have not given their life to Christ? God has made no promises to the people who are separated from Christ.
[time=1895] None really but once inside the covenant of promise there are thousands and thousands and thousands of promises that God has made to the people who have accepted Christ. Sacred promises which he makes from his heart and that he'll never ever break. Promises like he will never leave or forsake you. No matter how difficult life becomes no matter how far you may slip into your own sin if you've given your life to Christ he will never ever forsake you. Promises like there is no temptation that will be so strong that he will not provide the way of escape the besetting sins, the things that want to take a hold of your life and drag you down and further and further into the destruction of your life. God says if you give your life to Christ I will guarantee you that no temptation will ever overtake you. That is so strong that I will not provide the way of escape, the way into obedience, the way into life, the way into growth and maturity. Promises from the heart of God to his children who have accepted Christ as their Savior.
[time=1959] Promises of comfort and conviction and guidance through the ministry of his Holy Spirit which he gives to his children at the point of their conversion so that wherever you are doing and whatever circumstance the Holy Spirit is resident to comfort and to convict and to guide and to lead into the path of life.
[time=1975] Somehow he seems to summarize the thousands of promises that he makes and the one there where he promises to work all things together for good to those who love God and to those who are called according to his purpose.
[time=1987] When life goes in difficult direction and takes bends and directions you wish it had never gone there is the promise that God will inevitably and always and inexorably work it out for your good. Why? Because the dividing wall of sin has been broken down and the promises exist in your life. But where the promises, excuse me, where the wall is still up, where you're locked still behind if you will into the territory of East Berlin there's a whole world of activity that is going on and you can either connect with it nor benefit from it. You can just sometimes see its glimpse as you look over the top of that which separates you from all that God is doing in other people's lives.
[time=2027] And you are left at the end of verse 12 with these hunting words having no hope without God in the world. No hope for a better tomorrow. No hope for the marriage to turn around. No hope for the children to turn around. No hope for the financial situation to recover.
[time=2047] No hope for the rest of your life and no hope for all of eternity for you are without God in the world.
[time=2055] It's a bleak and a barren picture.
[time=2059] If any of you have ever traveled behind the Iron Curtain you'll see as soon as you go. Some years ago I was in China and it was as if I'd been involved in a time warp and there was no color. The clothing had no color and there were no flowers and the buildings had never been painted and it was just this lifeless, dirty, drab existence locked under an oppressive system and freedom was not allowed to have its way.
[time=2091] And so it is in the spiritual dimension when locked behind the great dividing wall of sin. And there is no freedom from sin and sin continues to have its way in your life and your drug into the colorless existence. No hope and without God in the world.
[time=2111] Life behind the wall of sin separated from Christ excluded from the commonwealth of the people of God strangers to the covenants of promise no hope and without God in the world.
[time=2123] Where do we find the power to take the wall down? Well look at verse 13. It's a tremendous truth. But now you can hear the contrast once again in God's word. Here is the condition in which we were born.
[time=2135] Here is the condition being locked behind the great wall of sin but now it says in verse 13. In sharp contrast to that let me tell you what happens when you are in Christ.
[time=2147] When you are no longer in East Germany but you have the privilege of being in West Germany when you are liberated to a new dimension and a new place and a new time and a new experience but now in Christ is what he means there. You who formerly were far off you who by means far off that condition of being separated from Christ and excluded and strangers you who had no claim upon the kingdom of God have been brought near by the blood of Christ. It's an amazing truth. The wall of sin is destroyed not by chisel or by hammer but by blood not your blood not the blood of saints not the blood of martyrs but the blood of Jesus Christ the true in living God incarnate in his son shedding his blood to remove forever and break down the dividing wall. Look at verse 14 it says for he himself is our peace who made both groups into one and here it is and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall only in Jesus. Only in Jesus can the wall come down. Do you have your bulletin with you this morning?
[time=2215] Take it with you. I mean this wasn't even in my sermon but as I looked at the bulletin insert not the insert but the part that says bridging the bridge illustration we had used this in a video a couple of weeks ago and I wanted you to have it because I know many of you are striving to understand and learn it but it fits so perfectly with what we're saying this morning that I can't resist it. Instead of thinking of the separation between us and God as a wall think of it in terms instead of a chasm a great valley a great moat a great distance that separates us from God that goes so deep and try to cross that distance as much as you would and that's the arrows at the top left. They all inevitably lead us to death all the good works we would try to accomplish all the church attendance all the nice deeds and you see the distance is just too far it's just too great a gap ever to be spanned by human achievement and so all of humanity that would land at the bottom of this abyss in the mire of death physical and spiritual death that's the great reality that's what it means to be separated from Christ and excluded from the common wealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise left out there all on your own to try to overcome this incredible chasm that exists between you and God that chasm there because of sin that separates us from a holy God. But the wall comes down and the illustration not a wall coming down but a bridge is being built.
[time=2303] The great bridge that allows us to span the chasm again is not our human effort you'll notice it's the shape of a cross and that is the clear teaching of God's word that chasm can only be spanned through the cross of Christ who died for our sins and on that cross shed his blood to pay the price of eternal damnation our just do for our deeds.
[time=2327] And down the barrier of the dividing wall Christ in his cross spans the chasm it's an amazing truth that's exactly what Paul is saying when he says for he himself is our peace who broke down the barrier of the dividing wall well you see what is life like without the wall where are we once the wall is down look at verse 19 says in verse 19 so then you are no longer strangers you're no longer aliens but you are fellow citizens with the saints and are of God's household instead of being in a distance instead of being a stranger off kind of just looking at what else what everybody else is involved in in their relationship with God instead of feeling the inevitable distance between you and God God makes you fellow citizens with full rights in the kingdom of God there is no level of citizenship there's no caste system here there's no I'm sort of a citizen or over time if I work harder I'll become more of a citizen and notice the note the word saint there some of us think that the word saint you know that's those people that get enshrined they make statues at them put them in churches and the way you get to be a saint is you live so faithfully for God and you sacrifice so much and you give up so much of what you otherwise would have wanted done for the cause of God that eventually somebody says you know you're now a saint and they make a statue no that's not at all true the Bible doesn't teach that anywhere you know what a saint is a saint is a person who gives their life to Christ and the moment they give their life to Christ they become a saint because coming to Christ is not about personal merit before or after it's not about human achievement it's about the completed work of Christ the shedding of his blood and he bestows on whoever will put their faith on him complete and total sainthood at the moment of conversion it's not something you achieve it's not something you work for it's a misguided notion that you see in some of the churches sainthood is given at the instant of conversion because of the merit not of the individual but because of the merit of Christ so you go from being a stranger and an alien to having full rights as citizenship
[time=2459] being coming a saint by the merit of Christ and then the 19 says and becoming a part of God's household we talked about that a couple of weeks ago
[time=2469] Ephesians 1 says it's not enough for God to forgive you for your sins it's not enough for God to make you holy and blameless it's not enough for God to redeem you through the shedding of his blood it's not enough he wants you in his household he wants to adopt you as his son he wants to be in as close as relationship as is possible and that exists only through adoption where you become a part of his household so separated from Christ excluded from the commonwealth of Israel strangers of the covenants of promise without hope without God in the world because of the blood of Christ tearing down the dividing wall you go from that to being a fellow citizen a saint and a very child in the house of God
[time=2521] the backdrop of this passage is up in verse 11 the backdrop of this whole text the experience of these Ephesian Christians
[time=2531] is against the backdrop of the great divide that used to exist between Gentile and Jew the circumcised and the uncircumcised and with the exception of what's going on in the Middle East there is real no animosity I don't think that goes on between Jew and Gentile today but in that particular day there was enormous animosity particularly in the religious arena between Jew and Gentile and here's how it left the Gentile feeling God looked out over the nations of the world and he longed to restore them in a relationship and so he chose the Jews he chose the nation of Israel to be his missionary nation to be the nation that would tell all the other nations about the true and living God right where we started at the beginning of this message there's something in the human nature that wants to be divisive that wants to put barriers that wants to say you can't play at our country club that wants to say you can't work because of your gender I mean there's just something about us and it happened to the Jews as well and instead of being the missionary nation that they were supposed to be they used their privileged position before God to put barriers between the Gentile and the true and living God and they said if you're not a Gentile you can never come to God if you're not a Gentile you don't have a ceremonial law you don't have the birthright you weren't circumcised you just can never get right with God and they looked with disdain and a hard heart on the Gentiles and the wall that Jesus breaks down here is not only the wall of sin that separates man from God the wall that separates the Jew from the Gentile as I was thinking about this you know again the Jew Gentile thing doesn't rage real hot in the city of Fort Wayne but I'll tell you one that does that is definitely an application from this truth there are those who were raised in the church some of you have been going to church since the day you can remember we'll call you the Jew we'll call you the religious person we'll call you the one that's always known about God and then there's another kind of person that runs around the streets of Fort Wayne never been to church never raised in a Christian church didn't didn't have Christian parents didn't didn't have that kind of upbringing maybe went once in a blue moon and you know what the church can sometimes send the message to the unchurched you don't have our ceremonies you don't know our Bible stories you don't even have a Bible and you know what we can in fact become the barrier to God just like the Jews did and the great message of this text if you're here today and you and you don't have a church background and when you come in here you feel a little strange like man these people are speaking a different language and they've got a history and a tradition here that I don't have the great truth of this text is that is that your acceptability before God and your acceptability in this church has nothing to do with whether or not you got raised in the church it only has to do with the person of Jesus Christ and if you would come to Christ then like it says in this text fellow citizens instant St. Hood and a child of God a member of his household and then certainly this church an expression of the household of God a full fledged bona fide participant in all the activities of this church it has nothing to do with how you might have been raised in the church or out of the church one of the things that I enjoy so much about the direction of our church is our small group ministry I'm finding in my small group an opportunity to get to know people at a level that I might not ever have gotten to know them where we always locked in a large group with one person talking and most people listening as I was preparing this message and reading through this text and thinking about its application to our day one of the guys in my small group came to mind because he wasn't raised in the church never had a church experience really as a child parents didn't go to church parents weren't saved grandparents weren't saved and yet somehow or another God reached out and he went from being raised without any church experience to becoming a leader in this church and I thought you might enjoy hearing his testimony and so I've asked him to come and Jim if you do that now for a number of years Jim has now has been saved he's gone from the outside as a stranger and alien to being a citizen I don't know if we should say saint yet I don't know maybe his wife would argue with that concept certainly positionally in Christ a saint and a leader in our church don't ask my kids about that either as Russell was describing people on the on the outside and on the inside I kind of went back and was like rewinding
[time=2821] a tape into my childhood and I realized that under normal circumstances under normal circumstances I wouldn't be up here this morning I wouldn't be at Black Hawk Baptist Church I wouldn't be at any church about right now I would still be in my bathrobe and I would have the journal gazette and I would be going through the Sunday paper because I like to read the Sunday paper and I would be channel surfing and I wouldn't really feel bad about that I just wasn't into this religious thing and I remember growing up in our family and I came from a good family my parents were very moral there were never any real serious problems in our family that we just weren't into this religious thing like some people in our neighborhood were and I remember once in a while on Easter or Christmas maybe every other Easter every other Christmas we would get our suits on and we would go to church just any church just to kind of say that we had been there but there wasn't any real if we missed it it was no problem at all there was a church about a mile down the road from our house people would always drive by our house going to church and I hated to be outside the house on Sunday morning and have these people see that I wasn't going to church I remember running out to get the Sunday newspaper one time when a car came up the hill and it was people from that church and they kind of did one of these when they were buying their I was clutching the paper there's that center he's not in church this morning and one Sunday my dad had me cut the grass in the front yard and that was an ordeal it took about 25 minutes and all the people from the church drove by and they saw me out there working and we weren't in church but I looked at it this way some people are in a collecting stamp some people like radio controlled airplanes some people are religious but that wasn't us and we didn't really have a need for it after all we believed in God we believed that Jesus existed we lived in America and we didn't do anything bad so when we died we would go to heaven because of all those things and we didn't do anything bad never killed anybody you know hell is for people like Adolf Hitler and Charles Manson but not for us we're just normal everyday folks and that's the way that it went down the road about two miles from our house there was a tiny little brick ranch and in that ranch lived Mrs. Bechtel, Mrs. Bechtel the religious fanatic everybody knows her religious she was the religious fanatic and about every few months we would get a letter in the mail open it up and inside would be at what's called a tract a religious piece of paper and it would have these religious sayings on it like you must be born again or have you been saved and I would just kind of look at that and kind of give me the shakes I would just kind of put it aside and say that's just that fanaticism coming out
[time=2977] and so we lived our lives one day my dad was involved in a very serious traffic accident
[time=2983] and my mom was in the car behind him they were bringing supplies back for our family business and a drunk hit him head on the first passerby after hurt my mom's car was a pastor's
[time=2993] wife and she went to the hospital with my mom and ministered to my mom in this difficult time
[time=2999] and then her husband who was a student over at Grace Theological Seminary came up to the hospital and he visited my dad several times in the hospital dad eventually got out of the hospital came back home
[time=3009] and we felt kind of a sense of obligation to go to this guy's church the minister's church because you know he had come to visit dad so often so we thought we would go
[time=3019] once or twice and then that would be the end of it and our obligation would be fulfilled so the appointed Sunday came along and we got all dressed up and we drove to this church of about a hundred people and when we walked in the visitors had to wear ribbons oh I hated that big yellow ribbon that said visitor now there's only a hundred people in the church you know so everybody knew that we we just didn't belong there you know who are these people coming in
[time=3044] and we had and so he had to stand up and everything else and it was a spectacle and I just felt like crawling under the pew but the people there were very very nice and the pastor was friendly we enjoyed what he said from the pulpit
[time=3055] so we we kind of started going back and suddenly it became apparent that he was preaching something from the Bible
[time=3062] that that we had never heard before we only had one Bible in our family it was the family Bible
[time=3068] and it weighed about 20 pounds it was one of these great big things that you have on your coffee table and the only time I had ever looked in it was to see the births and deaths and things in the front to kind of see who my relatives were and you didn't carry that big thing to church we didn't know where Philippians was at and he was preaching from Philippians one Sunday preaching from Ephesians and one day he said to me you know you don't go to heaven by by going to church every Sunday
[time=3091] and I said well why not you know to me you go to church and then you when you die you go to heaven because you've been a good person
[time=3099] you want to church that's fine but if you haven't anything bad then you'll go to heaven he said no it's not the way it goes I said what do you mean and he said he said you're not you're not guaranteed of going to heaven by being a good person
[time=3110] because we're all sinners I said yeah well we're sinners I do bad things but I don't do real bad things so I go to heaven no he said what you've got to understand is that salvation is a gift that God gives you
[time=3121] that we're all under sin everybody in our church the little church that we went to and visited everybody in that church was a sinner just like we were we had something in common and because of that the Bible said that we would not be able to go to heaven and I had never heard that before
[time=3135] my parents had never heard it before I remember Ephesians chapter 2 verses 8 and 9 where it says by grace you're saved through faith and not of works lest any man should boast I remember looking at that and it was like a light went on like oh no kidding this is what the Bible is about you've got to accept Christ as your Savior as payment for the sin in your life and I really felt a conviction to do that and every Sunday morning he would have what's called invitation he would ask people to come forward and accept Christ as their Savior and they would do that during an invitation him and so I remember one Sunday very very distinctly I had I had talked to the pastor I had read
[time=3169] Ephesians and I really felt convicted that I ought to go forward and accept Christ because then I could
[time=3175] know for certain I was going to heaven and if I didn't do that scripture said that I wasn't going to be one of those people going to heaven and we stood up to sing and I really felt like I should go forward but something was keeping me back and I remember grabbing ahold of the pew in front of me like this and just grabbing it and not wanting to go up and you know they're always saying all the verses when it happens you know amazing grace that was all for him you know on and on and on and every verse it gets worse and worse and I'm going like that anyway the song ended I didn't go up we went home and I said to my mom I said
[time=3204] you know I really felt like stepping out and walking forward to the front of that church in front of all those people accepting Christ and she kind of smiling she said well it's a good thing you didn't do that and I said well
[time=3215] why and she said well because the seat of your pants is ripped out so in a way I'm glad I didn't go forward
[time=3223] that might have been providential but the next Sunday I went forward and accepted Christ as my savior
[time=3229] and virtually every member of my family has come to Christ as the result of that traffic accident
[time=3235] and that invitation to church in our lives were changed 180 degrees it has had a profound impact
[time=3241] in the lives of all the people in our family and I think back and think to myself what would have happened had that not happened and we had not gone to that church had not been invited and had not responded I can guarantee you that beyond the shadow of a doubt I would be sitting home this morning and I would not be here
[time=3256] and if you're here in that position this morning realize that it's more than just a curiosity as you see people who go to church and who don't go to church we all have the same problem we all have sin it's just that the people at Blackhawk who claim Christ as savior have appropriated Christ's death in their life
[time=3273] for the payment for their sin and because of that we're in Christ and that's the message we're sharing and so the question I would leave with you this morning is what have you done with Christ?
[time=3283] Thank you Jim, it's great to watch Jim and his family live God's truth to the best of their ability
[time=3291] and see the fruit of it coming out in their life and the difference they make even in our church between the services a lady came up to me and she said I was born and raised in Laos
[time=3302] and was raised a Buddhist I didn't just not have a church I had a church it was just a wrong church
[time=3310] I've been raised completely and totally in that way of thinking and through a tremendous set of circumstances
[time=3317] of course the communist oppression that went there or tripped into Russia and then from Russia to Italy and eventually to America
[time=3324] all through that it wasn't a car accident for her it was a sense of destitution a personal sense of lostness
[time=3331] and a kind of weariness of hired and she began to seek for God kind of took a big step in going into a church
[time=3339] over in Italy and got kind of a feeling like you know something's happening here this is the right part
[time=3345] and then many years later took another step towards understanding who God was and eventually prayed to receive Christ
[time=3351] through the ministry of this church many many years ago about 15 years ago
[time=3357] so you know the great message of this truth to you who are here today that have no church background
[time=3365] or have a church background that hasn't taught you clearly what the Bible says that salvation is a matter of grace
[time=3371] it's a matter of the person of Jesus Christ the wall comes down only through the power of his blood you just need to know that God is standing with his arms wide open and he's saying you know I don't want you to feel excluded
[time=3384] I don't want you to feel second class I don't want you to feel like it's too late for you because you didn't get raised this way because it isn't he wants to create something new with you make you a full fledged bona fide citizen in the kingdom of God
[time=3398] well we just stand with me now as we have a closing word of prayer
[time=3404] our gracious God and Heavenly Father we're thankful that you are not a God that looks upon people's color
[time=3414] you're truly colorblind and you're not a God that worries about past religious backgrounds or the utter absence of that
[time=3422] you just say to whoever it is no matter where you've been no matter what you've done no matter what your experience is no matter how you were raised you just say come to Christ
[time=3430] and in Christ the whole matter is resolved once and for all
[time=3436] if you're here today and you feel the Spirit of God saying that to you if you're here today and you feel something going on inside your heart and you know that God is speaking to you
[time=3446] and you know the wall of sin is as high as it's ever been in your life it's thick and it separates you from God
[time=3454] and you want that wall to come down and you want to be right with God I invite you to pray right now to receive Christ as your Savior you can follow along as I say it out loud you say it in your heart God will hear you and God will save you right now my gracious God and Heavenly Father I know that I am a sinner
[time=3476] I know that I have piled one sin upon the other until this great wall separates me from you
[time=3482] but I believe that Jesus and the sacrifice of his blood tears that wall down
[time=3489] so I accept Jesus Christ as my personal Lord and Savior the payment for my sins the bridge across which I can travel and not go forever into the abyss of death
[time=3502] I thank you for saving me I thank you for making me a citizen of your kingdom
[time=3508] for making me a saint through the merit of Christ for adopting me as your child
[time=3515] we thank you for the power and the wonder of the person of Christ and whose name we pray and all God's people say amen In a moment I'll give you our address so you can receive a copy of lessons on assurance
