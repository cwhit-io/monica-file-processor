[time=30] This is the Sunday Morning Worship Service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=53] Thank you for joining us.
[time=54] Today in our continued study of the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus tells us that truth-telling is the standard if you want into his kingdom.
[time=61] Only the people who have never told a lie will ever get in, unless you tell the truth about your line and ask to be forgiven.
[time=67] Sound confusing?
[time=68] It isn't.
[time=69] Stay with us today and find out the truth about lying.
[time=72] Now let's join our service.
[time=88] [MUSIC - 954 seconds]
[time=1046] Perfectly honest with you earlier, Deb.
[time=1050] This won't change our relationship, will it?
[time=1053] Oh, don't be silly. Of course it won't.
[time=1056] [buzzer] [laughter] Are you sure?
[time=1065] What I lie to you...
[time=1068] Would you mind rephrasing that?
[time=1070] Oh, look, there's Mr. Nichols right now.
[time=1073] Listen, now try to calm down. We don't want that going off in the middle of your meeting.
[time=1079] And hopefully the subject of your health won't come up.
[time=1082] I doubt if Mr. Nichols is interested in damaged property.
[time=1086] damaged property?
[time=1088] Shh, there he is right now.
[time=1090] Yahoo! Mr. Nichols, here we are.
[time=1095] Debra, you look lovely as always.
[time=1098] [laughter] Why thank you, that was so considerate of you.
[time=1103] Did you hear something?
[time=1105] Me? Yes, I mean no. I mean, I don't think so.
[time=1109] [buzzer] You can control yourself or shut that thing off.
[time=1112] I can't.
[time=1113] You must be Stan.
[time=1115] Yes, sir. It was very nice for you to take the time to meet with me.
[time=1118] Of course. Debra's told me all about you.
[time=1121] I mean, she thinks you'd be perfect for this opening we have in our ad department.
[time=1126] [buzzer] There's that sound again.
[time=1129] Um, a bee. It must be a bee.
[time=1131] [buzzer] But I think it's gone now.
[time=1135] No need to worry about the bee, sir. It won't bother you.
[time=1139] No problem. Bees don't bother me much.
[time=1143] So, did you have an opportunity to look over my drawings?
[time=1147] Uh, yes I did, and I was quite impressed.
[time=1150] You know, Mr. Nichols has an excellent eye for new talent.
[time=1155] It's why he's known for it in the company.
[time=1158] [buzzer] What's wrong with you?
[time=1161] That pacemaker is doing this interview a lousy job.
[time=1164] What is the matter with you? Are you having a heart attack or what?
[time=1167] My heart is fine, but I think this interview was over before it began.
[time=1173] What do you mean by that, young man?
[time=1175] Just when I said, for some reason that I don't yet understand, your mind is already made up.
[time=1180] I'll have you know I'm very open-minded and fair, and all my employees are very loyal, right, Deborah?
[time=1187] Almost certainly.
[time=1189] [buzzer] That's a lie, Deb.
[time=1192] Uh, what's the end? I thought you knew me better than that.
[time=1196] Now, would I lie just to impress my boss?
[time=1199] [buzzer] You shut that lousy pacemaker off?
[time=1202] It's not a pacemaker.
[time=1204] It's a device that beeps whenever someone tells a lie.
[time=1208] All those beeps you've been hearing are simply a result of the lies we've been telling.
[time=1217] Nonsense. I would never lie.
[time=1221] I would rarely lie.
[time=1223] I can houch for that.
[time=1226] Seems to work every time.
[time=1229] Wait a minute.
[time=1233] That thing beeped when you said you liked my new dress.
[time=1236] Well, I didn't know it worked then.
[time=1238] Hey, didn't that beep when you said I was a great boss?
[time=1247] I don't think so.
[time=1249] Oops.
[time=1250] And you didn't like my drawings.
[time=1253] Well, they weren't bad.
[time=1255] And what difference does it make in our relationship if I had a bad heart?
[time=1259] It doesn't make any difference at all. This is not mine.
[time=1262] Why, Deborah, you're good at this line. I'm surprised.
[time=1265] Now, Deb, when I said I liked your dress, I just meant it.
[time=1268] No, wait a minute.
[time=1270] You better make it up.
[time=1271] I know they're not complaining.
[time=1273] Okay, I'll preach on one condition. The machine's off.
[time=1277] Boy.
[time=1281] Let me invite you to take your Bible and come to Matthew chapter 5.
[time=1291] Suppose, for a moment, suppose for just a moment that the Lord were to say,
[time=1300] "Okay, entrance into heaven is dependent upon just one thing."
[time=1307] I mean, if you can get this one thing right, you have free passage into the kingdom of heaven.
[time=1314] And suppose if that one thing were this, that you had never told a lie.
[time=1323] Now, I don't know about you, but I think the issue would not be how many of us are still in the running.
[time=1330] The issue would be how early most of us got knocked out of the running.
[time=1334] I mean, how early is your first lie? Can you remember?
[time=1337] I gave some thought to that this week.
[time=1339] Thinking about the first time I can consciously remember the feelings of deceit, the occasion of my first lie.
[time=1345] Now, I'm quite confident it must have been prior to this, but this is as far back as my memory goes.
[time=1350] My folks smoked, they smoked Taringtons, you know the ones where you'd rather fight than switch.
[time=1356] And being a young wee little boy there in the first grade, second grade, I saw that, and I thought, well, that looks pretty cool.
[time=1363] But I also knew that if I did that, I'd get spanked, and that didn't sound too cool.
[time=1367] So I snuck in the kitchen when nobody was there up on the counter, opened the cabinet, reached in the cart, and grabbed a pack of Tarington cigarettes and some matches to boot, and then thought, where do I smoke these where I don't get caught?
[time=1379] Went outside, and there was this little crawl space, a little door that led into the crawl space underneath our house.
[time=1385] It was cool there, because in the summer months it could get hot in LA, and it was always cool underneath in the crawl space, and then there was this really cool little mesh screen deal so that Eric could get in and out, and I could sit in that underneath that spot and look out under the street, kind of keep an eye on what was going on, and smoke myself at Tarington, which I did. Second grade, eight years old.
[time=1404] I can remember coming out of there and making a clean getaway. It wasn't like, what were you doing out of the house, but I'd been gone a little while.
[time=1413] And my mom said, now, where have you been? And there I was at the moment of truth.
[time=1421] And I remember lying very clearly. I remember saying that I was up in the backyard in the tree house,
[time=1429] and hoping desperately that, you know, she hadn't gone out there and looked for me or called for me, and apparently she hadn't, and she bought the lie, and I was off, you know, in certain sense, scot-free.
[time=1440] I think that's the earliest memory I have of my first lie. Now, what about you?
[time=1445] Wish we had time. I bet we'd have some incredible stories coming out of a group this size about the first lie you can remember telling.
[time=1453] A recent survey indicated that 75% of Americans will lie if it suits their purposes and if they think they can get away with it.
[time=1461] Business people lie, sales people lie, doctors lie, teachers, writers, reporters lie, even politicians and attorneys have been known to lie from time to time.
[time=1473] We have a society that lies. You know who else lies? Preachers lie.
[time=1479] This week, Friday, in fact, I was driving with a friend, and he lovingly confronted me about a commitment that I had made over a year ago that should have been fulfilled by then.
[time=1490] And it wasn't a commitment that I'd made here at work. It was a commitment that I had made in the context of our relationship, and I hadn't fulfilled it.
[time=1497] In that sense, broken my word. I in that sense had lied. Now, I didn't lie to him knowing I wouldn't do that or intentionally deceiving him, but as it worked out, I didn't keep my word.
[time=1507] Even preachers lie. Let me tell you some things about most people I know.
[time=1513] Most people I know want to go to heaven, and I mean by that most people that I know believe there is a heaven and they believe there is a hell,
[time=1524] and they would rather go to heaven than hell. A few people I've met aren't in that category.
[time=1530] My grandfather, for example, he was a professed agnostic, and that means he doesn't know.
[time=1535] And I'd ask about heaven, and he didn't know, and I'd ask about hell, and he didn't know, and I'd ask about God, and he didn't know.
[time=1540] But most of the people that I've known want to go to heaven.
[time=1545] Something else about most people I know, they have a sense, they have a belief that at the end, I mean after life, when it's all said and done,
[time=1553] there's going to come a day of reckoning.
[time=1557] And they believe that God is going to look at the quality of their deeds and make a decision based upon their deeds,
[time=1564] whether they get to go to heaven or whether they get to go to hell.
[time=1568] Most people I know believe that.
[time=1572] Here's another thing that most people I know do.
[time=1575] Most people I know adjust the standard that they think God will evaluate them by.
[time=1583] Most people that I know are not willing to live with the pressure and the depression and the devastation and the discouragement,
[time=1592] that if God were to have a high enough standard, and I brought my deeds and I brought the relative value of my good works to that standard that I would be found wanting,
[time=1602] then have to live day after day with the awareness that when it's all said and done, I'm probably not going to heaven, I'm probably going to hell.
[time=1609] And so to remedy that, most people I know adjust the standard down to something they feel they can achieve.
[time=1617] They adjust the standard of God down to get it in the bounds of something they feel they can achieve.
[time=1622] And I mean just a little exercise like we've done already this morning.
[time=1627] I mean if, and in fact it is, if one of the criteria to get into heaven was that you could never have lied in your past or in your future until you die,
[time=1638] I mean if that's one of the questions, one of the points of evaluation, and I say again that is in fact one of the points of evaluation to get into heaven,
[time=1645] that you have never lied, that you have always told the truth, that is so discouraging and so overwhelming and so depressing that most people make a mental decision to simply adjust the standard of God.
[time=1656] And say to themselves well there's got to be a way around that one.
[time=1659] I mean if it's not that then everybody would go to hell and everybody would go to hell do they?
[time=1664] And so we begin to adjust the standard down.
[time=1668] Look at Matthew 5 chapter 24 a minute.
[time=1671] There's a group of guys and they're in the process of adjusting the standard down, they're called scribes and Pharisees.
[time=1676] Jesus is preaching in this, the Sermon on the Mount, and the whole point of his message is right here in verse 20.
[time=1682] He says this, "I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and the Pharisees, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven."
[time=1693] Now Jesus took a hold of some religious people in the community, they're called scribes and Pharisees, and they would have been the more dedicated people.
[time=1701] They would have been the people in that city, in that town, who were working the hardest at trying to earn heaven.
[time=1708] So they were out in front of the pack, they were doing better than everybody else.
[time=1712] And Jesus says to them unless you're better than those guys, you'll never go to heaven.
[time=1716] And you say to yourself well what was wrong with their standard?
[time=1719] What was wrong with what they were doing?
[time=1722] Why was what they were doing not good enough to get into heaven?
[time=1727] Well that's what he's talking about.
[time=1729] Look at verse 21, he said you've heard that you should not commit murder and that's true, that's one of the ten commandments.
[time=1735] And murder is against the law of God, and if you murder someone, and then you stand before God at the end of the age, you don't go to heaven.
[time=1744] They knew that, and they were committed not to murder.
[time=1749] But Jesus says wait a minute you guys, there's more than just the physical act of murdering somebody that God is going to evaluate you on.
[time=1757] He says in verse 22, "But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court." Everybody who says Raka which was a kind of a cuss word of old.
[time=1765] Everybody who says you fool from an angry heart and suddenly these scribes and these Pharisees and everybody who is listening that day,
[time=1773] and everybody who's listening this day must come to the reality that God does not just evaluate us on our external behavior,
[time=1782] whether or not we've taken and murdered someone.
[time=1785] God looks into the heart.
[time=1788] God's standard does not just include external behavior, it includes attitudes and heart motivations,
[time=1795] and he is saying though you may have never murdered someone actually and physically, if you have been angry with them from your heart you fall short of the standard of God.
[time=1807] You see in the Old Testament and this wasn't anything new, God had said this, that you shall love me, now watch this, with all of your heart, with all of your mind, with all of your soul.
[time=1821] To be in relationship with God, I mean to honor God and to be acceptable to get into heaven, you not only have to obey all the outward commands, you have to do it every minute of every day from a pure heart of love and devotion to God.
[time=1835] You see, they couldn't measure up to that, I can't measure up to that, I don't know anybody who can measure up to that.
[time=1841] And rather than live with the rejection and the discouragement of having to admit that you don't live up to the standard of God,
[time=1850] men are prone, women are prone to drop the standard to leave parts out and say you know what,
[time=1858] it's probably just enough that we didn't actually kill the guy.
[time=1862] God will probably let us in on the basis that we didn't kill the guy.
[time=1867] And Jesus is trying to say time out, time out, don't lie to yourself, don't deceive yourself on that one, that's not how it's going to work.
[time=1877] There was another issue in verse 23, these people were saying you know, it's got to be good enough with God that we come to church, right?
[time=1885] I mean that's got to count for something with God, I mean it's after all, it's his church and we come and we do the worship thing and we're faithful to it and we do it on a regular basis even, that's got to count for something.
[time=1894] Look at verse 23, if therefore you are presenting your offering at the altar, that was how they went to church in that day.
[time=1900] And there you remember that your brother has something against you, leave your offering there before the altar, go your way and first be reconciled to your brother and then come and present your offering.
[time=1910] And what he is saying is, I am not impressed by the external evidence of your body sitting in church somewhere and you pretending to worship me.
[time=1920] When you are at violation with a broken relationship somewhere with somebody, because true worship comes from the heart and you can't give love to me and receive love to me when you are in a broken relationship with somebody else.
[time=1933] So get up out of your chair, he says, and go out that door and get that relationship fixed first, which means confession and humility and seeking people's forgiveness from your heart and then coming back and being ready to commune with the true and living God in church.
[time=1948] And Jesus says it's not enough, it's not just an external performance of showing up and giving your offering at the altar, it's a thing that happens in your heart.
[time=1957] He takes in another step. In verse 20, 70 says you have heard that you shall not commit adultery, well that's another one of the 10 commandments and that is true.
[time=1966] You're not supposed to commit adultery, you're not supposed to have a sexual relationship with somebody who is not your spouse.
[time=1973] And you know what, these scribes and these Pharisees were pretty committed not to doing that, they were very committed not to doing that.
[time=1980] And they thought well based on the fact that we're not doing the adultery thing, when we get there in the final analysis, God's going to look at us and say come on into heaven, but Jesus is wait a minute, wait a minute, it's more than the external, it's more than failing to just commit adultery.
[time=1996] It's something we're going to evaluate in terms of what's in your heart and so he says in verse 28, but I say to you that everyone who looks on a woman to lust for her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.
[time=2009] God's going to look right past the behavior, the absence of adultery, he's going to look into the heart and if he sees their heart that has been looking at other women and lusting after those women, you know, mental sex if you will with other women or men, or excuse me women after men,
[time=2028] he's saying time out you violated the standard, you are not acceptable to God and you will not be admitted into heaven.
[time=2037] So that's one of the things that most people do. Most people I know want to go to heaven.
[time=2045] Most people I know believe there'll be a final day where they stand before God and their deeds will be examined.
[time=2051] And most people I know are pretty committed to adjusting the standard way below the actual standard so they can have a sense that they're okay.
[time=2062] And Jesus says that is a false sense of security and Jesus says I love you too much to let you labor under that false sense of security only to come to the final day and the final analysis and then be confronted with the reality that you are unacceptable.
[time=2078] And so he does it here in the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=2082] Now there's a second thing that most people I know do.
[time=2087] Some of the commandments of God are too hard to keep even if you just do it externally.
[time=2092] I mean some of the commandments that God has for us are too difficult and too hard even if you do it with no heart.
[time=2101] I mean just to observe it never commit adultery never murder.
[time=2104] A lot of people can keep those even though it's not a heart love relationship with God but there are some that nobody can keep even if they don't give a rip about God.
[time=2112] You want to know what one of them is? Tell them the truth. Tell them the truth.
[time=2117] There isn't a person in here who's kept the truth their whole life.
[time=2121] In fact I've been to say there isn't a person in here who can make it to the next 365 days without telling some kind of a lie without being involved in some kind of a misrepresentation.
[time=2130] And so there's one of those externals that you can't even keep from an empty heart much less from a heart of love to God.
[time=2137] And so most people I know find a way to adjust even that external standard and that's exactly what these guys were doing.
[time=2145] God had long called for truth and for truth telling.
[time=2150] God had said in the ninth commandment that you shall not bear false witness.
[time=2153] Now you say why did he do that? I'll tell you why I did that.
[time=2157] God from all eternity past had been in perfect relationship inside the Trinity.
[time=2161] God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit.
[time=2164] And they had enjoyed such a rich experience and that rich experience was entirely based on one thing, truth.
[time=2174] They had never lied to each other. They had never deceived each other.
[time=2179] They had never told a falsehood and as a result they were able to have trust and respect.
[time=2186] They were able to really enjoy the fullness of relationship.
[time=2190] And so when God got ready to create you and me, when God got ready to create the human being, he said you know what?
[time=2198] If I don't give them the law of truth, then they will never even begin to experience the kind of relationship that we experience in the Trinity, which is what life is all about.
[time=2210] And so he very graciously and very compassionately put a boundary around what we say.
[time=2215] And what he said was tell each other the truth and keep your commitments because where you have that a relationship has two things, trust and respect.
[time=2225] And if you don't keep your word, you can't really trust each other and you can't really respect each other.
[time=2230] And if you can't do those two things, relationship is very, very superficial.
[time=2234] Relationship is very, very tentative. Relationship is a lot like isolation.
[time=2239] Relationships that are not built on truth that have respect and confidence in each other, it's like walking around with other people, but you're totally alone.
[time=2251] Could you imagine the chaos that would come to the United States of America if we had a different value about truth?
[time=2259] Could you imagine if America said the greatest value is lying not truth?
[time=2264] Could you imagine if when you walked into a courtroom and you swore on a stack of Bibles what you were swearing to was to lie instead of to truth?
[time=2272] Could you imagine if when you stood up in front of a bunch of people and married a man or a woman off and they committed to deceive each other, they committed to lie to each other instead of committed to tell the truth to each other and keep their promises?
[time=2285] Could you imagine if business contracts were tried to be built on the premise of lies and deceits, how would we function?
[time=2293] The whole thing would just collapse, where there is not truth, where there is not promise keeping, there is no possibility for relationship.
[time=2304] And in that scenario I just described, the only person in the entire country that you could trust would be yourself.
[time=2311] You would be totally alone. You couldn't trust your wife, you couldn't trust the police, you couldn't trust the courts, you couldn't trust the government, to be absolute total anarchy and chaos.
[time=2327] You see, when God said to the human race, "Tell the truth," he said a good thing. He said a good thing because civilization and relationship are impossible without it.
[time=2339] And so we look at that and we understand that and we agree with that. And we say, "You know, that's very true. A civilization must be based on truth, not falsehood."
[time=2349] But when we personalize it, when we begin to ask ourselves the question, "Okay, I get it, but have I, am I the truthful person that will gain admission into the kingdom of heaven?"
[time=2360] Have I told truth all my life in every relationship? This thundering no comes back over and over and over again.
[time=2371] And so you end up doing what the scribes and the Pharisees are doing. And you begin to adjust the standard of God down lower than he intended it, so you can feel good about yourself with a sense of false security.
[time=2385] Now how did they do it? Look at verse 33. He says, "Again you have heard that the ancients were told, you shall not make false vows, but shall fulfill your vows to the Lord."
[time=2395] Now listen to that. You shall fulfill your vows to the Lord. Now that's a quote out of an Old Testament passage, but it's actually kind of a manipulation of a couple of Old Testament passages.
[time=2407] Number one, God said always tell the truth, but then he said this, then he said this, "If you make a vow, if you make a vow, and you promise to keep your word based upon the God of heaven."
[time=2420] I mean that is, that is a promise you can never ever ever ever break. He's saying you should never break any promise, but if you bring God into the thing there should be a sense of holy awe and you make sure you keep that one above all else.
[time=2433] But what these guys did was they said this, "The only vow you have to keep is the one that you keep when you vow to the Lord."
[time=2444] All the other vows, you can break all those and God doesn't mad at you for those because you didn't promise according to the Lord.
[time=2451] See what he's saying? "You shall not make false vows, but shall fulfill your vows to the Lord." And the implication and the emphasis they put on was to the Lord.
[time=2459] As if to say only the vows that you make to the Lord are the ones you have to keep. All the rest of them, no problem, you can break those without any bad conscience.
[time=2469] You know what it is? It's just like when we were kids. It's just a grown-up deal like when we were kids.
[time=2474] You know what we would do? When we wanted to make sure that the deal would go we were trying to make with our buddies? And they didn't believe us because they knew us. They knew we were liars.
[time=2483] And you're trying to get them to trust you on this one because you really want it to work. So finally you say, "Listen, I'll tell you what, cross my heart and hope to die stick a needle in my eye."
[time=2493] And you're like, "Did that work? Did they believe me this time?" Now see the scenario is of course he's got an ice cream and you've got the bike.
[time=2500] And you want the ice cream and he wants to ride your bike for an hour. And the deal you're trying to make is you give me the ice cream, I give you the bike.
[time=2506] But he knows you, he knows you're a liar, he's been burned by you in the past so you do the, "Man, no, no, this one. I mean, I'm telling you this is the truth. I won't lie this time."
[time=2514] In fact, cross my heart, hope to die stick a needle in my eye. See? And the sucker believes you. He hands you his ice cream.
[time=2524] And you get on your bike before you notice this is what's happening. You start to pedal away and you get your necessary distance and you go, "Yeah, have my fingers crossed!"
[time=2531] Right? King's X! King's X! That's all this is. This is a grown-up version of playing King's X.
[time=2541] The only promises I really have to keep are the ones that I vow to the Lord. And if I didn't vow it to the Lord, then I don't have to keep it and it's a legitimate breaking of my promise.
[time=2552] They, of course, were lying to themselves.
[time=2557] Well, how were they doing it? Look at verse 34, "But I say to you, now Jesus is going to confront their practice. Make no oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God."
[time=2568] They would swear. And instead of saying, "You know, cross my heart, hope to die stick a needle in my eye," they'd say, "I promise I'll give you this ox on the appointed day, and I promise you this by heaven."
[time=2580] And it convinced the guy. And the guy says, "Okay." So they make the transaction, or the first part of the transaction, but later he comes back and he says, "No, I don't have to keep that promise, because all I did was I promised by heaven. I didn't promise by God."
[time=2593] But the Lord says in verse 34, "Wait a minute, it's the throne of God. Heaven is the throne of God. Heaven is a part of what God has done, and you can't just swear by heaven and not swear by God, because God created the heavens."
[time=2604] It's just throne room. Then they would say in verse 35, "Oh, I promise you, oh man, I'll keep this promise. I swear to you by the earth itself."
[time=2613] And in their minds they're thinking, "I don't have to keep this promise, because I'm not swearing by God, I'm just swearing by the earth." But Jesus says, "For it is the footstool of his feet." The earth is the footstool of his feet. In other words, that has a relationship with God, and you can't swear by the earth and not swear by God at the same time.
[time=2627] Others of them would try to do their king's ex deal this way. Verse 35, "I swear to you, I'll keep my promise by Jerusalem."
[time=2634] And of course, they'd add some stuff. That's where the temple is. That's where the altar is. That's the great holy city.
[time=2640] And I swear to you by that, you wouldn't think I'd break a valley made by Jerusalem, do you? Hoping the guy would believe him.
[time=2646] Then they'd come back later and say, "No, no, no, King's ex. I didn't swear by God himself. I just swore by Jerusalem."
[time=2652] And Jesus says, "No, no, no, no. Jerusalem is the city of the great king." That also is in relationship with God.
[time=2659] Verse 36, "Nor shall you make any oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black."
[time=2667] That's pre-clear all days.
[time=2669] What they were doing is they say, "I swear by my own life. I swear by my own destiny. I swear by the eventuality of my own life.
[time=2676] I swear to you by everything that's ever going to happen to me." And Jesus is saying, "You can't even control the color of your hair much less the rest of your life."
[time=2683] You can't swear by that. That means nothing.
[time=2686] Then what's he say? Verse 37.
[time=2689] "But let your statement be yes, yes, or no, no, and anything beyond this is evil."
[time=2696] He's saying, "You want to get into my kingdom? You want to go to heaven? Here's how it works.
[time=2700] You are a person of such total and complete honesty and integrity that in all your life, all you've ever needed was one word answer.
[time=2710] And it was completely and totally binding and you never violated it." Will you sell me your farm for X amount of dollars? And you say, "Yes."
[time=2724] And you're bound by your word. And everybody knows you're bound by your word, because nobody's ever heard you break your word.
[time=2731] Nobody's ever heard you break your word. Nobody's ever even thought you could break your word.
[time=2735] Somebody says, "If I do this, will you do this?" And you say, "No."
[time=2741] And you never do. In the context of last week, if I turn out to be a wife that you don't want me to be, I mean, if I don't age the right way or if I don't cook the meals just the way you like them, will you divorce me?
[time=2751] And at the wedding value you say, "No, I will not divorce you under any circumstance." Boom. Never get divorced. Why? Because he gave his word.
[time=2761] Jesus is saying that people who get into heaven keep their word every single time and they don't need contracts and they don't need oaths and they don't need vows and they don't need attorneys and they don't need anything.
[time=2771] All they do is they say one word once and they're bound to that course the rest of their life.
[time=2776] They're of perfect truthfulness and integrity. But you're yes, be yes and you're nobody no.
[time=2785] Anybody here qualify?
[time=2789] I don't. I don't qualify for this. I haven't qualified for this in my memory since second grade.
[time=2800] There's drama brought to mind something in my life.
[time=2803] I remember very clearly I had this here in my notes even before I saw the drama but I had a discussion with my mother.
[time=2810] I was about 14 years old and my mother and dad they believed the Bible all their life and still due to this day and I'm so thankful for that.
[time=2816] And she had a desire to instill principles and values in me and I'm thankful for that even though they were very late in blooming.
[time=2824] We had a conversation when I was about 14 and she said, "Now Russell, I don't remember if I had just lied to her and she had caught me.
[time=2830] I don't think that was it. I think she was suspicious that I might have lied." But somehow we got on the topic.
[time=2835] And she said, "Now Russell, never ever ever lie. Never lie to me."
[time=2841] She said, "Never lie to your father. Never lie to a teacher. Never lie to anyone. Never lie."
[time=2848] Because she said, "If you learn to lie to me or someone else, you have taught yourself to lie to yourself."
[time=2857] And as soon as you can start lying to yourself, then you're capable of committing any kind of act conceivable in the human mind
[time=2865] because you know how to lie to yourself and to justify and to rationalize and then any course of behavior is within the realm of possibility.
[time=2873] She's never lied to me and never learned a lie to yourself.
[time=2877] Then she said this.
[time=2879] What happens when a person lies to another person is you take a chunk out of that relationship.
[time=2885] The integrity factor of that relationship gets severely damaged because the person you lie to never forgets that you lied to them.
[time=2894] And they believe in their heart you're always capable of lying to them again.
[time=2898] If you can lie once, you can lie twice.
[time=2901] So she's given me this big speech and it was all pretty true.
[time=2904] That's all pretty true.
[time=2905] Never lie because you lie to yourself and when you lie to other people, the relationship is irreparably damaged.
[time=2912] And then at 14 years of age, she says this. Now, this is the part I didn't like.
[time=2917] She says, "Now, you've never lied, have you? I mean, you've never lied to me." And I'm like, "Well, I'm 14 years old. What do you mean? I'm thinking of my head. Of course I've lied to you."
[time=2929] I mean, all the time.
[time=2931] But what, I'm going to say yes after that speech?
[time=2934] I mean, you just give me the biggest speech in the world about never lying, never lying to you.
[time=2937] If you lie, you lose your relationship with a person and you never really get it back in full course and it was like, "What? I'm going to say yes. I lie to you after that big speech."
[time=2947] So I said, "No." I lied.
[time=2955] And in the process, I put a little wall up.
[time=2957] I mean, she put half of the wall and I put the other half up.
[time=2960] And I remember living after that conversation with a sense of separation from her
[time=2967] that I could never really go to her with the truth when it meant revealing that I'd lied to her.
[time=2974] I could never really go to her and say, "You know, I said I was here last night, but I was really over here." Well, these other kids are doing this other thing.
[time=2981] I know I told you this, but the reality was this.
[time=2985] And I had to kind of live my fault here.
[time=2988] I kind of had to live now under the pretense that I had never lied.
[time=2994] And it distanced us in our relationship rather significantly.
[time=2999] You say, "Well, what would you wish you would have said?" "Well, I wish you would have done that same speech. Never lie. Never lie to me. Never lie to yourself." And then adjusted the irreparable damage part and said, "When you lie to somebody, you take a chunk out of that relationship."
[time=3012] And it takes a lot of work to put that chunk back.
[time=3016] It takes a lot of truth-telling to get the chunk back.
[time=3021] And then I wish she would have said, "And you know what? I know all this because I'm a liar." I lied to my parents. Let me tell you some of the lies that I told to my parents.
[time=3031] I wish she would have said that. Oh, I wish she would have said that.
[time=3034] I wish she would have told me some of the juicy ones of her youth.
[time=3040] And then I wish she would have said, "You're 14 years old by now. I'll guarantee you something." You don't have to admit to this. Don't say a thing. I know you've lied to me already.
[time=3048] Because you can't be 14 years old not have lied to your mother.
[time=3052] She thinks highly of me, but not that highly.
[time=3057] And then I wish she would have said, "You know what? If you're ever lying to me, I want you to know, you can come talk to me."
[time=3063] And it'll be hard, and you may have some consequences, but I'm committed to forgiving you.
[time=3067] I'm committed to forgiving you. And let's get to work on restoring the thing rather than have a sense of isolation.
[time=3075] I have those kinds of conversations with my kids.
[time=3078] I want them to know that I know they're liars.
[time=3081] I want them to know that I know that, and I want them to know that I'm a liar.
[time=3085] And I want them to know that it does hurt our relationship, but I stand in a posture of forgiveness for whatever they've done.
[time=3093] Listen, here's what God's saying to you today.
[time=3098] Then listen very carefully. God is saying to you, "Do not lower the standard of my holiness," he says.
[time=3107] Jesus says in the Sermon on the Mount, "Don't be taking the righteousness bar and lowering it down to a height that you think you can get over it."
[time=3114] Because you're playing games with yourself.
[time=3117] The righteousness bar is where it is. And listen, the righteousness bar is completely out of reach for any human being who has ever lived.
[time=3125] We are angry people, and we don't achieve the perfection that God wants there.
[time=3131] We are selfish people, and we do break relationships, and we do walk in here and go through the form of religion, and it breaks the righteousness standard of God.
[time=3139] We do lust. We do look after people of the opposite sex, and we do think things about them that we should not think, and it does break the law of God.
[time=3148] And it does leave us without admission to the Kingdom of God. That is true. All of that was Jesus said is true, but he did not say that in that sermon.
[time=3159] Nor is it being preached today with a desire to push you away from God.
[time=3165] It is not being said that so you'll walk out of here and say, "See, in reality, I know I'm not good enough. I know I'll never make it. I may as well stop trying. I can never be in relationship with God."
[time=3174] That is not the intention of Jesus when he preached that sermon.
[time=3180] What he is saying is, "Please, my friends, please take an honest look at the standard of anger, and murder, and confess to me that you do not meet the standard.
[time=3192] And say, "Oh God, then I can't make it on my own. Please forgive me by your grace. This Jesus, the Son of God who died in the cross for my sins, please forgive me because I can't make the standard."
[time=3205] When you look at the broken relationships in your life, don't cover them over. Don't puff them up. Don't put a facade on them.
[time=3212] Look at them and say, "You know what? I'm a selfish person, and I break relationships in my life, and I don't keep my commitments, and I act harshly towards people."
[time=3221] So that then you can look up and say, "God, please forgive me for my relationships. Please wash me by your grace and the person of Jesus Christ."
[time=3230] That's why he's saying this, so you and I will no longer labor under a false sense of security that God is going to judge us by a measure less than he really is.
[time=3240] And you know what he wants you to do? He wants you to say, "Oh God, I'm a liar. I'm a liar. I got a million reasons for my lies.
[time=3250] I got a million justifications for my lies. I got a million people who I think lie worse than I do, and so therefore I'm a little bit better and you ought to let me in."
[time=3258] But God, none of that's true. The standard is absolute truthfulness, and I am not truthfulness. I've never been truthful.
[time=3263] I'm going to lie sometime in the next 365 days, probably many times, and oh God, just then please forgive me by your grace and through the power of the Holy Spirit.
[time=3276] There's a good ending on this little conversation with my mom.
[time=3281] So many years later, I'm about 25, 26 years of age. I finally did give my life to Christ in that cement truck in the middle of Los Angeles and got started going in some different directions.
[time=3289] Eventually I ended up in the ministry and, you know, going through seminary and it was very exciting.
[time=3293] Well, we finally had this conversation.
[time=3298] And I said, "You know what? That was a hard conversation for me back there when I was 14, because it made me feel like I could never tell you the truth
[time=3305] about how I lie. It made me feel like I had to labor under a hypocritical stance there.
[time=3312] And I know that's not your fault. I know that wasn't your intention. I didn't have to lie. I chose to lie.
[time=3316] But I'm just telling you, part of the dynamic I think in that was kind of the way you said it and where it left me.
[time=3322] Then she says, "Oh, I get what you're saying." She says, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry for not inviting you to tell me that you were a liar."
[time=3332] And I said, "Please forgive me. I lied to you a lot." And she did. She forgave me.
[time=3339] And then we had a kick.
[time=3341] Then I started telling her about all the lies.
[time=3345] Oh, man, we laughed.
[time=3348] Because you know what? It was all forgiven by God. It was all forgiven by her.
[time=3353] And we just laughed at the shenanigans that I would pull and the fabrications that I would spend.
[time=3360] And we laughed in the reunion of our hearts finally on that issue after such a long period of time.
[time=3367] It was just a giddy thing to be able to tell the other person the truth and know that you were forgiven.
[time=3374] Now, that is exactly what God wants to do with you today.
[time=3379] God isn't trying to beat you over the head with this stuff.
[time=3382] God is saying, "Look, if you'll just come to grips with the fact that you're a liar, and I feel just come to me." God is standing right now with His arms open in a posture of grace and forgiveness
[time=3391] that He's already paid for in the person of His Son. He just wants to apply it to your life.
[time=3396] But He can't apply it to your life until you come to Him and you say, "I'm a liar, and I'm a lustful person, and I'm a broken relationship person, and I'm an angry person, and I'm whatever else I am God, and I just can't make the standard on my own.
[time=3412] I'm a failure." And then God smiles. He says, "I know that.
[time=3418] That's why I sent my son to die for you." And you say, "Well, then, would you forgive me
[time=3424] for my sins through the person of Jesus Christ?" And He wipes them all clean.
[time=3429] And He forgets them all.
[time=3434] Then He starts to make a whole new set of promises to you.
[time=3437] You come to Jesus Christ, He makes a whole bunch of promises.
[time=3440] One of the promises is that He will never remember your sin.
[time=3443] That's cool. I mean, He'll never remember it.
[time=3446] He forgets it. Boom, it's gone.
[time=3449] He says, "I promise to separate you as far as the east is from the west from your sin."
[time=3455] I mean, that's like infinity. I'll never, ever again think of you in light of all the sins of your life. I'll wash you clean.
[time=3464] He makes other promises. He says, "No matter how much you sin in the future, between now and time you die, I'll forgive every single one of those.
[time=3470] Every single, I'll forgive them all. Forgive every single one of them.
[time=3473] They'll never be a problem between you and me again." And when you come to the final day of judgment, here's this big promise, "I will not evaluate you on what you have done or failed to do.
[time=3483] Instead, I will evaluate you on what my son did, that my son died for you, that my son was perfect, and that my son's righteousness can become your righteousness, and then you will have the righteousness to come into the kingdom of him." It makes all those promises, but you have to square up with him, my friend.
[time=3505] You have to get in there and go toe to toe and say, "I don't measure up, and I'm done trying. I'm a sinner. Please forgive me by your grace." Let's stand together for a closing word of prayer.
